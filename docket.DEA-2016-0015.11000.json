I feel we all have the right to put anything we want into our body as long as we are fully informed on the dangers.  \n\nThat said, I am appalled that a plant that grows out of the ground, that helps people get over opiate addiction could be banned.  We have a problem.  Good people are becoming heroin addicts because of prescription pain killers.  We all know it but no one wants to have a dialog about it.  And now there is a plant that can help with that.  A plant that has been around forever.  A plant that was used as a supplement dating back to the 70s and should be protected by law as such.  \n\nI don't want to believe it, but it's hard for me to think there aren't people in the DEA being influenced by prescription drug companies in this matter.  We are not beholden to you.  You are there to serve us and protect us.  So please prove me wrong.  I assume you are all good people in the DEA and you are working in the interest of the public to keep them safe.  Prescription pain killers are destroying our country but are deemed to be safe for the public.  Thousands of good people die every year on these drugs.  So they are not safe.  If there were a few overdoses a year on Kratom (I have yet to hear of a single verified OD that didn't involve other drugs too) but all in all, it helped thousands of addicts get off opiates, well then it seems like a no brainer to me.  \n\nKratom is the greater good no matter how you look at it.

It is a wonderful plant with so much promise to help people with a multitude of problems from drug addiction to sleep issues to pain control.  There is so much to be studied with this natural substance. I am a nurse, and I have used kratom for 3 years.  I drink the tea to control the long standing pain of a lower back problem . I used to be on opioid medications and found myself groggy and worse.. . becoming addicted!  As a nurse I knew the signs and knew I had to stop.  I found out about kratom during an internet search of natural pain remedies.  I tried it and found exactly what I needed, good pain relief without the side effects.  And the best thing.....it wasn't addictive! I can go for weeks without drinking the tea when I'm not having pain and that sure beats the way it was with opiates, I found myself wanting/needing to take them even when I was not in pain.\nI happen the a Christian, and Genesis tells me that \"God created every plant and herb for the benefit of man\".  Please don't take away this God given plant!  I will always have chronic back problems, I desperately don't want to go back to opiates!  I can continue to work and be a productive member of society when my pain is relieved by kratom alone.  People have used it for millennia without harm!  It's so hard to feel that we live in this awesome country and yet sometimes it seems as if when we find something good and helpful, the government wants to take it away!  Millions of us depend on the aid of this plant which keeps us from unhealthy other options.  I know all of you there are educated and intelligent and want what's best for the good of the people......that's why you have your position.  So PLEASE hear us, and have compassion, please don't take away this plant that helps so many yet harms none.  \nThank you for hearing me, for hearing all of us who have taken the time to write to you,\nRespectfully yours,\nAnonymous","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20855","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"See attached file(s)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8975","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I started taking kratom about a year and a half ago and it has saved my life and helped me in many ways.

The media has recently begun portraying this safe herbal tea as some kind of \"new\" heroin or cocaine, or even a hallucinogen, which couldn't be further from the truth. And we all know about the 'hasty' ban that was narrowly avoided. Kratom should be viewed as an important tool in the solution to the opiate/opioid epidemic, not just another green plant for government agencies to vilify for profit.  Kratom has a 2000-year history of safe, responsible use as a detox from opium and alternative to dangerous drugs such as opium and heroin which is easily verified. The Botanical Education Alliance website (botanical-education.org) and Transnational Institute (TNI.org) have extensive medical and scientific papers available showing both its efficacy and almost foolproof safety profile.  Ithas greatly enhanced the chances of opiate addicts to achieve permanent recovery for the same period of time, inexpensively and unofficially. During the last 15 years it has become a staple of many successful Narcotics Anonymous participants, boosting long term sobriety rates by preventing PAWS relapses.\n\nThere is no respiratory depression associated with Kratom, an established scientific fact, making it impossible to overdose, since one simply upchucks a larger than necessary amount. There hasneverbeen a death associated with use of Kratom leaf alone --compare that with any prescription opiate/opioid, much less street drugs.\n\nI worked for a time as a legislative aid, so I understand that lawmakers and regulators have many demands on their time and sometimes only have time to scan the lobbyist statements before voting on some issues.Don't let that be the case with Kratom.\n\nYou wanted a silver bullet for the opiate crisis? --here it is use it!\n\nMany thousands, or more, mature American citizens have found kratom to be a safer alternative to opioids or western medicines' \"solutions\" and an entirely new lease on life without any of the harms or side effects associated with either street drugs or the tightrope of prescription substitutes.\n\nThe only connection that Kratom (mitragyna speciosa) has with opiates is its ability to safely block withdrawal symptoms of street drugs like heroin or dangerous Rx opiates/opioids and provide a safe alternative for pain management and/or mood support. It does not produce a \"high\" that users will chase, and is ineffective as a a recreational drug. It is actually quite subtle. Other than an absence of pain, no one would notice its effects any more than an espresso coffee. The rest is media hype and misinformation by mislead anti-drug groups and pharmaceutical companies who have noticed a drop in their revenues from the highly-addictive opiate/opioid Rx medications that are wreaking havoc on our society.\n\nThousands of older adults have been spared the horrid effects of prescription drug abuse by using this relatively harmless dietary supplement as a simple tea. If a ban on Kratom becomes law, responsible adult Americans will no longer be free to avoid the snare of chronic opiate dependence.Leave Americans a choice, don't let the DEA become the drug pushers!\n\nAllow the many adult, responsible users of this herbal tea to educate you, and you will likely come to the same conclusion as the legislators in most States, that an age restriction of 18+ or 21+ is more than enough \"protection\" for consumers of this rather harmless herbal tea.\n\nThank you for allowing common sense to rule this issue rather than media hysteria and misinformation. I realize the war on drugs is always a high political priority, but don't shoot yourselves in the foot. Americans will benefit from your good sense. Good health to you.\n\nJohn Hilger\nPenacook, NH 03303\nhighwaterz2@gmail.com","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7976","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Hilger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have a BS and MS in engineering, have a long history of academic research, and I've tried Kratom on several occasions. It's hilarious to think this silly plant should be made illegal. It barely does anything in terms of psychoactive properties. Cough syrup can get you more \"stoned\" than kratom, and it's ridiculous to think our government plans to lock people in cages for using this thing that grows naturally to help with heroin and opiate addiction, alcohol withdrawal, smoking cessation, and chronic pain. With so many potential benefits to society, zero recorded deaths resulting from its use (I looked into the claims of 10 or so deaths over the course of almost as many years and there is no evidence that unequivocally concludes kratom was the cause of death...the claims are utterly unfounded). In an era in which people are waking up to the terrible collateral damage to society that results from making widely used substances illegal (e.g. cannabis, which accounts for the vast majority of non-violent offenders locked up in America today, which is a country that locks up more of its citizens than any other country by far--1%!) it's ludicrous to insensibly make plants with illegal that a vast array of people are clearly benefiting from, and which appears to produce a far greater benefit to society at large and humanity as a whole than it produces consequences (the biggest consequence of kratom's existence would be its illegality and potential to get people thrown in cages for its possession and consumption).","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15034","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matt Spellacy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Regarding DEA Docket# DEA-442W Mitragynine proposed rule, I am strongly opposed to the scheduling of this natural herb\nwhich is related to the coffee plant.

It provides a mild analgesic effect which helps me to function normally with clinical-\nly diagnosed osteo-arthritis of the knees and hip. I do not use any over the counter analgesics because of adverse risks and \nside effects. Tylenol is a good example of too risky and dangerous. Tylenol causes irreversible liver damage and has killed\nnumerous people. It is known as the drug of choice for suicide, as all emergency room doctors well know. Acetaminaphen\ndoesn't even work very well.

I have found no adverse side effects\nwith the use of kratom leaf. In fact, if it were to be compared to oxycodone, there are some notable differences, in which\nkratom has distinct advantages. There is clinical study evidence that shows kratom does not cause constipation, which can\nbe a major problem with oxy use. There is clinical study evidence that indicates kratom does not cause respiratory depress-\nion. Respiratory depression with oxy use is a major problem. Empirically, with three years of occasional use, I can definitely\nsay that I have experienced NO adverse side effects. Kratom has helped me greatly to maintain a very active work and\nactive personal life not otherwise available to me.

Marijuana has helped me a lot and also got me through very tough times. Through out the years my obsession became more and more. I started abusing marijuana every day for many years. It had become a huge problem for me. Between 2012 through 2016 I've been fired from a job I very much liked because of testing positive, used many other hard drugs, drank alcohol in large amount and blacked out nearly every time. 2015 I was arrested for DUI with alcohol and marijuana in my system. My life was a mess. I was depressed, I had no motivation to live and I had no energy. I did all the drugs I did to forget about my life. I was stuck in a vicious cycle of drugs and contemplating sobriety. I couldn't see any light at the end of the tunnel. My family and I knew I had a problem but I did not know what to do. I was a wreck and a disfunctional drug user at the age of 20.\n             Summer of 2016 I read about kratom on a forum and I decided to try it. For the first couple weeks I didn't understand why people used it. I continued my addiction with marijuana. One day I finally said enough is enough and I did my best to be sober. 3 days later my marijuana cravings were so intense I had not slept at all those night and picked up my phone to call my dealer. I remembered about the bag of kratom I had and took a tea spoon. 30 minutes later I could not believe what I was feeling. My cravings had completely disappeared and I was filled with energy and a warmth happiness. Suddenly I had an attitude that I can do it! I had motivation to live and get it done! One month later of being sober from marijuana and hard drugs I felt normal I felt like the real me. I was not intoxicated I was not high I was simply content with life. I had the energy and motivation to live. My performance at work went up because my depression and anxiety had gone away.\n            Thanks to God and kratom my life has been restored back to normal. I can now function and be a part of society. I have been sober from marijuana and hard drugs for 5 months now, which is the longest I have ever gone and I plan on continuing my healthy life and never looking back. Recreational drugs are not part of my life anymore. Although I wish I could be functional without kratom it has made me free to live my life. Maybe someday slowly I will stop taking kratom. But for now it has been a blessing to me. When I heard about the ban on kratom I was scared for my life and filled with intense sadness and anger. How could a plant so useful and so wonderful be banned? Is it for money? Is it so people would use pharmaceutical opiates? I don't want to use hard drugs again. I don't want to destroy my life again. I don't want to combat my depression and anxiety with pills that I would get dependent on. I just want to live a normal life and kratom has made that possible. I am 1 in thousands of people who has gotten their life back on track. Whether it be recovering from fentynal, heroin, and prescription opiates or severe depression and suicidal thoughts. Kratom has saved our lives. Please dont take that away from us. We are people trying to better ourselves and step in the right direction.\n             Sincerely,\n                              Dave Esparza","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14527","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dave Esparza","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \n\n  The idea that one group of individuals can tell other group, who benefit from the use of a substance, without any harm to others, that it is against the rules to use this substance, belongs to the infancy of modernity.

The best prevention or cure for addiction is a warm, supportive community, and a life that is enjoyable enough that the person no longer yearns to escape into substances. If you incarcerate people for using or posessing any substance, you destroy whatever life they had. Once they leave prison, they have few friends left, their families have moved on or now look down upon them, and it is EXCEEDINGLY difficult for a convict to find work. All of that is VERY depressing and life-dampening. No wonder there are such high recidivism rates....

As we are seeing an incredible epidemic of addiction in this country, I see Kratom as a very useful tool in the recovery process, and the fact that there are little to no withdrawal symptoms makes it an ideal candidate for pain management. To relegate this substance to Schedule one is to deny not only pain relief for those who want an alternative to narcotics, but it will also eliminate any and all research into the plant and it's medicinal properties. The natural world has a cure for every malady known to man. And this is one of those cures. Like marijuana, there is much anecdotal evidence supporting this plant's ability to relieve pain, and this evidence is being verified by independent research. Please reconsider your stance on this plant. I believe it would be detrimental to the American public to deny us this medication.

She is under the care of a neurologist who had been administering Botox injections in her neck for about three years. After her last injection, she did not receive any relief and her pain levels increased dramatically. She spent most of her time in bed and could not complete even the most simple tasks. Her posture became terrible as she had to always lean her neck towards her shoulder as her muscles tightened. As a last resort she researched Kratom, we ordered some and have had amazing results. She is almost back to normal as far as her posture and has decreased her pain level from a 9 to a 2. This herb has been a God send for us and enables my wife to lead a pain free life in comparison to her life before Kratom. She was taking 2 Percocet tablets every four hours throughout the day and is currently taking 2 for the entire day. With Kratom there is no \"high\", only relief from pain. Please consider that this natural herb is providing comfort and relief from excruciating pain for millions of Americans with literally zero side effects. To ban or regulate to the point of removing easy access to suffering Americans would be criminal in my estimation.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15409","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Preface: I am a 22-year old college student, I also work full time. I hope to be a college professor of history within the next few years. I come from an upper middle class family in one of the many wealthy suburbs outside of Atlanta. Addiction touches everyone, kratom can help everyone.\n\nI was eight years old when my grandmother first over dosed on pain killers. My mother hadn't heard from her in a few days, which was extremely out of the ordinary, so we went by her house just to check in on her. The first thing that hit you upon walking into the house was the smell of rotting food-- plates left throughout the kitchen and living room that she had been too high to care to clean. She had been notorious for keeping a gun on bedside table, and fearing that she would hear us and think that we were intruders my mother had me keep yelling \"Grandma! Grandma!\", as we slowly walked up there stairs. After hearing no response I finally peaked my head around the corner and into her room, where she lay hanging half-way off of the bed. The doctors told us that had we arrived any later she would have died that day.\n\nLooking back on that day, I can't help but wonder what the difference would have been. After  a few short weeks in a psychiatric hospital, they let my grandmother return home. She was a smart woman, and in the manipulative way that only addicts can do, she convinced her doctors that there was no problem with her continuing to take those pills. She spent the next eleven years of her life locked up in her room with the blinds pulled down. Every time I spoke to her, her words were slurred, sometimes falling asleep in the middle of a sentence. She began to live in absolute filth. My sweet grandmother, the former beauty queen, quit bathing herself. No rehab would take her. She knew how to clean up when she needed to. \nAfter well over a decade of subscription pill abuse (that awful day when I found her half-dead, the doctors estimated she had taken 60 pills), it only took 10 to kill her. She'd had a glass of wine before bed and a benadyrl. A cocktail that surely seemed harmless to her took her life, just when I was starting to get my grandma back. We found her the exact same way that we did when I was little, only this time we were too late.\n\nThe same month that my grandmother passed away, I was diagnosed with crohns disease. For the next two years I spent weeks at a time in the hospital, became far too familiar with the emergency room staff. Every time I came in, they pumped me up with dilaudid (a form of heroine the pharmaceutical industry has found a way to monetize), sent me home with 60 oxycontin. Crohns has proven time and time again to be an awful disease. Even having gotten it under control, there are many days that I've spent crying in pain. I needed that relief, many people do. But one day, I realized that I understood what my grandmother and addicts across the country love so much about them.\n\nI found kratom around August of this year. It's a powder. It can't be smoked, it can't be injected, its too expensive in a pill, you can make it in tea (but I'm from the south so I'll only take it sweet). The easiest method is swallowing the powder and washing it down with gatorade. Simply put-- its a pain in the ass to take. You can get a similar high as from pain killers, but it takes A LOT to do that. The value in that-- is that when you're addicted to that high, you can still get it, but never to a point that you cannot function in the way that prescription pain killers do. I've had small withdrawals from pain killers before, and I would only take a few at night to relax. I can't fathom how much worse heroine, or a person who truly misused pills, would experience. With kratom, I was able bypass those withdrawals. \n\nMost importantly, kratom took away my pain. Better than any pharmaceutical drug had ever hoped to. I haven't missed a single day of class or work because of pain or pill-indueced fatigue since I began taking this plant. Now that I've weened off my pill habit, I take it when I need it. Rarely enough to get high. As doctors rightfully make prescription pain medicine more and more difficult to get, they need to be handing out kratom. There's no reason that kratom should only be a cure for addiction, I truly believe that it will prevent it from ever happening. \n\nKratom has undoubtedly bettered my quality of living. I truly believe that it would have done the same for my grandmother as well. Kratom does not need to be illegal. Doctors, and the public, need to be better educated about it uses. I will have crohns disease for the rest of my life. Its incurable. I don't want my life to go back to the way that it was before. I don't want any other little girl to find their grandmother the way that I found mine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10748","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amy Scott","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have had a problem with alcohol for a long time and kratom has been the only thing that his kept me sober.

I am a 38 year old, hard-working father of three, 1 teenager, an 8 year old and a 4 year old.  Perhaps you can imagine and appreciate the relief and security I felt when I found a safe, natural alternative to opiate painkillers.  I read on the news that there are now more Americans using opiates than tobacco.  The pharmaceutical companies are obviously doing very well.  I understand age restrictions but to label this as more dangerous than alcohol or tobacco is completely ridiculous.  Kratom does not kill people, in fact it saves lives.  It provides a safe alternative to much much more dangerous opiates, and it is crazy to make such a substance illegal.  The right, moral and ethical thing to do is leave it alone!  Please do not cave in to greed and money.  Kratom is safer, much less likely to be abused, it works, and it helps hard working, responsible people like me stay away from the dangers of opiate addiction, or even infinitely more important, it keeps it out of my household and therefore out of the hands of my children.  Please do the right thing.  Why on earth would you make something that saves lives illegal and turn people into criminals?  Who are you protecting?  People and peoples lives and the quality of peoples lives outweigh the interest of making a small handful of people even richer.  Please allow me to live my life pain-free while not being addicted to dangerous drugs.  My life is better because of kratom, and my children are safer because of it too.  PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING!

At some point in my career I broke my back and damaged 7 disks which caused me terrible pain, I was sent to pain management and for years was treated with opioid pain medications. Before I found Kratom I was prescribed 16mg of DIlaudid (Hydomorphone) a day and secretly taking much more. I was hopelessly addicted to the drugs my doctors were giving me for the pain. I was dying. I remembered hearing about Kratom and on a day when I was in the deep throws of withdrawals because I took all my Dilaudid before I could get another prescription I sent my wife to the local smokeshop to see if they had it, and they did. I took 5 grams of Kratom orally and my withdrawals stopped. I never looked back, I continued to use the Kratom and stopped all opioids completely without going to rehab or even tapering off of them. I am able to start and stop the Kratom without withdrawals  when I'm not in pain. This plant saved my life. If it was not available legally and I had to go back to using opioids I am sure I would end up dead. \nMine is not a unique story and I have recommended it to a friend who was addicted to opioids after surviving cancer with success and to my 72 year old mother who also has debilitating back pain.

I don't know who's decision it was to classify this product is something bad but I don't think they know anything about it nor have they done any research and is typical of the government is trying to intervene with no statistics no knowledge or no thinking of this through.

Here are some testimonials from www.businesswire.com:\n\nRyan Estevez, MD, PhD, MPH, a psychiatrist and psychopharmacologist in the Tampa area who has worked for years in emergency rooms, community health centers, and prisons, says: I am well versed in both good drugs that help people on a daily basis, and bad drugs that are epidemically abused and create a tremendous burden on society. Kratom is [a natural herbal supplement] and not one of these 'bad' drugs (I have yet to admit anyone for kratom-addiction) and efforts to ban it are misguided and wasteful. Grieving parents, well intentioned policy makers, and opportunist politicians often seize on opportunities to assign blame and then offer a quick fix. The proposal of an absolute ban of Kratom perfectly illustrates what can happen when hype trumps science, as this plant has been benefiting millions of people for decades of time. I have been troubled by an increase in news reports and misinformation that has been disseminated about the dangerous and addictive drug Kratom. Even worse is the subsequent careless and knee-jerk response by many legislators and policy makers to ban Kratom. I believe much of the negative publicity surrounding Kratom to be the result of being incorrectly lumped in with synthetically derived mind-altering substances such as spice and bath-salts, substances that deserve their reputations for being dangerous and harmful.\"\n\nPhil Schoenwetter, MD, Family Practitioner in Southern California since 1980, commented: \"My first encounter with Kratom was stunning and unexpected. Janet, my wife of 35 years, suffers from migraines and last year had a breakthrough episode that normally would require strong pharmaceutical treatment. While fueling our SUV at a Chevron station in Nevada, Janet went to the food mart and noted a lady requesting her daily eight capsule packet of Kratom. The kind lady said it helped with her midlife aches and pains and no other adverse side effects. Janet purchased the same packet and took one capsule. Although a licensed physician in several states since 1978, I had not even encountered the word Kratom. Some 60 miles down the road Janet announced she was OK, pain free, clear of thought, (not 'loaded' as with morphine) and ready to take the wheel, which she did flawlessly for some 165 miles. This was the clarion call to wake up, smell the coffee (another botanical) and delve more deeply into natural agents and understand mechanisms of action and implement in my family medicine practice. Adverse events are infrequent and when occurring are minimal, transient, and most often is light heartburn lasting a few hours. Kratom already is a must have adjunct to numerous long term conditions and its role in my practice already exceeds the usual and customary uses that one normally will find referenced in literature found on the internet.\"\n\nHere is a link to a study that proves kratoms major alkaloids had benifits for pain, there are many others, please look into them and reconsider this ban.\n\nOrally Active Opioid ?/?

I took prescribed narcotics from 2007 to 2015 in escalating doses.  I made the decision last year to discontinue using opioids.  I take 5 - 7 grams of Kratom 3x a week, to manage pain  and successfully manage pain symptoms.    I can confirm that the substance has a discontinuation syndrome, with symptoms lasting a week, that occurs with daily useage.  I'm willing to live those symptoms in the increasingly rare occasions of flare ups lasting for multiple weeks. and need to be able to function despite pain scores above 6.     The substance is effective, though escalating doses work in reverse.  You don't get increasingly soporific effects by using more.  Whatever euphoric effects one gets when first using the substance, and they are very mild compared to opioids, wear off rapidly with continued use.   I don't have \"cravings'\" when not using KRATOM.\n\nI'm a 52 year old working professional with no interest using any drug for recreational benefit.  I have found exercise and Kratom to be the ONLY two things that allow me to live a somewhat normal life.  I'm opposed to the DEA banning it outright but would welcome government enforcing standards so that what I take isn't adulterated with other substances.\n\nPlease do not leave people like me no choice.   Pain is pain, and when unmanaged, it motivates one to do whatever it takes to alleviate it.   The unintended consequences of banning the substance outright is more illegal drug seeking, ruined lives and deaths.    Don't make the problem worse for yourselves, because you'll end up having to clean up a bigger mess.   If you won't let people like me make responsible choices , at the very least, allow medical research to continue on the active substances found in KRATOM.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19004","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael O'Connor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern... I am a 35 year old mother, author, and investment lender that has suffered  from various spinal and nervous conditions throughout my life. Because of this, I spent 12 years in pain management treatment just in attempt to have a quality life and to have the ability to perform my duties as a patent and in my business, as well as my personal life. I was taking opioid medications during these 12 years, and although it took the edge off of my pain, I felt as if I was living with a ball and chain, imprisoned by these drugs. I have never been a person who indulges in the recreational use of substances, and always only took my medication as prescribed. But as years went on and my tolerance grew, the amount and dosage became frighteningly high, just for a bit of relief. Due to having to live my life around a medicaton, and feel more like a criminal than a patient as opioid regulations stiffened, I struggled with depression and lived in fear of what I'd do when there were no higher doses, what would happen if laws became more strict and I couldn't get enough medication to be able to walk and live, and constantly worrying about the dangers and side effects associated with the meds. Then I learned about Kratom,  and was able to almost painlessly get off of all opioid medications  (very high doses as I said), and achieve all naturally, much safer relief without all those awful side effects and risks. I believe this plant has saved my life and has renewed my energy and we'll being. And that's speaking only for myself and in summary. It would take hours to really convey the wonderful things that it's done for me, my life, those close to me, and countless others I know that have been helped emmensly by this plant. I'm utterly terrified at the prospect of having to ever return to chemical pharmaceuticals to have even a fraction of the quality I have today. I don't feel that it's a viable long term solution. From the extensive research I've done,  there is such a miniscule amount of kratom related injuries, especially compared to even seemingly innocuous household items such as laundry detergent, and no DIRECT kratom related deaths. Kratom may have been in one's system, but was not the sole cause of death. Compare this to the staggering and ever growing number of opioid related deaths. We do not want to return to those risks or way of life, and some of us don't have the choice of just foregoing any therapy unless we wish to resign to a life on the couch or in a wheel chair. We deserve better, and we deserve healthier, natural options. Besides any health concerns, it seems another concern about Kratom is that of people abusing it or using it to \"get high.\" But what history and even common sense shows, is that for those out solely to seek a high, banning a particular substance isn't going to stop that. They'll find another way, another substance. And the ones who truly suffer are those benefiting from said substance. Also, from a social standpoint, since no one can stop drug abuse as a whole, is it not a lesser evil for people to be using a substance with lower risks than alcohol,rather than much more deadly subalances? Kratom offers little to no negative side effects, and \"overdose\" results in a stomach ache or vomiting (again, no worse than our legal alcohol, and isn't even fatal as alcohol can be), haso no criminality surrounding it, and does not have nearly the abuse potential of opioid medications or street drugs. I implore you to please reconsider any ban to be placed on this plant,  which to me and many others from ALL walks of life has been nothing short of a lifesaver. I, for one, don't want to lose my ability to be a great mother, a businessperson, a wife, daughter, adventurer, or any of the other things I now enjoy being to the fullest, simply because my only options go back to being immobile and useless or playing Russian Roulette with medications. Please consider the benefits, please see this as a blessing and viiable option to more dangerous \"drugs,\" please don't take away the quality of life that this naturally growing gift of God has given me and so many others.

Kratom has never made me feel intoxicated and I have not felt that my thinking or judgement was impaired while using kratom. In fact it is more the opposite. I usually feel more energized, comfortable and in a better mood than before use. I use kratom  occasionally to help with pain and fatigue due to health issues as well as for a general tonic when I am feeling low energy and still have a lot to do. I do not feel kratom has danger of abuse for responsible individuals. Over my 6 months with kratom I have not increased my dose or frequency. I feel that kratom is much safer than alcohol or even cigarettes regarding health and possible addiction. I ask that you take the time to really understand this plant before making your decision. I feel it would be a shame to loose the use of healthy and beneficial herbal supplement. I do believe that it may be wise to not allow extracts of kratom to be sold in other words when they make an extract that is 25, 50% or more potent than the natural leaf.

I refused to go to a doctor and have myself put on addictive, dangerous drugs such as prozac and xanax. \n\nA great deal of research and taking responsibility for my own treatment led me to Kratom and has made it possible again for me to function to the fullest. I believe there is a lot of misinformation being spread, including that it is a dangerous, addictive 'drug.' Let's be clear -the dangerous, addictive drugs are the ones that are already perfectly legal: antidepressants, benzodiazepines, opioids, alcohol. I plead with you to allow persons such as myself and others - people who suffer from mental and physical pain - to continue to have access a safe, natural alternative. The 'war on drugs' is already a travesty and complete failure. Increasingly states have defied the DEA and federal government and begun allowing marijuana for medicinal purposes. This is a step in the right direction - allowing people options and access to alternatives. Banning Kratom will turn hundreds of people seeking alternatives into criminals. And placing Kratom as a Schedule 1 makes zero sense. I think you send a dangerous message to people by putting harmless substances in a category with substances that have legitimate dangers. Marijuana has killed literally 0 people. Kratom has killed literally 0. Why group these in with heroin, a substance which is being abused at epidemic levels? \n\nLet's use common sense when regulating things. And let's allow people the choice to chose a treatment that works best for them. Thank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10778","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Hansen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 33 years old and started using kratom off and on about 5 years ago.

My name is Dr. Matthew Benskey and I am a Research Scientist living in Grand Rapids Michigan. I originally began using kratom as an alternative to opiod prescription pain medication due to chronic pain resulting from a broken leg. I did not want to begin using opiod based pain medication due to the high likelihood of addiction, and thus I sought out a non-addictive alternative. Upon discovering kratom I experienced a safe method to handle my chronic pain that has not resulted in any addiction whatsoever. What little scientific research that has been done on Kratom supports these anecdotal experiences, as kratom show a very low risk of dependence formation, and a complete inability to overdose on the substance. I know several people whom have benefited greatly from kratom like myself. In light of the opiod epidemic that si sweeping the nation I urge the DEA to listen to the public and cease the pursuit of legislation to make this safe herbal medication illegal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17370","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Benskey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I suffer from (RLS) Restless Leg Syndrome.

Now, I dont mean metaphorically, It has literally saved my life. This time two years ago I had a shot gun pointed under my chin. (My friend technically saved me), but Kratom was the catalyst that has kept me alive todays time. I remember that day pretty clear. I couldnt wait for him to hurry up and leave my house so I could be alone and 'do it' already. Soon as his car left, I grabbed the shot gun, loaded 2 shells into it and put it under my chin. I had it there only about 5 seconds because I was making sure I didnt forget anything from my mental pre-suicide check off-list i had. I was only a few seconds from pulling that trigger and then I heard the door break open and my friend flew over the couch (he came back cause he forgot his phone) and grabbed it from me. Now, I told you that, so I could tell you this.\n\nI'm an 8 year vet and I have seen and been thru a lot of shit. After many years of abusing drugs and alcohol it started to catch up to me where I needed to be intoxicated to just to menial things like go shopping. I'm bi-poler and manic depressive. I'd go to the V.A every month to see my Pyc Doc and have been on a list of heavy meds. Seroqual, Wellbutrin, Depakote and Gabapentin. The side affects of those meds will scare the devil, but if I didnt take em I'd be worse according to the V.A doctors. \n\nNow I didnt do drugs because I was a loser piece of shit, I did them because they helped with my crippling anxiety and depression. After 4 bouts of pancreatitis I decided to stop drinking and using opiates as my then 32 yo body couldnt handle it any longer. The meds helped some but it was a uphill battle against the alcoholism. I was homeless at one point, suicidal and not the man the 10 yo me knew I wanted to be. That was until I found Kratom. Almost instantly my life started to change for the better. Taking Kratom immediately stopped the alcohol and drug cravings. within a week my depression and anxiety were completely gone and within a month I was sober 100% and a new job and my family back. Now here I am 2 years later, alive healthy and 100% alcohol and drug free with a house and happy family, because of this miracle plant.  I am begging the DEA to not let this amazing plant be demonized because of big Pharma lobbyists influencing the DEA to ban this harmless and helpful plant because maybe one day, you or someone you know will need its help and this plant should be available for every single adult AT ALL TIMES. I had lab work done recently and I'm healthy as a race horse with daily use of Kratom. I wake up and have a cup of Kratom tea. Have a cup at 3pmish and sometimes in the evening and I havent harmed anyone or myself nor committed any crimes associated with legal drugs such as opiates. This plant has been used for over 2000 years and needs to be accessible for all. Please dont take this miracle plant away from me and turn me back into the monster I use to be. Pharmaceutical meds have ruined me and without Kratom I dont know If I'll live to see my son grow into a man. Please dont take this life saving plant away from us who rely on it to stay healthy and alive. When I say its life saving, I fucking mean it. Thank you for reading.

It is in the same plant family as the coffee tree, known as Rubiaceae. It is used for chronic pain relief, treating addiction to opiates, alcohol and some pharmaceuticals, chronic inflammation, anxiety, PTSD, depression, insomnia, high blood pressure, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis and the list goes on. It has also been used as a stimulant by workers in Thailand for hundreds of years.\n\nThe DEA is claiming kratom has a high likelihood of abuse, zero medical value and poses a serious threat to public safety. It has therefore decided to enact an emergency temporary ban to stop the masses from dropping like flies until further research can be done. The DEAs strongest argument is from a small number of deaths associated with kratom and 660 calls to poison control involving kratom. But it has been found that most if not all deaths involving kratom were cases where it was combined with other dangerous substances, not just kratom on its own. And the 660 poison control calls were over the past 5 years. To put that in perspective, there have been 6,843 calls for children exposed to laundry detergent pods just in the last 7 months.\n\nThe problem with the DEAs proposed temporary ban is Schedule 1 status would make it nearly impossible to conduct research that would lead to kratom ever being unscheduled. Meanwhile thousands would be suffering not only from the conditions mentioned above, but also the endless side effects of the pharmaceuticals they are forced to take because the only healthy, safe and effective alternative has been made illegal. With the ban, tens of thousands of ill people will become felons overnight including injured veterans, seniors and accident victims.\n\nI have personally used kratom almost daily for the last 2 years as an alternative to coffee by mixing the leaf powder with water and drinking it or brewing a tea and I can confirm it has been an entirely positive experience with zero undesirable effects whatsoever.\n\nEveryone knows someone who has had problems with chronic pain and/or opiate addiction problems. The fact is kratom is the single biggest saviour for these people and the most effective tool against the countries current opiate epidemic. While I fortunately do not live with any of the debilitating conditions mentioned thus far, I would like to rest assured knowing that if I (or anyone else) did in the future, we would have access to this life saving gift of nature. Rather than being forced to use the unnatural, addictive, dangerous and expensive prescription drugs that wreak havoc on the body and turn people into unproductive zombies who are unable to work or even drive.\n\nNobody is writing or calling in to senators or congress or marching in front of the whitehouse to tell them how alcohol or tobacco has changed their lives for the better, yet they are perfectly legal despite tobacco being responsible for over 480,000 deaths annually and alcohol being responsible for over 88,000.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15647","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Austin Whitley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"More research needed","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9686","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Emil Konferowicz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern\n\nHi my name is Dustin Riddle. I have been using Kratom for about 6 months now and I am amazed at how it has changed my life drastically for the better. I take Maeng da and yellow vein twice daily. For ten years I struggled with alcoholism, p.t.s.d, depression, intense pain and opioid dependency. I was diagnosed with adhd and placed on adderall for four of those years. I have lost so much that was dear to me in these periods. I have been hospitalized 17 times in those years due to problems with the issues mentioned above. I have crippling memories of the dark places I've visited through these challenging times. I do take responsibility for this. I've tried everything I could think to do this naturally. I've packed myself into gyms. I've looked for healthy hobbies like yoga, playing music or riding dirtbikes. No matter what I did or how hard I tried. I continued to hit the same brick walls with my addictions. When I would seek out help I would tell doctors, councillors, and therapists about my issues. The end result was always the same. Go to group therapy which took valuable time away from me that I needed to work and make money to survive. Then take a prescribed medication. Medication that would steal my spirit in one form or the other.  I have spent periods of that time struggling to keep a job or shelter. Parts of my body have been changed indefinitely from taking prescribed medications. The side effects have from these medications have scared me from wanting to use them. Turning to Kratom has aleviated all of my issues with little to no side effects. I feel normal for the first time in my life. It has been such a blessing. My pain has been alleviated and my confidence restored. My dreams are becoming a reality and I've built communion with my peers. I now have a beautiful home with amazing friends. I am helping to build a successful local business here in Western North Carolina. I am taking an internship as a motorcycle mechanic at the most spectacular garage in town. I have big dreams of writing a self help novel in my lifetime. Like I said, Kratom has helped to restore my confidence. I am free of hazardous addictions. I am finally a productive member of society. I spread cheer and love. I am a ripple that brings many things positive. I am Kratom!\n\nSincerely;\n\nDustin Clyde Riddle","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5131","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dustin Riddle","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W\nMy son has used Kratom since October 2015 several times a week for chronic tendonosis pain relief and a mild mood brightening effect.

For the last 10 years have struggled with painful arthritis, primarily in my neck and lower back. This has recently been aggravated by sciatica flares.  I faithfully perform exercises recommended by  Physical Therapy and still have been prescribed an opioid, which I take regularly.\n\nSince I started taking kratom I have been able to significantly reduce my dependence on the narcotic as it adequately reduces my pain.  I have never experienced any negative side effects from this powder.  It is much less disturbing than marijuana, which makes me lethargic and paranoid.  \n\nRather than ban this herb, if the federal government wants to get involved, more research regarding dosage and effects would make it safer for the consumer.  Perhaps as an OTC herb that would require a prescription for anyone under 21.  It seems as though negative effects are fairly rare and it benefits many people - especially as an alternative to opioids. Please don't throw the baby out with the bathwater - prescription narcotics are a huge problem for this country and Kratom seems like it could be part of the solution.\n\nSincerely, Cindy Durant","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3354","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cindy Durant","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would describe my body as athletic type around 155 pounds. I'm a male, age 32. No history of major illness, no medication I take regularly. I did take finasteride from May 2008 to Jan 2014 for regular hairloss but quit taking it. Many side effects I had originally thought were from taking kratom I discovered to be entirely from finasteride.\n\nI started taking kratom in October 2008. I take it for back pain originating from either a gym injury or work injury around 2007, I'm not really sure which. It wasn't a readily apparent back injury whenever it happened. My back pain is bad enough that I have trouble sitting upright in chairs without feeling pain or standing straight for too long. I had no health insurance at the time (Oct 2008) so I never went to a doctor about it. I have tried oxycodone and hydrocodone which I had prescribed to me  for wisdom teeth surgery and different dental procedures. I never used them for dental pain and have refused all pain medication since starting kratom. I discovered at one point as an experiment that kratom and hydrocodone cross tolerate so you get nothing from taking hydrocodone and kratom together. Neither hydrocodone or oxycodone seemed to do much of anything for my back even when taken at higher doses than recommended.  But when I started taking kratom it completely rid me of my back pain outright. It also didn't make me itchy like oxycodone and hydrocone did. Kratom didn't make me tired either like those drugs did. Kratom is more of a stimulant like caffeine is. When I first started taking kratom it wasn't daily it was one large dose every other day. Then after a few months I started taking half of that dose daily. I have quit kratom for about 6 months total since Oct 2008 almost always when financially strapped. I would say it's addictive but only as addictive as caffeine, maybe a little less addictive than caffeine. I've NEVER tried to quit caffeine and never will in my life but have quit kratom. Sometimes I tried quitting outright and sometimes weaning down. I've found weaning down to be more effective for quitting and staying off it for longer periods. Quitting outright seems to make me more prone to going back to it a week later. The withdrawals usually peak the first day or two after quitting then you just feel the normal pain you're in after a day or two. In my experience you can't really build up any tolerance to kratom lasting more than a day. I take the same dose everyday for many years now around about 6 to 12 grams a day spaced out as a little under 1 gram per hour. When I first started taking it I had a problem with the taste of it but now I'm just used it.\n\nThe way I take kratom is by pouring about 1 gram into a small cup of water, let it sink in, then toss it back in my throat. Then I drink a small sip of water after. I've never and I repeat NEVER gotten any of the symptoms for kratom I've seen listed on a lot of scare stories about kratom like hallucinations, delusions, trouble breathing, or anything of that sort. When I ever do take too much kratom it seems to make my hands shake some but only after about 20 grams in one day. Around 30 grams in one day it feels like you're wired kind of like after drinking a bunch of energy drinks. I've only ever done that much in one sitting just to see what would happen. I've never vomited from taking kratom but know some people that have. I've never really experienced any constipation on kratom but have heard others that have. I have experienced more frequent urination when using more kratom than usual in a day but I'm also drinking more water with the kratom to wash it after on those days.\n\nThe current work I do is box lifting and moving at a transportation company. Very heavy manual labor job. I've done it for a little under 7 years now (same work at two different companies). I usually take 1 gram of kratom before going to work then one gram of kratom when returning 6 to 8 hours later. Without kratom I would not be able to do that job. At home I do paintings in my freetime and again I would not be able to sit upright in a chair long enough to paint anything without taking kratom.\n\nI've climbed and hiked literal mountains on kratom. I'm very outdoorsy and enjoy mountain hiking. I restrict how much kratom I take at higher altitude because with or without kratom I get terrible altitude sickness to the point of vomitting after eating nothing. Even when going from sea level to Denver I'll get altitude sickness. I usually take one gram of kratom before starting up a mountain then one gram while coming back down. I've really turned my life around since I started taking kratom and I do thank kratom for that turnaround.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6238","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nathaniel Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep kratom legel it help me reduce muscle pain \nThx \nIt has nothing harmful","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4525","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bobby Pat","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi Im Crystal & I found kratom around 5 months ago. I was struggling w a 2 year pill addiction & have been opioid free since 7-1-16! I came across a pain relieving shot (kinda like an energy shot) tried it & noticed my day didn't suck so bad. Look into the ingredients & found kratom. I was taking anywhere between 10-30 mg. Of Hydro codon , drinking about 2-6 alcoholic beverages, & 1-3 5 hour energy shots a day. I was 220 pounds with no motivation. Now that I have been blessed With kratom in the short 5 months I've lost 43 pounds. Don't drink or take anything but kratom for pain & energy.  Not even ibuprofen. One teaspoon each dose & 2-3 doses a day thats it! So please save kratom cause kratom saves lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3393","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Crystal Mckenith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not make Kratom a Controlled Substance.

With its help, I have had more success in battling chronic injury related knee pain than with any other substance - either prescription or over the counter.  I take a low to moderate dosage (4-5 grams) as needed.  Unlike other pain relief alternatives, kratom has caused zero negative side effects for me.  I have never experienced any withdrawal symptoms or mental/physical addiction symptoms.  I have never been injured or harmed as a result of using this substance and never will be - as it is physically impossible.  I have never heard of anyone actually being injured or harmed as a result of using kratom alone either.  Additionally, there have never been any overdoses/deaths from kratom use alone.  Kratom has been used for many hundreds of years and is undoubtedly safer than any DEA scheduled drug of any class - including cannabis.  Kratom should not be scheduled as a controlled substance.  It should remain available to any consenting adult capable of making his/her own decision regarding pain relief treatment.  Lastly, with record high cases of opioid addiction in the United States, it would be irresponsible to ignore the positive results kratom can have on overcoming addiction. \n\nConsider wisely.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18796","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Colton Hiler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I cannot share my name, as there is an unfortunate stigma regarding kratom.

There is depression and anxiety in my background. I had gotten to a point where I was using too many pills. I worried about my liver and actually at one point became addicted to the pain killers I used for arthritis. Then I found out about kratom on a website which helps people get off of opiates. Since beginning to use this natural herbal remedy I have eliminated my pain killer, my anti-depressant and even my statin medications. That was about six years ago. I feel so much healthier and I rarely get any viruses (which I attribute to the antioxidants in kratom) or colds now too. My liver is working properly and I rarely have to seek medical treatment. I am very active for a woman of my age and at one point was working four part-time jobs. I attribute most of this to my kratom discovery and healthier lifestyle.\nI also have two young people in my family who benefit from kratom. My son has severe back pain and has eliminated toxic pain pills by using kratom and I have a nephew who struggled with depression and addiction who found relief from these issues by using it. Both of these young men are married, successful fathers of young children now leading happy lives. There is even evidence that kratom curbs an alcoholic's desire to drink.\nWith so much concern these days about opiate addiction across the country, I think that criminalizing the one natural remedy to combat it would be a big mistake. In fact, I feel it should be encouraged as a way to get off of pain pills and heroin. For some reason, those of us in the kratom community haven't been able to convince others of kratom's effectiveness and safety. And now this threat to ban it! Please don't put kratom in the Schedule 1 category. It has nothing in common with the other drugs it's being classified with!

A substance should not be banned without a substantial amount of high quality scientific evidence of the need for a ban. Even then, there must be substantial policy bases for a ban, demonstrating that the substance in question is completely devoid of any legitimate use.

Im all around a happier person, and have motivation and feel like my daily struggles arenthe thing the past with kratom. I would be devasted if a herbal drug that helps so many people that dont abuse it and use it for a cure and feel much better taking it on low doses have to get punished... If it becomes illegal it scares me to death to have to fight with my demons of taking perscribed drugs that keep me numb and unhappy verses a teaspoon a day of kratom that gives me a boost and makes me feel like a normal person again.

I am a twenty-four year old woman who recently graduated with a Masters (with honors) from Boston University, and I now work at Hulu full-time. I implore you to reconsider any ban on kratom, as it is a safe substance with many positive side effects that I have used for years to alleviate chronic pain and anxiety.\n\nI suffer from polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which gives me frequent and severe pain in my abdomen, back and joints. It has been suggested that I should be on painkillers but they are \"too unsafe\" for someone of my age to begin using. Instead, a friend suggested I use kratom to alleviate my pain; it has allowed me to live day-to-day without pain, and has given me the opportunity to be a productive member of society without taking heavy prescription drugs or medicine.\n\nI have experienced zero negative side effects from kratom and do not use it recreationally (although it certainly does also have mood-lifting benefits, and I have felt far less anxiety since I began using kratom). If kratom is banned, thousands of people will be without a safe remedy to their problems; if kratom is given its rightful place in our society and economy, I believe it can give even more people the opportunity to live healthier and more fulfilling lives. Kratom is a gift that poses no immediate or imminent threat to our society. I hope you will consider allowing kratom to remain legal and accessible.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8108","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amanda Domuracki","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 33 year old glass blower from New York.\n   When I was in my early twenties I became addicted to prescription pain killers that I was prescribed for back injury.

I suffer from both depression and anxiety, and kratom has been an enormous help for me. It provides an uplifting, calming effect which has substantially increased my quality of life. Because of kratom, I'm able to be more productive in my life, not having the same degree of worries as I usually did. I've been using kratom for several years and have not noticed any negative side effects. It's a benign herb with many medicinal qualities.\n\nMy story is just one example of the medicinal value of kratom. Additionally, it can be a very effective (and non-addictive) painkiller, sleep-aid, as well as being an aid for some in discontinuing use of other, addictive drugs, given that kratom can reduce withdrawal symptoms from certain drugs. It can even be effective for veterans in treating their symptoms of PTSD.\n\nPlease keep all of these medicinal benefits in mind when making your decision. I strongly oppose putting kratom on the list of controlled substances. I believe that it would be very harmful to limit access to kratom, as there's a huge amount of people that use it to raise their quality of life and productivity, myself being one of them. Taking it away would have disastrous consequences.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18184","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Pick another operation DEA.

I am writing anonymously, but I really want to stress the fact that this situation is very, very important to me. I don't even really know where I would be right now if I didn't have kratom available when I needed it.\n\nI suffered injuries from a weightlifting accident a few years ago and experienced a rather large hematoma in both of my legs. I was having a lot of trouble sleeping and was in constant agonizing pain to the point where I couldn't think of anything else. I ended up seeing a doctor who prescribed pain killers and instead of helping with my injury I just found myself quickly becoming addicted to the medication. I eventually suffered a seizure from my usage and was put in the hospital. When I got out I thought it would be business as usual, but I quickly found myself addicted to my medication and it was getting harder and harder to stop.\n\nEventually the pills started running my life and it was all I was thinking about. I got sick of it one day so I decided to do some research and I stumbled across several stories about people using kratom to wean off of opiates and breaking their addiction. I ordered some online and followed some dosage/preparation guidelines and never looked back. It has helped me immensely in regards to fighting my addiction and keeping my head on my shoulders. \n\nI eventually decided to cut down on the kratom as well and now I only use it to curb any cravings if they end up rearing their ugly head. The best part about it is I don't have this constant urge to take any substances now like I did when I was on opiates. When I was taking pills my entire day was just thinking about the next time I could take pills again. Kratom freed me those shackles and really improved my life.\n\nThanks a lot for reading my story and PLEASE keep things like this in mind when making your decision. I urge (heck, I even beg!) the DEA to keep kratom legal. I don't think prohibition is the right idea here at all and if anything has to happen it should only be regulation.  Kratom isn't some crazy new synthetic drug that is ruining everyone's lives, it's a plant that is helping a lot of people deal with their addictions, anxiety, depression and many other things. Since starting up this fight to keep kratom legal, I have spoken with doctors, nurses, addiction specialist and many other highly respectable people who are fully in support of keeping kratom available. It's truly been amazing to see all of the good people who are coming together and standing by this plant. There was never this much support for other substances like spice and whatever else in the past because mostly everyone could understand why it was being banned. That isn't the case with kratom.\n\nSo again, I urge you to keep stories like this one in mind. Please. I am a responsible adult and I only want what is best for me and I really don't want to go back to my old life before I had kratom available. Kratom has played a huge role in who I am today and I would be eternally grateful if the right to use it wasn't stripped from me. Please help us out here.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2500","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't believe Kratum should not be made illegal, and should continue to be sold as is.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10332","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Manning","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After becoming addicted (not hardcore) to hydrocodone resulting from severe shoulder pain, I began looking for something to replace the cravings of more pain pills and still provide the needed pain relief. Someone referred me to Kratom and I finally broke free from the addictive properties in opiates. Kratom provided a mild pain relief and allowed me to be opiate free for the last 5 years. I can take Kratom when I need it and suspend my use when I don't need it without the opiate cravings I use to have, need it or not. Now I understand that the DEA want to step in and classify Kratom no different than heroine. This is absurd!! I have acquaintances that have tried Kratom and did not like it because it didn't provide the high they experienced on opiates. Well, guess what, it isn't suppose to. It is not the magical high that opiates provide.....its just a mild pain reliever with just enough effect to get by without opiates to the thousands who are not hard core addicts but just looking for something stronger than Ibuprofen or Aleve.  So, we found it in the leaf of a tree. I have yet to read of a Kratom epidemic or Kratom overdose victim. That's because it is NOT an opiate or anything like it. Have a couple DEA agent take the recommended dose of Kratom and then tell us that is should be considered the same level of heroin. Chances are they will tell you it did NOTHING to them because they don't need any pain relief. If your looking for a mind bending high, do not bother with Kratom because it AINT that!!!  Just leave well enough alone and monitor its use and see if there is anything criminal in its use. I am beginning to believe that the DEA wants to cease and desist any food, drink or other bodily imbibed material that anyone in society says makes the feel good. Show me the crime or health statistics related to Kratom and then maybe we can have an objective discussion. If you want to ban something that is crippling society let's look at tobacco or alcohol but NOOOOO.....that's backed by big business so the death toll is completely permissible.

I have read numerous accounts of individuals being able to stop the hard core drugs and eventually not even take anything as they used Kratom during withdrawal.

I wrote in once before expressing why kratom needs to stay legal, emphasizing the fact that the vast majority of kratom users are not teenagers seeking a fast buzz, but adults who need kratom just to function and feel normal.  I need to reiterate the fact that kratom can help people to feel \"normal\" and productive from the standpoint of where we are right now as a society.  There is already so much hopelessness out there, a condition that kratom can somehow take the edge off in some way.  For some reason, even with life's inevitable bad turns, kratom seems to have anti-anxiety properties that can somehow make one feel that they have the strength to push through and still do what s/he needs to do to progress.  To deny people this plant in this way alone could be disastrous to our way of living right now. \n\nAs divided as our country is now, we do not need something taken away that can safely make it easier for us to function and get along and work with each other to try to heal as a society.  Kratom is just part of the solution, but a part of the solution none-the-less.  \n\nI must state further that kratom is not a drug, but an herbal supplement that will not cure any condition, but absolutely helps and improves chronic issues to the point where life becomes manageable.  We will have new administration now, and the president-elect wants people back to work, but people need to be able to work, and kratom can definitely help with that prospect.  Not to mention, the kratom industry itself is sizeable, and our economy needs it.  Again, the amount of work and productivity that could be lost if kratom is unavailable is incalculable.  I know there have also been many references to kratom helping to ween people off dangerous opioids and other actual drugs, again, which kratom is not. \n\nProposing a worse case scenario, if kratom is addictive, and research is absolutely needed so that everyone can learn about it and make determinations regarding aspects such as addiction, I would think it would be better to be \"addicted\" to a substance like kratom which (on its own) will not kill you rather than to be addicted to a true opioid which can and will kill you.  This is another reason kratom should never ever be Schedule I.  Some quality control and regulation regarding age would be OK.   \n\nKratom users are everyday people trying to function in integral parts of society, as teachers, ministers, constructions workers, and so on - people that are not expendable.  Kratom is vital to keeping our culture moving at this point and without any doubt needs to remain available.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18734","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not place Kratom as a Schedule 1 Drug.

This is not how you take care of any issues you may have with kratom. Regulation like with other supplements may be okay, or just leaving it alone in general.\n\nI'm a 30-year-old male that has been using this plant on and off for 2 years. I have PTSD from an abusive childhood and other things that happened to me. I've had panic attacks, nightmares, and a number of other issues that make it hard for me to work. The medications I have been on ranged from anti-psychotics to anti-depressants and they made it hard for me to do anything at all due to how cloudy they made my mind feel.\n\nDuring the time I was getting medicated, I started to experiment more and more with alcohol and drugs. This led me to a much worse place, and eventually someone told me about kratom. First, I had to quit the drugs I was on, and then I had a battle with alcohol for a while. This ended in a hospital visit, and before that there were many bouts of alcohol poisoning and other dangerous situations caused by a legal substance.\n\nI ordered some kratom after going through withdrawals from alcohol in a hospital because that withdrawal gave me seizures. You cannot tell me that it makes sense to schedule a plant but you are going to keep alcohol legal.\n\nNow that I've been using kratom, I can work again and have become a productive member of society. I got married, take care of my stepkid, and am able to actually leave my house without being drunk or high.\n\nPlease reconsider this ban. I honestly don't want to have to make a choice to either be a criminal and keep using kratom or switch to something much more dangerous. It really doesn't make a lot of sense why this is happening, beyond some kind of ulterior motive which I hope is not the case.\n\nThis plant can help people. Anything can be abused or done in excess, but there are far worse options for people. If you want to work on the opioid epidemic in this country and come out ahead, you have to understand that banning everything doesn't help anyone. Making prescriptions hard to get doesn't help, either. You are just going to make heroin more and more popular or cause people to get on strong drugs like methadone. Why not help everyone out and keep kratom legal?\n\nYou can save lives, or put more people on the track to serious problems. I trust the government to make the right decision after reading our comments and looking at the scientific evidence.\n\nThank you for letting us comment on this.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1652","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon Harvey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"RE: Docket No. DEA-442W - my comments\n\nMy name is Shawn Thompson.

I'm currently attempting to get on disability due to chronic, debilitating pain from having osteoarthritis and a rare condition called Ehlers Danlos syndrome. I have been prescribed medication in the past, but nothing seemed to take the pain away or I'd have unpleasant side effects from it. \n\nOne day, I was on the Internet looking up alternatives to pain medication. For one, most people my age don't look up that sort of thing on the Internet. I'm fairly young, but I will have deal with these conditions for life, barring some huge medical breakthrough. During my search for something to relieve me of pain, I came across something called kratom. I began to read about it for the next couple days and finally ordered some.\n\nI'm an extremely skeptical person, so I had my doubts about kratom being effective. I wasn't worried about it being dangerous after all the literature had pointed to it being safe, with some minor side effects. Long story short, I received my package of kratom in the mail a few days later and tried some. Within 15-20 minutes, my back and neck pain vanished. I wasn't left feeling intoxicated or like I couldn't function, on the contrary, I felt more able to do different things.  For the first time in awhile, I was finally able to sleep through the night. Kratom has had a huge impact in my life. Not only has it helped my physical pain, it's made me more active and I'm also more social as I don't feel miserable and actually talk to people. \n\nPlease reconsider prohibiting people like myself from just wanting to feel normal and pain free. I urge you to please think about all the people who have experienced great benefits from kratom. I thank you for being considerate enough to hear the voices of the kratom community.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0658","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sy Overmyer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was mis diagnosed with cancer at young age dealing with years of pain now in my 30s kratrom has been my only relief the thought of not being able to use kratrom worries me alot.

There is no real \"high\" associated with use of Kratom and I would rate it's potential for abuse as extremely small (maybe on the order of coffee). It's benefits, however, are manifold and include pain relief without sedation, rapid anxiety relief without euphoria, efficacy at a wide range of doses, a lack of withdrawal effects as a dose wears off (so no \"chasing the high\" or desire to take more to avoid \"coming down\") and an inherent feeling Kratom provides that dissuades the user from taking more once a dose wears off. I began taking Kratom to manage chronic back pain and have recommended it to several of my patients with chronic pain, all of whom found it helpful. Kratom is not something one would seek out solely for intoxication- it is simply not that reinforcing or \"fun\". I believe that scheduling it as a C-1 drug is both unnecessary and a bit ludicrous. There are few effective remedies for chronic pain a doctor can offer patients apart from opioids; but Kratom is effective, well-tolerated and non-addictive, and I would like to keep recommending it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15008","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Broderick MD","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI suffer from chronic migraines, that I have had since I was 17. I also suffer from chronic bladder infections. I have tried a whole mix of things, nothing works 100%. Every medication has a side effect, weather it's tingling fingers of memory loss.. That's topomax to burning feeling in the face and possible heart attack... Imitrex \n\nI believe in a mix of medication and self-healing measures, such as yoga and meditation. I also believe that its not good practice to rely only on one medication for pain management. My neurologist and I have agreed that diversification of pain medication helps to reduce the risk of rebound headaches, and the risk of dependence.\n\nThis past February I was researching herbal pain remedies and came across an article from Vice News (http://www.vice.com/read/why-banning-the-controversial-painkiller-kratom-could-be-bad-news-for-americas-heroin-addicts) about kratom, a natural substance known for its pain relieving qualities. Could this be another way to manage my pain? Maybe this would replace or cut out other pain meds that I use. I took to the internet to obtain facts, check on addiction rates and understand how to ingest kratom. Here are some of the facts I found (with references) that made me decide that I would try kratom as one of many branches in managing chronic pain.\n\nAccording to Kratom Science (https://www.kratomscience.com/strains-effects-and-dosage): An important distinction is that unlike other administered drugs like oxycodone and morphine, kratom exhibits less dependency and addiction potential on the user. As mentioned previously, I am very cognizant of not becoming too dependent on any one substance and believe that diversification with kratom can be beneficial to my pain management plan.\nVice News reports that it is used to wean addicts off of heroin (http://www.vice.com/read/why-banning-the-controversial-painkiller-kratom-could-be-bad-news-for-americas-heroin-addicts).\nThose with multiple sclerosis, back pain, chronic fatigue syndrome and Lyme disease have reported relief when using kratom.\nThere have been a limited number of deaths attributed solely to kratom. Only 15 reported in the last 10 years. The majority of overdoses where kratom is present, other drugs and alcohol were all contributing factors.  Unlike opioids, kratom does not suppress the breathing function, which is an element of overdosing.\nThese findings led me to try kratom. After trying different strains and dosing, I can say that I finally have my life back. Kratom takes the pain away. I found that it gives me a little boost, allowing me to be more productive. I have been pleased with the results and love that kratom is less toxic than opioids.\n\nOver 100,000 Americans signed a petition (including myself) to halt the DEAs two-year ban on kratom. During the temporary ban, the DEA would conduct studies on this natural supplement. To me, it makes more sense to conduct studies and then come to a conclusion on whether or not to ban kratom. It clearly helps at least 100,000 manage their pain in an era where taking any type of opioid is completely taboo. People with pain matter. Completely blocking access to kratom will have a direct impact on those who responsibly take pain medications to deal with a chronic medical issue.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the DEA to halt the ban until further studies can be performed. I believe that I represent the majority of patients with chronic pain who use opioids. We are responsible and educated. Yes, there is an opioid epidemic in this country. However, taking away a natural supplement that could replace an opioid as pain management doesnt make any sense.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSara Ann Sparacio","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10997","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sara Ann Sparacio","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"we want to keep kratom, so there.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2277","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a veteran with a wide range of skeletal and connective tissue issues due to injuries and wear, I deal with pain on a daily basis and use various types of  prescribed anti inflammatory medication and Tylenol 3s, the latter I refrain from taking due to the fact that I am mildly allergic to opioids and when I have to take it (on my worst days) I experience headaches and nausea.

I also have an undergraduate honors degree in Psychology from Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. One of the modules I attained high marks in pertained to the study of drug addiction.\n\nThe big difference between kratom and opiates is that mitragynine prefers so-called delta opioid receptors, while opiates bind to mu opioid receptors. This is believed to be the reason that kratom is not (strongly) addictive (1).\n\nMy current role involves dealing with top executives on a daily basis via phone calls and face to face meetings. Thus my job requires incessant amiability, alertness, punctuality, and professionalism. I tend to only use kratom on weekends, and its use has not affected my performance in any way, shape, or form. This would be true even if I used it everyday. I never find myself craving kratom or feeling like I need higher and higher doses to feel the same effect.\n\nAs I'm sure the DEA knows, 88,000 people a year tend to die from alcohol-related causes in the United States (2). Over 480,000 people tend to die per year from tobacco-related causes (3). There have only ever been 15 'kratom-related' deaths known in the United States in the past 16 years. Additionally, autopsies for those deaths revealed that kratom was always far from the only drug in the person's body at the time of death. It thus can not firmly be concluded that kratom has caused a single death.\n\nTo even consider making kratom, which cannot be firmly associated with a single death, a Schedule 1 substance in a nation where two widely-used drugs, alcohol and tobacco, are completely legal and known to contain poison as well as to have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, is utterly preposterous. Such a consideration is a complete waste of time, effort, and money for the DEA and all those involved. \n\nAs a government entity designed to protect citizens of the United States from harmful substances, I implore the DEA to do just that. If alcohol and tobacco are not considered Schedule 1 substances in our society, no reasonable argument can be made that kratom should be. \n\n1) www.mitragyna.com/usage\n\n2) https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics\n\n3)  https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/tobacco_related_mortality/","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6444","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zachary Sirlin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have suffered from cluster headaches for the past ten years.

Opioid pain killers do not help with my symptoms (which I am thankful for due to the high chance of addiction). Kratom is the only thing I am able to take to improve my quality of life. While it does not resolve all of my issues, and does cause stomach problems because of how sensitive my stomach is, it is the only thing that makes me feel remotely normal again. The \"high\" for Kratom is closer to how you feel on caffeine. It does not make you feel foggy or crazy or silly or anything that you would typically expect from a \"drug\". Kratom gives me the energy to be able to function like a normal person in our society. Research has shown that the only deaths caused by this drug have been from mixing it with other substances. Tylenol even has that problem, so this does not seem like enough cause to ban a medicine that can and has changed the lives of many people. Outside of people like me that need it for chronic pain, Kratom also is a safe alternative to people that are addicted to opioids. If you're looking for a solution to all of the problems caused by our government's war on drugs: this is part of it. Outlawing Kratom would be taking us several steps into the wrong direction.

Otherwise the DEA should consider the science and public outcry in opposition to banning or scheduling kratom - a botanical substance used safely for hundreds of years.\n\nBefore turning potentially millions of responsible users of kratom into criminals, the government should conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis. It is my belief that scheduling kratom will negatively impact thousands and perhaps millions of law-abiding citizens.

My marriage was about to end and I was self medicating with drugs and alcohol. I just didn't know how to be happy and I was so tired of being miserable. I so badly wanted to be a good mom and productive member of society but I didn't know how. The day I tried kratom changed my life. I stopped using drugs and alcohol and my life went from devasting to full of joy and energy. For the first time In my life I woke up happy and went to bed happy. I have been able to be a mom and a wife and productive member of society! I had a bird child recently and I actually got to enjoy the birth and bonding without postpartum depression. My life is so full today of joy and love and happiness. I got my life back and I do not want that taken from me or anyone else in the same situation. please keep kratom legal. Personally it has never caused harm in my life, it is not addicting and there are no negative side effects. Please consider that it is not a hazard to public safety but banning it WILL be.

Kratom is another miracle plant given to us by the earth so we can heal ourselves. I suffer from anxiety and depression which I refuse to take chemical pills for REFUSE! Kratom has helped me deal with these issues which allows me to continue living a happy and healthy life. If it is taken away from me it is like taken away my herbal teas that help me sleep..it is just wrong and upsets me beyond comprehension. Kratom is truly a miracle plant that has more benefits for wonderful people who are trying to just live their lives in the best way they can. Making people felons for trying to heal themselves withoit chemicals will be the worst decision the DEA could ever make in history. It isn't harming anyone and it is only a herb.

While Kratom may not be for everyone it has made a significant positive impact in my life.\nI believe this tea, when speaking of the 100% unadulterated plain leaf,  is the safest possible option that I could have access to. Myself and countless others have benefited significantly from this leaf. To take away this natural plant option from adults would be an asinine move. It makes zero sense why there should be any control over this alternative. Kratom is not a drug. Kratom is a plant. It is a tree, most often grown in the wild- organically- and safe sustainable farming practices allow these leaves to be harvested, ground up into a fine powder or into crushed leaf and used safely by thousands of people worldwide, in some countries for more than a century. It is used for a variety of reasons, but it helps improve lives not destroy them. The DEA nor the FDA should be able to take something so beneficial away when it is not a danger or a threat to lives. \nTo classify this leaf as anything other than for what it is,  a tea, would be devastating to countless families, like mine. Please do not limit adult access to kratom. We have organizations working to make sure that responsible safe handling practices and product quality is held to the highest standards. I believe the direction this industry is moving and working towards, being handled by these organizations is the best solution to any agencies hesitation. Once these organizations have all the guidelines in place and as a community those who refuse to abide by these standards are rejected, we will be one of the most safe and effective communities there is within the United States. We have had no guidelines of standards in the last 10-15 years, when kratom really began to be used by a large number of people within the US, but yet even without these industry standards in place we've been doing a great job and had one of the safest possible track records of nearly any other product available in the United States. I know of very few other products that have a track record of safety as strong and well established as kratom. \nWe are not criminals looking for a new drug or something to elicit a \"high\", we are far and widely mature adults looking for natural ways to help improve our quality of life. Kratom is my answer. Don't take this away from us. If anything, I believe states should be the highest level of \"control\" such as in my state of Illinois where they already established an 18+ law. I believe that is more than adequate. I know you already have seen the studies showing the safety of kratom in various ways and controls, including the study by Ole Miss led by Dr. Christopher McCurdy. Kratom should be more well-known and you can believe that IF it was a danger- it would have already been far more known. Before the announcement published in August, if I asked anyone who hadn't been around me since 2014 (when I found out about kratom) they had NEVER heard of it. When there is a danger of anything that's been around for more than 5 years,  people are aware- if I ask anyone what a Lortab or Heroin is, by age 13- they know. That in itself should speak volumes about just how safe kratom truly is. Kratom is a safe natural plant helping thousands of people lead better, more productive, higher quality lives. Keep our tea available for ALL adults.

I went through treatment for that addiction, but then ended up in jail for the medication I was prescribed to stay off opiates. I attempted suicide twice while I was in jail which was a direct result of being forced into coming off anti-depressants, anti-anxiety, and buprenorphine medications, \"cold turkey\", in jail. I had no criminal record before that time, and now at age 44, I have a felony and misdemeanor conviction. \n\nAlong with a vegan lifestyle, and daily exercise, for the past 3 years, I have taken only kratom to help manage any desire, I may have to go back to opiates. It also helps with my anxiety, and depression issues that I have had my entire life. If I would have known about kratom before going into treatment for opiate addiction, I am certain, I would not have the criminal record I have today.\n\nMy felony conviction has made it very hard to find a job that provides an income where I can be independent, and provide for myself, so I sell kratom. I get a lot of satisfaction knowing that I am helping others by offering them a plant based alternative. \n\nI am not going to downplay the addictive qualities of kratom. I know it is there, and it can be unpleasant, but not deadly, and the focus should be on harm reduction, and my kratom use has never put me in the types of harmful situations that pharmaceutical drugs did. With caffeine, sugar, nicotine and alcohol we accept that consumers must exercise personal responsibility in using the products, and we know that a certain percentage of consumers will not.

Aside from myself, my grandfather, a Korean War veteran, takes Kratom regularly as well. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer over ten years ago, and after several years cancer free, it returned. He can no longer receive chemotherapy treatment or radiation treatment. My grandfather also does not like to take the opiate painkillers he has been prescribed for pain associated with cancer and nerve damage- these medications cause him much more harm than good with the unpleasant side effects he experiences. He was introduced to Kratom and such a small amount gives him the pain relief and energy he needs to get through each day with cancer and other medical issues he suffers from at the age of 85. I cannot understand why anyone, government agencies included, would want to see the elderly people of our country, the war vets who gave up everything so many times for this country, to suffer and live out their lives in a miserable state. Once he has passed, he is gone, there is no going back to try and make things better, to make his quality of life better. I cannot imagine by fun loving, wise-cracking jokester of a grandfather having to go through each of the last of his days unhappy and in pain. Please consider our vets, and our Americans who have outstanding amounts of medical debt, as I do myself. Allow them this small chance to live pain free, anxiety free, DEPRESSION FREE, and debt free. It's such a small sacrifice for our government to make to allow our people their freedom to chose what plants they put into their body to better themselves. There are absolutely NO deaths associated with Kratom by itself. I can attest to the effects, both short and long term. I went through surgeries, pain relief treatments, and medications without any improvement. Also counseling and anxiety treatment. I found Kratom, went to my doctors as needed, had a healthy and happy pregnancy, and was regularly checked and seen by doctors all while on Kratom. I have had zero side effects or health issues associated with Kratom. Please can we all come together and do what's best for our people and our beautiful country. I am absolutely willing to do my part for the people. Our government has the potential to show the world how important and strong our people are, and that our people will fight for their rights which other countries do not allow. \nPlease consider regulating Kratom. If we can allow alcohol and Tabacco into the lives of adult Americans, I believe we can certainly allow for adults to make the right choice in herbal remedies such as Kratom.

I am a 42 year old professional woman who works in the medical field as a nurse. I have been using Kratom for approximately 2 years. I started taking Kratom after my doctor took me off of Tramadol cold turkey. I was in several car accidents, my second accident in Jan 2001 was the worst. I developed severe back pain and was unable to walk. I was put on several pain medications but nothing worked until I started taking Tramadol. I took Tramadol for over 10 years until my primary doctor left and I was assigned a new one who decided to take me off entirely without warning or tapering. I was miserable and in excruciating pain on a daily basis. I was told about Kratom by my dad who stays up-to-date with different alternatives to pharmaceuticals. It helped me so much with the negative side effects of opiate withdrawal and not only that but it helped with the pain. I have never felt \"high\" with kratom and do not take it in excess or on a daily basis. I take about 2 teaspoons three times a week. I am never foggy or drugged up. In fact, kratom actually helps me focus more and has helped relieve other things I've experienced in life such as anxiety and depression.

I have experienced absolutely no netagtice side effects, have not felt a dependency , and can find absolutely no reason why this herb should be illegal. I do believe the FDA should study it to help consumers understand for sure what amounts are safe as well as interactions and other considerations but the regulation should be extremely limited as this herbal remedy could help so many people in so many ways. I also strongly stand by my belief and that of many other advocates that any deaths or sicknesses attributed to kratom are falsely reported due to the supplier selling adulterated product or dangerous synthetics with little to no actual Kratom content. All of my interactions with the herbal remedy Kratom have been from reputable suppliers and I really can not say enough great things about it, it could truly improve the lives of millions of Americans that would otherwise be faced with using much more dangerous substances.

I am a Kratom user. I depend on Kratom daily. I suffer from endometriosis, extreme ovarian cysts and Severe Menstral complications. For my complications, there is no cure. I have been told multiple times by numerous doctors that I have three options \" pain medication, abrasive surgery or to deal with it.\" I didnt like those choices so I looked for something natural and that's when I found Kratom. I have been able to keep my pain tolerable with Kratom for the last year with zero side effects. Kratom helps with more then just my pain, I am a mother of a special needs daughter and I don't have time for the fatigue that comes along with my illness. Kratom gives me energy after a long day at work to take on my house hold and motherly chores. \nWhen they first announced the ban I stopped taking Kratom completely, I was terrified that I could be charged the same as a person using heroine. I stopped that day and I must report I had no withdrawal symptoms. I don't drink, smoke or use any street drugs so Kratom has never been a \"replacement drug\" in my case. I have panic attacks and anxiety, Kratom has helped me to cut my medicine in half. So I am asking you please take my comment into consideration when coming to a final decision. Kratom has helped me actually enjoy and live my life for both me and my daughter. Please don't take my hope away.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3948","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As an avid user of marijuana I've done research on Keaton and learned more about it through Joe rogans podcast.

I've been using Kratom for about a year now to help with my depression and anxiety. Before using kratom, depression and anxiety ran rampant in my life and it was very difficult to do everyday things. With depression and anxiety comes a lot of fatigue and unwillingness to do things that are healthy for my own being, but kratom has helped give me the natural energy boost and sense of well-being I need to be able to get out of bed and do things that are productive to my life such as exercising, interacting with people, and taking the time to take care for myself and those around me.\nMy dad also uses kratom to deal with back pain and methadone withdrawals. He has been using methadone for, I believe over 5 years now and was told by his doctor that if he continued to use methadone at that rate, he would need a liver transplant in 10 years. My dad asked the doctor for an alternative and he was told there was nothing he can do. I introduced my dad to kratom, and in the first month alone, he was able to lower the dose from five doses a day to only 2. Kratom relieved his back pain while also curbing the horrible methadone withdrawals without the ill side-effects. His job has been jeopardized several times because of the side-effects methadone would give. He works at an oil refinery, a very dangerous and fragile environment where many people have lost their lives due to negligence and petty mistakes. \"I know what that environment is like because i have worked at an oil refinery in Los Angeles for some time.\" Methadone caused him to feel spaced out at times, numb, unconcentrated, and because of this he endangered himself and those around him, but now with kratom he no longer encounters those problems.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8992","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Allen Rodriguez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I can't understand the DEA's interest in kratom.

I'm 37 years old, I'm a single parent and I'm a responsible adult consumer of kratom. I am opposed to any scheduling of this plant. I live with a chronic pain condition called Trigeminal Neuralgia. The pain strikes without warning and lasts for weeks to months on end. This condition is known as the 'suicide disease' due to its exceptionally severe and persistent nature. I feel very strongly that I should be allowed to choose natural options like kratom to help with this debilitating condition that leads many to deep depression. Kratom lifts my mood without impairing me in any way and while it does not always ease the excruciating pain it does help me to remain functional. It has returned me to productivity. It allows me to live a full life and to be the mother my son deserves. Please don't take this plant from me.\n \nThe US is currently in the midst of an atrocious opioid crisis that is worsening everyday. It is inconceivable that kratom might be made unavailable to the public during this critical time. Pure leaf kratom is safe and it saves lives! While addiction to narcotics is something I have managed to avoid thus far (thanks to kratom), it could very easily happen to me and it does happen to millions of others. Per National Institute on Drug Abuse, as of 2012 it was estimated that 2.1 million people in the United States were suffering from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers and an estimated 467,000 addicted to heroin. Heroin-related deaths increased 439% from 1999 to 2014. In 2014, opioids were involved in 28,647 deaths. That's 61% of all US drug overdose deaths. Additionally, 10,574 were related to heroin, in particular. Sadly, these statistics are only increasing. Kratom helps people struggling with addictions get their lives back! Please do not ban this plant! Do not take away this option in our greatest hour of need! \n\nI am fully opposed to ANY scheduling of kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10264","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Megan King","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 44 year old male Surgical Tech/ Operating Room Materials Manager. As a young man I was in the U.S. Army. I have been employed at the same hospital in Okc. for 20 years . At the age of 39 i started to have some severe/complex health problems. I became a type 2 diabetic and developed sever painful diabetic neuropathy in the lower half of my legs i also had a sever cachectic reaction to diabetes. I have tried all of the FDA approved medication for PDN and only mild if any relief  was achieved. After attempting to treat with these medications and numerous narcotics.  I decide to try going with no medicine and my quality of life was so bad I struggled with work and my family suffered for 2 years becoming fed up and feeling like i was about to loose my wife of  20 years at the time I went back to the narcotics Loratab 10   1-2 a day when pain was overwhelming typically in the evening. I hated the thought of taking Loratab the rest of my life but it allowed my to spend some decent time with my family. I was visiting with one of my old Army buddies and discussing health and he mentioned I should research and try Kratom he was taking it daily and in his words changed his life for the better and returned him back closer to the man he used to be and wanted to be. I researched it and gave it a try, completely changed my life i have been taking it since that was almost a year ago. Now I guess i will get into something a little more personal and private but i feel is very important. The very first side effect of type 2 diabetes i experienced was erectile dysfunction not something you really want to discuss or make public knowledge. My E.D. was sever and non responsive to treatment, I tried them all Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, combinations of them all under the direct supervision of a few Physicians, nothing worked. I was reduced to having to give myself an injection in the side of my Penis just before any sexual event and sometimes it would work sometimes it would not. I was in a really miserable situation with sexual function and only 41 years old. Since starting Kratom I have had a sexual life without the injections, it is the craziest thing. If i quit taking Kratom for 2 weeks I am back to giving myself an injection. One last important note I was spend a small fortune on medication over $500.00 a month, luckily i have a great job and good insurance, since kratom my medication monthly charge is less than $100.00. Kratom is a supplement in my mind not a medication that is taken for one or two ailments it is a total health and body supplement.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6269","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Liles","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a mild herb with amazing benefits.

The one in my lumbar is completely worn out, and is now bone on bone, and the nerve damage has begun. Without pain management, I walk around like a 70 year old man. I can't work more than a few hours, regardless of how many ibuprofen I take. I was prescribed percocet, and got up to 45 mg a day, and it wasn't helping for more than an hour. I was also prescribed muscle relaxers so I could sleep. Then the doctor decided I was taking too much percocet, so she cut me back to 30 mg a day, which didn't help at all anymore. So I stopped taking them, and got sick from withdrawals. Then I found kratom. Not only does it cost a fraction of what the opiate drugs do, this natural, simple supplement not only eased my withdrawal symptoms to a bearable level, it gave me energy and helped with the pain better than opiate drugs ever did. I was able to get up and get a job. I got off of government assistance and a 40 hour a week job in a warehouse. Because of the extra pain relief, I am also able to work hard enough to be tired, and pain free enough to fall asleep on time at night. Which helped my back even more, because I was able to get real rest, instead of tossing and turning in pain all night. It also helps my appetite. Since I stopped taking the opiate drugs, I've gone from 145 to 185. I'm six foot tall. This natural, unadulterated herbal supplement has given me my life back. If kratom gets banned, I'm back to being unable to work. And I'm not alone. The ban will cause a huge wave of medicaid and disability claims. The fact that it cannot ease opiate withdrawal symptoms, without causing that doped out high, and allow people who are addicted to heroin and all of it's \"legal\" cousins, to get away from dangerous and physically addictive drugs that are running their lives.

To think something that may help millions of  people is going to be outlawed is disconcerting.  I was addicted to opiates for 6 years. I have done Suboxone for the past two. For me suboxone has been a sort of pacification. It shares many similarities with opiates and is one of the main drugs used  for opiate addiction. The withdrawals from suboxone are the same as morphine or heroin so i have yet to abandon the drug as i still wake up sick like i would from prolonged use of morphine. Kratom is something i've been looking into and am considering trying to finally become drug free. From my research of first-hand accounts with Kratom it can be a miracle drug for opiate addiction. If Kratom would be as medicinal for me as it has been for many others it would be a life changer. For this reason i see no explanation as to  why it should be outlawed. It seems to me that there could only be one reason to outlaw a medicine so quickly and harshly without research or any backing evidence and that is to keep the opiate pushed  pharmaceutical companies in business.

Please do not ban Kratom, it is the only effective method that I have found to help me sleep at night and ease my chronic pain, that previously would make me toss and turn all night.   I have tried prescription drugs and OTC meds, and sometimes resorted to drinking to much Alcohol  to get rest.

With Kratom Tea, I have been able to abandon all  pain medication, Alcohol and get  a good night sleep.  In My opinion, Kratom is a very useful plant that serves as a safe alternative to dangerous prescription drugs and alcohol which can cause dependency, impaired motor function, and liver damage.  \n\nI do not believe the Kratom needs heavy regulation, If anything it should be a recognized as over the counter dietary supplement, like it is in Canada, like green tea or coffee.

I respectfully disagree. My reasoning is my own experience. I use Kratom for wellness, motivation and an all around positive natural force. I do also take Wellbutrin daily, which is prescribed by the VA to help me with PTSD resulting from my time in Afghanistan. Wellbutrin is well known for lowering the \"seizure threshold\" in human beings considerably; the max daily dose of Wellbutrin is 450mg/day; at this dose, patients have a 0.4% chance of having a seizure. At 600mg, that number jumps to 4% - so essentially for every 100 humans that consume 600mg of Wellbutrin in a day (theoretically) 4 of them will have seizures. DEA and other opponents of Kratom have alleged it contributed to seizures. I have consumed Kratom for 5 years. I have taken Wellbutrin (off and on) during that time, including as I write this. The Wellbutrin is used to treat my PTSD (as opposed to SSRI/SNRI which are far more harmful and can have very adverse effects). My consumption of Kratom is part of my own personal wellness plan which also includes a very dedicated exercise regimen and a health diet. In the entire period I have consumed Kratom, I have NEVER experienced a seizure (or any adverse effects, for that matter), including while taking Wellbutrin.\n\nKratom is an amazing plant and it should be embraced not banned. Again, I take Kratom to help maintain a consistent wellness. It has helped at home, at work and while continuing to serve our Country.

Thats when I found Kratom. It has given me much better pain relief and dramatically improved the quality of my life. I no longer use opioids, anti inflammatories, or blood pressure medication. My depression and mood are much healthier. I no longer need a handful of pills; I have chosen to treat naturally and found it has dramatically less side effects compared to the synthetic components I was previously using. \nI understand that the FDA has suggested any use of kratom is considered abuse, because it is not FDA approved. I should be the person responsible for my health care decisions. I do not support scheduling Kratom or it's active alkaloids. I believe it's my choice to buy and use a tree leaf and decide what works best for me. \nI do not want to return to the pharmaceuticals that failed me. Kratom hurts no one and helps me to be a productive citizen again. This is supposed to be the land of the free. Spend your resources on getting dangerous drugs off the street. Kratom is not a drug nor is it dangerous. Kratom is my choice!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17090","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tammy Bieganowski","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm 60 years old and I've been using Kratom for nearly 5 years.  In my early 50's I went to my Doctor to see why my neck was constantly hurting.  He looked at my x-rays and told me I have Arthritis in the neck and recommended I take Tylenol to help with the pain and had me get some neck exercise instruction from a physical therapist.  That help a little, but it was getting worse with time.  An acquaintance told me about how Kratom was really helping him deal with his back pain so I gave it a try.  It made a tremendous difference in making the pain bearable so I can continue to work a busy schedule.  I own a business and employ 20 full time employees.  Before I started Kratom I was researching a way to sell my business because I felt I was getting to the point of becoming disabled and unable run it any longer.  I couldn't find any buyers and It looked like I'd have to close the doors and give notice to 20 employees that are more like family to me and I thought I would have to go on Social Security Disability.  Kratom turned that all around.  With 2 doses of Kratom a day I only experience mild pain from time to time.  It's still there, but I can function at a normal rate with very little down time.  Kratom has kept me going like nothing else I've tried and there are no bad side effects.  I love my work and plan to keep doing it until I'm in my 70's and maybe think about retiring then.  As long as Kratom is still available for me, this is my dream.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10886","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Hopf","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\n    Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\n    If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\n    Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n    Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n    Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n    Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14642","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Doris Lein","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My girlfriend has been using Kratom on and off for about 10 years to treat her severe back pain.

While in high school 2002-2006, I became very addicted to opiate medications that were prescribed (actually over prescribed) to my father after he fell off our roof in year 2000. Which sadly today has become a normal story for so many kids with easy access to such powerful medications. I got to the point I was stealing and taking everything I could from anyone and everyone i knew, money, pills, whatever. My relationship with my family was severely suffering because of it. It also left me with the most horrible anxiety one could ever have, hard to live a normal life with that....Luckily and by the grace of god around 2005-2006 i stumbled across a simple little at the time unknown herb called kratom or mitragyna speciosa, while looking for a way out, little did I know this simple herb would SAVE my life. I guarantee within a year, i would have been dead on the streets had I not found kratom, sadly I know that as a fact. It's now been 11 years now since i found kratom, I live a normal, healthy, happy life, I own my own business, I pay my taxes, I have stayed out of trouble, I have great relationships with friends and family and i would NOT be here if it weren't for kratom. Kratom didn't do it alone, but it was a very very important tool that helped me and continues to help me. Please don't take it away from me and the many thousands of others that have been helped and saved by it. We have one of the most horrible heroin/fentanyl/opiate crisis in America right now, that was created from over prescribing medications for so many years. If you take away kratom I can 1000% guarantee that crisis will explode 100 fold, to the likes of nothing we have seen yet. Why would you knowingly want to do that? Most who take kratom are responsible adults, that don't take it to get \"high\", they take it to help themselves live a better, HEALTHIER life, to work again, to be active again, to naturally and safely take their pain and anxiety away, to be able to spend time with their kids without being so drugged up on medications and in so much pain, they couldn't before.. Kratom isn't the threat you like to portray it as, i know it and many more thousands do also, i'm a living testament now 11 years later, I don't need the FDA or anyone else to tell me different. We don't need more and more pills being prescribed in america, that only poison our minds and our bodies, kratom doesn't do that. So please think of these people before you decide take such a wonderful life saving thing away. I'm afraid everything ive accomplished will go away should kratom be taken away, as are many more people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9083","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chad Steven","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Plainly put.... my mother was strucken with severe back problems stemming from several injured vertebrae that happened from an injury at work.

I was able to stop using prescription pain medication without ANY withdrawal symptoms, with the help of Kratom. Kratom also alleviated my extreme anxiety and allowed me to feel like myself, and still does. However, with Kratom, I do not feel like I NEED it like the prescription pain medication made me feel...because it is NOT addictive. Kratom also gives me a boost of energy, after working all day, then coming home and having to make dinner for my kids and do homework (me and them).

Unfortunately my body did need it because i found myself in withdrawals. I have never gone thru anything harder in my life and being a first time mom just made me feel absolutely horrible! Luckily i have a great family and they helped me get thru that. That wasn't the end of it tho because after i birthed my twins i found myself in even more pain than before and too scared to take medication for it. I opted to have surgery and i did feel a bit better it was only a temporary fix tho. Pain and more pain was to follow now with 3 kids i was in no way about to start back on prescription pain medication and go thru that hell again. Did some research online and found kratom! That week i ordered some and when it came i made a tea out of it and my life changed for the better that day. I haven't taken any pain medication i make my tea in the morning and it gets me thru the day with very minimal pain. I am the mom i want to be because of kratom! Please don't take this away from me.

I was, at one point, bound to prescribed pain medications for a period of approximately 4 months due to a lower back injury.  Not knowing what addiction or dependence was, I took them steadily those 4 months while my back \"healed,\" and, for the first 3 months, functioned quite well.  The 4th month I felt my strain had improved but found myself challenged to stop the medication.  I felt sick- depressed- miserable.  Not knowing why, I went to my physician, who then prescribed me 12mg of Suboxone.  Let's just say, mg for mg, the dosage was entirely too high and it became an even worse problem than ever before, taking a solid 3 years and 8 attempts to finally quit.  Since then, I've never touched a pain medication and, honestly, don't  like taking any medication.  \nNot long ago it was recommended I try Kratom for my frequent migraines, as well as some other ailments I had.  \"It's not a pain killer like you'd expect- you won't get high, you won't be euphoric, and you may still have some pain, but it's certainly a valuable tool for your arsenal,\" I was told.  Since then, I've taken Kratom here and there for headaches/migraines, back aches, and various other ailments.  I've used it for long periods of time and short periods of time, each phase stopping for breaks and never feeling miserable.  I've cut back on coffee from it!  I am a happier person because of it.  I've never felt like I was going to overdose (though once, when changing my vendor source, I did take more than usual and ending up puking twice before I felt normal, thus teaching me the valuable lesson \"less is more.\"  I've also helped others discover the benefits of Kratom and have observed them go from pharmaceutical relief to natural relief.  WHat a difference it has made for them and myself.\nI am all for regulating certain things, but to treat kratom like a vilified plant, making it a Schedule I and illegal to own or possess or consume, is not only a foolish mistake, but a violation of our rights as US citizens.  Alcohol kills more people, directly and indirectly, than kratom ever has or ever will, meanwhile has no true benefits that can be touted, whereas kratom has a wide array of benefits.  I see no reason to outlaw kratom and make it yet another street drug- which is exactly what will happen- for the police to deal with and to load up our prisons.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13648","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Richmond","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I will keep this short and sweet.

In order to rid my body of all the drugs pushed my way by doctors, I decided to give Kratom a try as a healthier and natural alternative to all the prescription drugs. Within one week, I no longer needed to take antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, sleep aids, and most importantly pain medications all because I drink Kratom tea once or twice a day.  I beg you to please reconsider putting Kratom into a category with opioids and heroin and making it a schedule one drug. It is nowhere near what people are misinterpreting it as.   It is so much healthier for people and it can literally four people from addiction and help the populations and masses of people struggling to get off of opioids and heroin and use an alternative that is literally grown in nature and been used for thousands of years.   I beg you to understand that this herb, this plant, this God given leaf is saving thousands of people from the toxic medicines  pushed on people daily. Some of these poor people have no choice but to turn to other drugs such as heroin because they can't afford the medication is being shoved down their throat's by the doctors today. These medications have horrible side effects, damage body parts, and are killing people on a daily basis.   Kratom is natural, has no side effects, does not make you high, and merely reduces pain and suffering, eliminates stress, depression and anxiety, and  assists people with drug and alcohol issues and detoxing and becoming clean. Isn't that just what our country needs right now? Something to help these people who desperately need it? I myself  honestly do not know what I would do without Kratom.  It has given me my life back, giving me clarity, and made me happy again. Please, please do not make this mistake and classify this perfectly harmless leaf  as a drug.  We have so many more bigger fish to fry in this world and in our country today. Please reconsider and reach out to all these people who are trying to tell you the magnificent benefits this plant provides to good people in our country. I am proud to say that crate him saves lives, and has saved mine.

When you live with anxiety, every day you feel unclear in your thoughts. You feel stifled, afraid, and unsure of yourself. It is almost as if you are viewing the world through a filter, a haze that acts like a curtain to block you from taking any positive actions and from connecting with those around you. Kratom helped to remove that curtain! When it did, I felt a heavy weight had been lifted from my shoulders, allowing me to pursue new opportunities I would have previously been afraid of. I felt able to fully express myself to friends, family, and colleagues instead of constantly feeling mentally restrained. When I take kratom, nobody even knows I am using it  they only notice that I am making positive changes! Kratom helped give me a chance to take the actions necessary to grow and improve my life instead of continuing to live in a mental cell of anxiety and fear.\n\nIf you have made it this far, I want to thank you for taking the time to read my story and to please support the legal availability of kratom as a botanical supplement!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15270","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"AJ B","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 46 year old man that has been in a suboxzone program for 4 years.

And I have seen a complete 180 difference in her since. She has an almost perfect attendance record as a recruiter for a local staffing agency. She is responsible and pays her bills and makes strides to better her life and the lives of others in our community through volunteer work. She doesn't steal from us, lie to us or completely avoid us anymore. And she seems to genuinely happy with life again.\n  When she first told me about kratom I was afraid of what that meant. But I took some of the kratom in capsule form. As a person with 2 knee replacements surgeries, I could tell a slight relief from taking the kratom, but it was nothing compared to the oxycotin that the doctor prescribed after my surgery. Oxycontin left me unable to function as a mentally sound individual. And I can assure, my experience with kratom was nothing like oxycontin. \n  Please do not take my niece's quality of life away by scheduling kratom as a Schedule I drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5011","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Diane Gibboney","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"kratom helps with pain and doesn't affect me like pain killers and other big pharma drugs that rot you from the inside out after taking something a dr prescribes you only to find out later that its horribly bad for you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21984","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nTwo years ago , I WAS addicted to herion.

I have done extensive research on its properties which are helping addicts successfully abstain from opiates. I've been a heroin addict since 2009, and am currently participating in a medicated assisted treatment plan at the methadone clinic in the city where I live. At first I was terrified. I didn't understand how opiates could help me get off of opiates. What I found was that it offered physical and mood stabilization and allowed me to organize my life, a mess from years of use, and bring myself out of chaos and into a scenario conducive to recovery. It's been effective, but its purpose has been fulfilled, and I'm looking to take my next step toward a life free of chemicals (prescribed or otherwise). It is my dream to exist as ME, and not a combination substance reactions. With my counselor and the help and wisdom from some friends who have had unfathomable success abstaining from opiates with Kratom, I've created an action plan consisting of a gentle methadone wean down and a transition to Suboxone then Kratom then freedom. A lot of people know about the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with opiates, but most aren't aware of the emotional state, the anhedonia (the inability to experience pleasure from activities usually found enjoyable), a sort of drug induced depression that is often the reason for relapse. Why bother being clean life seems vague and meaningless? Kratom can help with this. Kratom can help people free themselves from the prison of addiction. It hurts me a great deal to think about this plant's ability to save individuals from prison, rehab, and often times, death. It hurts me a great deal to imagine anyone taking this away from myself and other addicts, each on our individual quests toward abstinence. Addiction is winning. We've seen AA, NA, Narconon, Brighton Hospital, A Forever Recovery, Methadone Maintenance- all recovery programs I've tried along with hundreds of thousands of others.They have proved effective for a short period of time, if at all. We are well versed in what's not working. Opiate dependance is an epidemic, and we are consistently losing people (in the figurative and literal senses) who might otherwise contribute to the beauty and strength of our country. This is a potential path to individual transcendence, and a happier, more fulfilled populous. This is something that deserves the chance to prove its value in the world of  substance abuse.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21104","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Whitney Potter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom (Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine) do NOT warrent Schedule 1 status.\n\nThank you for your kind attention,\n\nSharon Paltin, M.D.\nVolunteer Physician working with Haight Ashbury Free Clinics, Rock Medicine division, for past 22 years.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19810","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sharon Paltin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom.

Before I discovered this natural plant, I was taking narcotic prescription pills for pain and having terrible side effects from them. I ended up losing my job and becoming very dependent on the medication, taking more and more to help with the pain, thus having even more terrible side effects. I suffer from depression and anxiety as well, and as time went on, having the prescription medication only made these worse. I felt like I had no hope and was living day to day trying to avoid my physical pain and relying on the medication which made me even more depressed. I lived closed off to everyone, laying in bed all day, feeling completely hopeless. While I have always suffered from depression and anxiety even before taking prescribed medication, I felt even worse after taking them. So many ups and downs and feeling like I had dug myself into a hole. This went on for over 4 years. When I took kratom for the first time, it took away the physical pain without the terrible side effects that medication had given me. I was able to stop the addicting prescribed narcotic medicine, I was able to leave the house, I got a job again, and my outlook on my life changed completely. I was able to live again by taking this natural plant that did not give me any negative side effects, whatsoever. I am so thankful for discovering Kratom every day because I have my life back. If this plant becomes illegal, I will be very scared that I will end up going back to the prescription medications, and I don't want to. I feel I will end up worse than I had been in the beginning and that scares me.

Unfortunately my body can no longer tolerate either medication because of the side effects specifically the chronic constipation. Because of my history I can not take any opioid medication and that leaves me with very few choices to manage my condition. Regular Tylenol or Advil do not work and is hard on my stomach. \n\nI heard about Kratom and tried it and was amazed at the results.

It's an amazing herb that has given me my life back. I was able to detox off of the methadone using Kratom and have not had any opioid cravings since. Whenever I run out of Kratom I don't go into withdrawals although I do have a bit more pain so I know the Kratom is really helping. I hope you won't make it illegal because it's an herb that helps a lot of people in need. If you take away the Kratom chances are many of us will have to go back to using opioids of some type.

Let me get this straight. You assholes allow monolithic pharmaceutical conglomerates to get thousands nightmarishly hooked on boundlessly terrible chemicals like buprenorphine and methadone (which, it's no secret, are far more addictive and equally as damaging to the brain and body as the illegal drugs which they're a supposed alternative/treatment to.) yet for a whole cornucopia of dumbass reasons, plan to outlaw fucking kratom?? For real? The only real reason I've seen is the amount of calls to poison control centers regarding kratom. While you're at it, make household cleaners, cough suppressants, caffeine, and motrin illegal too. Actually, wait: don't. Don't make any of these things illegal because it's a fucking stupid idea. Even more ludicrous than the prospect of prohibition. \nKratom is a far more superior alternative to the two accepted substances I've listed above, because it doesn't get the user intoxicated or negatively euphoric, nor does it have an equivalently high likelihood of killing those who consume it. Oh, and, big, BIG benefit here: it's not satanically addictive! You don't have any idea what it's like to come off of methadone compared to heroin or oxycodone. I do. I've been there. I'm one of the type of people whose lives you'll be fucking up with your totalitarian bullshit. It takes a grueling two or three weeks to finish the acute detox of methadone or subutex. Heroin lasts five days, at most a week, and then it's over. You know how it's okay to be prescribed methadone or subutex to detox off of opiates? I've taken it maybe three out of the dozens of times I've detoxed, preferring to go cold turkey. Why? Because I don't want to prolong my horrid plight by taking those evil goddamn pharmaceuticals.  \nKratom, on the other hand, does not do what methadone and subutex do. It's a natural and non-opiate method of overcoming the excruciating detox symptoms of opiate addiction. Just like Iboga, only it's a little less radical, so you people should be okay with it. But you're not. Because you have no idea what you're doing.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12959","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Wanda Powell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"  I have never been concerned as much as I am now, for the state of society and the world.

I could not lie down or sit without terrible pain. And I had no insurance (I belonged to Samaritan Ministries, but one must pay out at least $300 in doctors bills for a condition before one can submit a need to them). Our household of 8 has an income of less than $30,000 a year, so I don't go to the doctor much.\n\nI've always looked for the most natural remedy in any illness or injury, shying away from pills and drugs. So I did the same in this case. I researched natural pain remedies on the internet. \n\nWhen I came across kratom, I was surprised that I had never heard of it, and that it was being so widely used by people with chronic pain. I read quite a lot about it, that it was used by some for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, others for PTSD, and that it was also helping those addicted to prescription opiates and street drugs to recover from their use. It was inexpensive in its powdered leaf form, so I found a reputable retailer and ordered some. \n\nI took what is generally thought to be a low dose, and the relief was almost immediate. Within about 20 minutes the pain was greatly reduced, and within an hour I was amazed that I felt no pain. I could sit, walk, stand and go about the business of taking care of my six home-schooled kids. The relief was so thorough that I thought initially that the injury had miraculously healed.  I felt no pain for about 8 hours, and it's return was so gradual that I did't need to take anything more until the next day.  After about  a week I was healed enough to go back to just Ibuprofen for the residual pain. I didn't suffer any withdrawal sypmptoms at all. But kratom has become a valued addition to my natural medicine cabinet.\n\nTaking too much one time (I was in a hurry and didn't measure, but just took it off a spoon) resulted in an \"overdose\" which made me nauseated and dizzy. I recovered within an hour. \n\nI've continued to read on it and recommend it to people I know who could use it. My sister uses it for fibromyagia pain and for anxiety.  My husband has used it  for pain as well. I think it is nothing less than a wonder. It is inexpensive and effective for at least 70% of those who've used it for pain. \n\nMy guess it that the drive to make it a scheduled substance is fueled by the big pharmaceutical companies who make money from addicting people to prescription pain killers. They are studying kratom, and it will be only a matter of time until they create from it a drug that is dangerous, addictive, expensive and patented. Money is always the bottom line. In this country we tell our children that drugs are bad, but then every other TV commercial in the evening is for some kind of drug. \n\nI pray the DEA will rethink its position regarding the use of this natural supplement. I take zinc, Vitamin C and Echinacea when I'm coming down with a cold. My husband takes Hawthorn Berries for blood pressure and Red Yeast Rice for cholesterol. It is a good thing to have kratom on hand to use for pain.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13293","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nadja Van der Stroom","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 34 year old mother of two (single), business owner/entrepreneur in which I own 2 individual businesses of 1) Handmade Artisan Exclusive One of a Kind Gemstone Jewelry & 2) Selling high end boutique clothing & fashion.

For the two years following the accident kratom helped to keep my pain from the strain of whiplash completely controllable to the point where I could go to work & enjoy life without the flare ups of my back/shoulders to bother me. I also noticed while drinking the tea that my PMS was dramatically reduced & mood was a lot more stable - something I've struggled with since puberty. It has now been nearly 5 years since the wreck & I am not taking kratom anymore because my state decided to ban it in May of 2016. I do occasionally experience flare-ups of muscles seizing about seasonally. I think what saddens me the most is I have no relief for the hormonal issues I go through every 23 days. I have tried everything from midol to Topamax to control the syspmtoms I experienced cycling & nothing helped except the kratom tea. Please do not take the right to choose away from American people. The majority of people that consume kratom lead a much better quality of life, they're nicer, more pleasant, more productive, happier citizens than they were beforehand & that counts for everything in my opinion. I urge you to educate yourselves with an unbiased information in order to make the best decision you possibly can. Who knows, maybe you or a loved one would benefit greatly from this amazing plant. \nSincerely, \nA Concerned American Professional","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14868","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Joshua Rhodes, I am 31 years old, and I work at a Union factory in Cedar Rapids Iowa.\nI found inner peace and freedom after I stumbled upon kratom during a Google search 5 years ago.\nI've struggled with an interpersonal detachment disorder for as long as I can remember. My earliest childhood memories often replay as flashbacks from when I lived in an orphanage and resided with multiple foster families. I've encountered many forms of abuse the while growing up. Love did not come naturally to me and I've always felt disconnected to everything and everyone.\nMy sisters and I were all adopted out later on but we were all split up and we eventually lost connection with eachother.\nI've trialled several different medications prescribed by my doctor to combat my anxiety and nervousness but nothing really helped me. I just went deeper into isolation and gave up the idea of treatment.\nI attempted suicide in 2011 on Father's Day with my 45 Colt Revolver and it turned out I have a guardian angel. The gun slipped from underneath my chin, rolled forward, and penetrated my knee instead.\nIn consequence of this event I developed chronic pain from the gunshot wound and I was prescribed a powerful opioid painkiller alongside a strong anti-deppressant. This combination made everything worse and it wasn't long until I was tightly clenched into the jaws of addiction. \nI scrambled to find a natural alternative and I luckily found kratom. It curbed my pain and it dissolved my anxiety. For the first time in my life I felt like I could breathe effortlessly. This therapeutic tea had the power to lift me up without any unwanted side effects, and it effectively kept all of my demons at bay.\nI improved on every level and even got half custody of my 7 year old daughter. We are living so well and are as happy as can be.\nPlease do not ban kratom. I've never been in trouble with the law, not even once. It would be a shame to look at how I got better as being a punishable crime.\nI just want to live my life without this useful tool being ripped out of my hands.\nThank you for considering my comment on this matter.\n\n                                                                  ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15606","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Rhodes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nPlease give serious regard to defining Kratom as a schedule 1 drug.

It's been an absolute blessing to have found something that actually changed my life. I've been on so many medications and this is the first time I don't have to be dopped up on meds just to get through one day.

I couldn't quite get to sleep or quell anxious thoughts without half a dozen drinks to quiet down. This legal drug has in the past few years damaged my health and will continue to, as I have had a doctor advise me that on my current path I will have a very serious conversation with him in about 5 years. Alcohol is legal and condoned in our society yet I have had a medical professional flat out tell me by the time I am 30 I will have some very serious complications due to my usage. Objectively speaking it makes no sense that such a dangerous substance linked to disease, domestic violence and motor vehicle fatalities should be legal while an obscure herb with very limited research should be classified as highly dangerous.\n\nKratom has given me an alternative to alcohol and serves as a stepping stone as I explore my own shortcomings, seek help and  reverse destructive behavior. Like anything else it has a potential to be misused but given there are far more harmful substances that are legal (alcohol, tobacco and trans fats to name a few), it is a disservice to the American people to ban something that may help transition from harmful ways of living.\n\nIt is my sincere hope that the DEA and FDA which we the people have entrusted to act in our best interest, objectively study and understand what this herb does before taking action to classify it as among the least useful and most harmful substances known to mankind. Having the experience I do, I highly doubt this will be the case and personally can speak to the usefulness of this herb. Many people with far more dangerous addictions vouch for this herb's usefulness and I am concerned that should it be classified as a dangerous and deadly substance, they will be left with no legal options to deal with their problems. This will affect all Americans in that illegal activity will increase, law enforcement will need to respond accordingly and ordinary citizens will live in a less safe America.\n\nPlease do your best to fairly and accurately assess Kratom's potential for therapeutic use and should it be harmful after all, please ensure consumers are informed. But before it's known, while it is helping so many people, please do not automatically default to assuming the worst of this seemingly very helpful medicine.\n\nThank you very much for your time and consideration.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nJ.S.

I grew up in therapy and was put on many different medications to try to help me cope and to aid in fixing my ptsd, insomnia, anxiety, etc. I ended up getting into many drugs along the way and lived a dangerous lifestyle. Then I got introduced to kratom. Miraculously enough I stopped taking drugs. Got off my medications . And started living an amazing normal life. Along with kratom I have made so many steps to creating a life in want o live. And the fact that it was legal made it even better. I also want to sat that I have a love for neuropharmacology and I've read many things about kratom and it's alkaloids and it's effects on the body and mind. Its comparable to Marijuana in the fact that there is no risk of death from overdose, with the addition of not fogging up your thinking or effecting your judgment and motor skills. 7 hydroxy-mitragynine does not cause respiratory depression, nor does it damage receptors to the best of my knowledge.I don't know what I'd do if I lost kratom.

I strongly urge you to reconsider your stance on this herb. Like many, I developed an addiction to opiate painkillers. After multiple attempts to quit, and a great deal of pain, misery, and money, I heard about kratom. Three days of brewing kratom tea totally broke my physical dependency on opiates. I drank it three twice daily, and after that, I was able to simply stop. My experience is mirrored by countless people. I beg you not to withdraw this option --- there are so, so few options already.\n\nIf you investigate the kratom-related deaths, you will see that kratom itself is not implicated in them. It has long been used safely. It is less addictive than caffeine, let alone alcohol or tobacco. In addition, it has tremendous medicinal properties: as I said, it saved my life, which was spiraling out of control as prescription opiates took over my brain. It is too awful for me to contemplate what would have happened to me without this herb.\n\nIn addition, I have a friend who suffers from sever chronic pain caused by multiple sclerosis. Nothing has worked for her other than opiate painkillers --- which are strongly contra-indicated for long-term use --- and kratom. She uses it once or twice a week, when the pain is too much to take, and has been doing so for years with no adverse effects and no dependence.\n\nPlease, work with us here. We trust the government to look our for our wellbeing and to not implement restrictions that serve little good and actually do harm.\n\nI am confident you will make the right call.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0489","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please read with an open mind, I will greatly appreciate it.\n\nYour job isn't to use scare tactics and momentum to make more things illegal (that you have no idea what they actually do).

I have years of personal experience with kratom that have been nothing but extremely positive.  I started eating small amounts of the ground leaf three years ago because I heard it was a healthy alternative to opioid pain medication.  I have multiple ruptured discs in both my cervical and lumbar spine that cause moderate to severe chronic, daily pain, but also love to lead an active lifestyle as well as keeping my thinking clear in order to be able to read, learn, and interact with intelligent people.  All opioids have made that impossible, plus they are highly addictive and get me into the opioid spiral where I build tolerance take more, build tolerance, etc., which can end up being lethal as we are reminded of every day.  Kratom has been a miracle in my life.  It has a powerful analgesic effect, enabling me to work on my feet for ten plus hours a day, come home and be a proper husband and father.  I have noticed no ill health effects whatsoever, there are no side effects that I have noticed that make me \"high\" or altered in any way other than a general sense of well being with a notable reduction in pain.  My work consists of either public speaking in a high paced, critical role, or fabricating ultra high-end yachts in the winter.  I can't do this with an unclear mind and kratom has never once interfered with my ability to do my job/s.  The only alternative to this safe, natural remedy to a problem that modern medicine has not figured out how to solve, is opiod pain medication which is accepting a life of being a drugged out zombie, SSI disability, lost relationships and possible death from drug overdose.  It is impossible to see why any agency responsible for ensuring the well being of US citizens would chose to outlaw kratom.  Please, please do not.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3342","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Strauss","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Stop hogging the good stuff why the fuck is kratom iligal in Australia. \nWe need research","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18812","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyle Dawes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\nPlease do not place Kradom on the schedule 1 list.

I worked critical care for a decade before becoming paralysed due to a spinal cord disease. I have been using Kratom for a little over a year now. I first learned about kratom through a chronic pain support group. I researched kratom for many months before trying kratom personally. There was a multitude of information available as well as many testimonials from both long term and short term users of kratom. The general concensus I found through my research was that kratom offered great pain relief, mild stimulation, very few side effects, zero respiratory depression, no known overdose amount, and very little evidence that kratom alone had caused any fatalities. I must say I was very sceptical at first. The claims seemed too good to be true. Is it possible that something can actually help with pain, provide a bit of extra energy, all without being highly addictive or mind altering? As a nurse I had encountered patients that had overdosed both on prescription and illegal street drugs. It was never a pretty site, or an easy road to recovery. The possibility that kratom offered a safe alternative, without the possibility of overdose is a fascinating find for people across the nation suffering from addiction or opiod dependency. But, in order for my opinion to be truly objective I felt it necessary to actually try kratom. My first step would be to consult my physician. It was no surprise that he had never heard of it, but after reviewing the chemical makeup of kratom he was intrigued. We began to taper down my opiod medication. Although he could not recommend kratom to me, he was well aware of my intentions. After I had successfully completed my taper program, I tried Kratom in a tea. I ordered from a vendor online who came highly recommended by the community and offered lab reports to prove that the kratom was pure without any adulterations. I consumed a teaspoon and was waiting patiently for the \"rush\" that would come from my opiod medications. One hour after consuming the tea, there was still no rush, but what I did find was that my pain was significantly lower, and my joints were easier to move. Was I totally out of pain? No, but I  did notice a difference. It was surprisingly long lived. While my medication would wear off 2 to 3 hours after taking them I found that the effects of kratom lasted 5 to 6 hours. I found that at a larger dose of one and one half teaspoon in the morning,  that my pain was controlled almost all day long. Best of all, there was no roller coaster effect happening for me. This is what happens when you take opiod medications, they peak and your pain significantly decreases for a short time, then as the meds begin to wear off the pain seems to come back stronger than before. Thus, causing the need for more medication to treat the same amount of pain as before. This builds up a tolerance and dependency to narcotic pain medication. After consuming kratom for over a year now, I can safely say that kratom does not produce this effect. When I found out that the DEA wanted to schedule kratom as a class 1, I was highly confused. Then I read the sensationalism and how it was being called incorrect labels like \"synthetic\" or  \"opiod\". So it became clear why the DEA was concerned. However, I believe the DEA to be held to a higher standard than just falling for the sensationalism. I believe that appropriate investigation into kratom and it's effects would have prevented the entire misunderstanding. I am not against an investigation by the fda either. I do think it is important to note that these investigations can take years to complete and for some people addicted to opiods, it's time they just don't have. Kratom and it's effects are so benign that it makes no sense to try and regulate something that is not harming anyone. We are a nation of free thinking, capable adults. We should enforce a buying age much like alcohol, and include the \"not fda approved\" stickers on the sale, and go about our business as a country. There are much bigger problems that the DEA and FDA should be spending their time and resources on. Make kratom consumption, like alcohol, the responsibility of the consumer. We cannot and should not regulate every single thing on this earth. It has been a huge failure to tax payers and the medical community to do this to marijuana. Let's not make the same mistake twice. I am including a link to a recent publication that backs up my personal experience with kratom and it's possible medicinal benefits that would be stiffened by a ban. If it is the intentions of the DEA to protect the people from harmful substances, please consider that a ban on kratom would have the opposite effect by forcing many people back on harmful narcotics that are responsible for thousands of deaths a year.    jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2588524","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19171","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is an excellent supplement for pain.

Kratom has been of immense benefit to me, allowing me to live a more active life, and be a more effective wife, mother, and participant in society (specifically as a volunteer in the school system).\n\nKratom has allowed me to quit taking the six medications I was taking to deal with pain, and difficulty sleeping (prescribed by SouthEast Pain Care--a reputable pain clinic here in Charlotte), and replace it with a three-times-a-day glass of  ground-up Kratom leaf mixed with orange juice.  I have been taking Kratom for three years, and my health has improved a great deal now that I am no longer on so many strong, prescription medications.  The labwork from my annual physical has come back looking perfect each time, so I have not personally seen any ill-effects from long-term use of Kratom.\n\nI have stopped taking Kratom twice in the last three years (once when it looked like North Carolina might schedule it, and once when the DEA's emergency scheduling notification was released.)  Both times I wasn't taking it for 4+ weeks in a row.  I was able to quit Kratom \"cold turkey\" with no difficulty.  I had flu-ish feelings for about three days in a row both times, but it was orders of magnitude easier than when I stopped taking the daily Lortab and Soma that my Pain Clinic had me on.  \n\nWhen I stopped taking Kratom out of fear of it being made illegal, I really realized just how helpful and effective it was, and what a negative difference not having it in my life made.  Both times, I found myself in too much pain to participate fully in my family and community.  I really missed the wonderful energy that I feel when using Kratom.  It was so much more difficult to get out and exercise, or play with my children, when I didn't have Kratom to help me deal with the severe fatigue that is a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis.  \n\nIf Kratom is made illegal in any way, I would lose a safe and healthy (in my experience) way to live a full and useful life.  Many people in America live with chronic pain, and taking away their right to use a beneficial plant is inhumane.  I do not want to have to go back to taking prescription opioid pain medication.  I felt much worse when taking it.  I ask you to please, please take the experience of law-abiding citizens like myself, who use Kratom safely every day, into account when making any decisions.  If you schedule Kratom, you will change my life for the worse in a very real, powerful way.\n\nThank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4206","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"L W","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Im a 62 year old male disabled from degenerative disc disease and chronic pain from numerous surgeries.

The Kratom issue is very important to me. I live in Florida and in 2007, Pill Mills started popping up everywhere, no pun intended. Basically doctors were passing them out for a stubbed toe.  Ive had a few injuries in my life, from sports to just being stupid, and got caught up in the mix after my prescriptions would end. I battled with that for a few years and got clean in 2009. I still had pain issues though, in 2012 I stumbled upon kratom. This plant has completely given my life back and i no longer have cravings, nor am in any amounts of serious pain or discomfort. I can work throughout the day, without being bogged down by an opiate. Its a very clear, caffeine like feeling with mood elevation. This year alone, i lost 5 friends due to pills. They may not have all been opiate related, but my 5 friends could have easily gotten the safe, effective, and even beneficial because it has antioxidants, relief they were looking for. Please take some more time and learn about Kratom. The deaths that have been supposedly reported on, that kratom was invovled with, all involve other MAJOR DOCTOR PRESCRIBED medications, mainly antidepressants. Kratom has helped me Tremendously to continue being a productive, tax paying memeber of this Great Country. I feel many others can bemefit from this plant and will be able to start giving back to their communities as opposed to being a burden, or worse, non-existant. Thanks again for reading.

I find it disturbing enough that the DEA continues to classify Marijuana as Schedule 1 thereby promoting their ignorance (really, flat-out lying to the public) about its medicinal properties -- even though there is an abundance of scientific and anecdotal proof that shows otherwise. I do NOT want any of my PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION DETAILS MADE PUBLIC.\n\nNow the DEA wants to misinform the public about Kratom, stealing from us yet again,  a safe, natural medicinal plant. Right in the middle of the much-hyped epidemic of abuse and death from legal opiods. I have personally experienced the wide-ranging, positive medicinal effects of Kratom (and marijuana). I have a slew of health problems, including chronic and severe full-body pain from Anklyosing Spondylitis and Fibromyalgia; migraines; chronic fatigue; ADD; Major Depressive Disorder; anxiety; bouts of insomnia; and TMJ, among other issues. I am in pain Every. Single. Day. I've been prescribed a plethora of Big Pharma medications, including - but not limited to - an array of anti-depressants, biologics (TNF-blockers), and painkillers. I self-weaned from 20mg morphine sulfate & 60 mg hydrocodone/day to no opiates. The painkillers helped a bit, but over the years, I became dependent - NOT ADDICTED - and had to increase dosages until I realized that there was a real potential for addiction. And I know the horrors of addiction - my younger brother was an addict for years. He's no longer addicted to opiates. He's dead. \n\nKratom's analgesic properties have helped immensely with my physical pain. I'm not saying my pain has been eliminated; just greatly reduced. Other medicinal properties of this plant that I've experienced are decreased anxiety, decreased symptoms of depression, increased focus, increased motivation.... Again, I'm not proclaiming Kratom as a panacea or that it's cured my various diseases and disorders --- but it has helped me in many ways, as has marijuana, and I'm a nascent Kratom user. \n\nPlease, please do not ban/outlaw/control this incredible plant. Please do not deprive the millions of Americans from having the option to use a natural resource to manage their various forms and levels of pain. Yes, I know opiates are *derived* from the poppy plant, but Kratom is used in its pure, original form. There is no evidence of abuse or addiction or deaths from correctly using Kratom.

This product has helped me immensely with my issue of a compromised immune system/disorder.  I have been diagnosed and lived with Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome for many years and Kratom has been a life saver for me.  I have finally found something to enable me to function to some degree.  I do not like or tolerate pain medication and it really doesn't work for this type of skeletal muscular discomfort that I experience.  Kratom is not long lasting nor does it make me feel \"high\".  When it wears off I have no craving for more.  I do not have any kind of hangover or withdrawal from Kratom.  It simply allows me to get out of bed and function enough to perform most of my ADL's (activities of daily living).  With CFIDS it is difficult to get medical attention or acknowledgement that it actually exists nevermind any kind of treatment.  I also struggle with depression/anxiety over the fact that I can't function in life.  Kratom has given me hope that I might have some sort of life. I have not been able to work for many years but am actually trying and Kratom is helping.  I have been trying to receive SSDI for 3 years to no avail yet.  I had to sell my home/car and buy something less so I have money to live on. PLEASE...don't take away my only hope of earning a living.\n\nAs far as the possibility of a public abuse hazard, I believe we have many many products that are public abuse hazards that are perfectly legal including food!  I also have not heard of any problems with Kratom ALONE in the body causing death or public hazard.  Those I have heard of are from concerned and justified parents whose children have had multiple substance abuse problems. Losing a child is more than tragic, but Kratom is not the cause....sorry.\n\nThank you for your sincere consideration of this matter and I pray that you will receive and understand accurate information.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5647","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Self","postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lisa Miller","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm not a user of kratom, but I have been able to watch my boyfriend move beyond being barely functional because of pain from an old spinal injury - he had to drop out of college and couldn't work it was so severe.

It appears the information you have is very outdated or may or may not be actually about the use of kratom.  Some of what is mentioned in the letter of intent looks like it came from the Thailand government in the 1940's when they outlawed kratom due to their financial loss when people would consume kratom as an alternative to or to help with quitting opium.  It also looks as though the side effects listed are not from kratom but likely from products that may have contained kratom along with synthetic opioids. Hallucinations and delusions are definitely not something that happens from consuming it. \n\nI have been using kratom in my daily routines for close to a decade for its relaxing and stimulating effects. I am an IT professional that has worked in the same field for 17 years.   Kratom does not even come close to the stimulant effects of caffeine but I would say that is more consistent in those effects helping one to stay awake and focused.  As far as it being relaxing it is probably less sedating than an antihistamine.  I see it as something that can help calm a mind down and allow someone to relax naturally and be able to fall asleep a bit more easily. \nAt least allow more time and research before making this a final decision.

I don't like the way coffee makes me feel Very much and when I heard that Kratom was related to coffee, not illegal, and won't get you \"screwed up\" I decided to try it. Admittedly the first time I tried it I ignored a warning not to take more than 2 grams. 10 minutes after I got naucious and threw up, however since then I have been using Kratom for about 2 years. These are the things I have noticed from my personal experience.\n\n1. It is similar to coffee but not as harsh on my body.\n2. When the ban was coming I stopped drinking Kratom with no adverse side effects after nearly 2 years of daily use.\n3. Overdose while possible starts with vomiting which was different to me than taking too many multivitamins, I experienced no other negative symptoms.\n4. I have never experienced \"coming down\" or withdrawal sideeffects like I have with alcohol (hangover) or even coffee (fatigue sluggishness etc)\n5. though not an alcoholic my desire to drink ANY alcohol diminished significantly over the course of two years.

My family is everything to me.  I make a modest living as a pipe welder, manufacturing machinery, big and small.  Three years ago, The pain started.  First in my knuckles, and moving to my hands, I did everything I could to push through the pain.  The sole provider for my family, I kept working for months in unbearable hand pain.  My welds suffered greatly.  My supervisors warned me of my work quality in greater urgency, until the pain made it to my shoulders.  At my worst point, I couldn't even hold the tools of my trade.  The tools that defined ME.  \n\nI was told to visit a pain specialist and in the end, I was too weak to fight any longer.  I just wanted the ability to function.  To hold my daughter.  I made it through 8 different medications, most narcotic pain killers, with little effect.  Nothing worked.  It was only after thousands of dollars in medical bills, money I wasn't making, and a life without sleep, that I found Kratom from a new friend.  From the first time I tried Kratom, until today, I have found relief!  I cried the first day.  My life had returned to me.  I was able to work again.  I was able to swing my daughter in the park.  I was alive again.  It has been two of the best years of my life as a productive worker, -an active member of society, and a father.  \n\nPlease consider the potential RUIN a ban could affect on so many people like myself.  I would love to see more information about Kratom by reputable scientists.  How is it that this plant works for me when any number of toxic, narcotic, side-effect ridden pharmaceuticals could not?  The community as a whole is behind research.  Please rethink the mentality of scheduling Kratom as an illegal drug.  This is an herbal supplement.  \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this account of a humble blue collar American.  Please be there for me and those like me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11810","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep this legal, too many benefits to turn a blind eye.

I say this because I have witnessed prohibition or lack of access drive addicts to extreme measures. I have also seen Kratom used to help people get off of and stay off of heroin and opioids. The connection between my observations is that the removal of Kratom will not remove the use of substances from peoples lives and will likely cause an increase in use of opioids and heroin. \n\nTo be brief and to the point, Kratom has been of benefit to at least six people I have counseled as a Pastor. They have expressed their fear of its criminalization and I can state with confidence that such criminalization would severely harm their lives and the wider community. As a citizen it is my responsibility to advocate for policy that makes is best for society. The proposed ban is not best for society.

I have been on prescription opiates for several years. I take them daily for back pain. We have a considerable epidemic of opiate addiction and subsequent overdoses in this country. Kratom has the effect of alleviating my symptoms as well as withdrawal symptom from reducing the use of the opiates. \n\nThis is not a get high substance. This is real world results that are far more beneficial than leaving me hooked on deadly narcotics. This has the ability to allow me to be relatively pain free without narcotics. I cannot imagine what the downside of this could be except to bend to the will of big pharmaceutical companies that do not control this. I am not some libertarian that believes there should be no control over what we are allowed to put in our bodies but there is considerable subjective if not completely empirical evidence that this substance has considerable beneficial results for a large number of people. There is also very little evidence of negative effects with regards to its continued use and legal status. \n\nBy adding this substance to the controlled substance list you will be condemning people back to the slavery of opiate addiction. That is how it feels. I have to every 3 months go to my doctor and prove I am still in need of my medicine. Living in fear he will change his heart to my condition and try to make me stop the opiates which would have the effect of confining me to my home, unable to be productive and take care of my family. This substance allows me to be in control of my symptoms and not have to grovel for my fix from the man every 3 months. Give me the liberty to determine how to treat my own condition myself with dignity. \n\nSincerely,\n\nRobert Lafler","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22625","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Lafler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was diagnosed in May 2016 with hyperthyroidism. My immediate research pointed out I created a weakness in my auto-immune system. I had none of the problems research offers about my condition. It was only a few weeks when I began to notice one of the problems, fatigue. I continued to research and soon found a new source of information. I changed my life style once more and found my fatigue became more pronounced. I was unable to focus at work where I was involved in sales administration. I began experiencing headaches. \n\nI now understand that as I began to detoxify chemicals, metals, mold and other issues my cleaner body was suffering of new product poisoning. The work place was full of the poisons which I was cleaning up. It was the re-poisoning which caused the symptoms of fatigue and pain. It was at this time I was introduced to Kratom. I introduced it at very low levels. My energy level allowed me to work through the day without falling asleep and my painful headaches disappeared.\n\nSince that time my wife introduced Kratom into her diet and debilitating pain has disappeared. \n\nI now understand that Kratom, a natural product from our earth, affects the same receptors which opiates affect. The biggest difference it does so without addiction. \n\nI can only surmise those who openly criticize the use of Kratom must have a financial agenda for doing so for calling it addictive can simply not be backed up with science. The critics who openly site it as a product which kills, or has been over used by some, only need to research the abuse of drinking water which has killed and its overuse is backed up by science as being debilitating to the body. \n\nI consider Kratom to be as natural as water and cannot endorse or understand endorsement of laws or rules limiting its use by humans, other than to simply teach 1) How affective it is for pain control and overall comfort control by those who suffer from fatigue or anxiety and 2) Overuse can be detrimental just like over user of water, alcohol, eating food or just about anything that can be introduced into the human body.\n\nI have quit the job, which was re-poisoning me to work in health care and am witness to cancer patients, those with diabetes, others tied to wheel chairs, some who are described as 'walking dead' whose auto immune system has become so jeopardized they are almost incoherent to society. I have witnessed Krater's use by these individuals who have a better quality of life and health and without addiction. I can also add I witness the same from those who have been addicted to prescription drugs, some for as long as 30 years.\n\nThank you for your interest in my observations of the use of Kratom by humans and for your interest in allowing its natural truth to help those in need of it natural properties.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCharles R.

I started taking Kratom for pain relief when I had a herniated L5-S1 spinal disc causing extreme sciatica in my right leg in January 2016. I was prescribed Percocet and Valium while I was in physical therapy, and while I would take the Percocet for episodes of extreme pain, the Percocet would sometimes make me a bit spacey, for lack of a better term. I found that what worked best for me was a daily dose of 1 teaspoon Kratom powder with 220 mg of naproxen sodium. This provided enough pain relief without any noticeable mental effects that I was able to get back to work while recovering, and after 4 months, my recovery had progressed to the point that I no longer felt the Kratom was necessary, and I was able to stop taking it without any noticeable side effects. I still have the occasional episode of painful back spasms, but when that happens, I know that the Kratom/naproxen mixture makes the pain tolerable enough for me to do the physical therapy stretches and exercises. The only negative experience I've had with Kratom was one time when I took 2 teaspoons of powder, and all that did was make me nauseous and light-headed. Had Kratom not been available to me, I would have taken quite a bit more Percocet. Whether I would have become addicted to it, I can't say, but I can say that my Percocet usage never became heavy because I was able to take Kratom instead.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1718","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Damian Hopper","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to submit this comment against the DEA's proposed ban on kratom for the following reasons:\n\n1) Banning kratom expands the unsuccessful, destructive \"war on drugs,\" while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\n2) If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\n3) Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n4) Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n5) Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n6) Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14176","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Moritz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, \nI have used Kratom for three years.

Kratom has personally offered me relief of many mental conditions, without addiction. Pure and simple. I have my wife and family back. I work as a very successful home improvement rep for a contractor in DFW. My life has turned around, in part, because of Kratom. Don't misunderstand me when I say  that I had to make some other changes in my life, because I did. However, a small daily dosage of Kratom has slowly healed my anxiety, while making my necessary occupational production more manageable. Please study this plant and don't immediately dismiss it as an addictive harmful mind-altering substance, when it is not.

Before I delve into a bit of anecdotal evidence about what the plant has done for me, allow me to give a bit of background about myself.\n\n  I am a software developer and pharmacology student who has and still does suffer from numerous mental and physical conditions. As a result of a sports injury, I have chronic shoulder pain. In addition, I also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Autism. In my field, communication with others is integral to your success as a team, and as a business.\n\n  Originally, I attempted supplementing caffeine to ease the trouble of my mental disorders, and to increase my productivity at work. (I found that my pain was not bad enough to warrant strong opiates at this time). Caffeine worked pretty well, although it came with some negative side effects. It would overstimulate me, in both a mental and physical sense. It was bad for my blood pressure, and it raised my resting heartrate to nearly 100BPM after continuous use. \n\n  Over time, I became physically addicted to caffeine, choosing to go through the caffeine withdrawal. Having used various substances throughout my life, I will tell you that this withdrawal was far-and-away the most painful, agonizing drug-induced dysphoria of my life. So, I let my conditions go untreated, which effected my personal and professional relationships negatively.\n \n  A while after this, I discovered kratom. Skeptical at first, as kratom itself is physically and mentally addictive (as it has light action on the mu-opiod receptor), I proceeded with trepidation. However, I found it to be a harmless enough substance to supplement daily. After a few months of use, my anxiety was nearly nonexistent, I had the energy to complete my work day and be available after work, and it was even helping my pain!\n\n  I knowingly chose to become addicted to this supplement, as it was helping my life in such a dramatically positive way. This led to one of the most fruitful and stress-free periods in my life. Years later, I still choose to remain on this substance rather than seeking out scheduled chemicals. Besides minor constipation, I have not noted any negative mental or physical side effects. 200mg of Magnesium Citrate daily alleviates this. My physicals with my doctor have even been better than the period of my life where I was abusing caffeine. On top of all of this, the withdrawal from kratom only causes insomnia for me - not horrible headaches, crying fits, and anxiety like caffeine caused me.\n\n  I urge whomever may read this: let people like me have an option. Give us the freedom to better our lives rather than banning yet another innocuous herb. Alternatively, I may urge you to ban the Coffee bean, Yerba Mate, or Cola to remain consistent in your legislation. Caffeine, a chemical that over half of Americans remain dependent on, does more harm and less good than this plant that you are proposing to ban.\n\n  I appreciate the time you have invested in considering my comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8389","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nate P","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15142","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Corey Schade","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement\nkratom.

I am a well adjusted, productive member of society.  I was born with some congenital defects in the bone structure of both feet.  I also suffer from mild depression.  The foot issues never really held me back until I reached puberty & grew quickly and these defects started to cause unimaginable pain.  I grew up to be nearly 6'5\" and in my early 20's I underwent a grueling series of reconstructive surgeries on the bones & tendons of both feet.  My doctors had always been fairly liberal with hydrocodone & tramadol prescriptions.  In my mid 20s, I realized I had become highly addicted to opioid pain medication.  It was either be in terrible pain, or be in slightly less pain in a fog of dangerous doctor-prescribed painkillers.  As much as my body told me I needed pain meds, they still didn't begin to touch the level of pain I was in.  I managed to limit myself to tramadol & asked my doctors to prescribe less.  Still, up until 2 years ago, I was still taking tramadol daily.  Tramadol is not the 'less addictive' med that it claims to be.  The stuff is terribly addictive and comes with a host of unpleasant side effects.  A friend who is knowledgeable about holistic medicine suggested I try kratom.  Thanks to kratom, I've been 100% free of pain medication for over 2 years.   Daily, responsible kratom use freed me from antidepressants as well. I believe that limiting kratom access to adults would be irresponsible and dangerous.  Our country faces a ridiculously tragic epidemic of RX drug abuse & dependence.  I know people who have died from taking too much Oxycontin because of unbearable pain from serious illness, which was legitimately prescribed by their doctor.  In the face of a well-documented RX drug epidemic, banning a simple tree leaf (related to coffee) would be absolute madness.   I am 39 and am employed full time at a very physical job.  Kratom has benefitted my body and mind.  I am able to get up in the morning without using a cane or holding onto the walls to walk to the shower.  I wake up rested & my pain is less than 50% of what it was when I was still taking tramadol.  \nKratom DOES NOT make a person high.  Good, unadulterated kratom from reputable retailers has a subtle mood boosting quality & noticeable pain relief effects.  In 2014, before I started using kratom, I was taking no less than SEVEN doctor prescribed medications.  Now in 2016, I take heartburn medicine & the occasional aspirin when my pain becomes more severe or work is especially tough.  I am one of thousands (if not more) responsible adults who have chosen to make kratom a part of my daily life.  I have never been high on kratom, no matter how much I have consumed, I have never experienced a single negative or unpleasant side effect from consuming kratom.  I always tell people that good kratom feels like taking a few aspirin and drinking some strong green tea.  The DEA has made a very good decision in not pursuing the emergency ban.  Because in regard to kratom, there simply is no emergency.   How many calls to poison control are caused by energy drinks? Alcohol?  How many lives are shattered by Rx drug use & abuse?  How many emergency hospital visits are a direct result of side effects or overdose of prescribed medications?  The statistics do not lie.  I am so very thankful to the US DEA for listening to the American Kratom Association, and pain patients like myself.  Kratom is a safe, unprecedented natural medicine that is very safe in its natural, unadulterated form.  I don't know what I would do if my access to kratom was taken from me by way of a poorly researched ban. I do know that many kratom users suffer far worse than I do, & if banned, many people might turn to either prescription narcotics or other illegal drugs.  I also believe if kratom were banned, the suicide rate of many pain patients would rise.  My pain is manageable, but there are many folks who are worse off than myself, physically and mentally.\nIf we as a nation were to ban mitragyna speciosa, then we should ban alcohol, cigarettes, e cigarettes, energy drinks, coffee and cough syrup. These things all do far more damage to families and individuals than mitragyna speciosa, or kratom.  It gives me hope in our country's government to see than the men & women of the DEA have listened to stories like mine and taken the time to research the benefits of kratom, before going through with a ban that I believe to be dangerous, irresponsible and against the freedom of choice we hold so dear in our great nation.\nThank you so much for your time.\n-Aaron R.

I can go to any gas station & buy cigarettes, which have literally killed millions. I can go to any almost any grocery store & buy alcohol- which, like cigarettes, have killed millions either directly or through the reckless inebriation of other people. Yet it is being suggested that kratom- a plant that's been safely used in other countries for ages- is just so dangerous that adults shouldn't have the option to choose whether or not they use it. Kratom has been the cause of NO deaths, when taken alone. Hundreds of thousands of people (medical staff, military veterans, police officers, recovering addicts, professionals, etc) have spoken out loudly to make sure people know how much kratom has helped them or the people they know & love. \nSo to recap- \nCigarettes: kill millions, no known positive effects- legal for age 18+\nAlcohol: kill millions, no known positive effects- legal for age 21+\nKratom: kills no one, positive effects include increased energy, positive mood, helps insomnia, decreased anxiety & depression, effective for pain management, has helped thousands of people get off or avoid opiates- may stop being accessible. \nIt just doesn't make any sense!

I'm a 43 yr old Journalist.  I've been following and researching kratom for 2 yrs.  Based on my journalistic research and personal experience I think banning kratom would be a huge mistake.  Kratom has been helping people live a better quality of life through a very safe herbal supplement.  Restricting the people's access would be a violation of civil liberties and is nothing more than political grandstanding by the DEA.  With little evidence to support claims of kratom being an \"imminent threat\"  the DEA and Chuck Rosenburg push forward their agenda in order to look tough.  Kratom is not part of the problem it is part of the solution. \n\nI started using Kratom 2-3 years ago to help me sleep.  Every night of my life I would toss, turn in bed getting not enough sleep. I could not even be comfortable enough to sit on the sofa and watch a movie with my wife.  Please imagine how these things would affect any person's desire for a normal life.  This went on for nearly 15 years.  I came to try kratom by purchasing it over the counter (OTC) at a local nutrition store.  It had a very profound effect on me.  I was able to sleep much better, improved interpersonal skills with my spouse and I returned to being a fully function and contributing member of society.  I just put 1 teaspoon in a cup of cocoa at night while sitting on the sofa and watching tv with my wife. \n\nI urge you to keep kratom available OTC so Americans can express their freedom to choose.  \n\nThis letter from the CRE to the DEA touches on more persuasive scientific and legal reason why scheduling kratom is not in our best interest.

It's side effects are virtually non-existent compared to opioids. I don't feel impaired when I take it and the only negative side effect I've personally experienced is constipation, which is laughable compared to the side effects of many pharmaceutical drugs. Adding kratom to any of the five drug schedules would do nothing but make criminals out of normal human beings looking for a healthy way to relieve pain or anxiety. Studies have already shown kratom's analgesic and anti-anxiety benefits to be true, but more research is still needed and making kratom illegal would make that research hard if not impossible to do. I would not at all be against keeping kratom legal and regulating it like tobacco and alcohol to ensure quality control. But criminalizing normal people looking for alternatives to opioids would do nothing but expand this country's failed war on drugs, which has cost us untold billions and is opposed by the vast majority of American citizens.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20243","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adam K","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a nurse who has had-patients who take this supplement after knee and hip surgery these patients refused prescribed pain management \nI now take it from time to time for knee pain","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11740","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Charles Raska","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom ended my battle of being born an addict.

I can perform better professionally and socially, plus I have more energy from sleeping regularly and longer, which in turn has decreased my depressive states as well.

I am HIGHLY against using any sort of addictive pain pill, considering I have family members who have had serious addictions. I think Kratom needs more research to be done, people with chronic pain should not have to resort into opioids as a solutions. Opioids are very dangerous and they are dividing families all across the Nation. Kratom does not seem as dangerous and could be very benificial for people who are struggling with pain each and every day.

His journey through addiction, graduating to heroin and overdosing multiple times would have almost certainly killed him if it were not for Kratom.  After another near fatal overdose, he was desperate to get clean and his friends and family had been scared to find this wonderful person dead one day.  It was a very scary time for us.  Through research, he found hundreds of threads online of people getting clean from opioids through Kratom substitution.  After about six months of using Kratom to ween himself off of heroin, he is now completely substance free and the happiest he has been in years.  I should also mention that he does not even use/need the Kratom anymore.  His ambition has skyrocketed since finding Kratom and turning his life around.  He is now making a good living on his own and is very grateful to be alive.  \n\nFrom the research I have done myself as a cautious individual, I cannot find absolutely any justification to take this away from people and let them just continue dying.  The active ingredient itself (Mytragynine) does not actually attach itself to the opioid receptors, but only stimulates them and floats around.  As for the legal opioids, they drill themselves into opioid receptors like a screw and require extreme difficulty to quit taking.  \n\nPlease do not make the literal fatal mistake of taking this away from people, just so big pharma can go and make it addictive and expensive.  Clearly, there are already Pharma Companies trying to take advantage of this for money and have no concern for the welfare of the general public.  \n\nI trust you will make the correct decision.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13359","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Williams Williams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has made my life so much easier.

I have finally found something that is natural, affordable and not a big pharma product. Here is some of my history as a chronic pain sufferer. I was an active person, running marathons and enjoying all outdoor sports. One day in 2002, I happened to lean over to pick something up and hurt my back. After many months, tests and diagnosed with degenative disc disease and was finally scheduled for my first back surgery. I had some pain relief for a year.  The pain returned worse then previous, 24/7. All types of medications were tried by my dr. Steroid injections were also tried along with epileptic drugs, antidepressants, pain meds with no relief. I had given up of any kind of \"life\". Could only work part time, used all sick and vacation time to supplement my pay. Elected for a more evasive back surgery with fusion of L5/S1 in 2007. Titanium rods, cage and screws. No guarantee of success. I was lucky. I was excited for a new, no pain/ reduced pain type of life and tried to resume a \"normal\" life. After a couple of months I started to have fatigue, all over tenderness, migraines, foggy brain and a long list of other ailments. Now dr appts were more frequent. As a runner I was on no medication. Dr continue to treat me with multiple meds without relief. Increasing pain meds. In June of 2009, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndrome. In addition I was diagnosed with disc disease in my neck C5-C7 and upper back T4-T7 since. My life has never been the same. I have exhausted all sick and vacation time. Have not taken a vacation since. I have not pulled a full Paycheck in over 4 1/2 yrs.  My previous long time dr prescribed Oxycontin, Percocet, valium, etc together. These did not work either. I thought even to get a medical card for Marijuana but never liked it or feeling \"high\". I have since changed drs and have gotten off all these drugs. I have tried chiropractic, Bowen, meditation, physical therapy, Reiki, acupuncture, essential oils, over counter pain creams and lots of Tylenol, to name just a few. I can't take Aleve or naproxen due to stomach issues.  I don't get much sleep, I am in pain constantly, I am no longer social and don't accept invitations to functions anymore for fear of disappointing friends/family when I hurt to much to attend and have to cancel. Chores don't get done after work or on weekends due to being exhausted with fighting pain all day with horrific migraines. Recently, I have started to be able to walk the dog after work, go grocery shopping, make it through work with a smile throughout the day due to a friend that also has chronic illness' and had a friend that suggested a herb called Kratom. Did some research and thought to give it a try, couldn't hurt was my thought. Now that I have found this change to my life, I find that this maybe taken away. Again, having the rug pulled out from underneath me. I am 57 years old now. Will still need to work many more years.  I have lived in pain and a hell that only some can understand or have empathy. I want continued increased better health instead of going on disability will limited income. I want to be able to enjoy and play with my granddaughter who will be born in April 2017.

Watson. I am 29 years old and I am a Paramedic in a rural community in Northern New York State. During my EMS career I have seen many overdoses from heroin and prescription opiates. This is not a problem limited to urban areas. In a community with more cows than people we still see these cases weekly. \n\nFrom hearing different people in my community and through social media, I have learned that Kratom may be beneficial to those with opiate addictions. All too often our \"frequent fliers\" go away to rehab only to relapse again. If Kratom can help these people then I believe and opportunity for more research should be taken, and the Scheduling of Kratom should be held off until there are more studies about the helpful and possible harmful effects of this plant. \n\nI am opposed to the Scheduling of this plant and its alkaloids at this time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18438","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Watson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am commenting on the Kratom ban as I believe banning such a substance will do little to curb it's use and just create an endless prosecution of those who have safely used the substance for years. As we claim to live in \"the land of the free\" why does the government (aka the people of this country) feel the need to regulate substances and tell others what they can or cannot do with their bodies by using criminal laws to do so. If we truly are \"the land of the free\", why don't we own up to that motto and allow people to take personally responsibility for the decisions they make and the drugs and substances they chose to put into their own bodies. I personally feel that the government nor anyone else should try to stop someone from using or abusing a substance through the use of laws and the criminal justice system. Drug abuse is an issue of education and public health and making someone a criminal in an attempt to stop them from committing a nonviolent crime that hurts no one but themselves does nothing but: 1. waist taxpayer money 2. waste law enforcement resources that can be put to better use (IE. solving murders, rapes, and other violent crimes) and 3. ruins the person's life by adding a misdemeanor or felony to their record thus making them unemployable. \n\nAfter a person has a criminal record, their life continues a hopeless downward spiral and then perpetuates further drug use because they can no longer find decent employment and feel more hopeless thus pushing them to give up and move back to drugs. Drug abuse will never be controlled nor contained by using our brave men and women in our law enforcement agencies to try and stop the impossible. Just as prostitution is morally wrong in the views of many people including myself, I don't have any thought or hope that making it illegal and trying to arrest the problem away will have even a sliver of success. The same holds true for drugs and drug abuse. All we are doing is ruining people's lives further by turning them into criminals for what should be considered a disease treated through the heath care and rehabilitation systems. \n\nAs I have tremendous respect for the men and women of law enforcement, I ask that these brave people be allowed to focus on violent crimes that require brilliant minds to solve and help victims desperately in need of their help. By focusing so much effort to try and eradicate a problem that simply will never be solved, we are taking away resources from solving violent crimes and giving victims of violent crimes the closure they seek. Those who use and/or abuse drugs make a conscious choice that only effects themselves and can decide to stop and seek help when they are ready to do so. Until then, turning these people into criminals further pushes them into the shadows and isolates them from society as \"criminals\" who are not worthy of being helped or rehabilitated. Let's all agree that criminalizing nonviolent behaviors will never solve drug abuse issues just as it has never solved prostitution as long as humans have walked on the earth. \n\nThere are countries such as Portugal who have decriminalized drug use and have had tremendous success as a result. Drug abuse has gone down while current addicts have stepped out of the shadows to seek help since they are no longer \"criminals\". When you crack down on one particular drug, another just takes it's place. I compare it to the game whack a mole. I ask that the government please stop banning substances and allow Americans to make their own free choices even if they are bad for the person as making a substance illegal has done nothing but further damage the person and their situation. Let's make people accountable for their own actions which in turn will drive them to seek help on their own when they need it rather than hiding from the law and working a menial job for the rest of their lives because they have obtained a criminal record as a result of a sickness. \n\nI am all for prosecuting those who commit violent crimes against others and give our brave men and women the time and focus to help victims of such crimes.  Let's stop trying to wage war on behaviors that do nothing but hurt the individual who choses to engage in them and help that person when he or she decides to seek help. Let's also not brand them for the rest of their lives with a scarlet letter in the form of a criminal record so employers forever reject such a person at a time when they need a job and reason to move on. I ask that you please - no I beg - that you please do not make Kratom illegal and consider decriminalizing all other drugs so we can take power away from the illegal cartels and drug dealers and give those with a sickness the opportunity to come out of the shadows and seek the help they need. \n\nLet's please truly make this the \"home of the free\" and give individuals the freedom to make their own choices good or bad as long as it doesn't hurt another person.

First off, eight years ago I became dependent on opiates when a doctor couldn't treat my back pain.  She  took the easy road out by prescribing me countless Percocets.  After a few months I was so dependent that I couldn't work or go about my life without pain pills.  This led me to going to a suboxone clinic.  For 6 long years I took that hell of a drug just to maintain my life.  Again, if I didn't have it, I couldn't function.  I wanted a way out so badly, but these legal drug dealers (doctors) gave me no alternative treatments.  Finally, a neighbor of mine recommended I try Kratom.  He gave me a small bit to try... 20 minutes later I flushed all remaining suboxones that I had down the toilet.  It got me clean for the first time in 8 years.  I have a new lease on life and I'm finally  the person I've been wanting to be.  \nI have 5 friends since then that became clean once trying Kratom.  All legal suboxone dependents.  If you're going to consider banning a substance, YOU SHOULD BAN SUBOXONE, because it is so harmful.  It ruins lives and doctors won't change because it makes them money.  Please keep Kratom safe and legal so it can continue to help heal people!  It's my godsend!  \n\nSincerely, ALM","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17799","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe the ban on kratom is unfounded and illegitimately being pursued.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15296","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Mcevoy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please leave kratom alone and do not schedule it.  Many of us rely on this wonderful plant.  I was injured in a domestic violence incident that left me with a broken spine.  The surgery to fix it failed and left me with an incurable and incredibly painful condition known as arachnoiditis,  and set off fibromyalgia too.  Now I also have arthritis and hypothyroidism.  I don't have insurance.  Prescription pain medications are very expensive these days and only getting more expensive every year.  I cannot walk without my meds but I also cannot afford the meds that I was on before I had to stop working.  Kratom greatly helps my daily functionality and let's me use less medication.  I have small grandchildren to raise and a small business to run from home.  I absolutely have to be able to walk and semi-function.  Kratom helps me do that and I wouldn't be able to without it.  It's just one of the many tools I use in my chronic pain toolbox but every tool has it's purpose.  If we lose kratom I lose my ability to walk without a cane.  I'm only 44, not 84. My condition will only continue to progress and get worse.  I may eventually be in a wheelchair.  Let me walk now while I can.  Kratom is not hurting anyone.  It's HELPING!!  Taking this away from those of us who need it would be cruel.  Nature gave it to us to use if needed.  Let us use it.  It's been safely used for centuries in countries like Indonesia and their economy also relies on it. I've seen thousands of people change their lives for the better thanks to kratom.  This is a gift!  It's helping people get away from addictive substances.  Our country has an addiction crisis and unfortunately chronic pain patients are paying the intimate price now and being left with no medication they legitimately need.  Kratom helps the addicts AND the chronic pain community.  Leave it alone.  This country needs it more now than ever.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6299","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tammy Alender","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Im a 46 year old healthy male who suffers from anxiety, social anxiety and depression.

Most people who use kratom are not teenage thrill seekers but they are like myself.  I am a sixty year old audio professional and sound designer who works for Lincoln Center, New York City Opera and many other well know organizations.  I have been using plain leaf kratom very successfully for the passed eight years to control my depression and anxiety issues.  My doctors have had me on Lexapro, Paxil, Wellbutrin and several other ADs but none of them have the positive effect that kratom has had for me and without the nasty side effects attributed to those ADs.  I was introduced to kratom by by efforts to get off of the opioid pain killers that I had become addicted to after surgery.  Kratom helped me ween off off the hydrocodone and retake my life.  When I stopped the kratom use, the depression and anxiety that I had experienced before returned, so I started using kratom again and I have been a far more productive member of society and a better father and husband that I was without it!.  I do appreciate that extracts of kratom can be used in nasty head-shop formulas, but it is very short sighted to ban the entire plant and lose all the benefits that responsible users have gained due to this small number of miscreants.  We do not ban the cocoa plant and all its products because it is the source of crack cocaine.  We must have a similar approach to Kratom so that we do not screw responsible users with serious pain management needs due to a small number of irresponsible idiots!\n\nFurthermore, kratom is essential in helping this country get grips on the Opioid crisis we are in.  To ban kratom and take this away from opioid addicts who are trying to reagin control of their lives is short sighted and irresponsible.  \n\nPLEASE, for the sake of the health of our nation, DO NOT make kratom a Schedule One substance.

I don't have chronic pain, PTSD, debilitating anxiety, alcoholism, or any other condition that is remedied by the use of kratom. If kratom is made illegal, I won't be forced to take street drugs or dangerous pharmaceuticals or slide into a life of manic depressive, alcoholic decline. My life won't be ruined if the DEA oversteps its bounds and makes this benign botanical illegal. I suppose I should feel lucky in that regard.\n\nI merely take kratom the way I take coffee (a close relative of kratom), Red Bull, or a fifteen-minute power nap -- as a relatively mild way to boost my energy and make it through my busy day of being a full-time husband, father, financial analyst, freelance writer, and law-abiding citizen. \n\nI've been taking kratom in moderation for three years and have never experienced anything remotely close to a \"high.\" Had I taken kratom expecting a legal high, I would have been sorely disappointed. In my experience, kratom doesn't get you any \"higher\" than a Starbucks latte. \n\nCompared to the thousands of Americans whose lives have been saved by kratom, I don't  really have a horse in the race, so to speak. The absence of kratom would have minimal impact on my life. The real reason I'm commenting on this issue is to echo what tens of thousands of citizens and dozens of elected Congressional officials have already told you: you are overreaching your grasp by waging war against this nontoxic tree.

I am a responsible adult that has worked as an assistant manager at a restaurant for several years.I just wanted to take a few minutes to express my firm belief that Kratom should not be placed in any sort of drug schedule. This supplement has been safely used by millions of Americans for many years, not to mention for millennia across the globe. It is primarily used an an herbal tea that can provide energy, minor pain relief, and general mood enhancement. It is a plant relative of coffee, and is extremely similar to the way it affects humans. There have been no recorded deaths solely from the herb itself, and besides that, millions of people die each year from tobacco, alcohol, and prescription drugs, so in comparison to safety and legality, there should be no question that it doesn't belong in the same category as illegal narcotics, because if that was the case, alcohol and tobacco should be immediately placed into schedule 1 classification. Kratom is not used to cure any sort of disability, it is merely used as a supplement similar to Coffee, St. Johns Wort, Guarana, Yerba Mate, Ginseng, and many others. There is absolutely no \"public health hazard\". I myself drink the tea occasionally for an energy boost with my coffee in the morning as a pick me up, and have never felt any sort negative effects, or \"high\" with it. I occasionally drink alcohol, and dont take any illegal drugs, and I feel that it is an abomination to potentially incriminate me over something that is so ridiculously minuscule compared to the real drug problems America is facing right now. I also feel that banning this could have a substantial effect on the black market drug trade, Kratom is fully legal and available in our neighboring countries; Canada, and Mexico, which would make America a prime target for an herb that is high in demand, thus taking precious time away from law enforcement to engage in more serious crime.

Banning Kratom would not benefit anyone, it would only hurt hundreds of thousands of people in the United States whom rely on Kratom for one reason or another. It would also send many of those same people into a downward spiral in which they seek out actual drugs which are, and should be, illegal. It would also send many others (like myself) back to the doctor in order to find relief from opiate based medications, which nearly destroyed my life. Banning Kratom is only going to worsen the problems that our beloved country is facing with narcotics, and I fully believe that Kratom could actually benefit that problem by giving people a safe alternative.\n\nI started using Kratom 7 years ago to relieve severe pain I was suffering due to Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and a bad back, both of which I got working for UPS in my early twenties, and a back injury which I received while enrolled in the Oregon Youth National Guard Challenge Program in Bend, Oregon as a teenager.\n\nTaking Kratom has helped me remain active, work a full time job, be a full time father to my kids, and also go to school at nights full time. Without Kratom, I wouldn't have the energy or will to be able to do all of those things, and I might not even be able to work due to the pain I suffer from. Kratom is a relative of the Coffee Plant, and taking a dose of Kratom is much like drinking a really strong cup of Coffee. I have taken, and been dependent, on hard prescription painkillers before --- Oxycodone, Morphine, Vicodin, all of those things my doctor pushed on me when I was younger because there was no other alternative and Marijuana was illegal in my state at the time. Even though Marijuana is no longer illegal in the State of Oregon or Washington, I do not take it because I hate the way it makes me all doped up and slow. I cannot afford to be high in my line of work, or as a father and student. Kratom allows me energy and pain relief without the intoxicating effects of other drugs, and I am fully in control and competent when I take it.\n\nAnyone who has taken Kratom can attest to these statements, and it is my belief that the DEA should retract any and all plans to ban this plant, and spend money to actually have scientific studies performed so that these claims can be verified, and so that the DEA will have concrete facts to base any decisions off.\nKratom is a wonder plant which should be embraced and supported by the world. It is not a silver bullet to the drug epidemic, and it never will be --- but it is a good start, and a step in the right direction.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCody Hanson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3372","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cody Hanson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA,\n\nWe need to learn more about this before we ban, I do not want this banned.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11674","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathan Bradbury","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I am 20 years old and an alumni from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

Now I can function and be a productive member of society. The feeling of kratom is not intense and does not make you feel high or out of your mind, it's a calming/relaxing feeling.\nAfter I was in a car accident, at no fault of my own, doctors would not give me pain medication that I needed. It took 3 weeks after the accident until I started treatment for my injuries. From the time of the accident till the time of the treatment, I don't know what I would have done without kratom. Kratom made the pain manageable.\nI understand that this isn't one of the best stories that involve taking kratom, but there are a lot of people out there like me that will be affected negatively from banning. Kratom also helps people recover from ptsd, helps people get off of opioids, and deters people from using harmful drugs. Kratom is a healthy alternative for pain relieving. In my experience if you were to take too much kratom, you may get a stomach ache. Same with eating too much chocolate, cheese, or just about anything you can think of.

I have a BA from Colorado University at Boulder and also went to school for nutrition at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition in New York. In addition I am about to go back to school for Graphic Design. \n\nWhile growing up I endured 13 years of chronic pain (mostly in the form of headaches) that went undiagnosed until I was 24. I had the most severe case of temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ) my dentist had ever seen. Which was caused by poor dentistry practices while I was much younger. I spent years in and out of doctor's offices, put on many different prescription medications (including many opioids), with no end in sight of the pain ceasing. Due to the amount of opioids I tried throughout the years, I became dependent on them though they truly did not alleviate the pain. \n\nI count myself incredibly lucky for finding a dentist who could properly treat me and mostly correct the severe misalignment of my jaw joints. I underwent two years of even more pain to expand my jaw and try to correct the problem. While the majority of my pain has since left, I still experience nerve pain that results in headaches and \n\nDuring this treatment I found kratom and was no doubt ecstatic about finding a plant that had the potential to actually alleviate my pain. I do not support prescription medications as many come with great danger to our health. I've used kratom when in need for the last few years and have never experienced even the slightest negative side effect. It does not inhibit my ability to work for myself or affect my life poorly. I am not addicted to kratom, I do not crave it, but I do need it to alleviate discomfort I don't otherwise know how to truly heal from due to my jaw. \n\nPlease reconsider scheduling this very useful plant.

Due to its availability over the counter, I recommend that they try this perfectly legal herbal supplement. \n\nI have had many patients comment that the pain relief they receive from taking various Kratom leaf and tinctures is superior to that of high dose morphine or 75mcg/hr Fentanyl patches. I have had many reports of considerably less drowsiness and fatigue. I have also been told that nausea, a common side-effect of chemotherapy, is not a contributing factor.\n\nThis legal and over the counter substance has many, many great uses. Whether an individual takes small doses to assist with their GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) or severe pain (due to cancer treatment) all I have heard is positive reviews. Truly the only negative review I have heard is that the taste is foul.\n\nI believe that many patients will be harmed by scheduling this substance. This is not the same type of substance as \"bath salts\" that cause hallucinations and strange behavior. Kratom binds to similar sites in the brain that block pain and increase dopamine production; additionally, this herb is used by many native tribes across the glove and has been used for hundreds of years. Certain tribes of Native Americans/United States (First Nations/Canada) are permitted the used of Peyote and other hallucinogenic drugs.\n\nThus far, no evidence has been shown that Kratom has any carcinogenic effect nor does it harm the body. At the first worst, taking too much Kratom may induce nausea. \n\nPlease head my warning that Kratom is a very useful substance that will not lead to some form of pandemic of addiction. The users and researches of Kratom that I know quite well and follow have not show nor found any of the typical behavior of a drug addict.\n\nFinally, many individuals have used this substance in order to desist the use of harder and more dangerous drugs such as diamorphine (Heroin), Oxycodone (Oxycontin, Diludid (Hydromorphone), etc. To remove this avenue of recovery would only increase the usage of these substances while creating a whole new means of arresting and incarcerating individuals that merely wish to relieve their pain, anxiety, and addiction.\n\nA study has shown that even Marijuana itself, now legal for recreational use in several States within the U.S.A., is more addictive.\n\nPlease contact me at 505-514-0062. I am able to provide considerably more information on this substance. It would truly be a crime in itself to schedule this substance as it does not fit any of the criteria of a Schedule I drug.\n\nAdditionally, as someone who has assisted professionally with disabled, infirm, and individuals otherwise unable to care for themselves, I believe I am in a position to provide accurate information. This is not a substance that 99% of the users ingest to get \"high\" from, the overwhelming majority are seeking relief from a mental or physiological ailment that they are otherwise unable to treat via stand medical care within this country.\n\n\nE-mail Contact: KB3MGR@Gmail.com \n\nPhone #: 505-514-0062\n\n(If calling from a non (202) area code, please make a second call)\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJameson Glenn Williams","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9865","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jameson Williams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please take heed kindly, our elected Representatives.

It is not a dangerous substance and does not cause death to anyone. Even the plant marijuana has been regulated by the government and made legal in many states. That's about the only way the two are comparable, however, because kratom is not nearly as widely known or used as marijuana. However, it a plant substance and the properties for which it is sought after are as follows: \"Some of the most interesting health benefits of kratom leaves include their ability to lower blood pressure, relieve pain, boost metabolism, increase sexual energy, improve the immune system, prevent diabetes, ease anxiety, help with addiction, eliminate stress, and induce healthy sleep.\" (article via organicfacts.com). \nWhatever possible \"high\" or \"rush\" it causes people, depending on their body chemistry and their dosage (WHICH BY THE WAY IS CLEARLY SUGGESTED AND STATED UPON PURCHASE OF SAID PRODUCT OR CAN BE EASILY SEARCHED ONLINE) is not an unsafe or uncontrolled affect whatsoever. No one loses mind control; in fact, when too much is taken (too much=exceeding recommended amounts based on various desired affects) the person will simply fall asleep, similar to that of melatonin (vitamin). \nMy personal experience with kratom was never more than a tbsp. which was like a caffeine buzz for me, which is what any average person gets from a LEGAL cup of coffee. Shall we regulate caffeine through the DEA as well?! It's caused many more harmful and lasting side effects than the plant Kratom. I found when I took a bit more, it served as a wonderful natural analgesic for my migraines, and helped me to fall asleep pain-free and relaxed, without the use of any harmful drugs. \nThe only possible reason the DEA could be trying to regulate Kratom is for money; people medicating themselves in an herbal manner doesn't make the government as much money as it does when they're slanging prescription drugs, which can potentially cause addiction and other long-lasting bodily harm to humans. \nI'm a 26 year old hospitality worker; I've been in the service industry since I was 15 and am currently a server. Marijuana was just made recreationally legal here in Vegas where I currently reside, however, I am not able to medicate in that manner due to all the drug testing in the Union here. Kratom allows for me to not take drugs or spend tons of money on prescription drugs that had terrible side effects. It doesn't harm me at all, and I don't take it all the time. I've recommended it to friends who were not educated on the matter and have received nothing but good feedback. I'm always trying to make healthy decisions and find the next-best foods, vitamins, and herb-based remedies! Taking Kratom away seems completely heinous.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20509","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI have a history of heavy marijuana use. \nAfter 6 years lost in my early 20's, I was able to get off the lethargic, depressed lifestyle with kratom.

First and foremost, as an American I oppose the DEAs effort to make kratom a schedule 1 controlled substance because I believe we should have the freedom to do what we wish with our bodies, particularly when there is no evidence that the substance in question is dangerous or a public health threat. To me, it is sufficiently evident that kratom has enhanced the quality of life for many people, whether as an agent of pain management or a tool to reduce anxiety and manage opiate addiction. Furthermore, the dramatic scheduling of kratom will preclude any formal study and scientific research that may help us to better understand it.\n\nI began using kratom nearly two and a half years ago. Prior, I had been addicted to pain pills and while I had already quit using them, I found that kratom -- even in very moderate use -- helped the cravings to subside and allowed me to focus on rebuilding my life. I've successfully re-established my career, I've become creative and productive again, and best of all, I am free of narcotics and able to nurture my relationships without destructive habits and distractions. I cannot give sole credit to the dried leaves of the kratom tree, but I do think it's harmless, natural aid that should remain available to those who might benefit from it. I consider myself a privileged person who has been fortunate and able to bounce back from my troubles, but others suffer more and are not so fortunate.

I am writing to ask that you reconsider scheduling or banning the herb mitragyna speciosa, also known as Kratom. I first learned of this plant through 2 of my children, both recovering addicts, one from heroin and crystal meth, the other a 4 year Suboxone dependency as a result of painkiller abuse and heroin. They did not tell me immediately of their kratom use, assuming I would think they were just replacing one drug for another. But I research things, intensely, and the more I learned, the more I liked this plant. It helps ease the horribly intense and painful withdrawals of opiates, it is a natural alternative to opiates for those suffering chronic pain, it has no known health issues to vital organs, such as the liver, like opiates do. In fact, I liked what I found so much that I tried it for myself, as it is great for improving mood and severe anxiety issues, for which I have been taking pharmaceuticals on and off most of my 46 years. I also found it helps with my muscle aches and pains from my job, which is quite grueling most days, much heavy lifting and constantly on my feet. But more importantly, my children have their lives back. My daughter has been free of Suboxone for 8 months with the help of Kratom, for the first time in 4 years. She is confident enough to go to work and finally function as a productive adult at 26 years old. She is finally, for the first time, getting her driver's licence, something so small to most but has been an incredibly daunting task for her, much like leaving her own home. My son has been drug free for nearly 4 months. I was certain the last 2 years of speedballing heroin and meth would kill him. I hated the sound of my phone ringing, just knowing, this is the call, this is the day my oldest, my firstborn, my only son, had finally accidentally overdosed and killed himself. Kratom is the only thing that helped with his withdrawals and the only thing preventing him from using these deadly drugs. Please, I implore you, do not put my children at risk by banning this plant, because that is indeed what is inevitable. Addiction is a horrible disease, and so many do not make it out. But this plant, Kratom, makes it possible to help break that vicious circle, and return to a normal life again. Please help my family live, and live our lives to the fullest. Every person deserves that. \n\nThank you,\n\nLisa Lanier","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21186","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lisa Lanier","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a non-binary transgender, Hispanic, disabled person.

After pursuing numerous alternative treatments, I was forced to have my left arm amputated above the elbow in May 2015, ostensibly to save my life. Since becoming disabled I have used various natural botanicals rather than drugs to help with my constant phantom pain, which feels like a rock crushing your arm that is no longer there. Prescription drugs had undesirable effects and did not heal me, so I turned to plants. Kratom is one such plant that I have found relief from, as well as kava, often in combination. I am writing to urge you to not place kratom or any other plant on Schedule 1, or any other drug schedule. There is no public benefit to this, and it would hurt people like myself who have found some relief from kratom, often used in combination with other plants. Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.

I am 24 years old. Currently I am working on a Bachelor's in Social Work at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania. I will be graduating this coming spring. I plan to pursue a career in either substance abuse treatment or in medical social work.\n\nI am greatly opposed to the DEA's decision to categorize kratom as a schedule 1 drug. I believe that such a decision will have immediate negative repercussions that will damage the lives of thousands of American citizens. Here are just a few examples of the damages that may occur:\n\n1.) Taking away kratom will reduce the productivity of people who use it to help with pain.\n2.) Banning this plant will make responsible adults who use it into criminals which can damage opportunities for employment, stigmatize them, and subject them to financial difficulty due to fines.\n3.) Banning kratom will open up a dangerous black market for it and thus extend and complicate the war on drugs.\n4.) America is in the midst of an opiate abuse crisis. People have used kratom to help them escape opiate and other forms of addiction. \n\nAs someone who will be working in addiction treatment, I find it disturbing that something that could be saving lives is so easily taken away. I also must note that things like alcohol, Tylenol, and even peanuts have been directly responsible for more fatalities than Kratom, and they are readily available. _Source: Center for Disease Control_\n\nI began using kratom quite recently (summer '16). I heard about its potential to promote a good mood and an energetic yet relaxed mindset. I work a part time job at McDonald's and also part time at my father's steel fabrication shop to support myself while I finish my final college courses. I will be working an unpaid internship this spring and so I need to save money. The bottom line is that I work A LOT. Since my jobs are very fast-paced or physical, I am often exhausted at the end of my shifts and the last thing I usually want to do is school work. I will often make a kratom tea to help reinvigorate myself and get the motivation to get my school work done.\n\nI also must note that am an alcoholic. Alcohol almost killed me several times and led to various legal problems: DUI, public intoxication, and disorderly conduct. The irony here is that alcohol is completely legal. Kratom is absolutely no alternative to treatment, but in my case it promoted a sense of well-being and has helped me remain sober. I believe I may not be as productive as I am now if it were not for kratom.\n\nIt is for these reasons why I wholeheartedly believe that kratom should not be taken away from Americans who benefit so greatly from it.\n\nSincerely,\nEvan B.

Kratom is just that for some people.  Due to the increased opioid use in this country people who were once prescribed opioid pain medication are now stuck between a rock and a hard place.  It is all too common for someone post surgery to get a few prescriptions of oxy, Vicodin or any other opioid pain medication just to help them get through the pain of a very traumatic surgery.  Then After a few months of using a drug that was prescribed by a doctor, someone that the patient put all of their trust into, is now unable to stop use due to the terrible withdrawal effects that happen when you stop receiving these opioids.  Now they must continue to do these drugs not due to the pain of the surgery but from the pain of withdrawal.  Someone who was once a very productive professional person is now at the mercy of a tiny little pill.  If they can not get this pill they will be unable to function and will be unable to feed their family.  Along comes a 100% natural substance, a plant that grows in nature, put here by a higher power for this very reason and you are trying to ban it.  Kratom will be the leg for these people to stand on to help them break the vicious cycle of addiction.  Please give these people hope.  Please allow research on this wonderful plant and  please do not add this plant to a list of banned substances of the highest level.  Thank you for your time and I hope you find it in your heart to understand the point of view of someone whom has no ties to any pharmaceutical company nor any ties to profit from Kratom.  I am just a guy that believes in second chances.

She had daily migraines. She was prescribed many drugs; opiates, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and saw 9 different doctors, all of which only offered more drugs as a solution. My wife, in the end was a mess- addicted to pain relievers and dependant on a plethora of other pills to cope with the still persisting headaches and now growing anxiety issues. We became disenfranchised with the medical community and started looking for our own answers. After great length we came across the dietary supplement Kratom and learned of its reported success in helping opioid addicts.  My wife began taking Kratom and over a short time was able to stop the daily use of opioids for pain relief. She also noticed a reduction of her anxiety in conjunction with the Kratom, and over the next year she stripped away her pill dependencies until she was taking only Kratom as a daily dietary supplement.\n In 2013 after searching for answers from all fields of medicine my wife was taking 5 prescription drugs all with significant side effects and detriment to her long term well being. She was still suffering. After finding Kratom in the fall of 2013, fast forward 2 years and she is now drug free, only using Kratom as needed as a semi-regular supplement.\n  I have seen 'hard drug's and have known those who have struggled with them and fallen to them first hand. These experiences include having a friend die from the addiction to prescribed opiates. Kratom is no schedule 1 drug. It is not harmful even in the hands of fools.

He was addicted to pain pills and heroin, but was able to completely get off of these horrible drugs with the help of kratom. He takes kratom daily and never acts \"high\" or even close to how he acted while taking opioids. He says it makes him not want to take the drugs that he used to. He's a wonderful father, husband and provider for his family; he was able to obtain a master's degree once off of opioids and is a great employee. \n\nI myself do not take kratom, but have seen the benefits that one can obtain with it. I know of others who take it for PTSD, depression, anxiety, migraine and other pain relief. It's a natural supplement that helps so many.\n\nI truly do believe that if kratom is made illegal, there will be serious repercussions. I know that many kratom users will revert back to their old habits in order to deal with whatever issue kratom has helped them with. I'm especially scared for those that use kratom to help with opioid addiction. I know that many will go back to using heroin and pain killers and that they very well may end up dead. \n\nKratom is a natural supplement that has helped so many people with several different issues. It is much safer than other drugs that kratom users have used to help alleviate the problems that they are dealing with.

I have Systemic Lupus, Fibromyalgia, Ascending Thoracic Aneurysm, Endometriosis, Severe Asthma and Allergies.  In order to just be around to see my children grown up, I take a myriad of pills and see multiple specialists to fight back to a body that hates me.  I live in constant pain, debilitating fatigue, fight to breathe, constant sickness and that all causes depression and anxiety.  I have no control over my body.  I have no control over the symptoms the 20 plus different medications I have to take every day just to stay alive,.  I've lost friends.  I mourn my old self, but most of all I mourn the fact that I miss out on parts of my children's lives due to my body giving out on me a different way, every single day.  \n\nI've been prescribed strong opiates to combat the pain.  But those only work for so long before I need more and more to even be able to get out of bed.  I've seen people fight addiction.  I do not want to be that person. The usage of those almost killed me with the way they affect my liver.  \n\nI was introduced to Kratom from a fellow Lupus sufferer as medical marijuana is not legal in my state.  Nor do I really want to take marijuana because of the way it makes me feel and I'm still not able to be the parent I need to be or really work.  \n\nFrom the first time I tried Kratom, I felt better than I had felt in years.  I have the energy to work full time and be a productive member of society.  I love being able to work.  It has improved my mood, depression, anxiety, lowered my blood pressure which is important so I won't have to have open heart surgery. It has given me the best rest I have had in years.  Without the ability to use Kratom, I believe my myriad of diseases will kill me within the next 5 years if not sooner.  \n\nI am happier, am able to practice football and softball with my children, I am a better employee, a better friend, daughter, sister, aunt, niece and co-worker.  Kratom has become my saving grace.  My will to live has returned.  My zest for life has returned.  I have been able to stop taking some of the medications that cause even worse side effects than what they are trying to 'help.'  I love that its natural.  I truly believe that if Kratom is banned, people will die, end up in jail for just trying to live a normal life and the people that have absolutely no control over their bodies will just give up.  \n\nI'm just a mom that wants to watch her children and someday grandchildren have wonderful lives.  Please don't take my son and daughter's rock away from them.  They need me, I need them and I need Kratom.  I have my life back and don't want to get back to that dark place I was when I was ready to give up.  \n\nPlease keep mine and everyone else's story about how Kratom has saved them when thinking of banning it.   All we want is a better quality of life with something natural, not synthetic.  As an American, we live in the land of the free and the brave.  People that are as passionate and have such a zest for life that need Kratom to make that happen will make this country a better place.  We deserve that. American needs that.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3083","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Douglas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Not only do I use kratom as an herbal supplement  to reduce menstrual pain, but I have multiple friends who use it to help with their anxiety.

At this rate you will schedule any and every medicinal plant the people of this country have.  My family is full of old time red blooded americans, my great grand father worked on the railroads when they were being built, driving forward our nation at an important time in its economic expantion just like those that built our interstate highways. Him and my great grandmother foraged for their foods, they consumed plants suck as lactuca virosa, bergamot, etc plants that under the same ignorant pretenses you are trying to use to single out this plant could be banned. The california poppy is currently being used and smoked by teenager for a marijuana like high. it is a dietary supplement which is widely used, having opiate like compounds in it, called isoquinolines, it has not been singled out even though it has a history of abuse, lactuca virosa is notoriously named opium lettuce because of its sedative effects. Bergamot is as well a narcotic plant, even though it is used widely in teas such as sleepy  time tea. Another pplant that has been abused widely by teenagers is ipomoea tricolor. It has made  numerous news reports spanning over a decade as a plat of abuse, it is a very common garden plant sold by seed sellers such as ferry morse and can be found in most every dollar store throughout the country. Coleus blumei is another plant of abuse, closely related to the plant salvia divinorum in the compounds it contains. It is sold at most every Walmart throughout the country during spring planting time. I find the attack on the plant mitragyna speciosa by the dea as well as the countrywide attack on plants like salvia  divinorum tobe highly hypocritical and a violation of the constitution.No plant should be allowed on your or any state list of controlled substances. Plants are containers  of substances, yet you continue to list them along with different states and their medical boards on the CSA. In doing this  you have  overstepped  your constitutional authority, doing  this has  allowed both state  and  federal jurisdictions to prosecute individuals for  the possesion of plants overstepping their right to proof of intent, it has aswell bypassed the  right  of the  individual todue  process. You have  listed entire plant species on your list as substances. Doing this  is literarily incorrect. As the CSA  sits right now it is an illiterate piece of  legislation. Any piece of legislation that is not literarily correct should not allow for  the prosecution of any individual. The powers add plants  to the CSA was  never  enumerated to your agency or the medical boards, or any state  or federal agency as  a matter of fact  to schedule plants as substances, as  precursors to substances. In order to schedule  plants you must pass either  a drug control or plant based  substance control piece of legislation. I find it to be a disgrace that such a good intentioned act passed to fight pill diversion and actual substances that can hurt people in the wrong hands has been used to take away the right of the people to posses or consume certain medicinal or pharmacologically active plants. You just lowered the  threshold of opium that drug companies import from countries like Tasmania, the  same plants  that  Taliban farmers are  poisoning communitys with, after being called out on the kratom issue. Seems like desperation to me,in order to create an image  that you actually care about the drugs  epidemic in this country. Yet you dont emergency ban the poisons that these pharmaceutical companies are pumping out. Like fentanyl, which is 50 times as strong as heroin, the drug we banned in this country in the first place because it was to strong. The drug  cartels are shipping  in heroin that is pre laced with the drug fentanyl, because  american drug  addicts  are so hooked. Cartels are  shipping in meth cristals the size you would find in a quartz quary, yet kratom and plants that have  legitimate, constitutionally protected religious  uses are on your radar for some reason. Coca leaves which have been used for thousands of  years safely by Andean peoples are listed, people are federally indited for the possetion of lophophora williamsii, as well as psilocybin containing mushrooms even though they are not listed, people are arrested for possesing iboga and khat plants as well as the possetion of non THC containing cannabis seeds because they are live. The transgressions agains due process and against true rule of law, against burden of proof law in this nation by your aghency as well as state agencys theroughout the nation are innumerable. Not even the United Kingdom, the motherland to the founders of this nation has the level of distain for rule of law that the people within the legislative, judicial and executive branches here.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1914","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Keith Richards","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am not a Kratom user, but a close family member uses Kratom and we have seen amazing changes in her mood and over all well being.

As a recovering addict of 13 years , kratom has been one of the key contributors to my success and getting off opiates and benzodiazepines. While I was using Suboxone to get off the heroin addicition, I found myself being addicted to suboxone, and having an incredibly hard time getting off of that. It got as bad as my heroin addicion. I'm so thankful I've found something completely natural like Kratom that affects some of the same opiate receptors, giving me a very mild feeling that just allow me to get the motivation and confidence to get out of bed, go to work, have a relationship, be a member of my family again. I'm thankful because of these mild effects that are just enough (not getting me high) to keep my head up and onward in life. I'm not addicted to kratom, there's never been a time I got sick without it, or stolen to get it. It's nothing like some of the terrible addictions in my past. I'm a new person today because of Kratom and I hope and pray that it doesn't become illegal because I don't want to look for other potentially addictive or harmful alternatives.

I used Kratom to lessen my use of narcotics. I believe it helped me get through my ordeal with less dependance on opiates and minimal opiate withdrawl when I stopped needing pain medication. I was made aware of Kratom by a young man who had used it in his (successful) battle to kick heroin addiction. \n\n     I ask the DEA to carefully weigh the evidence and the opinions of scientific researchers, medical practitioners, and those who have personal experience with Kratom. \"Thank you\" to those who helped open this to public comment instead of rushing to a hasty decision. \n\n     \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22944","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dean Martin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jenny Jacobson.  I am 39 years of age.  I am a working, full time Paramedic and have been employed in EMS for 19 years.  I oppose the DEA placing Kratom on the Schedule 1 controlled substances list. I started taking Kratom 5 years ago, and after years of full time EMS work, I developed a back problem which resulted in several doctor visits and medicine. Anxiety and depression became the norm. Which lead to counseling and of course more medicine. I didn't want to take pain medication and decided to try a natural alternative.  My brother suggested Kratom to me and said it would help. I did my research and made my first purchase. That's when my life changed forever! I did not experience any withdrawals from stopping the prescription medications while taking Kratom. Kratom enabled me to continue working as a Paramedic and discontinue pain medication use. Kratom helped with all of my previously diagnosed medical issues. Kratom is a natural alternative to prescription medications and does not need to be placed on the Schedule 1 list of controlled substances.\n\nThank you,\nJenny D.

My experience with kratom was due to having chronic pain issues. But not just pain, I had digestive issues concerning pudendal nerve entrapment and pelvic floor dyssynergia. I had a horrendous symptom called tenesmus, which is the constant urge to defecate. My life quickly spiraled downward as you can imagine. I woke up each morning having diarreah every 15 minutes, and after that i had theconstant urge even though there wouldnt be anything left. I was literally running to the toilet 30 times a day. For a couple months, I suffered day in an day out, losing 30 pounds I already could not afford from constant diarreah, anxiety attacks, insomnia, extreme depression, suicidal thoughts and the persistent pain in my ass, literally.\n\nI then found kratom. First time I tried it, I was completely alleviated of all my symptoms for 4-5 hours. This was a miracle! Nothing else helped. I tried diet changes, physical therapy, yoga exercises, chiropractic care all to no avail. I saw many doctors and had many tests done during this time, but no one could figure me out. At least I could function and go back to work, eat enough, no more anxiety attacks or suicidal tendencies, all of this due to kratom. It truly saved my life. I was seriously contemplating suicide before this and the pain pills they gave me barely touched the pain.\n\nFor the next 1.5 years, I was dependent on kratom, although still seeking medical treatment. My doctors agreed to keep taking the kratom until we found something else as it was keeping me from pooping at a hazardous constancy and consistency that would severely dehydrate me. I held onto hope that there would be an answer, and kratom held onto my hand and guided me through the misery and shielded me from the worst.\n\nAfter 1.5 years, I found a new medication that worked wonders called Amitryptiline for my form of pudendal nerve IBS/pelvic floor dyssynergia and pain. I also took ibuprofen as needed daily, but the digestive issues were cured finally. Over the past 6 months, I am down to 1 ibuprofen a day and cut my Amitryptiline dose in half along with no more kratom. I will soon be completely in remission. I wouldn't have made it this far without kratom.\n\nIt's safe in the sense you can't overdose on it, the worst that happened to me was nausea if I took too much, nothing too bad. I did have withdrawals when I quit cold turkey, but wasn't anything I needed medical treatment for. I did it on my own dropping from a heavy habit of 30 grams a day since the new medicine was working. Withdrawals aren't dangerous like alcohol and harder opiates can be, but they sure weren't enjoyable. I think it's safe to say withdrawals are akin to quitting a very heavy marijuana and coffee habit at once.\n\nI do believe that kratom should be regulated to some extent, similar to how tobacco is. Considering alcohol and tobacco are legal, there is no way that kratom shouldn't be either. If anything, chronic pain patients and people with harder addictions have a RIGHT to use kratom. This plant has saved so many lives and denying access for people who truly need it like I used to, is a cruel sin. Many people will suffer and die due to pain and addiction if kratom is banned completely. I think you guys understand this though, so I will spare the lecture and finish my story. I know you have the best intentions for our country and believe you will do the right thing. I am grateful to have a country that is at least looking out for our best interests and for that I thank you. :)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0121","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bradley Noskowiak","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a thirty-eight year old artist, mother and student.

I'm a 46-year old woman from Carolina Beach NC, and I'd like to voice my concern about the possible de-legalization of kratom.\n\nI began using kratom about 6 months ago, primarily to treat my peripheral neuropathy, which causes me a great deal of pain and discomfort. Prescription drugs such as Gabapentin and Cymbalta were ineffective, and I was very discouraged, thinking that I had run out of options and was going to simply have to endure the limitations of my disease.\n\nAfter hearing about kratom online, I decided to give it a try, even though I was dubious. To my great surprise and relief, it works tremendously well! My pain level is almost nil. I am now sleeping through the night, which is something I haven't done in years. I'm performing much better at my job, and have the ability to exercise and participate in athletics like I did before my diagnosis.\n\nI have also had problems in my life with substance abuse (specifically, alcoholism), and depression and anxiety. Kratom alleviated these as well. It elevates my mood and helps my focus and clarity. It also lessens my craving for alcohol substantially, and my cravings had always been a huge obstacle to staying sober. I have now been sober for over five months, which is something that had you asked me six months ago, I would have said was impossible.\n\nI really feel like I have my life back. It's so novel to be virtually pain-free when you've been in nearly constant pain for years! I have a better relationship with my friends and family and actually look forward to the future, which is a feeling that had been slipping away from me for years. After I started taking kratom, I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop  it just seemed too good to be true  but the shoe never did. Kratom is also very affordable and I have experienced no ill-effects. I'm still on the same daily dosage I was on when I began taking it.\n\nI would be devastated if legislation made kratom unavailable to me. The quality of my life would plummet, and I don't believe that any medical options are available that are as effective as kratom has been for me.\n\nKratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life, so I'm asking you to please keep it legal and available.\n\nIf you have questions about kratom, please visit www.americankratom.org. Thank you for your time and service.\n\nSincerely,\nSarah Woods","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19196","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Woods","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Irvin Antonio, I really believe kratom should stay legal and more importantly studied for its medical befits instead of just banning the plant and possibly ruining the lives of all the people that benefit from this natural substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20715","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Irvin Antonio","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do NOT take this beneficial herb from those who benefit.

I have used it for both migraine headache relief, and for help with a clinically diagnosed depression.  In both cases it seem miraculous to me--providing real relief in both cases, yet not leaving me foggy, or drugged-feeling, in any way.  Especially in the case of my depression, which did not react well to the classic SSRIs.  Yet kratom helped lift my depression--without any unpleasant side effects!--and allowed be to return to work. It saved my life then.  Please don't take this away from those of us who might need this simple, marvelous plant.\n\nKratom is not an intoxicant.  It simply is not.  Thanks the beauty of it. To link it to heroin and LSD is so wrong-headed as to beggar the imagination.  It's a modest herb, related to the coffee plant, that provides pain relief for those with chronic conditions.  It was of enormous benefit to me in both of those capacities some years ago.  I beseech you to at least allow for further research before this seemingly uniformed reclassification takes place.\n\nThank you for allowing a public feedback period.  It means a lot.

I am a substitute teacher in special education, an intern with a groundbreaking positive youth development program, and I am finishing a self-directed study on the psychosocial roots of addiction in my community as my undergraduate capstone project. I will be graduating in two weeks with an interdisciplinary degree in the cognitive and social sciences with concentrations in social psychology, addiction theory, criminology, and youth studies. I am vehemently opposed to placing kratom on the list of Scheduled substances, especially Schedule I.\n\nI began taking kratom three years ago. Prior to taking kratom, the life I have now did not seem possible. After a progressive decline in my health that led me to being functionally home-bound by what was ultimately diagnosed as chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia, I failed out of college and could not work. Since my health decline I have taken countless pharmacological and complementary measures were taken to try and improve my quality of life. Some formal interventions have marginally improved my condition but nothing seemed to be turning my condition around enough to get a job or even take an online class, I was still mostly home-bound.\n\nI ordered kratom using from a vetted vendor after reading about it on a pain forum. I paid for it with Christmas money. My mother brought the package to my bedroom, I took a half of a teaspoon, and didnt think much of it until I looked at the clock after showering and realized that I was up and moving before 3pm. Normally I would be tired after a shower, this day I wasnt. Kratom quickly became a part of my complementary wellness regimen. I began substitute teaching after four months and taking online classes within six months. In December 2015, my college took me back. I can function reasonably with less pain and fatigue now. It took a lot of work, and kratom gave me that extra push.\n\nIn the time that I was trying to rebuild my life, I saw countless friends, classmates, and roommates fall into the downward spiral of addiction. It takes more than two hands to count the number of my peers from high school and college who have died of opioid overdoses. It would take two more hands to count the number of youth from my hometown who have also died. I am researching addiction because of these young people, I want to do what I can to prevent even just one more person from ending up in the ground before their parents. \n\n It breaks my heart to know that a plant in the coffee family that has helped my quality of life maybe could have saved theirs by placating their opioid receptors to help support recovery and sobriety. Placing kratom in the Schedule I category would hinder research into this plants potential to help those of us struggling with pain and those of us struggling with addiction. I now carry narcan on my person because of the number of friends I have who have struggled with opiates and for my fear of coming across an overdose in a public restroom or a parked car. Narcan isnt enough.\n\nI fear that those who are currently using kratom to support their sobriety will face the possibility of relapse. I fear that those who use it to assist with pain could become suicidal or turn to demonstrably dangerous street narcotics out of desperation -many in the kratom community forums have expressed these fears for themselves. Banning kratom, even temporarily, would cause an imminent threat to public safety, productivity, and even commerce. Respectfully, what would the American population and economy look like if coffee was scheduled tomorrow? \n\nI have never been suspected of, arrested, or prosecuted for a crime. Kratom has supported my ability to serve my community, complete my studies, and retain gainful employment. My bad days are not as devastating as they once were. Placing kratom on the Schedule I list would place myself and countless other Americans in the position of choosing between continuing my life as a law-abiding citizen, and having a semblance of a quality of life. I have never experienced adverse effects from kratom, never withdrawal. I cant go back to being housebound, and I cant let my community down. \n\nI hope that we can address any remaining health concerns without affecting kratom consumers who are benefiting from it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20770","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Holly Currier","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, my name is David.

This act would put kratom, a plant consumed safely in the U.S. for decades and world-wide for millennia, and one that helps millions of people on the same level as illegal drugs such as heroin.  Further research is very much needed to ascertain all the benefits kratom has...scheduling it will hinder or prevent much needed research.  I use kratom and legal CBD to help me lead a better life, one not as full of pain and anxiety when I didn't take it.  I was overdosed in the hospital after being given morphine and dilauded and hydrocodone, and then the same to take home.  I was back in the hospital with stroke-like symptoms!  I am not a doctor, however I was a trained Air Force Addiction's Counselor and had many clients hooked on different drugs.  My wish today, as a retired AF Veteran is to somehow get kratom to our Veterans who are 'hooked' and were hooked on pain meds by the 'system' and now being told their dose is gone.  We are losing over 22 Vets a day to suicide and that wish of mine to get kratom to these Vets would save lives.  The worst thing that has happened to me from taking kratom is I got constipated.  That's it!  Just need to drink more liquids like you need to do with many other things we take, such as Flexeril.  Kratom is working for me and many others.  I can honestly state I would need painkillers if not for this plant.  Fact: if you take kratom with an opiate they will counter each other.  I want kratom for me and for whoever needs it to get off of addicting drugs.  I hear from so many people that it's worked for and I'm so proud and happy for them.  Please, please, this plant is a God-send for so many of us, and especially for those that became hooked and can't get off of what they are on.  No more methadone clinics please!!!!  I saw first hand what it did to clients...more pain and addiction.  I also have a degree in Social Psychology and would love an invitation to help research the benefits of kratom.  I welcome speaking to anyone about this plant and what it's done for me, an 80% disabled Veteran.

This is a safe product that can benefit the human race.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4775","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ELI Chase","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22632","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Drug Policy Alliance","postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Luis Emmanuel Morales Falcon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly oppose the ban on Kratom.

I began using it in January of 2012.  In September of 2010 I was in a car accident which crushed my left knee and left elbow.  After many surgeries which resulted in my having various pins inserted to hold my bones in place, I was given many prescriptions for narcotic painkillers.  I quickly became dependent on these painkillers and I developed a horrendous addiction. Not only that, but the various side effects wreaked havoc on my body. Doctor after doctor gave me different pain medicines to try, weaning me off one only to give me another. I felt I had no real control in the matter as my chronic knee and elbow pain made it difficult to work, get exercise and generally have a decent quality of life.\n  On October 3rd, 2012, I attempted suicide but stopped at the last minute.  I was attempting suicide because my addiction had led me to lose my job, my partner, as well as my relationship with my family and friends.  I was isolated, had dropped out of college and had no money left. I tried to detox a few times on my own but finally decided to seek professional help in January of 2012.     \n  After checking myself into a detox center, someone there told me about kratom.  I went and bought some online and within 12 hours of using some my pain had gone from it's usual 7 to a 4. Not only that, but I felt energized and motivated.  This, in turn, led me to find a part-time job rather than relying on disability and unemployment which I had nearly exhausted.  \n  Then I had a full-time job, then I went back to college, then I graduated and got a real job in my field.  During this time, I used kratom twice a day (4.5 grams in the morning and evening) and was able to repair my relationship with my friends and family.  I eventually went to graduate school and got my Master's degree; I also met an incredible woman who is now my best friend, partner and roommate. \n  Kratom was what helped me control my pain and get enough energy to begin a virtuous cycle that hasn't stopped in the 4 years I've been using this incredible herb.  Where pharmaceuticals failed, Kratom did not. \n   Banning Kratom while keeping pharmaceutical narcotics legal is only going to worsen the opiate epidemic.  I can easily overdose on narcotic pain killers but I cannot on Kratom.  I can also easily destroy my life again with pain killers and yet Kratom has done the exact opposite for me. So, in closing, I strongly urge you the reconsider this ban as well as the evidence behind it.\n                         Sincerely,\n                         AJ\n          AJ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4618","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"AJ B","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"An effective natural plant that has no side effects.

Instead of being doomed to a life of addictive ,dangerous,narcotic prescription drugs, these people can simply take a natural leaf with no deadly side effects. This leaf works effectively to ease a variety of pain issues and also has many other benefits. It is NOT addictive, it does NOT decrease oxygen intake like opoids do, and it does NOT make you high. It simply helps relieve pain. It helps those with anxiety and depression to live a normal life instead of living like a zombie from taking strong prescription anti depressants. No one has ever died from taking Kratom. The few cases involving death that have been reported were due to a direct result of ingesting other prescription and/or street drugs..Many people have their life back because of Kratom. Kratom has helped countless drug addicts get off drugs and return to being productive members of society. I really want to believe the DEA has the public's best interest in mind. If that is true then there is no just cause for them to take away a natural, safe ,effective plant that has helped so many people who don't want to put deadly narcotics in their body..What makes more sense, using a natural plant to manage pain or using an addictive, deadly, man made narcotic that has killed so many people or has lead them down the road of crime and addiction? The answer is obvious to so many of us that don't take drugs. I'm thankful this ban has been suspended and our voices are being heard. Kratom is going to help many people in the future to regain their lives after years of drug abuse and is going to prevent many deaths from  prescription pain killers because it is a safe alternative..","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0613","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I started using Kratom about 8 months ago.

Bullet point style.\n\n1. I've been a regular kratom user for just over 2 years. \n2. I use the powder form mixed with coffee.\n3. I use around 3 grams of White Rabbit Brand \"wellness\" line of meang da strain three times a day.\n4. I am an ex opiate addict. I used heroin. And then Suboxone to get off heroin. After many attempts to quit unsuccessfully... I almost gave up. Figured I'd always be an addict. Inpatient rehabs, methadone, outpatient therapy, suboxone clinics, bought suboxone on the streets...I just could not kick it. \n5. After hearing about kratom I decided to give it a shot. From the first dose...I never picked up a street drug or pharmaceutical drug again. \n6. I really believe kratom saved my life. To me...it is a miracle. The answer. The CURE.\n7. I've gone without kratom here and there...and yes...it does have mild withdrawal effects. Runny nose, sleeplessness, but these are mild. And this was when I was using WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH.\n8. When I first used kratom regularly... I used 5-8 grams up to 5 times a day. And when I used that much...it wasn't as effective as a treatment for my addiction as it is now. That's when I experienced the withdrawals. But now that I'm under 10 grams a day....its perfect. I experience ZERO adverse effects. AGAIN I REPEAT...... USING UNDER 10 GRAMS A DAY GIVES ME ZERO ADVERSE EFFECTS.\n\n\n9. In conclusion... Please....please do not take this amazing plant from us. Of course as with anything there is a potential for abuse. But eat enough IMMODIUM pills and it will get you high. Soak poppy seeds in lemon water...and it gets you high. Brew kava kava root and it intoxicates you. Eat enough cold medicine...it will get you high. There are many many perfectly legal yet potentially deadly things out there that have no restrictions available right now to use. One way or another if someone wants to use something to alter their state of mind they will. And here is this 100% natural plant that is safe...effective and available that WILL SAVE LIVES. If I knew about kratom years ago I wouldn't have a criminal record. I wouldn't of developed a serious drug addiction. If I would've known that I could go to a store and purchase something easily that would CURE my withdrawal ....my life would be very different. I would never of had to steal to go buy expensive drugs just to not feel like I was dying. Opiate withdrawal literally controls your actions. Nothing is as important as getting rid of that tortuous feeling. Dope \"sick\" is a horrible understatement. Its torture. Plain and simple. And kratom cures that without prolonging the withdrawal period. Please. Our very lives are in your hands. The lives of millions of people will be affected by this decision. Just let us have this one...OK? Seriously now...it hasn't hurt anything. Banning kratom will only serve to keep drug addicts without a solution to the misery that is opiate withdrawal. BANNING KRATOM WILL KEEP CRIMINAL ACTS HAPPENING... KEEP HERION ADDICTS USIMG HEROIN...AND KEEP FAMILIES TORN APART. \n\n\nTHIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO SHOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT IT CAN TRUST ITS GOVERNMENT.  \n\nKratom granted me a new lease on life. Kratom saved my life. Please don't take this miracle away. Regulate it like cigarettes and alcohol if you have too...but please don't put the power of choice in someone else's hands. Its our right as human beings to use what was put on this earth.     But when all is said and done....its up to you. Please...please show us that you care about the people. This is a my life we're talking about. And I take it very seriously. Kratom helped me get here....so please...please let me continue to live a good healthy life. Thank you. \n\nSincerely,\n\nEric Daniel Tomlinson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11948","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Tomlinson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am hoping to plead my case against the ban on kratom. My mother and I have suffered a chronic cough our whole lives. My mother passed away 5 years ago and I am currently 55. I have spent the better part of my life trying to find out why I cough and have been to hundreds of doctors and specialists. My mother did the same thing her whole life. Still no answers. Consequently we both ended up on narcotic cough medicines to help and ended up terribly addicted. I have been on a quest for an alternative to this route. I found kratom and it works really well at keeping my cough at bay, it also has boosted my immune system and I rarely ever get even a cold once every couple of years, even then it is brief and barely noticeable. All this is to say that kratom has saved my life. I only wish my mother had been able to find this relief in time. Please, please do not ban this wonderful botanical extract ...

I'm also one of millions of Americans suffering from debilitating chronic pain. I've lived with symptoms of various autoimmune diseases for over half of my life, beginning in adolescence. My diagnoses include advanced/severe ankylosing spondylitis with axial psoriatic arthritis & a myriad of comorbid conditions, complications, & symptoms, such as chronic intractable nerve/joint/tissue pain with joint degeneration/fusion throughout my entire neck/spine/pelvis, spinal & foraminal stenosis, sacroiliitis, sciatica, kyphosis & scoliosis, muscle spasms, tension headaches, chronic depression, insomnia, chronic fatigue, the list goes on. Despite long-delayed diagnoses & many struggles, I have persevered. I have earned an advanced degree in my field. I contribute part-time to the work force. I have never given up. Over the last two decades, I've tried all manner of therapies, procedures, medications, \"miracle cures,\" remedies, & natural supplements. I discovered kratom tea about one year ago, & I have found it to be a highly effective, safe herbal supplement for managing & coping with my relentless pain, fatigue, & other symptoms. I also haven't taken a single opioid since I started drinking kratom tea.\n\nLike millions of Americans suffering from chronic intractable pain, I was prescribed opioids. Since I was offered no alternatives from my physicians, & opioids are covered by health insurance, I used them as directed for years. However, since discovering kratom, I no longer use opioids or go through the ordeals of their awful side effects & cravings. When I had to use opioids to manage my pain, they were frequently on my mind, like a dark cloud: counting down the hours to my next dose, calculating how many pills I had left for the day, week, month. My days revolved around when I could take my pills. I felt sluggish, foggy, & unmotivated. I felt nauseous all the time & had a poor appetite. I experienced horrible withdrawal symptoms when I would run out of my medication. This happened regularly because my state's health insurance required me to see my pain specialist in person every month to get my prescription refilled, & these visits would often get delayed due to health insurance red tape. Chronic intractable pain is a heavy chain, & having to rely on deadly, addictive opioids is a steel cage.\n\nConversely, my experience with drinking kratom tea to help manage & cope with my pain has absolutely nothing in common with my ordeal with prescription opioids. I drink kratom tea most weekdays before going to work, like many people who drink coffee in the mornings. Unlike coffee & opioids, however, I have absolutely zero cravings for kratom. Unlike opioids, there is no looming dark cloud of addiction; my days don't revolve around kratom tea. In fact, I haven't noticed any adverse side effects from kratom tea in the entire year I've been drinking it. It doesn't even upset my stomach the way coffee does. I have a healthy appetite again, & I'm more active than when I was taking opioids. Kratom is simply a tea leaf with properties that help dull my relentless pain in a safe, natural way. Furthermore, I would not describe kratom's pain-relieving effects as being similar to opioids at all; in fact, kratom is more effective than opioids at relieving my pain without making me feel foggy, sluggish, \"loopy,\" or \"high.\" Kratom is natural, which is important to me because I have to take enough pharmaceuticals to manage my autoimmune diseases & their symptoms as it is. Kratom is affordable, accessible, & gives me some agency & independence from my health insurance. In short, this wonderful herbal supplement helps to safely ease my suffering, which helps me participate part-time in the work force & live my life more fully & actively. Opioids were my cage, but kratom helps to carry the weight of my pain & walk more freely.\n\nOpioids are killing Americans every single day. The pain & opioid epidemic in America is in dire need of more safe, natural, affordable remedies. Kratom is simply a tea leaf -- an herbal supplement -- & a Schedule 1 classification of its natural alkaloids, mitragynine & 7-hydroxymitragynine, is outrageous. This scheduling would turn suffering Americans like myself into felons for the act of drinking herbal tea to manage our chronic pain. Enforcing this scheduling would likely waste millions of American tax dollars. Classifying kratom's natural compounds as controlled substances would also severely restrict research into this plant when this kind of research is needed most by the American people.\n\nPlease do not move forward with placing the natural alkaloids mitragynine & 7-hydroxymitragynine on the list of controlled substances. Kratom is far from a public safety hazard; in fact, it improves & saves lives like mine. Kratom needs to remain accessible to consumers in the food/supplements market & unrestricted for research. Thank you for your time & consideration of my personal testimony.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23155","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Juliana Piscitiello","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"More research is needed.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

Not because it is dangerous to use, or because I didn't like the effect, but mostly because it is relatively difficult to use. A typical dose, 4g, is quite a bit of powdered plant material to ingest. I mixed it with yogurt, but even then, it was not that pleasant to take. Regarding the effects, they are moderate, perhaps like taking a single Vicodin. One does not get high, or at least, not noticably high. It blunts pain, but not completely. On top of all that, it CANNOT be taken in higher doses, by most people, because in doses much over 4g, it induces nausea and vomiting. \n\nAs this report suggests, although I still have quite a bit of the drug left, sitting on a shelf, I am not that incline to use it. If I find myself in pain, without any reasonable alternative (OTC analgesics don't work well for me anymore), I think I will be glad to have it. Otherwise, it will probably just sit there unused.\n\nTherefore, I think that any reasonable observer would conclude that kratom does NOT have a high potential for abuse. It is also not known to cause ODs (because small overdoses induce vomiting), and it doesn't seem to be addictive, either, perhaps because doseage is strictly limited by the nature of the drug. All told, I think it would be extreme overkill to prohibit kratom. Prohibition would create far more harm, as was the case with alcohol and then marijuana, than the drug itself would ever cause.\n\nPlease, if you know what is good for America and Americans, do NOT prohibit kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6742","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"the drug war has been a colossal failure and adding MORE substances with medicinal value into the mix just reinforces the idea that the U.S. government is fascist and out of control.  let the peons that have to exist in this disaster of an economy you've created, have the things that make them feel better!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18075","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"adam gill","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I haven't used kratom as much as most of the other commenters, but I've taken it enough times to know that the extent of its \"danger\" is nausea.

It can also prevent withdrawal without posing any measurable  risk of overdose or physical dependency. \n\nYou'll likely see that expressed in these comments in form or another, and though its anecdotal, I've seen several of these cases in my own experience. For this reason, I do think there is much to be gained by further studying what the benefits of Kratom might be in the treatment of substance abuse as well as pain management. \n\nTo that end, I nor anyone I've discussed Kratom use with   have seen signs of physical dependence from of self-medicinal or even recreational use of Kratom. \n\nI say that as someone who has used Kratom for extended periods of time, and then been able to cease doing so without much effort at all. Admittedly, Kratom can become a habit,  and if that occurs, someone habitually using it would certainly  prefer to do so rather than not. \n\nHowever, in the experience of most, it isn't much different than those who frequently use alcohol, nicotine, coffee, their cell phone, eat unhealthy foods....ect. In other words: Kratom is as habit forming as anything else human beings enjoy.\n\nTo my second point: Kratom is wonderful pain management tool that doesn't present nearly the risk of overdose or organ damage that opioid prescriptions cut with acetaminophen do. \n\nThe effect on a person's sobriety also seems to be much less pronounced, and for many a, proper dosage can deliver pain relief without drowsiness or intoxication. I think this makes it a much better alternative to those who are trying to manage pain during a work day or during a recurring physical activity. \n\nFor me, it was playing the drums. I'm still relatively young (30), but I'm more than six feet tall and crouching to play a drum set for hours can have sometimes wreak havoc on my back. \n\nWe play a lot of bars and events, so I used to manage that discomfort by drinking alcohol. For more than a year now, though, I have taken a small dose of Kratom and drank water, which has kept my back from causing problems and enabled me to stay more focused on performing. \n\nI know that's certainly not \"chronic pain\" on a diagnosable level, but for those who are facing much worse medical circumstances, I can't imagine their experience would be much different, especially for those working in construction, manufacturing or any number of physically-demanding fields. \n\nFinally, I want to say I understand the concern that Kratom's complete lack of regulation causes. I think many in the \"community\" don't have qualms with addressing retailers who put unregulated products in front of and in the hands of people who may not know what they're taking. \n\nHowever, I hope to covey to the DEA the sheer volume of responsible, wonderful and thoughtful adults who, not only use Kratom, but depend on it for their sustained quality life, physical health and emotional well-being. \n\nThank you for allowing the public this opportunity to comment on this issue.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7805","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason Johnson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've used Kratom for the last 2 years as a pain reliever after a botched surgery.

A ban will insure that real people who are in pain can't get relief in a timely and affordable manner, but will allow these drug companies to profit with huge margins, when the people are forced to go through their monopoly to obtain said relief at an insanely huge mark-up. The drug companies and their trolls, along with miserable and ignorant people have tried to use scare tactics based on lies to manipulate a ban in their favor. It does not serve the will of the American people as evidenced by the white House petition signatures. If your goal as a regulatory body is only to keep Americans safe from harmful substances, you are barking up the wrong tree. So far anecdotal evidence of calls to poison control, and about 16 deaths are cited by proponents of the ban. Here are the facts: most of the calls were from doctors who were seeking information on the plant and possible drug interactions, so as not to harm their patient who takes Kratom. Of the deaths, not a single one was Kratom alone, nor ruled as cause of death. In every instance, other toxins, from alcohol, to pills, to heroin was found and ruled as cause of death. The presence of Kratom mere coincidence. If half the people who commit suicide have chewing gum in their mouth or pocket, it is illogical to conclude chewing gum had anything to do with their demise. This is a similar instance. I implore you to not let ignorance and fear dictate policy when there is sound and reasonable, true scientific data on the matter. Skewed and easily manipulated statistics made to spark fear are not the standard by which laws should be made in the face of actual clinical study on the matter. Kratom has saved many lives and prevented many suicides also. I would hate to see that change.

I was so tired of that life. I had 2 little boys and I could barely function. I searched the internet for some LEGAL and SAFE and NATURAL alternative to opiates and everything else I was taking, and I found Kratom.  I thought what the heck?! So I ordered some from online and by the 3rd day, I knew I found what I was looking for. Kratom got me off everything! And still 10 years later, I only take kratom and have a career, my boys are very well loved and taken care of, I am able to hike and ride horses again. All of those things I could not do before kratom. Please don't take kratom away. It would be like taking coffee away and I bet some of you reading this right now are drinking coffee and would FREAK if coffee became illegal. It should be considered a dietary supplement and to be used as needed, just like kava, blue lotus or even hemp oil. If kratom became illegal you would be turning millions of law abiding, tax paying citizens into criminals. Kratom is NOT dangerous. It was the best decision I have ever made for myself and for my family to turn to kratom and get off all those drugs legal and illegal. Americans are losing faith in our government, if Kratom became a dietary supplement that would be a HUGE step in the right direction. Please HEAR us! Hear the researchers and scientists who say they can use this plant to make safer alternatives to opiates. And let us keep our beloved tree , in its natural form, to be used by any adults as needed.

He said it was suprisingly effective for a natural leaf that could be bought over the counter. I have had some anxiety and depression issues myself so I thought I may as well give it a try.  It looked and smelled just like matcha tea, which has proven health benefits, though not as a treatment for any disease or disorder.  My first dose was about a teaspoon full of red maeng da powder, which i took just before a trip to the hardware store.  It did'nt seem to affect me much at all except for a slight groggy feeling.  When I returned home I sat down on the couch and began to feel a general sense of well being.  it was a warm comfortable feeling that was far from impairment of any kind.  I've been succesfully managing any and all anxiety issues since then and have even found my alcohol intake had decreased signifficantly, so much so that I've lost ten pounds.  I'm a family man with a hectic schedule and this leaf is a godsend.  But as a family man, I can not and will not have any schedule I drugs in my house.  I find it baffling that a leaf that has given so many people relief from all manner of ailments is subject to this type of classification.  There have been just over a dozen deaths?  There are better odds of drowning while drinking a glass of water.  I understand there are some potential withdrawal issues, but after all of my research I am troubled by this attemp to deprive so many of a safe and effective treatment while other widely accepted and FDA approved drugs for the same conditions are MUCH more dangerous. Perhaps there are powerful groups that want to harness the capabilities of this plant for their own gain?  I can see no other reason to restrict this wonderful plant to such an extent.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19914","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Blake","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should remain leagal, most certainly.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15286","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have diabetes and nerve damage in my limbs.

I strongly believe in the human right to use anything that occurs naturally if it provides a benefit with minimal risk. Placing kratom on any Schedule, especially Schedule I, would deprive millions of Americans of an inexpensive tool which at a minimum can promote a sense of well-being as part of a healthy lifestyle. In many cases, it can save lives.\n\nMy wife has survived PTSD, depression, and severe anxiety for most of her life. Since age 16, she has been on 24 prescription medications with varying degrees of success. She has managed her illness, but by 2014 (after several seizures led to an epilepsy diagnosis) she was forced to retire from a career position after being declared totally disabled by her psychiatrist, who recommended she apply for Social Security benefits. We moved to another state to be closer to my family, and she resigned herself to part-time employment, at best. We were no longer insured, and she had to endure withdrawal from benzodiazapenes and SSRIs after suddenly stopping them when she was unable to obtain and pay for new prescriptions. Withdrawal from benzodiazapenes can and does cause seizures and death, but she made it through, vowing never to take them again. It was then that we began researching natural remedies and found kratom. \n\nWith no real expectations, she began using small quantities of kratom mixed into smoothies a couple of times a day. Almost immediately, she noticed an improvement in her anxiety and began sleeping through the night, something that hadnt occurred in years. She applied for a part-time data-entry position through a temp agency which quickly led to her being hired on to a full-time position. Data-entry led to a promotion to a software-testing position, and early this year, she applied for and obtained a promotion to her dream job within the same organization. The change has been profound from my point of view. None of her illnesses have been cured, but she has found a natural herbal supplement that has given her a foothold and allowed her to leave the house and has helped with her depression and anxiety. Shes happier and the PTSD symptoms like flashbacks have been kept at bay. We both feel immense gratitude to kratom for helping her get her life back. It would be beyond devastating to have that essential tool taken away.\n\nThe day back in August that we learned about the potential ban was one of the scariest days in either of our lives. For my wife, it was the potential loss of the most reliable way out of the darkness that she has yet found. For me, it was the potential loss of my wife. I sincerely hope that the stories you have heard since then lead to kratom remaining available to any adult who may find a use for it. Thank you for listening to our voices.\n\nSincerely, \n\nC.

I would like to voice my opposition to the DEAs Intent to Schedule the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, which would make Kratom (Mitragynaspeciosa), a schedule 1 controlled substance with no medicinal value. This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin.\t\n     I have been diagnosed with chronic migraine disorder which I have been suffering from for quite a number of years. I have been through countless doctors and specialists trying to find a solution to manage my extreme pain. Chronic migraine disorder is the 8th most disabling disease in the world with headaches that occur more than 15 times a month. I have been on preventative medications and triptan medications and have received Botox injections to try to help with my symptoms most of which I dont find much relief with. I have struggled with daily living from my disorder and find it very difficult to manage a job and hold on to my medical benefits which I so desperately need.\n    Im a responsible consumer of the botanical kratom. Through constant research for my disorder I came across Kratom which is a plant that grows in Asia that I read has benefits to those with chronic pain. Within one day of taking it I noticed I did not have a headache and the frequency of my pain from migraines was becoming less and less. This plant has given me my life back I feel. I am more of a productive person because of it. I have been able to return to work and I have a better quality of life now. Ive gone from having a daily headache or migraine to only a small amount in a month without any side effects. \n   Kratom is a safe herbal supplement that I believe should be accessible to any adult.

Kratom is an herbal tea closely related to coffee. It is so helpful to me because it does not have the negative side effects of prescription pain killers. Prescription pain killers can be very bad for diabetes. They can cause my blood sugars to spike and drop randomly, and have very negative effects on my liver and kidneys. Kratom does not effect my blood sugars negatively and my organs are not in any danger. Kratom is also the most effective medicine for my pain and swelling, the prescription pills just don't seem to get the job done and make me feel awful. It is not an addictive medicine either. It helps many people move past addiction to illicit substances and prescription pain meds. Please do not schedule Kratom, so many people depend on this harmless medicine for so many reasons.

I have metal rods (from 1992) fusing my back from top to bottom not to mention buldging disks in my neck and lower back pain below the rods.  I was on strong opiates for 2/3 of my life.  Finally a yr and a half ago i was switched to Methadone with a cocktail of other stuff and ended up passing out behind the wheel on my way to pick up my daughter from school and flipping my car and had ankle surgery.  I should have been dead but i think the Volvo I bought when i had my daughter saved me as many of the first responders, etc stated.  After that, i was done with opiates.  I was 34 when this happened and it was hell on earth trying to get off.  The kicks, the sweats, the vomiting.  I had to take weeks off of work to go through withdrawal (while on crutches) but i was introduced to Kratom.  It helped relieve some of the withdrawal and then helped with my chronic pain with no side effects.  I was not drowsy, i did not build a tolerance and many more im sure you already know.  I had my life back and could have fun with my daughter.  Im not sure if whoever is reading this has ever has chronic pain but it makes you mentally crazy.

I know thats not right, i am a highly educated person with a full time job.  Many doctors have told me to go on ss disability but i want to show my daughter what its like to be a strong role model.  Please leave Kratom on the shelves for people like me.  I am pretty sure you can't overdose and i think only about 1% of people are using it to get high.  I have gotten higher smelling whiteout so that is just crazy.  I also have ptsd and anxiety and it helps with all of that.  If you take this off the market, so many people like me may turn to hard opiates like heroine.  In my opinion, Kratom is safer that Tylenol and works better.  I don't want to live in pain.  Please don't do this, just leave Kratom for sale as is.  I understand if you want to put an age limit on it but you mght as well do that with coffee as well and outlaw cigarettes and alcohol.  They kill way more people than Kratom.  Thank you for listening to my story.  Please consider it in your decision making pricess.  Im happy to talk to you.    Thanks again.

I use many herbs for benefits they afford me, personally ( chamomile, valerian root, tumeric etc ), and Kratom has been incredibly beneficial for my pain, energy level and general sense of well being. It has been 8 years since I have taken a Dr prescribed opioid for my back pain. I am a great supporter for natural supplements for helping people, and my own research into Kratom's uses and benefits has only strengthened my appreciation for this herb.

I am a college graduate. I lost my ability to work in 2009 and have been approved to receive SSDI monthly. As most of you know, doctors no longer treat patients with chronic pain with opioids and after years of trying just about every other medication under the sun, with no pain relief, I was fortunate enough to find Kratom. This plant has literally saved my life. Suffering with the level of pain I have made me wish I was no longer living. This miracle plant has amazing pain blocking ability, I have safely used it for over 2 years now with no side effects. It gave me back the ability to be a mom again, it helps me to sleep and without the Kratom I rarely slept. I am even going to attempt to work part time at some point in the future, but if Kratom is banned then I will have not even entertain that idea. I truly believe this plant is tremendously safer than pain medications, and is a very safe alternative to them. If Kratom is banned it will alter the lives of so many people that are suffering tremendously and needlessly. I pray that you reconsider and research this plant more, you will find that it is very safe and very effective and helps SO many of us.

At that time, I was feeling the effects of an accident that I had suffered some years prior which included pain in both shoulders and my right knee. The pain was severe enough to warrant pain medication but I did not want to begin any such thing as opoids. I wanted something natural if it could be made to work. I discovered powdered kratom I made into a tea and consumed. The results were immediate and worth the effort. Please know that I was not sleeping well and enduring discomfort during the day. My doctor told me it was Arthritis aggravated by the accident. Kratom made my days and nights much more bearable.\nSince that time I have invented, and patented a device which I am in the process of marketing. I don't feel like a stereotypical addict, nor do I believe that my behavior is in any way indicative of addiction. I have stopped taking Kratom before when I have neglected to buy more. The pain has returned but there were certainly no withdrawals that I could see.( I don't have experience of withdrawal symptoms other than stopping coffee once). I have also never increased my dosage but the analgesic effects are still there.\nPlease do not make this beneficial plant illegal. It is, in my experience, innocuous and entirely benign.\nThank you for this opportunity to express my thoughts.\n\n ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19554","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Mr.","postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kirby Nance","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This product has been of enormous help to me with my chronic back pain and anxiety.

My name is Chris Hoffman, and I am 53 years old. I am a Chemical Engineer. I oppose the addition of Kratom, and the active alkaloids in the plant, to the category of Schedule 1 Controlled Substances. I began using Kratom in 2011 to help manage pain when I was unable to use OTC pain relievers due to limited kidney function caused by those same OTC pain relievers, namely Ibuprofen, but I can not use any other of the NSAIDs either. I did not want to become dependent on the opiate pain relievers and through research found out about Kratom, and gave it a try. I have found Kratom to be an excellent pain reliever with a minimum of side effects. I have discontinued using Kratom several times and found there were no problems of the sort encountered with other opiates with discontinued use - Kratom is not addictive. Nor have I had to increase the amount I use to obtain pain relief. If Kratom was to be made Schedule 1, important research on the plant would become difficult, and I would appreciate serious research on Kratom and its active alkaloids to determine scientifically their properties in order to find out how this plant could help people suffering from pain and opiate addiction, and to properly determine usage.\nIn conclusion, I have found Kratom to be safe and effective, and a good alternative to the opiate based drugs that cause so many problems, and would hate to see its promise destroyed by it being classified as a Schedule 1 Controlled Substance.\nSincerely,\nChristopher Hoffman","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16682","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Hoffman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is a terrible idea to ban a plant that grows straight from the soil we live on.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7494","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello My name is Andrew and I would share a sort story ,and how\nKratom has help me and even saved my life.Back in 2008 I was introduced to prescription painkillers,and quickly got addicted.Before I realized I was spending most of my money on anything I can get my hands on.For the next 4 years I was in a downward spiral taking dangerous amounts of hydrocodone,oxycodone,and even xanax.I knew if I didn't stop I was going to end up dead.I tried many times to quit,but the\nOpioid withdrawals were just too bad,and I ended up back on painkillers.After a few tries to get clean I was lossing hope then after I did some research I heard of a natural non toxic plant that people have been using for thousands of years for a variety health conditions name Kratom.I took a chance,and ordered some.Kratom is a god sent,as with weeks I was able to stop all prescription drug use.I am now 3 years clean,and I owe it all to kratom.Please help Kratom save more lives,and don't ban this non toxic plant that has never killed anyone.All the people that had Kratom in their system at time of death had a mix of other hardcore drugs like meth,heroin,and other prescription drugs.Kratom is a safe plant that millions of people are benefiting  from,and is a life saver.Thank you for reading my story,and God bless.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0487","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Oliva","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello:\n I am 62 yrs old veteran and have suffered from Depression, anxiety & PTSD all my life.

I began using Kratom in 2012, as an herbal supplement that was recommended to me for alleviating the symptoms of the anxiety that I had been experiencing for years, which burdened my life, in all areas, with many struggles and limitations. \n\nSince I began using the herbal supplement, Kratom, I no longer live with the struggles and limitations that were caused by anxiety, so the quality of my life has greatly improved in all areas. In addition to consistently and effectively alleviating my anxiety symptoms, Kratom has provided me with an increased energy level (which was previously low, due to the levels of anxiety I was experiencing), along with increased mental clarity and sharpened focus. \n\nThe energy increase and mental clarity / focus that I experience when taking Kratom is comparative to a cup of coffee in the morning, but it is a much more level, natural feeling without the jittery nervousness, or caffeine crash later in the day. In my experience, Kratom has always been a very mild feeling, herbal supplement with zero side effects and zero withdrawal symptoms. I've gone days and weeks without using Kratom, at various times over these years, and I have never experienced any withdrawal symptoms during those times, nor have I ever needed to increase my intake for effectiveness when using Kratom daily for months at a time.\n\nKratom is such an important resource for me to be able to maintain optimal health and quality of life, because in addition to the health benefits that I've experienced, it has given me a natural alternative to synthetic prescription drugs for anxiety which come with harmful side effects. Many people, including myself, seek natural supplements whenever possible and avoid prescriptions with harmful side effects, at all costs, to protect our health and doing that should be a fundamental, protected right and freedom for all. \n\nI am very concerned about the possibility of Kratom being made illegal and reclassified as a schedule one narcotic, because I believe that this would have an immensely negative effect on the quality of life and health of many others, besides my own. I truly and wholeheartedly believe that banning Kratom would be a tragic mistake, a potentially life threatening, if not fatal one for those whose lives have been so greatly improved by it, like the many military veterans who are using Kratom to help with their PTSD, or the many opiate addicts who are using Kratom to combat their addiction and the many people suffering with chronic pain who have found relief with Kratom.\n\nThe United States of America is the land of the free, and we have made great strides in recent years to ensure that we are living up to that ideal, which so many Americans have died for throughout our history. For example, we are beginning to see the legalization of marijuana happen from state to state which is greatly helping to improve the lives of many medicinal users with chronic illnesses, as it will help in saving our tax dollars by reserving prison space for criminals that pose a true danger to society. That was a very progressive and successful move towards our national ideals of freedom. \n\nBanning Kratom would not only directly oppose and contradict those ideals, but it would be very costly to tax payers, because it would fill our prisons with non violent offenders that pose no threat to society and are simply seeking to improve their health with a natural herbal supplement, that taken alone, has never proven to hurt anyone. Banning Kratom would be a hugely regressive failure, as the vast majority of Americans would find out that it is an unnecessary infringement on our freedoms with scientists already proving it's harmlessness and potential benefits, so it would inevitably create a movement of opposition, a rising of American people demanding that Kratom be legalized once again. Banning Kratom would be the ultimate offense against the people of a nation that stands for freedom and justice for all.\n\nI am requesting that the DEA, please, take into consideration that no one has been proven to have been hurt by taking Kratom alone, and to please, consider the many lives that will be adversely affected, if no longer allowed access to this herbal supplement. I am requesting that the DEA, in good conscience and in upholding of the values of the United States of America, please, keep this harmless plant, a natural, herbal supplement, legal for the good of all.  \n\nThank you for allowing this time for public comments to take our concerns into consideration, and for taking all facts, evidence and thorough scientific research into consideration, prior to making this extremely important and life altering decision.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nDiana Morton\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23174","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Diana Morton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May concern,\nI am a year old scientific professional working at a non profit  institute as a Flow Cytometry specialist.   I started using Kratom about 1 year ago.  Since I was 13, I've suffered from a hormone disorder Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.  Some of the systems involve major anxiety, panic attacks, foggy brain, and unbelievable sadness.  I've found it hard to function at times.  I've been on a couple of antidepressants, birth control, and xanax to deal with the problems associated with this disorder.  There isn't much that you can do.  Although Xanax helped, I could only take it at night because it knocked me out and I was extremely worried about becoming addicted to it.  So, I usually wait till I'm pretty bad off before I take it.  A friend on mine suggested that I use Kratom and what a difference it made!  I felt normal.  i was able to focus, sleep better, and be more productive and calm.  It changed my life.  I felt hopeful for once in my life!  Because it's not addictive for me,  I felt comfortable to use it when for as few or more times as I need to help with my PMDD symptoms.  \nSomeone in my professional needs to interact with many researchers in collaboration.  It takes a calm focused brain to troubleshoot and deal with issues concerning projects or people.  When I heard that the DEA was going to put kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances, I was shocked.  How can Kratom be classified with other substances that stop productivity, destroy families, and destroy a person's well being?  I don't feel that with Kratom at all.  In fact, it gave me MY LIFE back.  Therefore, I strongly OPPOSE Kratom being classified as a Schedule 1 Controlled substance.  \n\nAmy Cortez","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5272","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amy Cortez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"FR Doc # 2016-24659\n\nPlease see that kratom stays available for medical use as a non controlled substance.

I personally have lost friends to the powerful and evil opiate epidemic. It truly is a disease in disguise, we lose 1 in 7 people to the addiction of opiates. Yes you can make the case that kratom is mind altering. Yet so coffe we have also allowed mind altering substances like alcohol. Which in my opinion is one of the worst drugs on the open market. I do feel you guys should really invest in some more research into this plant. It has been used for years and years throughout history, yet we have never really done any research to prove or disprove it's validity of a drug or a supplement.

I first learned about kratom a year ago.  I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and rheumatoid arthritis.  Kratom helps me tremendously with my anxiety and joint pain.  I have had some personal issues with opiate abuse in the past and kratom has been the best option for me.  The effects for me are subtle, but excellent.  This herb has allowed me to get my life back without relying on pharmaceuticals.  I have three young boys and am a busy mom.  I am constantly running around with them and need a clear head.  This is not possible with Norco or Percocet.  They cloud my judgement and I don't feel safe driving while taking them.  I have anxiety and joint pain every day.  Pharmaceuticals are not a good option for me because I don't want to become dependent on an opioid pain medication.  Kratom allows me to function well and participate in my daily activities with my children.  I have never had any negative side effects from kratom.  I feel like it is a safe and perfect option for me.  Making kratom illegal would severely impact my life negatively.  I try to treat my disorders in the safest and cleanest way possible.

The body naturally expels the kratom by making you vomit in such a way that you won't do it again.\n\nIt allows a better dialogue with my physician, because as of now it is comparable to discuss using it as similar to taking valerian or melatonin. To schedule it makes it as difficult to tell your doctor as if you were using heroin. The more people share with their doctors, the more anecdotal evidence that can be collected to study its use. Even though marijuana can be used in some states, not everyone (including me) can tolerate the high that comes with it. Kratom does not space you out, it just leaves you relieved of pain and somewhat energized.

I started taking it when my pain management Doctor retired. Finding a good pain doctor is a lot harder than you might imagine. Esp after so many were abusing the system. Well, I had no choice but to try anything to function. ( my spine injuries are quite severe, permanent damage to my nerves) With out Kratom I would have committed suicide. Many many adults I know use it for many reasons. I myself am in my 30s, and feel truly blessed to have found this plant. If you take this away, people like myself will resort  to harsher pharmaceutical drugs, or street drugs to find some relief. And I for one will never live on medication again. It can and does ruin the quality of life for many. I lost my whole family  because I had to constantly increase my doses, and with the stigma associated with having a high dose, I was ridiculed and looked at like a junkie. Kratom has never killed anyone, pain meds, heroin and the like do. I will continue to take Kratom even if you choose to be ignorant  and schedule it. It is so much better than that poison being pumped into millions by big pharm. I am a capitalist, conservative and have no ill feelings towards businesses like pharmaceutical groups, but they don't  care about me, they care about making me a lifetime customer........  This plant doesn't make anyone high, maybe a little euphoric, but far less than any alcohol.

When I was initially injured, I was prescribed narcotic painkillers and rapidly developed an addiction which ended up costing me a great job, a marriage, a home, and several years of my life, as well as my previously spotless legal record when at the age of 32 I was charged with fraudulent attempt to obtain a controlled substance when I tried to call in a prescription on my own.  The judge was sympathetic and told me he didn't think I was a criminal, but an addict, and I ended up in a long term recovery program when I couldn't kick it on my own. I haven't touched a narcotic since...but it didn't mean the pain wasn't still there. After a chat with a man I met at a local health food store, I did some research and decided to give kratom a try. I've never second-guessed this decision! I feel like I have my life back!! Not only does it significantly reduce my level of pain... unlike the poisons the pharmaceutical industry pushes down people's throats, kratom does not put me in a brain fog. Quite the opposite actually! Taking kratom is very uplifting and I feel energetic, clear-headed, and happy! If I happen to run out or miss a dose, there are no terrible withdrawal symptoms and I don't feel compelled to rush out to get a \"fix\" by any means necessary. \nKratom has been a total game changer for myself and many many others I've met both in person and online. I've turned several personal friends on to it and their experiences are identical to my own.  To outlaw this amazing plant, while maintaining the legality of deadly poisons pushed on innocent people by the medical and pharmaceutical companies would be nothing more than another example of corporate greed. God made this truly spectacular plant with the ability to help people, while the doctors and pharma companies are only interested in getting people hooked on their dope so they have to keep coming back...I speak from personal experience as a victim of their schemes. \nPlease allow common sense and reason to rule the day! I do not want to go back to being in excruciating pain most of the time, and I certainly am never going to think about letting a doctor try to prescribe me a deadly poison again! Life has been so much better for me and so many others thanks to kratom!!!

There are hundreds of thousands of people, Luke myself, who use this wonderful plant to avoid all of the harmful effects of prescription narcotics. I suffer from System Lupus and have been on a myriad of pain medications and steroids. One of those pain medications began causing me to have severe grand mal seizures in June of 2013. My children watched their mother convulse helplessly waiting on paramedics. Since that time, I have discontinued all narcotic pain medications and rely soley on kratom to keep me mobile. Without it, I am bedridden with pain and fatigue. Kratom is a safe alternative to dangerous pharmaceutical drugs with none of the nasty side effects. Not one death has occurred from kratom use alone. Thousands die every day due to prescription drug overdoses. There are also many other Americans utilizing kratom to overcome narcotic addictions. People that otherwise would continue to abuse things such as heroin or prescription drugs. Kratom allows them to discontinue such drugs safely by reducing kratom and easing the debilitating symptoms of withdrawal. Banning this amazing plant would have severe consequences for so many Americans left with few other options. Studies have shown kratom to be a safe alternative. Laborers in Thailand have used this plant for thousands of years to treat several things with no I'll effects. Kratom does not cause the \"high\" typically associated with narcotics. It allows the user to experience relief from their symptoms without the loopy fatigue side effects commonly associated with narcotic medications.  I urge you to take our pleas into consideration.

Kratom is one such alternative, and I can tell you that it has a very positive use, and reclassifying this substance would be a true crime!\n\nMy wife is just one example.  She was in a terrible car accident as a teen- nearly 40 years ago.  She was not expected to live. Her pelvis was crushed, her spleen, gall bladder and a good part of her liver were removed. Her intestines were \"replumbed\" for lack of an easier description.  She has been in pain ever since and always will be.  In recent years, she has had breast cancer, and a host of other afflictions, such as server type 1 diabetes, gastroparesis, fybromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and depression. Her afflictions are severe enough that she is disabled and cannot work. It's a challenge for her to do basic things. Her having access to decent pain medication means the difference between her lying in bed all day because of the pain, etc., or being able get out bed and do a few things.\nOxycodone helps to a large degree, but it is getting harder to get and we fear someday it may be outlawed.  It also has it's own issues and is not a perfect drug. It aggravates her gastroparesis and sometimes gives her migraines. \n\nKratom helps reduce some of her pain and does not have the side effects that oxycodone has... however, it is not anywhere near as strong.  It does reduce her pain to some degree, but it also helps a lot with her mood and depression...again with far fewer side effects that prescription drugs.  The fact that it helps with depression and pain, is a wonderful thing!!!\n\nKratom is a wonderful plant that should be embraced.  I think we could learn a lot from it.  I cannot help but think that big pharma may be behind pushing the DEA for this ban... it's sad for people like my wife, who find it a tremendous help.\n\nThe government seems to be really down on anything that has to do with pain killers.  They can be dangerous.  They have their issues.  What I would like you and all politicians to keep in mind is this:  Put yourself in the shoes of somebody that has permanent pain issues. They are not all drug addicts. They hurt.  ALL the time.  They would gladly accept the chance that it might one day kill them-because it makes the difference between not being able to get out of bed vs. being able to have at least some functionality and a chance to do a few things that most of us take for granted every single day.\n\nThank you for your time..\nPlease help keep Kratom legal.\n\nSteve Thornton","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18169","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"steve thorntonn","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom this may concern,\n\nI am Adam Dewey, age 32, and and educator.

I have been prescribed pharmaceuticals for these disorders, all of which had created a chemical dependency and in a particular case with Zoloft, I suffered a heat stroke. Kratom offers a natural alternative to the dangerous pharmaceuticals that are handed out by doctors across the country. Please consider this when considering whether to ban kratom or not.

I first tried kratom about 8 years ago as an alternative to opiate pain medications because the opiates had turned me from an active, motivated person into a person who was lethargic, unable to feel normal emotions, and feeling dependent on narcotics to survive with the debilitating pain. Well, not only was I able to get off of the opiate meds I began to feel like my old self again and the pain was managed by the kratom. I've not had to keep increasing the amount of kratom I take like with the opiates for them to work. I feel strongly that it would be a great mistake to make kratom illegal in the US as it has helped many people to quit potentially dangerous medications. Kratom is a harmless plant that should be studied for it's pain relieving properties and it's ability to help people to get off narcotic pain medications.\nSincerely,\nHoward Jones","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18047","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Howard Jones","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is KATIE and I am 30 years old. I am a wife and a mother of two daughters. I work part time and stay at home taking care of my family. I suffer from degenerative disc disease and sciatica. Before March 3rd, 2016 I had been  on pain pills for over 9 years. I battled with opiate addiction and pain pill abuse for many many years. The pain was unbearable without the pills. The pills would be gone within a week and I would scrounge and suffer, steal and borrow. I wasn't myself anymore. I was an addict. March 3rd I took my last pill. I started ingesting kratom to help with the pain and the withdrawals.  Kratom saved my life and I say that wholeheartedly. I am no longer an addict and I am no longer in pain. I take kratom daily with orange juice for my back pain. I am a functioning human for once. It has made me a better person and changed people's lives. I think that people in the United States should have the right to ingest a life saving plant if they so choose. Especially when it can save precious lives.

While taking care of my mother as she was dying from breast cancer, I sustained several injuries, including two herniated discs in my neck. At the time I was uninsured, working full-time for a small business that had no benefit package, I would end up in the Emergency Room at least once a month because the pain was so excruciating. I Seriously considered suicide, stress increased the pain and muscle cramps, but I had no way to treat or address my injuries without insurance. I researched dozens of herbal remedies and tried several, the only one that gave me any relief is Kratom. Today, I have insurance through my employer, and have a prescription for Tramadol. I still use Kratom on occasion when the Tramadol just doesnt cut it, but my doctor now wants to wean me off the Tramadol because at this point it is potentiating my pain and wreaking havoc on my system, and I am addicted. I wish I had just stuck with the Kratom. I have never experienced a negative side effect from Kratom except for mild nausea. I wish the DEA would research Kratom before making any decisions that will negatively impact thousands of people who have come to rely on Kratom. I do not believe it is a dangerous drug. \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14578","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Beth Brubaker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't take this herb from us.

The second surgery was a success.  I was no longer in serious danger but I  developed severe nerve pain in my arms that was making it almost impossible to even simply sit at my desk and type.  I went back to my neurosurgeon and received further MRI's to find the issue.  He confirmed I was in no danger and that I was lucky that all I had to deal with was the nerve pain.  He was was not being insensitive.  He was stating a fact. I needed the surgery to avoid nerve damage but my spinal column was still very narrow and would continue to irritate the nerves there.  Further surgery was not a viable option as a good outcome was not likely from more expansive surgical correction.  Opioid pain killers such as Vicodin or Oxycontin were also not an option because the pain was not going to subside and I would have become dependent on such substances.  Over the counter pain relief medication had no effect.\n\nMy quality of life was declining.  It was difficult to ever be in a good mood. I was quite literally living in constant pain, on the pain scale of 1-10, I hovered between 4 to 7 24 hours a day. (For reference, I have had kidney stones and I know what a proper 10 feels like on that scale.)  I was prescribed gabapentin (and still am) but in doses high enough to properly control the pain I would start having sleep attacks (narcolepsy) and that is a very dangerous way to live.\n\nMy wife was worried about me and did internet research on some options and she came across information about mitragyna speciosa and how it had helped some people with similar issues. I had little to lose and since it was completely legal it was as easy as ordering it online.  A little bit of research of first hand accounts helped me choose a reputable vendor online.\n\nI just bought crushed leaf powder in bags. I tried several different strains, all a little different (as advertised) and was able to find one that not only knocked the pain all the way... that's ALL THE WAY out but it also counteracted the lethargy caused by the gabapentin.  All of a sudden I was productive at work again, I felt whole and happy and my home life improved. All of the work around the house that had been piling up I was able to slowly get through.  It worked.  Very well.  Better than anything the doctor had at his disposal to prescribe. I do complex technical planning and troubleshooting for a living (IT Manager). I was able to take mitragyna speciosa at work without hiding anything from my employer.  My performance was top notch. My employer had no issue with my behavior or state of mind.  Quite the contrary.\n\nMy wife worried after several months of my regularly using Kratom (mitragyna speciosa) that this plant might be dangerous and that by now I might be addicted since few things in life are that simple.  She compelled me to go have full a blood workup done to assess any damage. I complied.  My blood work came back perfectly normal except for my predictably high triglycerides (pre-existing). She then asked me to stop taking it for a while to see if I could.  I was worried.  I kind of assumed I would have to deal with a terrible withdrawl.  I was worried I would no longer be able to use this plant that helped so much.  But I quit.  Cold Turkey. I was pretty grumpy for 3 or 4 days honestly.  I slept more than usual.  Nerve pain came back LOUD. A rebound effect I guess. I went to work. I took care of my responsibilities. It was just a little harder.  About day 5 I woke up feeling back to normal.  Right back where I was before I ever took Kratom. I did not take it again for about 6 weeks. I discussed it with my wife that I was sick of dealing with the old nerve pain when I knew there was an answer.  She agreed and I started taking Kratom again. My dosages didn't creep up.  Every three months I stopped for a couple of weeks with the exact same results.  No big deal.  Safe stuff.  It even lowered my blood pressure a little.\n\nIn summary. While I very much disagree with the FDA/DEA decision to even get involved, I stopped using Kratom in mid-September to avoid being made a criminal. If made illegal, I will not use it again. I will suffer. It hurt to type this letter.  I have used several vendors over the 2 years since I found Kratom. All of them were reputable.\n\nPlease abandon this witch hunt and leave Kratom off of your schedule. Should people really go to prison or even be killed by police over a leaf that gave me my life back?\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0527","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it. \nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars. \nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement. \nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down. \nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids. \nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose. \n\n\nReally looks like the DEA officers are looking for was to justify their lofty jobs.

It's value as a treatment for addiction to prescription painkillers and other opiates cannot be understated. It is also of tremendous benefit to Americans suffering from PTSD and other forms of anxiety and mental health issues. \n\nThere are many people extremely knowledgable and informed on the benefits of this kratom. I would encourage opening up a discussion with the award-winning documentary director Chris Bell on the topic. There has been no evidence of deaths directly related to kratom. It is extremely important we continue allow Americans access to the kratom plant and fund research into the plant to discover all the benefits it has to offer. The more research done on kratom, the more mis-information and negative mis-conceptions will be dispelled. \n\nI look forward to more open discussion about kratom and its beneficial uses.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- whom do you serve?  The people, or some distant companies?  Remember why the FDA and the DEA formed in the first place: to protect us.

Before switching to kratom, I had tried a number of different anti-depressants and anxiety medications.\n\nThe anti-depressants made me feel like a zombie. Life barely seemed worth living. The anxiety meds that the doctor gave me made me very tired. All the time. My doctor did not like the idea of me switching to kratom. Instead he wanted to up the dosage on my medications. Coming off the anxiety meds was extremely difficult. My doctor had told me that those RX meds were \"unlikely to show noticeably addictive properties\".\n\nAnyways at this point I have been off over prescription meds for over four years. I no longer use kratom daily. At this point I only use it during the winter months, as I am prone to seasonal depression. Kratom truly has saved my life. It is much safer then the RX drugs. The side effects are minimal in comparison to the pharmaceuticals that I have tried.\n\nMore and more people are switching to kratom as a natural alternative to pharmaceuticals. It is a safer and more effective than many dangerous and addictive medications. Of course there are situations in which prescription meds are a better choice, but it is imperative that people may retain the right to choose a natural alternative.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2428","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For the first time, I have found a product that completely relieves pain.

I've taken it for a year now. Got me off suboxone, oxycodone and opiates in general. Easily. Got off kratom a month later to test the withdraw. Virtually none. The \"overdose\" of kratom is nausea, slight nausea. Eat somthing it helps. Honestly kratom is relaxing similar to coffee. There are many kinds but three types. Green, white, and red. Green= stimulating/pain reducing; white= stimulating/pain reducing/doesn't last as long as green but don't need as much; red= pain reducing/slight relaxing great once off work. Kratom takes as much pain away as vicodin or morphine BUT DOESN'T IMPAIR THE USER LIKE STRONG OPIATES. Basically, in my opinion, kratom is an organic substitution IF YOU HAVE THE WILL POWER to get off stronger opiates, it can give you energy similar to an energy drink (5 hour energy), and treats pain SO WELL! It also treats depression/anxiety. You need will power to take kratom if you want to substitute strong opiate addiction because IT'S NOWHERE NEAR AS STRONG AS EVEN VICODIN! It's mostly stimulating. Any other drug overpowers it! Examples: XANAX, OTHER OPIATES, weed, and alcohol. Kratom is not an enhancer drug. Just leave the kratom community alone. If you illegalize kratom YOU WILL BE WASTING TAX PAYERS MONEY AND MAKING THE SITUATION WORSE!! Maybe that's what you want? Kratom definitely helps people. It doesn't hurt anyone at ALL! Trust the people who take it and don't lie!

Upon hearing that kratom was natural and used for a long time in southeast Asia I decided that I wanted to see if it could help get me motivated to move on with my life.

There is no argument that the classical opiods are wreaking havoc on the world today, but Kratom could offer a route into the same or similar pain-killing mechanisms while demonstrating less risky tenencies, for example a lower mu-opiod affinity couple with higher agonist actions at the other key receptors involved in pain relief. A cursory look at some of the new synthetic opiods (tapentadol for example) proves pain--management can be pharmocologically efficient while minimizing the sedative and risky side eddects.

This is Dennis Pelton. I am writing you today in order to voice my concern about the DEA banning the mitragyna speciosa (kratom) tree. I was first diagnosed with clinical depression at age 16. I am now 43 years of age. Since age 16 I have tried every pharmaceutical drug available to treat biochemical depression. None of them helped my condition. I only found relief for my life threatening condition after discovering & consuming kratom leaves. \n     I have successfully used the leaves to treat my condition for the past 8 years with no negative side effects. If the kratom ban actually get's enforced. My greatest concern is for those that have served our Country & have come back from Iraq/Afghanistan & use kratom to treat permanent injuries that they have suffered overseas. I also feel for the elderly that use kratom to treat arthritis, fibromyalgia & many other medical disorders. The leaves of the kratom tree are saving hundreds of thousands of lives. Many will be forced to choose between staying alive & functional or obeying the arbitrary whim of the DEA and possibly dying! Or at the very least going back to a miserable life of suffering! For many this is not just a difference of opinion. It's a difference between life or death! \n     The banning of kratom will also be a burden to the health care system, insurance & government. Thousands are functional only because of kratom. Without access to this miracle plant they will go back to collecting a disability check instead of being a productive member of society. Kratom is paid for by the consumers. Not by insurance corporations or government (tax payer). However, if kratom is no longer accessible. People will have no choice but to go back to burdening the health care system & government. \n     Furthermore, has anyone actually taken the time to think about what the enforcement of this kratom ban would even look like? Picture wheelchair bound Iraq & Afghanistan veterans in handcuffs! Picture grandmothers suffering from fibromyalgia in handcuffs! This is after DEA thugs dressed in all black, wearing black ski masks kick in their front door! Videos of wheelchair bound disabled people in handcuffs being wheeled off to prison! Then after they get bailed out of jail they tell the press how they had DEA thugs point fully automatic weapons at their heads! It would be a public relations nightmare for the DEA!\n     In closing I strongly encourage you to join Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Congressmen Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Congressmen Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.) & their colleagues to stop the ban of the mitragyna speciosa (kratom) tree. Take care & may God bless you.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nDennis Pelton","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17482","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dennis Pelton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\nMy name is Alexander Tomaino and I am a mental therapist.

I personally have not had insurance, as it is simply not an option for people ,financially, pursuing a dream like this. In 2014 I decided to return to school, and take my first fight in 4 years.

I was successful, however the anxiety remained. I tried plenty of other natural remedies but nothing worked. I heard about kratom from another group I was in, about a year ago & decided to try it, as the anxiety was crippling. After doing some research as to the best strain to treat my symptoms, I purchased some. After taking it for the first time, my anxiety vanished! No high, no unusual feelings - just complete anxiety relief! It has been a life changer for me.\n\nI oppose the ban of kratom. To classify it as a Schedule 1 drug just boggles my mind! It is a natural herb that has only helped people. It has helped people who were addicted to opiates, it has helped people who were bedridden due to pain & it has helped people like myself who suffer from other ailments such as anxiety & depression. In my opinion, it should be available as a natural alternative to prescription ( addicting!) drugs.\n\nI thank you for listening & hope you reconsider this ban! It has only helped people - not hurt them.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2197","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Donna ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"if, YES, IF... the dea really want to stop DRUG ABUSE...

I ask that you please reconsider making kratom illegal.  It has helped many people, myself included,  with a variety of issues, and has potential to help many more if medical research is allowed to continue.  \n\nI first tried kratom a little over two years ago, after hearing reports that it had helped some people with anxiety and depression.  I have have struggled with these issues since I was  teenager--over the course of the last 15 years, I have seen all sorts of therapists and psychiatrists, taken part in in-patient and out-patient programs, been prescribed the gamut of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications.  I stopped taking these medications about five years ago, as they just didn't seem to be helping, and they had become difficult and expensive to obtain due to to insurance issues.  As I struggled to cope with these issues on my own, my relationships with my family and my self-confidence suffered.  I floundered in a dead-end job and took one or two classes at a time at the local college, just barely passing.\n\nIn the time since I started using kratom, I buckled down and finished my degree at the state university, driving two hours every day to get to/from class.  I have found confidence in myself and direction in my life.  My relationships with my family have vastly improved, and I am valued in my position at work, doing something I enjoy and believe in.\n\nI choose to use kratom almost everyday, and for me, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.  Kratom is a supplement with subtle effects, the intensity of which are on par with coffee.  It doesn't get me high.  Kratom is not a cure, but it has been a very useful tool in helping me deal with my anxiety and depression, and I can say emphatically that my life has improved in almost every way in the two years I have been using it.\n\nThe people who report having a negative experience with kratom are not the majority.  Many thousands of responsible adults in the United States choose to use kratom for their own reasons, without ill effect.  Please do not outlaw a mild supplement that has more potential to help than to hurt.  Thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nRespectfully,\nLaura Huebner","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13020","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laura Huebner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep kratom legal - it helps a great deal with my restless  leg syndrome and headaches.\n\nThank you!!\n\nG.

I don't agree that the public should be forced to take Big Pharma approved narcotics that only lead to addiction and infinite amounts of harmful side effects and the further growth of Big Pharmas' pocketbooks. Kratom is a natural substance from Earth and it happens to be able to relieve pain for people who can't find relief anywhere else, to take that away without evidence proving that it is detrimental to the health of the public seems very biased towards the pharmaceutical companies that are losing money due to people choosing Kratom over the narcotics doctors over prescribe. If there are synthetic pain killers prescribed everyday to people with tons of harmful side effects and severe addictive tendencies, why is it that Kratom is being considered too harmful based on frequent urination and loss of appetite? There needs to be much more research done before this product is banned from the U.S. with extensive evidence to prove it is more harmful than the thousands of narcotics that are supported by the F.D.A and other entities.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3003","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped so many people banning it or making it illegal is simply not justified and a complete overstep of authority nothing in the constitution grants the authority to ban it ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13575","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Corry Brown","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Argumentum ab inconvenienti est validum in lege; quia lex non permittit aliquod inconveniens.

After a serious accident in 2012, I unfortunately developed an addiction to prescription opiate painkillers.  Kratom was instrumental in defeating this addiction, and I have been opiate-free for almost two years.\n\nNone of my experience with kratom has been negative, I don't feel that there are any downsides including physical or mental addiction.  There have been virtually no noticeable side effects or other health effects.  My physician is aware of how I used kratom and cannot find where kratom has caused any danger to my physical or mental health--in fact, quite the opposite.  I had also been treated for anxiety and depression and since I began using kratom somewhat regularly I have completely stopped medication for the issues without any negative effects.\n\nI feel that the scheduling of kratom is heavy-handed and misguided.  I am of the belief that there are ulterior motives for some to try to influence the DEA and I hope that the DEA will make a fair and unbiased study of the benefits before taking such a draconian measure.  Looking at the original temporary ban, there are more than a few unsubstantiated claims and some that are absolutely false.  \n\nKratom does not, in my opinion, pose any danger to the public health.  It is not, as has been stated, an opiate, but rather a member of the coffee family.  Scheduling kratom as a schedule 1 drug will not only harm people who use it therapeutically, but will in my opinion cause an increase in the opiate epidemic that is harming so many Americans.\n\nPlease reconsider the scheduling of kratom.\n\nThank you,\nMark Wothe","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13600","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Wothe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing in support of the use of Kratom as a natural nutritional supplement.

As a teenager I used drugs to try to combat this. As an adult I spent many years drinking heavily. My drinking would lead to me doing bad things that I wouldn't normally do and most of the time couldn't even remember what I had done. I went to an alcoholic rehab at one point because of this. I have also seen many psychiatrists over the years and been prescribed a variety of medicines. Some have helped while others have had terrible side effects.\n\nAbout three years ago I came across something called Kratom. I found that it didn't get me high but did elevate my mood and reduced the depression. I have taken Kratom almost daily during this period. I finally stopped drinking altogether about 2 years ago. I have had no cravings for alcohol while using Kratom.\n\nIs Kratom safe? I've taken it daily for about three years and I seem to be healthy. Is it addictive? I would consider it about like coffee. I have gone without it for a couple of weeks at a time and the withdrawals were minimal. This plant is certainly safer and less addictive than both alcohol and cigarettes - both of which are legal. \n\nNow, the DEA has decided that they want to list Kratom as a schedule 1 substance. This means they think it is comparable to marijuana, lsd, etc. To me this is absurd but if I continue to use Kratom if the ban goes through then I could become a felon and go to jail if caught.\n\nKratom has helped thousands of people with pain disorders, depression, and many other ailments. It has helped me immensely. Now a bunch of unelected officials have decided that I can't have it anymore. I am 47 years old and I feel that if I want to eat a plant then I think I should be able to. I'm not hurting anyone. Isn't this America? Shouldn't we be free to pursue happiness if it doesn't hurt anyone else?\n\nPlease do not make Kratom a schedule one drug. It should be treated as a supplement. If this ban goes through, you will be turning normal everyday people into criminals. Is this what we want to do to people who only want to treat their pain, depression, and possibly treat their other more dangerous addictions?\n\nSincerely,\nAnthony Marshall\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2113","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anthony Marshall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I use Kratom every day.

Ever since graduating school and assuming a full-time position (an \"upright\" one, at that), I've dealt with a significant amount of back pain--significant not in its severity, but in its unrelenting presence--as well as the fatigue and stress that come with any job where your entire day is spent on your feet, often with the phone pressed between your shoulder and your ear. After several failed attempts to find something \"wrong\" with me (X-rays, MRI, ultrasound, etc.), I was starting to consider seeing a pain management specialist (and there are several in the vicinity of my work, so I was familiar with the types of treatment they offer). Still, I was hesitant, because without an official diagnosis, and an unwillingness to \"play up\" my pain level on command, I doubted they'd take me seriously. Plus, I got to see the cycle of dependency on a daily basis--patients who started out with a broken arm or some surgical procedure being prescribed short-term opioids, which gradually turns into long-term use, until they're referred to pain management where regular, around-the-clock opioids become a staple of the patient's regimen indefinitely (unless they're weaned off with an expensive prescription of suboxone, which often turns into an indefinite treatment itself). Luckily, it was right around this time that I discovered kratom. I was extremely skeptical that it would do anything, but within 30 minutes or so of consuming it for the first time, there was a mild but noticeable lift in my mood and energy, which then seemed to make the nagging pain more tolerable. After an initial period of finding the right level for me, I was able to take it at work, and get reliable relief that was just enough to enable me to smile and be engaged with our patients, even at the end of a 12 hour shift. The effects are about as noticeable as a strong cup of coffee (maybe two), but instead of being solely a nervous, jittery buzz, it provides a balanced sense of clarity and well-being. I've been taking kratom for nearly four years now, and have not had to escalate my usage to achieve the same effects. I've discussed it with my primary care physician, and he is thrilled that I've found something natural that alleviates my discomfort without putting me at the unnecessary risk associated with prescription pain killers. If a kratom ban were to go into effect, my quality of life would be significantly reduced without access to this safe, beneficial herb. Beyond that, I fear the quality of my care towards others would likewise be diminished--it's hard to be a truly good listener and problem-solver when all you can think about is how badly you want to sit down. With tobacco-related health care costs in the billions and ~480,000 deaths annually (CDC figures), I cannot understand why *this* harmless plant would be seen as posing an \"imminent threat\" to public safety. Additionally, considering the scope and severity of the current heroin/opioid epidemic, in my professional opinion it would be significantly *more* harmful to make a safe, natural alternative unavailable.

I am a loving husband and father of one son. I am writing to express my disapproval of the DEAs intent to place kratom on the Schedule I list of controlled substances. Kratom has helped me maintain a healthy, active lifestyle, and to be a better father and a more engaged, productive professional. Criminalizing kratom would result in a huge setback for people who -- like me -- have found a way to help improve their lives in a natural way. We are harmless, and only interested in being the best parents, professionals, and humans we can be.\n\nI discovered kratom in 2011. At the time, I was heavily medicated for depression, overweight, and had no energy to spend time playing with my four year-old son. I was falling asleep at my desk at work and struggling to be productive. I was also drinking at least several days per week. After a week of trying kratom, I had energy again. Within a month, I was playing kickball in the backyard with my son, even after a long day's work. Instead of taking naps after work while he watched TV, I was a dad again. At work, I began contributing again, and it was quite a novelty not to nod off during a meeting!\n\nToday, my career is back on track. Im working to improve my skills as a software engineer daily (and nightly). I now work out four times a week and enjoy power lifting, and am about thirty pounds lighter than I was five years ago. My interest in/desire for alcohol has also decreased, and my alcohol intake is limited to weekends. Overall, I am a healthier and happier person. While I wouldnt make the claim that kratom has been a panacea, I can say it has been a catalyst thats driven me to make better lifestyle decisions and ultimately become a healthier person.\n\nPlease consider the thousands of us who are good, decent, tax-paying citizens. We are loyal employees, spouses, and devoted parents who simply want to be healthy. Undoubtedly, the pharmaceutical industry has -- and will continue to -- provide important and life-saving drugs. That doesnt mean that we shouldnt have the choice to seek alternative natural treatments for ourselves. We are not criminals.\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1035","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rob Seaver","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have a family member that has 2 herniated discs in his back along with other ailments and when his back goes out he uses muscle-relaxers, codeine, Oxycotin, etc. pills to get him through the pain.

Hundreds of  thousands of people like me drink Kratom tea as an herbal supplement in order to avoid worse more dangerous remedies such as using escalating but ineffective quantities of addictive drugs riddled with serious side effects.  The proposed action to criminalize Kratom tea, even temporarily, should be tabled/denied/ never implemented for many valid reasons:\n\n1.\tEven if Kratom tea drinkers were forced to use conventional opioid therapy, it is unlikely our doctors would prescribe adequate pain relief, due to the stigma of long term opioid use.  \n2.\tI am able to live a productive life as an asset to society because of herbal supplements, like Kratom.  My positive function in society and the work place  would not be possible without kratom, as I would be less able, or unable to maintain the most basic functions of my job either because I will be wracked with pain or because I would be dependent on medication in quantities that would cause side effects that are dangerous to the work place.\n3.\tCriminalizing, prohibiting and unreasonably restricting Kratom will have many other harsh consequences such as:   legal operating Kratom vendors/businesses will have  shut down; people drinking Kratom tea to fight pain, or keep from using addictive drugs will have to obtain $$$ medical services; law enforcement will have to spend time and money on arresting and prosecuting older adults, 50+ year olds,  for drinking Kratom tea, instead of investigating criminals for real crimes; legally abiding Canadian citizens would be violating very serious drug laws if they brought their Kratom tea to the US with them on vacation or visiting (legal herbal supplement in Canada, as it has been here for years) and many others too numerous to write.\n4.\tEven temporarily criminalizing and unreasonably restricting Kratom will cause harm, to me, and many others, and prevent none.   If Kratom is criminalized and unreasonably restricted, it should remain legal and its use unimpeded while all appeals and studies are being conducted, and Kratom should NOT be temporarily prohibited while these matters are decided.  Hundreds of thousands of people in the US, like me,  have been safely using this supplement for many years, and there have been virtually no negative harmful, deadly, or more than minor, incidents compared to the number of people using Kratom supplement tea.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21397","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Abigail LandesonAnonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"natural meds should be up to yourself and your doctor. the gov. needs to keep out of it!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2798","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"karen whitt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, the united states has no right to tell me what I put into my body assuming I am not also committing an actual crime that directly harms someone else.

I used to be an alcoholic. I used to be able to drink more than A fifth of 80 proof liquor in A day. I have used Kratom for almost three years. One reason I use Kratom because it takes away my urge to drink. I live A healthier lifestyle because I no longer am an alcoholic. If Kratom was no longer legal and available to me that would be very detrimental for me. Kratom isn't A drug. Kratom is an herb. Kratom should remain legal and available because it helps people with opiate and alcohol problems, and it helps people with pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and other ailments. Kratom isn't A drug. It's A medicinal herb. Kratom has helped me so much in my life it is miraculous. Kratom is very safe compared to over the counter drugs like acetaminophen. It is estimated that about 150 Americans die every year from overdosing on acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has A narrow safety margin from the dose that is affective, and the dose that can cause serious harm. One study even showed that overuse of acetaminophen can increase a person's risk of early death as much as 60 percent, the study authors found. Acetaminophen can cause serious liver toxicity. You can't overdose on kratom, and Kratom isn't toxic to the body. In fact Kratom has antioxidants in it that are good for you. Kratom is safe compared to over the counter drugs that A lot of think are harmless when in reality can cause fatality. When you compare Kratom to tobacco cigarettes Kratom is obviously safer. It doesn't make sense to try to ban Kratom when tobacco is legal and available, and alcohol is legal and available. Tobacco and alcohol kill hundreds of thousands of people every year in America alone. When you propose A ban to Kratom when tobacco and alcohol are legal and available it makes me question why A ban was ever proposed to ban A benign herb in the first place when alcohol and tobacco combined kill about 580000 people every year in America alone. It is only fair to hold every drug and herb to the same standard as far as legality and availability go. The reason being if you keep alcohol legal, and ban chocolate. It's unfair to consumers that we can't eat organic dark chocolate, but can drink ourselves to death. Consumers will look at A list of system of scheduled drugs in that theoretical circumstance and logically they won't accept that chocolate is A schedule one narcotic while alcohol remains legal and available. A lot of people would find laws like that unfair and might even get angry. This is no joke. Taking away people's Kratom causes suffering in the people that have pain management issues that got off of pharmaceutical opiates, and just use kratom to manage their pain. It is no joke to take Kratom away from heroin addicts that do two to three grams of heroin A day, and are trying to make big improvements in their life. It's no joke to take Kratom away from people that have severe anxiety and got off of powerful anti anxiety pharmaceutical drugs like xanax, and just use Kratom to help them manage their anxiety. It is no joke to take Kratom away from alcoholics that are in alcohol withdrawal and feel really sick. If you become very consciously aware of what taking away Kratom from those people would do to the trajectory of those people's life you wouldn't be to take away Kratom from those people without behaving selfishly. Kratom is A medicine for me and the millions of other Americans that chose to take it. Please don't make Kratom illegal and unavailable to Americans. It will only cause more societal problems. A good example of this is that States that have banned Kratom have higher opiate overdose rates then States that Don't have prohibition laws on Kratom. The drug enforcement agency has A ethical responsibility to be A benevolent force in society. Please be fair and virtuous on this important Kratom issue, and keep Kratom legal and available.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2860","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Barnes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello?\n   I suffer from depression and I have been on a few things including prescribed off label pain killers because none worked and I didnt want to use any medication that Altered my vrain chemistry and how certain nuerotransmitrers function.

I'm 39 years old. I've been a stay at home mother for eleven years now. I have struggled on and off almost my whole life with unexplained chronic fatigue, anxiety and  depression. As I grew older and had children, I developed chronic pain and my other symptoms became much worse. My depression was labeled as \"treatment resistant\" because I had tried so many psych drugs that either didn't help or had intolerable side effects. For many years I complained of the same symptoms. Even checked myself into the mental health ward in a hospital for a week. Finally, I developed a large goitre on my thyroid gland along with some smaller ones. I had half of my thyroid surgically removed along with a parathyroid gland. Turns out that I have an autoimmune condition called Hashimotos disease which caused my thyroid to be attacked by my own body. I went from hyperthyroid to hypothyroid over the course of a decade at least. It went on for many years before I was diagnosed. Before, I was told that it was fibromyalgia and mental illness. My pain kept me from living a full life. I felt so much guilt as a mother and wife.  Along with it I would get a flu-like fevered feeling. It lasted for days, weeks, even months at a time. And, I had two in diapers to care for. My thyroid issues caused me emotional instability. Because there's an issue of opioid abuse in my area, doctors would not treat my pain. I ended up with stomach problems from taking ibuprofen on a daily basis. Finally, I was prescribed Valium for my anxiety. It worked very well for a few years. We moved and a different doctor switched me to xanax. I didn't think it was much different from Valium. But, I became physically dependant on xanax after taking a small amount of it for only two months! I figured that out after I decided that I wanted a break from it and I got very sick. It's dangerous to go cold turkey off of xanax. I didn't know this before because my doctor never told me. My xanax also turned toxic to me. I was sick with it but also sick without it! I suffered to the point of being bedridden and suicidal. I read about kratom from a facebook group for xanax withdrawal. I ordered a small amount and from the first day I started using it I have felt SO much better! Like I would imagine a normal, healthy human to feel! It's not a party \"drug\". It makes me feel better but not high. I've been able to decrease my xanax, I only take half a pill at night before bed. Sometimes I don't even take it at all. And, I'm off of my antidepressants! Kratom makes me feel more productive and energetic. I get more accomplished! I have went without kratom and didn't get any withdrawal symptoms. The only things I noticed was that I was tired and my legs ached. That was common for me even before kratom. My legs and feet were my chief complaint as far as pain. I only found kratom just six months ago. Please don't schedule it as an illicit substance! My kids need me to feel healthy! \n\nSincerely, Melissa Bradley","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3931","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Melissa Bradley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"PLEASE DO NOT BAN KRATOM IT HAS SAVED MY LIFE.

I am writing you today to urge your organization to reconsider classifying Kratom as a Schedule 1 drug. I wish I could claim to be an expert on the topic, but I can only offer anecdotal evidence of the benefits of Kratom. I sincerely hope you will find my experiences helpful when considering how to classify Kratom. \n\nAbout five or six years ago, I was diagnosed with recurrent Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. However, I have felt and dealt with the symptoms that led to those diagnoses for much longer, since my mid-teenage years. After my diagnosis, I had been prescribed many antidepressants and anxiolytics (including those in the benzodiazepine family of drugs). I found very little relief from my symptoms in any of the medications I had been prescribed, and, in some cases, felt much worse due to side effects. I am disappointed to say that I gave up on trying to find a medication that helped me with my disorders. \n\nAfter some time being off of medications prescribed by a psychiatrist, I turned to self-medication through alcohol. It started off slowly, just a drink here or there to calm the nerves. Over the next several years, however, it gradually built. Soon, I found that I was unable to go more than a day without something to drink. I would get severe headaches, volatile moods, crippling anxiety, and more that would only seem to get worse without drinking. While my drinking never affected my employment (I only drank after work and on days off), my over-consumption of alcohol was at serious risk for becoming a detriment to my health and mental well-being.\n\nMy brother (who has no doubt shared his own story in these comments), told me about Kratom and how it has helped him. I decided to try to quit drinking, taking Kratom when the withdrawal symptoms became unbearable. I was surprised at just how effective Kratom was, and that I experienced no side effects. With the support of Kratom, I was able to completely quit drinking on my first attempt. I was then able to taper off my use of Kratom as the alcohol withdrawal symptoms subsided. \n\nI have been completely free of alcohol for some time now, and only occasionally use Kratom when the symptoms of my anxiety or depression become too distressing. Without Kratom, my battle would have been much more difficult, and I am very doubtful I would have had so much success, so easily. I find Kratom to be very effective at helping to alleviate my symptoms of depression and anxiety as well. I have never experienced side effects or any addictive effects while using Kratom. It seems safe and effective, but my only evidence for that are my own experiences. \n\nAs I'm sure you have heard through the thousands of comments you've received, Kratom seems to have the potential to help an huge amount of people with an immense variety of ailments, addictions, disorders, and the like. Please take these cases and mine into consideration when your organization decides the fate of Kratom. It is a substance that seems to a great potential to improve the lives of many people.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration of our comments.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21119","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steve W","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Lynne Thermann. I'm a former landscaper, builder, maintenance worker and elder caregiver. I am 56 years old.\nI'm very strongly opposed to the DEA's proposed prohibition of the herb kratom (Mitragyna Speciosa) under Schedule 1.\nKratom has been enormously helpful to my well being for almost three years.\nI've been in chronic pain for most of my life, due to scoliosis and lordosis, two types of spinal deformity. In recent decades I've also developed fibromyalgia, arthritis, severe fatigue and migraine, with increasing pain, physical weakness and disability and attendant anxiety and depression. I've been prescribed various pain medications throughout my life and have used many different over-the-counter pain remedies in efforts to address my illnesses. I also began self-medicating very early, at age 9, due to physical pain and fatigue as well as attendant emotional discomfort.\nLike many others, I first learned of kratom in online research about pain management.\nObtaining and preparing kratom successfully for the first time, without undue hardship or expense, opened up a new world for me: it gently lessened my physical and emotional discomfort; it directly assisted my overall sense of well being and helped me function more normally in my daily responsibilities. Over time, it's become clear that kratom has definitely helped my well being, assisting me in reaching a healthful balance, in tandem with nutritional and spiritual practices. I've never felt as well as I do at this time, with the help of this simple herb. \nI'm not alone in experiencing a change for the better with the help of kratom. Generations of others have felt an enormous improvement to their own well being because of this traditional herbal supplement. I see no justification whatsoever for this simple herb to be scheduled similarly to synthetic drugs like heroin and LSD.

I first discovered Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine by way of Kratom at the beginning of 2014. I have been a daily consumer a few months short of three years.  Shortly after discovering Kratom I began using it daily, it wasn't until April that I ceased all illicit drug use, including methamphetamine and opiates/opiods. I am a 26 year old father of two beautiful toddlers, I work in the Receiving Department of a factory near by. I have had this job for a little over a year, the longest I have ever held a job prior to 2014 was 6 months.  I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 10 and was medicated with various medications up until I was 15 when I began using opiates in place of the ADHD medications. In the middle of 2014 I ceased all illicit drug use cold turkey, and moved 45 minutes away with the mother of my children as we prepared to bring my daughter into this world 9 months later. I experienced very minimal withdrawal symptoms considering the high doses at which I was consuming both methamphetamine and strong opiates such as fentyl. I then decided to go back to the doctor and got prescribed medication for ADHD as well as depression and anxiety that I have suffered from undiagnosed for all of my teenage years. I then stopped using Kratom for a few months as it was no longer sold locally. After experiencing no withdrawal symptoms what so ever, I came across an online community which pointed me in the direction of online Kratom Vendors. In that short period of time, my medication no longer relieved my symptoms completely the way I thought they did. I began suffering from severe social anxiety and depression again which made me unable to follow through with any important life decisions and plans. When I began ordering Kratom online from US vendors who imported from overseas, I noticed that my social anxiety was completely released. I was confident like I was before I stopped taking it. I became very optimistic on a daily basis, I no longer had an the feeling of impending doom. I saw how I wanted my life to go, and the necessary steps needed to make it happen and I took action. No longer do I live in fear of going to Walmart and paying with a live cashier. I was so afraid before that I would stiffer or be unable to speak when ever talking to anyone outside of my imidiate family. I was no longer afraid to just be my self. I have a great sleep schedule, something I never knew existed. Throughout my teenage years and all the way up until I began Kratom and stopped using illicit drugs I had sleeping problems, my mind would race and It would take hours to fall asleep. I get sleepy and fall asleep around the same time every night now and wake up around 5am every morning with no alarm clock. Of course this could be attributed to becoming older and not being on drugs. Kratom gives me an amazing mood and energy boost, I work 8 hours a day and some days I lay carpet/tile for four hours after I get off as well as some weekends. I never get tired while working, I never lose my motivation, I constantly see my achievements and I work hard until the finish line. I can't truly put into words what Kratom has done for me and how devestated my fianc and mother will be if I lose it. This is the first time since this announcement that I have been in tears about this situation. Please, reconsider this and go about it differently. I am not opposed to some sort or regulation. Maybe 21 and older? I understand that young people do not need something like this, but I also understand that it cannot be outlawed or made only available by prescription.

This natural supplement  has greatly improve my life. I am a 53 year old woman who has been taking Kratom for 2 years. I originally looked into it when a friend suggested that it might help with my menopause symptoms - and it has. It has helped to alleviate the anxiety that menopause has brought on, as well as the aches and discomfort, and I no longer need to use hormone replacement. \nA wonderful side effect of using Kratom is that I noticed quite soon that I no longer craved alcohol. I was not a huge drinker, but I did drink a little too much, and disliked that I wanted to have a drink every few days. All of my life I had fought that desire, unsuccessfully. My theory is that Kratom may lower anxiety, and thus my desire to drink goes away. \nOne of the nice things about Kratom is that the amount I take has neither gone up or down over the past 2 years. I have found what works for me, and that's it. The closest thing I can compare it to might be coffee. You may have a few cups, but then you stop. It doesn't cause an over-use problem.\nI should also mention that previous to taking Kratom my doctor had me on Klonopin, an anti-anxiety medication. I no longer need it!\nPlease look into the real story of this natural substance. It has helped me so much. We are all very likely to know friends and family members who would be better off taking Kratom than various prescription drugs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5670","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Phyllis Christopher","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I myself have struggled with depression for over twenty two years now due to an accident I was in.

Kratom is a blessing, I had been living with pain from unsolved back, and knee injuries for 12 years, until I found this plant. I spent thousands on MRI's, doctors evaluations, all with no results, and they couldn't prescribe me anything to help with the pain I live with. Well, kratom, it relieves pain when needed, and some of the anxiety that comes with it. It's not needed everyday either. It is not addictive as some claims have said, it is completely controllable, and there is a threshold of tolerance that doesn't rise. It doesn't cause hallucinations or a high, it is a mild sedative and/or energy boost and that is it. It is not much different from coffee, and in fact, quite related.\n\nYou claim there is no medicinal use, yet that is still under review, and more research can't be done if it is under Schedule 1. However, the Big Pharma companies have pending patents on the mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitraginene? They must think there is a possibility for medical use, which many would say yes to already from simple use. There is no need to take this simple plant from the public, and then turn around and try to make it a prescription 'drug'. Yes more research should be done to see how it affects the body, but in general people haven't had problems with it. It doesn't give you respiratory issues or addiction like prescription narcotics, opiods, opiates, whatever you want to call it. You also said it is an 'imminent hazard to public.' How is that?  There are no chances of overdose. It is only preferred by certain people, and is quite tame and benign.\nAt around '20,000' deaths a year from prescription drugs, which as we know so many people are addicted to, that is more of a hazard. Taking away kratom would put people back in pain, or worse, lead them back to prescription drugs, heroin, and alcohol abuse. That isn't liberty.\nYes, people need to take kratom responsibly, even though the worst effects would be getting nauseous. But common people naturally learn their tolerance levels and know what to take. There's always a few that maybe don't know how much they should have, and that's with anything.\n\nYou also claimed there were deaths associated with kratom. Keyword, 'associated'. That was proven false as all the suspected 14 deaths or so all were involving other drugs, narcotics, and medical issues. There is no evidence of one single death, involving kratom only. The closest to that were some I believe in Europe, but that was from kratom being laced with something extremely potent and hazardous. So again, 'associated.' Pure kratom, as long as it is pure, has no impacts of death to date and really no health hazards, unless otherwise proven by the research you should allow.\nIt has been used for hundreds, if not thousands of years, and even by Buddhists.\n\nAs you saw from the backlash of the first attempt to ban this plant, it is saving lives of veterans with PTSD, people with chronic pain/anxiety, and recovering heroin/pain killer/opiates/and alcohol addicts. Kratom is saving the lives of veterans who bravely fought for this country in the name of FREEDOM. Freedom to choose. There are many countries who have kept this plant accessible and you see that they don't have problems with it. It would be a violation of freedom, privacy, personal health choice, and religious beliefs if this plant were banned/scheduled.\n\nSo please keep Kratom on the market, it is not an imminent hazard, it is quite the opposite. It is saving lives, and you'll keep that miracle alive by dropping your proposed ban.\nAlso, it is ultimately up to the President- not the Attorney General, not the head of the DEA or anyone else, please consider all relevant information with the President of the United States.\n\nIf this hasn't been seen by the DEA please read this in depth study to date: http://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2588524\n\nAnd this: http://www.americankratom.org/press_releases\n\nThank you!

I survived Guillain Barre Syndrome from which there are three chronic, disabling lingering symptoms: Chronic Fatigue, Chronic Pain, Neuropathy and muscle damage. For ten years I've hoped for a miracle and have had the rug pulled from beneath me over and over. We GBS survivors are very rare and no two patients are left in the same condition.\n      I do not feel lucky.\n      For a decade I've been controlled by disability and prescription drugs. I take vast amounts of opiate based pills, neurological drugs, but NO drug helps Chronic Fatigue. (Illegal or otherwise) Then a friend-an exceptional sculptor and artist in Black Mountain, NC- told me of Kratom. She sent me a small amount and I was amazed. \n      Skip ahead: I purchased a kilo and was out of bed, using only 60 mgs of morphine, for ten days in a row. This for me is astounding. Unprecedented. Prior I was able to rise about once a week. Kratom's miraculous ability to lift the fog of Fatigue feels REAL. To hell with pain (Kratom also took my pain to a zero, another first) the true miracle is being able to speak my thoughts aloud, to lift my hand. On day eleven I was up again and making grilled cheese, something I've not been able to do since August of 2005. The muscles in my legs began to shake as damaged nerves sent insane messages through my body. I felt like a marionette being manipulated by two children fighting for control. The following day-up again-my heart was pounding, my fingers quivered and twitched and I recognized the loss of control from chronic fatigue. I slept for several days and faced coffee withdrawal (Ah, to enjoy coffee every day like a real person; the sound of a grinder, the smell of the brew, the warmth and comfort down the throat) and I learned the multiple facets of this medicine along with the same respect I give to Morphine, Hydromorphone, Fentanyl. Mostly I learned how little I know about it. \n      I learned something very important about Kratom: it is TOO close to a miracle. It is not a cure but is the most remarkable symptom barrier I've tried and I've tried everything that's come my way. But Kratom makes me believe I'm well again and even with the most subtle movements (using a pencil, rising to get a drink, picking up a dropped item) it allows me to abuse myself; to push my body farther than I should and can.\n        I cut back, spent a day in bed. Somewhere between the past twelve days and the last ten years lies an answer. But it will take me months, perhaps years, to find the balance-the very carefully measured doses at the precise time, how to balance with pharmaceuticals, food, sleep, action. The key to living with chronic illness is to listen to the body, a  skill requiring re-learning based on your \"before and after\" moment. Kratom deafens the voice of your body, something that can be dangerous, as made clear by my rising twelve days in a row. Additionally, those around you, who have hoped as much as you for a miracle, begin to expect more from you and our nature is to not disappoint them. We carry guilt for having become so sick in the first place. This is additional pressure to push ourselves. But how do we stop at a wall that we cannot see or feel until it is too late?\n      I'm writing this long and personal account to educate you all on the effects of Kratom which, like GBS, affects us all differently. I received some brief instructions from the members of this group. My package arrived with ginger candy, which was very sweet. Yet I've never had nausea from Kratom. I suspect I've adapted as I was taking 40mgs of Dilaudid a day and got accustomed to chewing ginger root. But it has now been 15 days since I took Dilaudid. \n      Kratom IS a miracle but SOME organization needs to study and research it, collect data such as I've provided, and do an equitable job in dispensing instructions. We all need to respect the power of this plant or the DEA and the FDA will take control and then license it to Big Pharma who will restrict it and then multiply the price by 100,000%.  (60 tablets of morphine costs me $197 a month, for example.) Ever person who distributes it must responsibly include  instructions and warnings so that when fighting these agencies we appear more knowledgable than gardeners, botanists, and common street dealers.

Although some people desperately need these medications and use them correctly, there is a large part of the population who unfortunately become addicted to these medications.  Compound the fact that doctors now are losing their licenses by correctly prescribing them and now you have a patient who has no pain control and in withdrawals.  Unfortunately too many of these people then turn to street drugs to get the same pain relief that they were receiving legally.  We have a very warped system when it comes to patients and their needs.   Just like THC, \"Kratom\", which is naturally found (just like poppy plants which opiates are made from) along with many other manufactured drugs come from \"natural sources\" (aspirin, digoxin, etc.) and help people tremendously.  Naturalists have been using these plants for many years....far longer than YOU have been around.   Putting Kratom as a schedule one is just ridiculous, as is keeping marijuana as a schedule one.

About 8 years ago I started getting this continuous ache with shooting pains from the sole of my foot to my hips and it steadily got worse so of course I started to take ibuprofen fr the anti inflammatory and pain relief but after a couple of years in and out of my doctors office we could not find a pain relief that would work and that I could take long term. \nI am a recovering addict and have 16+ years of sobriety I say that because I will not take addictive medication, so my list of choices was small.\nI am also into the fitness craze so it has to be healthy which led me to searching online for natural remedy's. After trying many different herbs plants oils etc I came across Kratom and figured okay I have not tried this yet so after some research found a reputable web site and purchased some. That was 4+ years ago and I have not looked back since. \nThere is no describing what it is like to have this dull ache with shooting sparks just disappear. Of course different strains tackle it differently so I have my favorites. \nOver the years I have experimented with the dosage up and down as well as just going without.

Let me get this straight. You assholes allow monolithic pharmaceutical conglomerates to get thousands nightmarishly hooked on boundlessly terrible chemicals like buprenorphine and methadone (which, it's no secret, are far more addictive and equally as damaging to the brain and body as the illegal drugs which they're a supposed alternative/treatment to.) yet for a whole cornucopia of dumbass reasons, plan to outlaw fucking kratom?? For real? The only real reason I've seen is the amount of calls to poison control centers regarding kratom. While you're at it, make household cleaners, cough suppressants, caffeine, and motrin illegal too. Actually, wait: don't. Don't make any of these things illegal because it's a fucking stupid idea. Even more ludicrous than the prospect of prohibition. \nKratom is a far more superior alternative to the two accepted substances I've listed above, because it doesn't get the user intoxicated or negatively euphoric, nor does it have an equivalently high likelihood of killing those who consume it. Oh, and, big, BIG benefit here: it's not satanically addictive! You don't have any idea what it's like to come off of methadone compared to heroin or oxycodone. I do. I've been there. I'm one of the type of people whose lives you'll be fucking up with your totalitarian bullshit. It takes a grueling two or three weeks to finish the acute detox of methadone or subutex. Heroin lasts five days, at most a week, and then it's over. You know how it's okay to be prescribed methadone or subutex to detox off of opiates? I've taken it maybe three out of the dozens of times I've detoxed, preferring to go cold turkey. Why? Because I don't want to prolong my horrid plight by taking those evil goddamn pharmaceuticals.  \nKratom, on the other hand, does not do what methadone and subutex do. It's a natural and non-opiate method of overcoming the excruciating detox symptoms of opiate addiction. Just like Iboga, only it's a little less radical, so you people should be okay with it. But you're not. Because you have no idea what you're doing.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11125","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lewis Bennett","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As usual Big Pharma doesn't want us to be able to get something that is natural and organic to help us out.

I am 30 years old and work in solar array inspections. I am writing to oppose the DEA's proposal to put kratom on the list of Schedule 1 controlled substances. \nI have used kratom casually to help curb stress since 2012. I particularly used it to help calm myself while I was quitting smoking cigarettes, along with other herbs such as raspberry leaf and valerian. I have not smoked a cigarette since early 2012, after five years of addiction. I also particularly used kratom when going to the dentist for a series of oral surgeries that gave me extreme anxiety. Kratom helped calm my fear of the dentist, in fact the dentist remarked on how calm I seemed.\nI believe that kratom should absolutely remain available because although I am prone to addiction ( I was previously addicted to cigarettes), I have never developed an addiction to kratom in almost five years of casual use. The effects of kratom are noticeable but not incapacitating in any way. There is very little evidence to support an argument that kratom is being abused in the way of recreational drugs, and in fact I believe it is helping a lot of people with opioid addictions to wean themselves off that horrible burden. While I myself have never abused opioids, I have one friend who said he was effectively using kratom to remain sober from them. In the age of an opioid epidemic, I think scheduling kratom would cause loss of life from addicts who depend on it to remain free from opioids.\nKratom is the type of herbal remedy we should want people of the United States to use to address their problems, not powerful pharmaceuticals that have a direct path to injectible street drugs. I think kratom is a boon to public health and I hope the DEA can see this as well.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9526","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sara Milner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is safe.\nKratom is good for pain, and it is far less addictive or dangerous than narcotic pain meds.\nKratom helps people who want to stop the endless cycles of addiction.\nMaking Kratom a part of the Controlled Substances Act is not necessary as it is not an immanent public health threat.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7854","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon Strong","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please repeal the current ruling on kratom.

I discovered Kratom  about two years ago while I was seeking an alternative to the highly addictive and dangerous opioid medications that my Dr. had prescribed to me for my lower back pain. I used the prescribed narcotics for 3 years and they worked ok for a while, then they stopped working as well so I started taking more, this led me down a path of dependence and addiction on the drug. Luckily I was able to break away from using the opioid medication by slowly switching and adding Kratom tea to my diet. I now am free from using the narcotic medications.  Narcotics had several adverse effects on me including nausea, drowsiness, and respiratory depression and I never felt safe using it. I have found that Kratom does not cause any adverse effects for me. I am a full time nursing student and I maintain an A average. I am a contributing member of my community and society as a whole. I have found that kratom tea does not give me the addictive and dependence feelings like the narcotics, but relieves my lower back pain so that I may function in my daily life. I feel that Kratom is not a drug, but a dietary supplement. I am opposed to the DEAs proposal to make the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, two constituents of the kratom plant, schedule 1 controlled substances. This would negatively affect my lifestyle and that of many others. Narcotics are dangerous and kill thousands of Americans a year.

I run a dog-sitting business out of my home and am also an artist. I'm 30 and have a bone disease called Fibrous Dysplasia. I have broken my femur upwards of 25 times in 30 years. I have had insanely major surgeries that have, in the past, led to me taking high doses of extremely potent opioids. I was physically and psychologically addicted to oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and even tramadol. I had two major surgeries in 2014. I have had around 10 total in my lifetime. The first in 2014 was a double osteotomy. The doctors broke my femur in two places, removed metal rods and screws, straightened my deformed femur, then put new metal in to support it. After the surgery, the doctors moved me to a post-op bed and when they did, one of the rods slipped through my bone and nestled underneath my knee cap. I had to have a 2nd double osteotomy 12 weeks later. Needless to say, I was on opioids for about 8 months. I weened myself down and got completely off of them for almost 8 months when I hurt my leg again and a rod slipped through my upper hip. I NEVER wanted to go through opioid withdrawal again, so instead of taking what the doctor prescribed, I looked into Kratom. I have taken Kratom off and on since then. It is NOT addictive, and the only side effect I get is similar to coffee/caffeine. I take it on average about 3 times a week when my leg is hurting badly. And I don't take it two days in a row.\n\nKratom has helped me to not take overly powerful prescription opioids when in pain due to a bone disease. The anguish these opioids cause when you try to stop taking them is indescribable. Kratom has helped the pain level to go down with very few side effects and every day life has improved dramatically in my work and relationships. I do not take Kratom daily. I only take it when necessary, and it has done wonders in a world where too many people are overprescribed very powerful narcotics. Please keep these amazing, helpful constituents legal. It's natural and it's safe, as we know with past studies that it does not cause respiratory depression like real opioids. More studies can be done and it can help millions of people around this world like it has helped me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19115","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Aaron Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 59 year old male, I work as a purchasing manager for a laboratory equipment re-selling business.

I strongly believe the Mitragyna Speciosa plant powder should remain freely available and that education is the most sensible way to inform the public of  any possible adverse effects, and that criminalizing this substance would have very negative consequences for the many thousands of people in our country that use this regularly to help with their well-being and their ability to lead productive, useful lives.\n\nSincerely,\nSamuel Schlufen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1994","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Samuel Schlufen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 29 years old and have been addicted to opiates for most of my life.

I am a 33 year old mother of two, a business owner, and a taxpayer. I am opposed to Kratom and it's compounds being classified as a Schedule 1 substance. I have been using Kratom for the past 18 months to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and insomnia. I was looking for a more natural substance to help my conditions (as opposed to anxiety medications or alcohol) and found research on the positive effects of this natural remedy. After doing hours of research into it's positive effects and apparent lack of negative side effects, I decided that I would give it a chance. Since first trying Kratom, my anxiety symptoms and insomnia has been helped tremendously. I have experienced zero negative symptoms from taking this natural herb. I have been sleeping much better, I feel great the next day, and it gives me energy to take care of my kids and household to the best of my ability. I do not think this natural remedy should be scheduled in any way and should remain legal to be purchased. I would hate to have to start taking prescription anxiety medication, which is full of negative side effects that would make functioning much more difficult.

Let me be clear; this is helping people not become addicted to illegal AND LEGAL medication and drugs. A lot of people get over prescribed pain medication in particular. As I am sure you are aware, their is a huge problem with opioid use in this country right now. A great deal of that, and arguably a majority of those with an opioid problem, comes from this over prescription. Giving a construction worker with back pain 3 Vicodin per day for 3 months is basically starting a new gateway drug. \nPeople in every facet of the United States use kratom. The New York Times even showed this when your ban was first proposed and going into effect the first time. Doctors, people labor-intensive jobs like construction, lawyers, people in the military... someone in every sector of the USA uses kratom to their benefit and successfully contributes to this country. Take that away and you will have deaths all over the place from all of these people needing to help their anxiety or relieve their pain and not having a non-addictive and totally affordable source to help. They will go for things like heroin and oxycodone and drugs that are dirtier and scarier. This will happen within months, if not weeks.\n\n- With this being a big possibility and probability, many people with saner heads will go the other route and try to get kratom illegally. They will get caught and go to prison for something that they have already been doing for years without causing and harm and actually helping the country function better. Now all of our money will be put more towards feeding and clothing these people for years.\n\nPlease do not go through with this ban. It will simply add to the already pressing issues the United States faces. Kratom is not the battle right now. And even though it should never be the battle, at least take some time to test what you want to ban first. \n\nThank you for reading.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19988","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jamison Lerner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For the past 3 years, I've used Kratom to ease the pain from a bulging disk and spinal stenosis.

I'm 51 years old. I have one grown son and I own and operate a daycare center. \n16 years ago I was diagnosed with 2 types of arthritis. Due to the chronic pain I was prescribed many different medications. Before long I was also diagnosed with depression and anxiety coming from my pain and poor quality of life. \nWithin 2 years from being diagnosed with the arthritis I found myself in the middle of a horrible addiction from all of the prescription drugs I had been prescribed. I couldn't work anymore and was absent from my family and friends. By December 2012 I had no desire to live. I was just waiting to die. \nOne day about 4 years ago I was searching YouTube for videos on natural remedies and came across a video on Kratom. The man on the video had many of the same ailments that I had and was getting great relief from taking the herb Kratom. I placed an order for it. I didn't hold out much hope but at that point in my life I figured I had nothing to lose. \nAfter starting on Kratom within 3 months I had tapered myself off of all prescription drugs. My quality of life started to improve by leaps and bounds! My pain was under control better than any of the prescription drugs had allowed. My depression and anxiety were a thing of the past.\nI have been back to work full time for 3 years now. My family and friends have me back also. \nIt was that easy and that amazing. The only regret I have is that I hadn't discovered Kratom sooner. \nWhen I went online this past August 31st and read about the DEA's intent to place Kratom on a schedule I drug list I felt shock and fear, then the tears came. I knew without Kratom my life would go back to being intolerable. I knew I would rather die than going back to that miserable existence. I pray every day that Kratom will remain legal so that people like me can continue to benefit from it. \nIllness and prescription drugs took away my life,  Kratom has helped me to get back my life!

I am 23 years old and I struggled with drug addiction since I was 15. About a year ago I got sober and was having a lot of pain in my lower back from two vertebrae turning in opposite directions. I used to be in acrobatics but I had a couple surgeries that left me unable to get the exercise my back needs to stay upright. So now I have almost constant pain. The pain makes me depressed and I'm afraid to see a doctor because they always want money and I can't afford it. \n\nI discovered kratom a few years ago when I was smoking weed and I bought some kratom for my mom at a headshop. My mother is a recovering addict and takes suboxoine for her opiate replacement therapy. She would run out of her prescription often and so she tried this and it worked so well that she used it along with suboxoine. \n\nThere are too many victims of pain out there that would suffer from a ban of this proportion. To many mothers in pain that have lives that need to be lived pain free in order to properly care for their children. Taking away that pain is the only thing keeping some people from killing themselves because of their depression is to much for them to bare. \n\nThe war on drugs and the current scheduling system is broken and scientifically incorrect. \nHow about actually making only harmful substances illegal? Most of the U.S population doesn't take your scheduling thing seriously because it's a joke. Cannabis, LSD, Psilocybin and many other substances in your schedule 1 list are completely NON-TOXIC. So why is Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen legal? It kills more people each year than any of the schedule 1 substances I've just mentioned. So who's controlling the DEA? Because something is very wrong with this system. It's an outright lie and at least three-quarters of the country knows it. So come out of the closet.\n\nEvery twelve year old in the United States knows that cannabis isn't dangerous. Yet the scheduling system says otherwise? It's an outdated piece of political injustice. Please allow for the safe use herbal, plant-based medication. Wake up DEA. Plants are like people. You can't make people illegal. Well actually you can. But that's it doesn't usually work. Because you are killing more people by not telling them the truth. Keep hard drugs out of the hands of our youth by regulating safe substances like cannabis and psilocybin. There are so many medicinal benefits that science has yet to discover! With laws like these you'll hold civilization back a thousand years!!! \n\nAnyway thank you to whoever is reading this for hearing our words.\n\nPeace + Love","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7794","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jacob Hutton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please consider doing research on this substance instead of just immediately banning it.

I am a 28 year old male, I started taking powdered kratom four years ago ,  kratom has been a life saver for me. Prior to taking kratom I was taking high dosage opiates to treat my chronic pain resulting from gastro intestinal issues. When I am on kratom I work, drive, barely notice any psychoactive effects. Not only does kratom relieve pain, but it also helps with my IBS like symptoms. Withdrawal from opiates was terrible, I never want to take them regularly again, but with kratom I have almost no withdrawal effects. Even after taking kratom daily for over a year, the effects of immediately stopping use  are comparable to not having my coffee in the morning, I'm a little irritable, maybe a headache, and my symptoms from my intestinal issues become apparent again. Also, it seems impossible to take too much, if I do I do not feel euphoria, I get a headache and nausea. I never want to go back to opiates, please do not take this plant that has helped me so much.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11554","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joel Brainard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is saving my life. \n\nGot me off of Methadone and keeps me off opiates. \n\nPLEASE consider your stance against Kratom. \n\nIf I'm responsible enough to take aspirin, I'm responsible enough for Kratom. \n\nKratom is LESS harmful than peanuts...or aspirin. \n\nThe positive effects outweigh the negative by a long shot!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9450","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"D Dillons","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please consider vetting kratom fully through a double blind placebo controlled study before scheduling it in a way that would deprive many citizens from bettering their lives and improving their well-being.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22475","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Moreno","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have absolutely no experience with this substance.

My dad is now off of kratom as well ,he used it for approximately 2 years to wean off of methadone! It worked an absolute miracle in his life and the life of our family, I know of one other person who has completely stopped heroin and methadone maintenance with the use of kratom! I believe many many more lives could be saved with kratom however its not a well known herb as of yet! Unfortunately the DEA and its imposed banning if kratom has given it a negative light which is not proven by any means to be substantiated!  It's my belief that the DEA the court's a nd the prison system need to find new ways to stay viable and relevant! Banning of kratom will probably cause some who continue to use to be subject to arrest and incarceration, keeping the fat cats of the DEA and there families well fed for generations to come! People whom use kratom to fight heroin and methadone addiction will wind up having to buy heroin or get back on the state funded methadone program which obviously is a tragedy bet yet continues!

While I was in the military all the doctors did was just give me pills pills pills. I was on everything you can think of. It was making my life miserable. I hated the way I felt everyday. I got hooked on the pain meds and became dependent on them. in 2010 I finally got out of the military and now I am a disabled vet. I started seeing a civilian pain management doctor and all he did was just give me more pain meds. I have  had 3 radio frequency nerve burns and other injections in my groan.

I have been taking Kratom for over 4 years now. I have not touched a pain pill in those 4 years. This plant REALLY does help with my pain. It does not make me impaired or incoherent.

I decided to explore this further, and based upon my research, it appears that banning kratom could cost billions more in disability payouts and could have a massive economic impact insofar as moving people out of the workforce.\n\nI recently conducted three surveys with kratom consumers.  The first survey asked how many people currently consuming kratom were working.  In a sample of 699 respondents, 69% stated they were working.  With an estimated 4 million kratom consumers in the United States, this means that there are up to approximately 3 million people currently in the workforce who consume kratom.  \n\nThe second survey asked that of those kratom consumers currently working (approximately 3 million) how many of them realistically believed that if kratom were banned and they could no longer consume kratom that they would then become unable to work and would be forced to apply for disability.  In a sample of 242 respondents, 32% responded that they did indeed feel this way.  That means that approximately up to 1 million  people would be out of the workforce and applying for disability if a kratom ban were to be enacted.  Of course, not all of these applicants will be awarded disability benefits, many will get denied.   According to the Social Security Administration, approximately 30% of those who apply for disability benefits end up being awarded said benefits  https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/dibStat.html   This means that approximately 300,000  people would receive disability benefits because a kratom ban.  In dollar amounts, this would cost approximately $4 billion annually in increased disability payouts.  This is a significant amount of money!\n\n\nThe third and final survey I conducted asked current kratom consumers how many of them had once been on disability but then were able to join or rejoin the workforce after they found kratom.  In a sample of 38 respondents, 18% stated that kratom had made them go from being disabled to being able to work!  This is also very significant.  As previously mentioned, the government does not award disability benefits easily.  In fact, of those who apply, about 70% get rejected.  The criteria for being considered disabled and completely unable to work, thus requiring the government financial support is very stringent.  So, for people who actually met the criteria for being disabled and were awarded disability benefits, it is remarkable that kratom made them able to work again!  \n\n\nThis is even more reason that banning kratom makes for terrible public policy.  This plant has been shown to keep people in the workforce.  An unnecessary loss of nearly a million workers and an unnecessary expense of almost $4 billion in disability payouts is economic insanity.  Even with all issues of civil liberties, government intrusion and loss of quality of life aside, it appears that a kratom ban would be significantly detrimental to the economy. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3146","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Katie Lair","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a natural supplement needed and beneficial.

Before I discovered  kratom I was suffering miserably from an anxiety disorder, panic attacks, avoided all social functions, lived in fear of certain situations, hated leaving the house, I was just a shell of a person that wasn't living life to the fullest. I don't have physical disabilities, just mental. I qualified for SSI disability insurance due to my condition. I was receiving treatment thru a psychiatrist and was put on awful prescription medications that would not only cause Physical side affects and just a feeling of being \"out of it\" I couldn't stand the way I felt on medications and had to stop them because I was also becoming dependent on them and ruining my life and family home life. Now since taking kratom I would say it's been a miracle for me and now live a normal life that has been non existent for maybe 20 years. It's just myself, husband and 1 year old baby daughter living at home and finally I can be the wife and mother I was meant to be. We now are very active as a family and our whole home life has done a 360 turn for the better. \n\nI am no longer on SSI... I am back to work part time and this is huge if you would have known me just a few short months ago! My life would go back to my own living hell if kratom becomes a scheduled drug. Please I beg of you to keep this miracle plant accessible for the hundreds of thousands people who's life has been changed for the better. Kratom has never affected me negatively.

This does not make sense to ban an alternative that could help solve the prescription drug abuse epidemic in the United States.  \nI believe that Kratom should remain legal not only so that my wife does not lose a natural way to deal with her chronic pain but also to be studied to fully understand the benefits that this plant can provide. \nI believe that as alternative to banning Kratom the FDA could help to regulate and standardize it as it does with similar supplements and vitamins. \nI implore the DEA to please look at the facts about Kratom to see that there is no reason to regulate a safe and effective supplement. The purpose of the Schedule I list is to protect the general public from harmful substances. Kratom is not a substance that is damaging or dangerous to the general population of the United States and does not belong on the Schedule I list.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23004","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nicholas Cusimano","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm writing this comment in support of those who take and benefit from Kratom.

You cannot afford to miss work. So, you dont. This is where the problem lies if one is taking opiates. Three weeks of horrible pain and your tolerance is built up. Then to start your day requires abnormal amounts of drugs. . \n    I want to get the treatment for my pain that is the reason for the pain clinic I was going to. The system is so broken that I cannot get the care I need or deserve.\n    I have found a plant that helps me almost as much with my pain and I am able to function much better.  \nI may not be able to continue the course of action I have chosen because the plant I use to control my pain is called Kratom. It is much less destructive to me than taking opiates. A hell of a lot safer for me than trying to kill the pain with alcohol. Does alcohol work? Yes, but it does not leave me functional in the least. Have I taken too much Kratom? Yes, I got very sick to my stomach. That was it!\n     Does this plant help with pain? I know it helps my pain. I chose to try it because I read over and over again, of people just like me (IN PAIN) and they claimed it helped them. Does it kill all of the pain? No, but neither do the prescription meds. Does it help me function? Yes! I have become a very independant person thanks to being able to kill my pain enough to work and to even play a little.\n   Ive had several problems with my back and shoulders.  My arm/shoulder now hurts so bad I can barely sleep some nights. I cannot reach straight out in front of me and pick up a coffee cup. It hurts months on end. If I try to do any tree work using a hand saw I am in unbearable  pain.  I also have DDD and even sciatic nerve pain from time to time. I have had cluster headaches since I was 4 or 5. I broke my skull when I was 7. Life long allergies; allergy shots for over a decade of my childhood. Rheumatic fever when I was ten.\n      I worked climbing, trimming and removing trees for 25 years. I served my country for 3 years, Airborne! I have 2 children that are grown and productive individuals. I have accomplished much in my life and have a lot of life left. At times my headaches were so frequent that I did not want to live any longer. Think, major brain freeze that lasts for two to three hours with someone stabbing an ice pick into one of your eyeballs and you come close to what a cluster headache is. The last cycle ended around 2001 and every now and then I feel a twinge like one may be coming on, but Thank God they have not yet. They will be back one day.\n        LIving in pain is DEATH. It completely rewires the brain. You cannot do anything you want to do. It is not a life.\n    Do I still have pain? Yes. Can I function? Yes.  But not because of anything the broken system has done to help me. I had to search for a way to survive. I have found it and have a life as close to normal as one can have working nights and doing physical labor with a bad back and neck.  Just as my life is getting back to normal after nearly a year of school and I have made a plan to just deal with things on my own and use the money for something useful instead of throwing it away on useless insurance. I cannot afford the cost of insurance and then co-pays. The specialist and pain clinics are not affordable, I tried. The broken system is USELESS.\n    I plead with the powers that be to keep this useful Godsend of a plant legal and allow the research to be done on it. By all means restrict the sale of it to keep it away from minors and insure the purity of the product but dont change it. Please do not make it illegal. It is very helpful for my pain. I do not want to die from pain medication. Pain medication is never prescribed in dosages that will allow you to live. If you do not get enough of it, you cannot function and if you get enough of it then the end of it is death. Pain management needs every way it can be given to work. This plant called Kratom helps me live. Over the last 4 years I have found a much better way to help with my pain and to be able to function in society. I want to work and be productive. I want to live.\n\n\nThank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15859","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Jenkins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban this plant.

I have been drinking Kratom tea with some regularity for the past couple years and have not experienced any adverse effects.  I use the tea as a replacement for coffee most days as I find that it provides me with energy like caffeine but without increasing my anxiety.  Scheduling the plant would be a detriment to my quality of life and I am unaware of any benefit that would be gained from the scheduling.\n\nThat said, I recognize that there should be limits to anecdotal experience in determining policy.  However, as I mentioned, I am not aware of any compelling evidence or arguments in favor of scheduling.  If the DEA is still considering scheduling, I would ask them to first answer these questions:\n\nHave studies been conducted on the effects of Kratom?  If so, have those studies shown Kratom to be harmful?  Have any studies conducted shown that there are benefits to using Kratom?  Is there reported evidence of Kratom being harmful to anyone?  I am aware that a number of emergency room visits have been connected to Kratom, but were the patients in those cases determined to be suffering from a health problem?  If so, was Kratom found to be the cause of those problems or were other factors likely responsible?  I have heard reports that there have been deaths in connection to Kratom.  In any of those cases, was Kratom found to be the cause of death, a factor in the cause of death, or merely present at the time of death?  Is there any evidence of other social ills in connection to Kratom or has Kratom use been found to cause any other crimes?  If it is the case that Kratom has not been found to lead to harm in any of the previous questions, does the DEA have other evidence that Kratom is either harmful or that scheduling it would produce any benefit on society?  If not, would the DEA still intend to schedule Kratom?  If so, what would be the reasons for the DEA's intent to schedule?\n\nThank you for considering these comments.  I look forward to an receiving an answer to my questions.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12752","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyle Novak","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.

I discovered kratom and I feel very strongly that it has allowed me to become a more productive person. If kratom was banned, I would certainly be less productive in my downtime. For me, losing access to kratom would not be the end of the world, but I feel I would finish projects less often. Specifically, kratom has helped me overcome writer's block and push through to finishing many musical arrangements and animated art. I use kratom occasionally: once or twice a month at most.

(In the instance of Kratom, \"the pursuit of happiness\" can logically be inverted to mean \"the avoidance of pain.\")\n\nPlease take a moment to think about what this country stands for, and whether or not the decision you influence today falls in line with what we stand for. You are an individual working in the government, and you have the power to act from your individual conscience.

For the last three years doctors have tried over 9 different procedures, 3 surgeries. Nothing worked, I am too young for a safe spinal fusion, so my Dr proscribed me 110 mg of oxycontin a day and said this is your life now. I started taking Kratom a week ago, I was able to immediately stop oxy with very minimal withdraw. Even more amazing is my lack of pain. I have been given my life back. When I was on the oxy it was not enough to keep me pain free, I was still couch bound and truly disabled. So far with kratom I was able to shop for and cook an entire thanksgiving dinner by myself. I am not confined to the couch, I don't need my father and boyfriend to wait on me and nurse me. I have lost too much of my youth to pain and pain pills. Kratom allows me to walk and stand up without assistance, I can do basic household chores, I don't have to limit my showers because standing hurts. No 27 year old should live like I was living prior to Kratom. The thing I am most excited about if Kratom remains legal is getting back into the work force.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12910","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Heather Hegeman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe Kratom should remain legal for the purpose of studying it further and it's healing effects","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14864","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi my name is joshua i am a kratom user and i jist wanted to say everything tharis being said how its a drug is not true its a natrual herb a tea a plant like chammomile tea or enchinica tea its not addicting its used to relax and unwind after a hard days work its not toxic non addictive i can stop taking it for two weeks at a time and feel normal as usual it doesent make you hi its a good herb to ban it is bannong god and religion its a plant god put here why would you make a plant that god put here for a reaosn illigial","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1671","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Gregory","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not Schedule Kratom.
