Brian has Asperger's and I have severe anxiety/insomnia. Since we started taking kratom, we have both experienced drastic improvements in our  health and well-being. Brian, my boyfriend, is finally able to be somewhat social and he is even able to return to work in a few weeks  as a result of the effects of kratom. I no longer need sleeping pills or anxiety pills, which often cause terrible hangovers the next day. Kratom has made such a huge difference in our lives, especially for Brian, who has been so held back by Asperger's until now.

I worked as a hospice care nurse and a daycare provider for as many years as I could until the pain and fatigue stopped me. I don't drink or smoke and I have never taken illegal drugs. I was diagnosed with SLE Lupus in 1999 after a few years of wondering why I was always so tired and hurting. After that I was also diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Degenerative Disc Disease and Psoriatic Arthritis among other things. Some of the medications I took for these illnesses caused weight gain and raised my blood sugar, I became obese and was diagnosed with diabetes and high blood pressure. \n     After trying every other option my doctor could think of: physical therapy, NSAIDs, steroids, counseling, meditation, antidepressants for a few examples, I was prescribed opioid medications around 2002. I was prescribed opioid pain medication safely and effectively for about 10 years until these legal medications became the drug of choice for many addicts. In an attempt to take these medications out of the wrong hands, they were also taken from my hands in 2012. \n     While I was prescribed the opioids for pain, my home was cleaned, my children were well cared for, I was able to go shopping, work, volunteer, help friends and neighbors and see my friends and family for holidays and social events. I couldn't work as a nurse, but I had gone back to college for accounting and hoped to have a new job, at a desk, so I could still be productive. \n     Once I lost the opioid pain medication I lost my chance to finish college, to have a job, to take care of myself and my home, to have a social life and hobbies. In fact I was basically bedridden other than doctor appointments and occassionally shopping for groceries. I had completely lost any quality of life.\n     In 2015 I found out about Kratom from a chronic pain support group. Some in the group had taken it to help with withdrawal symptoms when their doctors had forced them to abruptly go off opioid medication and they said it seemed to help manage their pain as well. I was scared to try it at first, I didn't know if it was some kind of fancy new drug the kids were all into - and I want no part of something like that! I asked a lot of questions and did some research myself to find out that it is an herbal supplement like glucosamine, chondroitin or turmeric which I have also tried. I decided to try it and it's been a true life saver, I'm starting to feel like myself again.\n     Since I've been taking Kratom, I've been able to walk 3-5 miles daily and have lost 70lbs., a little overweight but no longer obese. I'm able to go shopping as often as I want, get fruits and vegetables and stand in the kitchen long enough to prepare and cook them. I now control my blood sugar by diet and exercise alone. I am currently back in school, able to concentrate enough to read and finish homework and getting good grades. I'm hoping to start a job soon after I finish. I still have all the same illnesses that I had before, Kratom doesn't cure anything, the difference is that I am able to manage them. I am able to get up, get out and actually live as opposed to sitting in bed watching everyone else live. My pain is controlled enough that am I able to have some quality of life again and I am hopeful. I actually see myself having a future now.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2152","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Deborah Dollard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my name is Ryan and I am 27 years old. I am a father of 2 young children. 3 year old son with autism and 4 month old beautiful baby girl. I am a full time working tax paying citizen. I don not use any drugs or drink alcohol. The only thing I use on a daily basis is kratom. It is an amazing tool to help pain and fight the rising opioid/opiate epidemic in America.\n\n\nI am against the ban of kratom.2 years ago i broke my spine. I was then prescribed oxycodone and dilaudid. Needless to say I got addicted to the pharmaceutical pain killers. I needed them to function. My doctors then one day just stopped refilling my prescriptions. I am still in severe pain to this day but my doctors will not manage my pain because of \"DEA regulations\". After being cut off my medication I applied for disability because there was no way I could function in the amount of pain I'm in. I did a lot of research on natural botanicals that could help me out. I came across kratom and tried it. It changed my life. I could get out of bed,go to work, and take care of my children. I canceled my disability and went back to work full time. I now feel like my old regular self again. Kratom helps me with the pain without getting me high or foggy. I can care for my 3 year old and 4 month old children. I'm a law abiding tax paying citizen. If kratom is scheduled I will have to go back on disability and be unable to care for my young children.\n\nYou cannot overdose on kratom. You cannot die from kratom. It's literally impossible unless your using multiple narcotics together. Kratom has been blamed for numerous deaths but has never been the only thing in the bloodstream. All of the deaths are from people mixing kratom with multiple deadly drugs. Which kratom is not. Scheduling this botanical will do nothing but make the opioid/opiate epidemic even worse. In states where kratom was banned the opioid over doses quickly stacked up. There's enough proof right there to see what will happen if you schedule this plant. Please do not schedule this benign botanical. This scheduling willl do only harm and nothing good can come out of this. I think regulation is the proper thing to do. An age limit like alcohol would make sense. Banning it would not.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6956","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Kane","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am sending this letter as commentary on the upcoming possible ban on Kratom as an schedule 1 substance.

I'm not sure where to begin, other than say that quite simply kratom has saved my life and my sanity.  I suffer from extreme anxiety, and ever since taking kratom (for approximately one year) my panic/anxiety attacks have completely, 100% disappeared.  \n\nI started taking kratom after being referred to it from a friend who also suffered from extreme anxiety.  Before I tried it, the ONLY thing that would alleviate my problem was taking prescription opiates, which are quite obviously illegal to obtain.  I discovered this when I had to get a tooth pulled and was given some by my dentist.  My head cleared, my pain went away, and my anxiety was GONE for the first time in probably 15 years. When my prescription ran out my problems came back though.  Rather than turn to heroin, I decided on a whim to try kratom. I am proud to say that I have not taken a prescription pill in over a year because of kratom.  I am able to concentrate at work without having anxiety, and my family life at home is also MUCH better as I simply do not worry anymore. \n\nTo be quite honest, I'm absolutely petrified at the thought of not having access to kratom anymore.  It legitimately saved my life and my mental stability.  I do not take it to \"get high\" and I have never experienced an overdose from it.  It just simply provides me with mental clarity, concentration and eliminates my anxiety 100%.  I have been able to completely function as a normal member of society for one full year thanks to it.  \n\nPlease take this into consideration when making your decision.  I am scared of losing my sanity, but I am even more scared about what I'm going to do if it becomes illegal. I've never filled out a form or anything like this before, but this decision quite simply affects me more than maybe anything else in my entire life.  Thank your for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16454","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"M Pate","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Chelsea. I am 24 and now am a Licensed Nail Technician. I was born with short Achilles' tendons, but I did not know until I was 12. I grew up always in pain when I would stand for long periods of time. I remember going to the mall with my mom and crying from the pain from only standing for a good 30 minutes. I have a distinct memory of going to Gettysburg with my 4th grade class. We walked one of the battlefields, the pain was so excrutiating I was crying as well as sitting every chance I could find. The main thing I remember is one of my classmates fathers was a doctor. And the look of disgust/annoyance he kept giving my mom and I. He looked at me like I was a lazy, complaining child. Growing up I got that a lot from many different people; \nteachers, parents, as well as my elementary school principals. When I was 11, my mom, brother and I moved to a small town in Northern California. My mom started working for a podiatrist and immediately booked me an appointment with him. She was the only one who knew there was something more going on. That appointment we found out that I had short Achilles' tendons. Normal people can stretch their legs to a good 14 degree angle. My good leg I was measured at a 4. We tried many different things with nothing truly helping. When I turned 18 we made the decision to do surgery. I had my first surgery 3 months after I graduated high school. And the second surgery we did a year later. I had a good 2 years of rehabilitation. I was able to take a few online classes but that was all during that time. Those 2 years I relied solely on my parents, and coming out of the second year I knew I had to get a job to help out. I was able to get a job with the only grocery store in my town. I was made a cashier and eventually worked in every department. The 3 and a half years I worked there were excrutiating. There were no positions that you were able to sit, I stood for 8 hours a day, 6 days a week. I took aleve throughout the day with it not helping whatsoever. My general doctor as well as the podiatrist worked together and I tried many different medications during that time with them not helping at all either. They started giving me Vicodin, which was the only way I was able to get through those days. The last year I was taken off pain medication, since I am so young they did not want me relying on it. I was back to square one hurting every minute of everyday with no relief. I ended up quitting my job and having my 3rd and 4th surgery done, which I truly feel didn't help either. I have seen a few different doctors and each one tells me they can't do anything more and they don't know what to tell me. \n6 months after my 4th surgery I was reading an article about Kratom and decided to give it a try. It has changed my life. It helps me like ibuprofen and aleve help normal people (at least that's what it seems like). I have been taking Kratom for a year and a half now. I have gone to school and now have a job as a nail technician. I know that I will always have pain. I'm at the point where I just have to find ways to live with it. Step number 1 is not ever having a job that requires me to stand. I used to be in excrutiating pain, I honestly don't like looking back, it reminds me how consumed with pain I was.  Ever since I've been taking Kratom, I have been able to actually live life. Before there were so many things I would miss out on. But now I'm able to do all those things and honestly I am still in a little pain but Kratom makes it so I can handle the pain. I love being outdoors. I love hiking, exploring and everything that comes with the outdoors, and before I wasn't able to do any of the things I truly love. Kratom has made it so I can still do the things I love. I wouldn't be me if I wasn't able to do those things.\nThis August I heard that the DEA is planning on making Kratom a schedule 1 substance. I was absolutely devastated. I cried and called my parents asking what I'm going to do. I can't even imagine going back to the way I was living before. I can't go back to the pain I was in. What kind of life is that?  The DEA has no right to take Kratom away from people who's lives it has changed. Reading some of the articles about what the head of the DEA has said about Kratom just shows that they have no clue what Kratom even is. And I honestly feel like, with this irresponsible decision they have made, they do not have our best interests at heart. They do not care about the people who take Kratom, they do not care about any citizen in this country, because if they did, they would realize how much it has helped people like me. The positive direction my life is heading now. So I ask you DEA if any of you are reading this do not take this away from us. The doctors have failed me, the medications have failed me. But please do not take away the one thing that has not failed me. Kratom has given me a life again. Please do not take that away from me. \nThank you for reading.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8333","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chelsea Major","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please reconsider scheduling kratom. \n\nI have had Tourette's Syndrome for nearly 2 decades.

His addiction was during his teenage years and has affected him all the way into his mid-twenties. He has been sober for almost 3 years now and attributes this completely to kratom. He now owns his own house and works fulltime, never missing a shift. After he offered me some, I decided to do research on the drug. Although I have never tried the drug and do not plan to, I understand the benefits it can have for recovering opiate addicts.\nThis drug needs to be studied because the medical benefits are obvious. When the DEA announced they were banning it, my friend could not get ahold of kratom for a week or two. His mood was visibly different and he was definitely depressed. His back pain was at an all time high because he did not have any medicine. He even hinted to me that he was thinking about relapsing on opiates and he drank his first beer in years because of his lack of kratom.\nMy point is that there is an obvious benefit to this drug and is definitely a step in the right direction for battling the opiate addiction epidemic that is ravaging the USA. If the DEA really wants what is good for public well-being, then banning kratom is a huge mistake.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11195","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Spats","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I recently learned of Kratom through a friend. My husband suffers with chronic pain and had been prescribed opioid pain medication in the past. He was concerned with the addictive quality of past treatment, unfortunately this was his only option to help alleviate his discomfort. He stopped tandhe prescription pain medication and began taking ibuprofen to help, the side effects are horrendous causing frequent bouts of diverticulitis. Until recently he lived in pain and was physically unable to move without screaming, this  ultimately resulted in sleep deprivation. We did a lot of research prior to trying Kratom, he thought it would be useful in giving him his life back...our life back! It works! It does not come with the horrific side effects of NSAIDs, Gabapentens, or opioids. He does not become incapacitated, physically ill or anxious. His pain is alleviated without having any addictive characteristics. He does not \"crave\" or have a compulsion to use Kratom. On good days, he doesn't take the Kratom.

As a pre-med student, I have been closely following the growing opioid epidemic across the US. In the context of that scourge, kratom appears to be a great help to many recovering opiate users: it provides many of the benefits of methadone or suboxone maintenance therapy to patients too remote or too poor to afford going to more traditional clinics. Additionally, the risk of deadly respiratory depression from overdose seems virtually nonexistent (a rare quality in opioid analgesics), and subjective withdrawal syndromes seem less severe than those associated with traditional maintenance drugs like buprenorphine.\n\nMoreover, scheduling mitragynine and associated alkaloids poses a significant threat to clinical research. These compounds represent a promising frontier in pharmaceutical research. In the next few decades, kratom-based drug discovery research has serious potential to yield a less harmful alternative to disastrously addictive and diversion-prone drugs like Vicodin and Oxycontin.\n\nFor these reasons, and for the relative scarcity of cases of drastic harm due to kratom use, I urge the DEA to refrain from scheduling kratom, mitragynine, and the related alkaloids.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5586","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Drew Kravinski","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA is not a trustworthy authority on the issue of drugs.

Coupled with the fact that I was born with a degenerative spinal issue, I've tried everything to make life less agonizing.  I've been to many doctors, and the remedies is always the same. Pills pills and more pills. (Surgery is an option,  but I was given a 30-40 percent chance of it helping, and the amount of recovery time would cost me my job, for sure.).  After hearing about Kratom helping others in similar situations to mine, I thought I would give it a try.  The results were amazing.   I've gone from taking 30 mg of hydrocodone a day, to about 15mg a day, almost overnight, and the goal of using none is very much in sight.  The Kratom doesn't negatively effect my sleep like the Hydrocodone,  and it actually helps calm the nerve pain in my leg that results from the spine condition.  Not even the hydrocodone helped with that. To summarize my life has been drastically improved with one dose of 500 mg of Kratom, and I beg you to reconsider placing a ban on it.  My goal is to no longer be beholden to a monthly pain management appointment that offers little in the way of relief, with a whole slew of side effects that make life very unpleasant.  Kratom has given me control over my life again, and I think it would fundamentally  un-American to take that away from people like me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2450","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Larkin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA works for the FDA,and the FDA works for Big Pharma..$$$$$$$$\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21081","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"i am deeply opposed to the DEA proposed ban of kratom.

I believe putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled subtances would hurt the tens of thousands who take it everyday. \nI started taking kratom about 3 years ago. I was looking for relief of migraines and looking for relief for my fibro. I did some research online as I wanted a natural alternative for my body instead of getting prescriptions from a doctor because I have heard the nightmares of some medications in regards to  withdrawls and dependancy. I found a place online and made a first purchase. To my amazement it alleviated the hurtful ailments I had. My migraines were reduced and my fibro was much more better to handle. I can get up in the morning now and take my kratom with a cup of coffee and enjoy my day much better. It helps me move around more so than without taking it, therefore I'm in a state of well being , verses staying home and feeling like I'm missing out on life. \nI'm not a doctor nor a health expert but I wanted to drop a line asking that you keep kratom available for those including myself who would like a natural alternative instead of depending on prescribed pain killers .

I beleive everybody should have access to this plant. I beleive to use kratom is a god given right. I do not beleive the DEA should schedule kratom. This war on human nature will never solve the real problem. We as a whole must find a better solution.

It is important to have a public dialog concerning the legality of plant materials and other drugs.\n\nI don't use kratom, nor do I personally know anyone who does.  I have an interest in maintaining the legal status of any plant based medicine.  In most cases replacement of pharmaceutically based medicines with plant based alternative is much less damaging to the body and less addictive and more cost effective as well.  I have successfully used cannabis as a pain management tool for arthritis instead of taking NSAIDs or other pharmaceuticals.  I sympathize with those who are using kratom to manage their pain and am happy for them that they have found a safe medicine.  The threat of having something taken away from them that is effective in their pain mitigation is disturbing; many will risk becoming felons as they continue to use it if the ban goes into effect.  It is important that those people do not become \"criminals\" because of a ban.  The US already has the largest prison population in the world because of our ineffective war on drugs.  Let us stop this insanity.  Regulate kratom, allow its sale only to adults, require that if come with warning documentation just like any other over the counter medicine, but please do not ban it and continue to add to the mindless incarceration rates of American citizens who only choose to manage their pain.  Consider a mandate of yours to be the education of the citizens on the safe ways to use plant based medicines like kratom.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18877","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Konrad Kummli","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am so relieved the DEA suspended it's proposal to schedule kratom as a scheduled drug, and urge them to withdraw the ban permanently. \nKratom has helped so many people who suffer from chronic illnesses like I do. It's helped eliminate or drastically reduce our need to take prescription painkillers (opioids) just to get through the day. I have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, fibromyalgia, and depression as well as migraine headaches and extreme fatigue. At one point I was taking fentanyl, hydromorphone, tramadol, topamax, cymbalta, and several other medications in order to keep my pain under control. I couldn't drive and could barely function because I was so doped that my pain management doctor prescribed adderal to counteract the sedative effects. I was 30 years old and on more medications than my grandparents. \nLong story short, I've been able to stop taking all the pain medicine and am down to thyroid medication and a mild antidepressant in addition to kratom. My pain is manageable and on \"good\" days I don't even notice it. My depression symptoms have lessened as well and I have the energy to get through the day without having to spend the next week in bed from overdoing things. If it weren't for kratom I'd still be seeing my pain management doctor every month and going though my life in a narcotic daze. I was so worried that this would happen back in August when the ban was proposed and ask that the DEA to please not deny people with chronic conditions the quality of life they deserve.

They are dilations of the nerve root sheaths and are abnormal sacs filled with cerebrospinal fluid.  These cyst compress all my nerves from s1 to s4 and have worn away the bone in my sacrum causing constant pain.  The prescribed hydrocodone that I must take for the rest of my life is proven to be highly addictive. It causes me nausea, constipation and a constant feeling of being 'loopy'.  This makes working and being a contributing member of society extremely difficult.\n\nMy daughters who have been taking kratom for menstrual cramps for several years recommended I try kratom for my constant nerve pain.  I was amazed that drinking a tea from a natural plant could provide pain relief without the horrible side effects and addiction that hydrocodone causes.  Before taking kratom I suffered rather than take the risk of becoming addicted to hydrocodone.  Kratom is a non addictive natural supplement that has provided me enough pain relief to be able to work and be there for my family.  \n\nPlease do not ban a natural substance that has been used around the world for centuries.

She was going down a bad path fast that eventually took the life of her best friend last year . I started researching for alternatives to help her because she was very important to me and came across KRATOM . Long story short she now is almost a year clean and KRATOM helps her from anxiety ,depression , and restless leg syndrome , she has her life back and she does not get high from KRATOM . If it was not for KRATOM and only relying on the chemicals and medicine and god awful support that detox facilities offer and from doctors there's no doubt she would not be here today . Also to add to this story I had back surgery 2 years ago and I also was about to be addicted to opioids and dealing with pain , now I take 2 small doses a day and helps me tremendously,especially for anxiety that I used to deal with . KRATOM is not a susbstance that needs banned , and I as a hard working American citizen should be able to self medicate for me and my family . Now with that said should KRATOM be regulated, yes to a point just like cigarettes and alcohol and definitely quality and purity should be tested and required !!!

My name is Robert Gomez, a 46 yr old graphic artist that lives in El Paso TX.  I have surrounded myself in the natural health industry for more than two decades and would consider myself an overall healthy individual with no sign of addictive tendencies.  I don't smoke and my strongest \"vice\" if you need to know would be a strong cup of coffee or two every morning.  \n\nFor most of my adult life I have had to deal with the symptoms of adult ADHD and mild depression that would manifest in several uncommon ways.  The lack of motivation, anxiety and lack of concentration or focus were becoming bothersome with no end in sight.  I began to research natural alternatives to support my brain and overall health.  When i read upon Kratom, I was skeptical but decided to give it a try.  I didn't have anything else to lose by this point. \n\nKratom has been a godsend.  It has helped me conquer everyday tasks along with my ability to focus and concentrate unlike anything else.  My mood and overall outlook has been uplifted and I no longer feel as if I'm going down a deep hole with no end in sight.  What is even better than the effect I feel is the fact that I don't have ANY side effects while taking it.  Kratom is a wonderful self regulating plant.  It's effective in lower doses and more sedating in higher ones.  If anyone insists on passing the \"threshold\" dosage, he/she will simply feel nauseous and/or eliminate by throwing up.  You feel fine once it's out of your system.  One quickly learns that more is not necessarily better.  \n\nI aid in the care of my elderly mother who is 78 with Osteoarthritis, Diabetes and HBP.  I have been able to wean her off of the Hydrocodone and Tramadol that she was being prescribed by supplementing with Kratom.  Its effect on pain is wonderful and seeing her get back to her \"normal\" self has been a blessing.  The Hydrocodone and Tramadol had effects on her that I wouldn't wish on anyone.  It's wonderful to have my mother back.  \n\nSomething else that is very unique about Kratom is that you don't necessarily \"feel\" any different while on it.  One doesn't feel \"high\", \"inebriated\", or \"loopy\".  You just feel like yourself on a great day.  You,...only better.  I have also been able to stop taking Kratom cold turkey with no ill effect on my body or mind as well.  I feel much worse when I stop drinking coffee.  A numbing headache quickly follows until I take my next cup o' Joe.  \n\nI hope that my comment, along with the thousands of others that have been submitted are seriously considered when taking a closer look at Kratom.  Please don't try and make it a Schedule 1 narcotic.  That would be doing so much more harm than good and in the current state that our Healthcare is or is going to be, we need all the help we can get.  \n\nThank  you once again for your time in reading my comment.  Please don't hesitate contacting me if you need any further information regarding my submitted entry.  \n\nBest Regards, \n\nRobert Gomez","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16704","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Gomez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 41 year old woman who works in the substance abuse field as a Masters level counselor. Additionally, I happen to be in recovery myself - sober from drugs and alcohol for almost 8 years now. What I see, day in and day out, combined with my personal, first-hand experience with Kratom leads me to be EXTREMELY troubled and quite frankly BAFFLED regarding the DEA's plan to schedule Kratom as a controlled substance.\n\nFor well over a year, I have been using Kratom regularly - both safely and responsibly. I drink Kratom much like one consumes coffee, tea or soda. As a matter of fact, in my experience, coffee is FAR more addictive and quite a bit stronger than Kratom - which is why I fail to understand how Kratom would be categorized with hard core drugs.\n\nMany of my good friends and acquaintances also consume Kratom. All do it safely and responsibly. As a matter of fact, I've NEVER even heard of anyone abusing Kratom. What I have heard from the patients I work with is that Kratom is one of the only things that can prevent them from becoming \"dope-sick\" when they are trying to get off opiates or heroin. Many patients can't afford methadone, suboxone or the like but can't bear to go through the excruciating withdrawal. It is cruel to deprive these people from the opportunity of accessing a natural and inexpensive remedy seeing as so many are suffering intensely on a regular basis. I truly wish all opiate addicts knew of Kratom as I am confident it could save many lives. This is why I fail to grasp how this beneficial plant could be so misunderstood.\n\nBecause I am a recovered alcoholic, I think it is fair to say I understand how addiction feels and know first-hand the damage it causes. Working in the field of substance abuse has made me extremely familiar with other peoples addictions as well as the impact on family and society. I am absolutely 100% clear that Kratom does not even remotely compare to any addictive substances including legal alcohol. Alcohol and nicotine are FAR more damaging and addictive.\n\nPlease do not prevent us from harnessing this plant that has so much promise. Kratom has healing properties and can possibly mitigate the devastating epidemic of opiate abuse. Today more people are dying from opiate overdoses than from car accidents or guns. Clearly our opiate problem has reached catastrophic proportions. Is it sane or reasonable to ban a natural remedy that could help save millions of lives? Perhaps we would be better served exploring solutions to the problem instead of mislabeling a remedy. Please consider how many people could be helped by Kratom. Please consider how many people are ALREADY being helped by Kratom. Please prioritize human lives and scientific evidence over misinformation and misunderstanding. Please do the research.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA recovered alcoholic substance abuse counselor and Kratom supporter","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21393","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was introduced to Kratom as an alternative to prescription pain killers.

I can safely say that Kratom saved my life and gave me a fresh start. I am writing this not because I continue to use Kratom, but in hope that somebody that is currently where I was a few years ago has a chance to take advantage of Kratom in helping them quit taking perscription pain medication all together. By making the plant illegal, I worry that it would only contribute to the growing number of deaths and those abusing perscription pain killers. This issue may seem very small to this who have never had issues with addiction, but for those that have I know they can relate.

My father was a brave and strong man who never looked at his life as a struggle. But while he had sciatic pain in his back he turns to Oxycontin from his doctor as a relief. After 6 months of Oxycontin use he took his life. After autopsy it is known that he had a dangerous level of Oxycontin in his system. I don't blame the doctors for prescribing this to him. The system now and the drugs that are available to people with constant pain are not sufficient. Due to addiction and harmful side effects this cannot be our only option. I believe that more studies need to be performed on Creative because it could be a perfect replacement for all these harmful drugs. Nobody should lose a family member from something that is legal and prescribed by doctors for every day pain that can easily be subsided by something natural. This should not be illegal until deemed Dangerous by multiple studies.

I currently suffer from ADHD and Social Anxiety Disorder. Kratom has helped me TREMENDOUSLY with my conditions, Im able to focus and I am finally able to resolve my anxiety without losing my motivation. Kratom is is related to coffee and works in a very similar way. The herbs I have used in the past for anxiety just make me feel tired and worthless. Kratom has helped me treat my anxiety and my ADHD simultaneously and has GREATLY helped my productivity.\n \n      My next topic isnt so happy and colorful ,ive seen WAY TOO MANY of my friends struggle with opiates and heroine. Im sure your aware of the astounding number of opioid deaths in the past couple of years ,if not the number has TRIPLED in the past two years here in in our country. My home state , Virginia has declared in a state of emergency and it  has become an official epidemic. Everyone Ive talked to here in CO has said all of there friends back home (east coast and midwest) are all hooked on heroine or some sort of opioids .I cant tell you how tragic this is to me.In the past year Ive had three friends I went to highschool with die from overdose, one of them was a good friend of mine and a father to a baby girl. Now that you know how serious those heroine sirens are (if you didnt already), I would like let you know how beneficial kratom is to people I know that are off of  heroine because of Kratom. Because of kratom they are able to have a life again without opiates, because of kratom they are able to hang out with friends like my self and family. Because of kratom they are able to raise their kids without having cravings or temptations of those heroine sirens.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21624","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Edward MAyo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom this may concern at the DEA...\n\nI am a 36 year old husband and father.

I've struggled with both my entire life. It makes it extremely difficult to communicate with people and to hold down a job.\n\nOver the years,  I have been prescribed a multitude of different medications to treat my conditions, including adderal, vyvanse, concerta, xanax, clonopin, and Wellbutrin. Adderal and vyvvanse helped for ADHD, but they increased my social anxiety 10 fold. Not to mention, coming off of these drugs had crippling side effects. \n\nXanax and clonopin helped deal with my social anxiety, however, they both exacerbated my ADHD. Also, after coming off of Xanax use for one month, I was unable to sleep for 2 weeks. The withdrawal symptoms can only be described as being dragged through hell. I am over a year removed from the period of time that I used these drugs, and I still do not sleep well. Additionally, my residual anxiety remains.\n\nI found Kratom in a moment of desperation; when I was searching for any possible solution to my problem. My first time taking it was a breath of fresh air. It gave me the ability to not only focus on my job,  but to interact with other people with absolutely no trouble. It has been an absolute godsend for me, without the side effects associated with the medications listed above. \n\nI take Kratom once or twice per week maximum, and it really helps me. It is a much better alternative to dangerous pharmaceuticals that have great influence over public agencies like yourselves. I know from personal experience, as well as through watching my brother deal with a crippling opioid addiction. Keep the safe, herbal alternatives on the market, so people can fight back against the dangerous alternatives.

I had never even heard of it before.\n\nI suffer from multiple herniated disks in my lower back and stenosis in my neck. I have been dealing with this for around 7-8 years. Since I didn't know about Kratom I have been using doctor prescribed pain medication for years.\n\nWhile I didn't end up heavily addicted to the pain medication, my body did become dependent. This turned my life into a mess when I ran out of medication early, or when I went through worse than normal pain episodes and the medication simply didn't work well enough.\n\nThe very first time I tried Kratom, I immediately started feeling better. Not only was I more functional, but all of the side effects I had to deal with when using pain medication, didn't happen with Kratom. The only similar side effect I encountered was constipation, but no where near as bad as from the pain medication.\n\nKratom is a miracle for me, and I know it is for millions of others as well. I beg you from the bottom of my heart, please keep Kratom legal. I don't want to go back to using the prescribed drugs I was using before, and am so worried I will have to.\n\nI implore you to consider all the good Kratom does for people and to keep it legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16616","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shawn Ziemba","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Leave us alone!

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works... It uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies. http://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes... Thailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects. http://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15424","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alan Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It's a harmless herb.

I not only experience the struggles of quitting drugs, but watched many others around me destroying their lives. Kratom is completely natural, and there aren't the horrible side effects that come along with it like pharmaceutical drugs. Now, I use kratom to relieve anxiety, and help me focus while I spend long hours studying to complete my degree. I also use it before I go the the gym. I feel energized, and motivated, and I don't get as sore after my workouts. Will the country will be safer without kratom?

Back in 2009 \nI had a football size tumor removed from my intestine tract which led to many digestive issues for years following.\nI now am given 30 mg Morphine Sulfate 3x daily and 15mg Oxycodone 6x daily as needed. Being stuck in the cycle of \nnarcotic pain killers fucking sucks! You are a slave to the pill, if you don't play along your going to feel like shit.\nBut here's the thing... I can take a day off my given meds (or when I run low and have with-drawl issues due to the cost \nof filling a medication) from my pain management dr. and take a small dose of kratom instead. I can actually get around and have\nsome quality of life.\nIf gives people hope to be pain free without the dependency of Big Pharma and their Herion. Call it any fancy name you like but \nonce the pill passes the BBB it's Herion plain and simple. were looking for a cure for this madness, Methadone is NOT AN ANSWER!!!\nI was on this for 3 years and it is VERY ADDICTIVE and has a high danger level as the half life is so lone (12hrs).\nI know you are concerned with addiction and horrible things like \"bath salts\". I agree that kind of chemical is not something we as\na people need. But Kratom is different. It allows me to get around like I could never before. I can run and play with my daughter,\nI can take a small dose (1tsp) after a hard days work of being in so much pain you have to encourage yourself to walk another step.\nThis can be a solution to our epidemic of those who want to get off the junk but don't have access to a methadone clinic (methadone is fucked!!), \nor have the courage or finances to get the traditional help. It eases with-drawl issues and eases pain WITHOUT THE SEDITION \nOR \"SMACKED\" FEELING OF OPIATES. \nI do beg of you to please leave this wonderful gift of a pain free life without the Big Pharma addiction and risk of death. \nOr at the least give it time before you do, maybe study a few groups of patients.

I work at Starbucks and it can be very stressful at times. Yes I can have a sandwhich and relax, but the stress remains. I get anxious about angry customers, anxious about making drinks, and anxious about just doing my job right. The knly thing that has significantly helped me is kratom. It doesnt intoxicate me or prevent me from doing my job. It actually helps me. It lowers my stress levels and instead of being worried about customers, I open up and interact customers like never before. Kratom has helped me enjoy my job and it would make work hell if it becomes scheduled. It has also helped me family as well. My father is a blue collar worker and has frequent chronic back pain. I gave him some kratom to try and it dramatically helped him. His back felt a lot better and he was able to go back to work and complete his jobs. Kratom has been used by many workers to assist them in building the infrastructure you rely on. If kratom becomes illegal, it will bring dire consequences. Even if it does become scheduled, you cant take it away from us. We will get what we need. We are all sick and tired of you (the DEA) for trying to take away plants we use everyday to help us get through the days. We dont want your big-pharma drugs. You cant win the war on drugs. You cant win a war you created.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15961","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ben Goumalatsos","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been a helpful substitute for OTC, prescription, and illegally obtained drugs.

I suffer daily from excruciating debilitating pain from my upper back and through my feet. The drs refused to give me anything for the first two years but I still had to work to pay my bills. I'm not talking a minor ache and pain here, I'm talking I can barely get out of bed and when I do hurting so bad thats where I want to be. I wished the lord would take me so I didn't have to keep suffering...I had to do something because NOTHING over the counter helped which is when I came across kratom. It literally  was a godsend for me...While I still had to go through  the pain daily, by the afternoon I could feel much better to the point where I could do normal things such as clean shop other household chores as well as continue to work. Kratom doesn't make you high and dangerous its not like you hear about the bath salts and various other things. It allowed me to have at least part of what is being stolen from me every single day back....My life. They finally started giving me something a year and a half ago and I stopped using kratom....There were no withdrawals or anything else negative except for feeling sleepier than normal by the end of the day. In the past couple months things have gotten worse for me especially when a cold or warm front comes through which in the Midwest is quite frequently. My dr said to double up on my pain meds on those days but yet didn't give me more so if I do double up then id be making myself short another day and thats not an option. So I have once again turned to kratom to supplement what they are giving me on those terrible days and it helps immensely.

I am part of a community that uses Kratom extensively.  I see people use it for a variety of reasons.  The main things that we use it for is an alternative to dangerous drugs and alcohol. We go out dancing in environments where everyone is having a good time but no one is inebriated to where they become a threat to themselves or anyone around them.  This is the main reason this is such a beautiful plant.  It is extremely safe compared to already legal substances like tobacco and alcohol.  \nI also am a Veteran.  I was an air force linguist so I never saw direct combat.  However, I have plenty of friends and family that have.  Kratom helps them with their pain that they have from injuries sustained while fighting for our country.  It also helps with anxiety from PTSD.\nOn a personal level.  I honestly have found Kratom to be very useful for eliminating allergies.  I used to get massive migraines that originate from a variety of allergic reactions.  Once I learned how to use Kratom effectively, I haven't had a migraine from allergies in three years.  Before Kratom I was taking over the counter pills that were probably destroying my liver, making me feel groggy, and didn't really work as well as Kratom anyways.\nPlease, I am a grown man with a discerning intellect.  I have always made choices in my life that were, for the most part, good.  Good for me, my family, my friends, my community, and my country.  I have no doubt that choosing to have this amazing plant in our lives is a good choice.  \nThank You","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15590","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Patrick Presfield","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To the DEA, FDA, & to those whom can help me live without suffering from the Deadly Effects of Pharmaceutical Pain Relievers? My name is James Clark Tippens. I'm 52 year's old suffer from chronic pain due to Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Frequent Shoulder Dislocation. Due to generalized laxity of ligaments, I have combanation of diagnosis known as Bankarts & Hill-Sachs lesion. Also some deterioration of the L4 & L5 disks in my back. Needless to say I'm familiar with chronic sometimes debilitating pain. I had ben taking Pharmaceutical Brand Pain Relievers for close to 10 years. It was a verry difficult time for me to maintaine my family relations with a constant feeling of alienating myself only wanting relief from the constant pain I was feeling & knowing that I was never really myself on these Pharmaceutical Pain Relievers as thay tend to put my mind into a sort of Zombified Trance whenever I was at family get togethers? Not to mention my wife beging me to stop taking these horrible mind numbing personMedsy erasing dangerously deadly drug's. I was constantly trying to please my wife in getting off of these medications but alway's relying on them when my pain level's got to a point where I needed relief. It all came to a head when I visited my doctor for a situation where I felt verry sick & he took some tests. He immediately came in the room after he stepped out to speak to his nurse. He said you need to go to the hospital immediately. Lucky for me my wife was there with me as she was concerned about my sickness. My wife then drove me to the Hospital as thay rushed me into the ICU. Apparently my blood showed sings of Complete Renal Failier. I spent 4 day's in ICU at Saint Josuph's Hospital in Burbank Ca. I had wondered what had caused my Renal Failure? I had occured to me that it might be due to the amount of Acitametaphine mixed in the Pharmaceutical Pain Relievers which was recently lowered due to the amount of death's caused & increasingly growing to 16 thousand a year deaths caused by Pharmaceutical Pain Meds.\nAt that point I knew I had to finally find a way to get off of these medications for good. I Emptied my soul feeling totally powerless against this deadly medication that was sure to kill me if I didn't stop taking them? I truly believe a mirricole occurred at the point I Preyed to God. Please Loard why can't there be a natural God made Pain Reliever that would take my pain away without killing me or turning me into a Zombie that takes me away from the present's of mind to be able to enjoy my life & loved ones? I looked at my phone that i asked Google this verry question. Two seconds later I saw the name Kratom on the screen. I researched further & thought I can't be soo? But after thinking try a little. It can't hurt? Maybe it's a direct answer to my prayer? Needless to say. It truly was. I believe that whole heartedly. I also learned Kratom has ben used for hundred's of years in Asian Indonesian & Manny Cultures with No Death's Caused as Opposed to the 16 thousand Death's caused by Pharmaceutical Pain Meds.\nSincerely: James Clark Tippens","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4756","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Tippens","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has really helped me lower my alcohol abuse.

After completing treatment they used Kratom at times to help with their craving cycle for opiates. They have been clean for a few years now. They where honest about using Kratom to help with cravings and chose this as an option over Suboxone as they had heard from others that being detoxed from Suboxone was just as difficult as detoxing from opiates. They no longer use Kratom as it served its purpose for them. It is my opinion that Kratom was  critical in their development of abstinence and in the long run probably saved them from a life long struggle with opiates, which would have ultimately lead to them being incarcerated or dying from an overdose.

It is the only thing that has any effect on my pain due to peripheral neuropathy.  Please do more research and when I say research at least study.  As the opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic kills tens of thousands of Americans each year, some pain patients have turned to alternatives to opioids to ease their pain without as big of a risk of addiction and overdose. One of those alternatives is kratom, which appears to have  although, again, we dont know for sure, since the research is scarce  fewer deadly risks than opioids, yet can still relieve peoples pain.\n\nThe best overview of kratoms effects comes from a 2015 study published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study noted that there wasnt rigorous scientific research on kratoms effects on humans. So it instead analyzed hundreds of anecdotal accounts from Erowid, a popular website for drug users and researchers, to gauge its effects.\n\nThe study found several positive effects (from most to least common): euphoria, relaxation, enhanced sociability, increased energy, pain relief, sensory enhancement, and warmth or tingling. It also found some negative effects (from most to least common): nausea and stomachaches, withdrawal (from addiction), chills and sweats, dizziness and unsteadiness, vomiting, hangovers, and itching. Reviewing other research, the study found no good evidence that kratom alone has caused deadly overdoses.\n\nAccording to the study, the pain relief element has become particularly promising for pain patients who want to seek alternatives to highly addictive, potentially deadly opioid painkillers. The study also found that kratom may aid with easing withdrawal from opioid addiction.\n\nThe Transnational Institute, in its 2011 report, noted these benefits have been known in other parts of the world for a long time:\n\nMany studies report that the effect of kratom on the body reduces pain from withdrawal symptoms and helps manage detoxification. Interviews with [Thai] community members and leaders indicated that many people have been using kratom to wean themselves off heroin, yaba, and even alcohol and tobacco dependence. Indeed, 60 years ago, when kratom became a controlled substance in Thailand, its potential for management of opiate dependence had been widely recognised.\nBut how do the positives and negatives of kratom compare to opioid painkillers and other drugs? Chris Ingraham, whos done a lot of great reporting on kratom at the Washington Post, scoured Erowid for positive and negative anecdotal accounts for several drugs and how they compared to the positive and negative accounts for kratom. He put them all together in this chart, which suggests that kratom is less risky than marijuana and the opioid painkiller oxycodone:\n\n\n\nStill, the ranking suggests kratom is relatively safe. So why did the DEA move to ban it?\n\nWhy the DEA moved to ban kratom\nThe seal for the DEA.\nMandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\nThe DEAs initial decision to ban kratom came as the drug had slowly gained some popularity in the US.\n\nWith that popularity came more negative reports of kratom abuse: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the number of calls involving kratom to US poison centers \"increased tenfold from 26 in 2010 to 263 in 2015.\" And the DEA has tracked 15 deaths linked to kratom between 2014 and 2016  although none of those deaths were directly attributed to kratom, since people often use it with other drugs.\n\nGiven these concerns, the DEA at first concluded that it needed to ban kratom to \"avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.\" So it moved to classify kratom as schedule 1  meaning the agency would consider kratom to have high potential for abuse and no recognized medical value, and banning its sales and production. (As of now, kratom is on the DEAs list of \"drugs of concern,\" meaning the agency is keeping an eye on the drug but not officially banning it.)\n\nTHE DEA AT FIRST CONCLUDED THAT IT NEEDED TO BAN KRATOM TO \"AVOID AN IMMINENT HAZARD TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY\"\nBut the biggest issue for the DEA seemed to be that we just dont know enough about kratom.\n\nGenerally, in the US, drugs are regulated to ensure their safety and effectiveness. The DEAs mission is in large part to ensure that drugs are not being abused recreationally, but also to ensure that drugs that are often abused recreationally are available for use as medicine if theres research to support medical use. It typically does this by locking drugs into different schedules that measure potential for abuse and medical value.\n\nPlease research this more. Making it a schedule 1 drug will only put innocent people into an already overcrowded prison system.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7680","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amy Rengo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has made a positive impact on my life and well being in the following way.

I started using kratom about 3 years ago to deal with chronic pain and major depression. I've tried a multitude of  prescription anti-depressant as well as talk therapy with very limited success. I have also been prescribed narcotic painkillers in an effort to deal with my chronic pain. I found them effective but worried about the potential for becoming dependent on them. I would take these pain killers when I had unrelenting pain but after my pain flare ups improved I would discontinue taking them. I experienced withdrawal from these prescriptions even though I never took more than prescribed. I read about kratom online and heard it was effective for pain but with fewer problems than prescription narcotics. I was amazed that when I took kratom several days in a row for my pain flare ups that not only did my pain improve but I felt significantly less depressed. Furthermore, when I discontinued kratom after about a week and a half, I felt none of the withdrawal symptoms that I did when using my prescription Percocet. I strongly oppose scheduling kratom or its alkaloids as a Scheduled I substance. This is a plant that is on this planet to help people.

I myself have struggle with Opiate addiction. For the better part of a decade, and when I found kratom, it did not offer me solice; it just replaced my needles and back alley meetings for stomachs full of capsules and daily visits to local head shops. People that believe this a cure for addiction, ESPECIALLY Opiate addiction, are sadly mistaken. This drug produces identical feelings to low amounts of heroin, and it is also EXTREMELY habit forming. I was addicted, physically and mentally, to kratom for over a gear. While the withdrawl from it was not as severe, it was very, very unpleasant. I would hedge a serious bet that anyone else with the same affinity for drug abuse that have would too experience a substitution of kratom for their current Opiate drug of choice. Again, not only does it produce similar effects, but it is legal! Which is rediculous. If this drug is so helpful to those with pain, then it could atleast be a schedule 2 drug, with some kind of regulation. This drug is currently available at almost every head shop in my city, to anyone 18 or older (or potentially younger, because who's to say how strict these business owners even card their younger customers.) It is utterly absurd to me that a drug that is physically habit forming can be so openly sold on the open market, both at brick and mortar locations, as well as from the click of a button from dozens of Internet sites.  Kratom addiction brought me to a place of utter hopelessness and near suicide. All it takes to create a habit in someone using this drug is a couple uses. Anyone that has a genetic predisposition to addiction will find this drug, see that it's legal and easy to get, and possibly get addicted. Not only those people, but this, much like \"spice\" (synthetic Marijuana), is just another loophole drug that people trying to avoid failing drug tests can take. Substitution of one addiction for another is not the answer. Maintenance drugs are not the cure for addiction in today's world. I can see this just becoming the next suboxone or methadone, which have arguably been failures in the sense that all these doctors are doing are getting their patients dependent on something they prescribe, rather than something they buy on the street. My only positive comments on Kratom are that I do believe that it is a better alternative to perscription opioids for those who are in chronic, severe pain.  Because of this, I believe this drug should be able to be distributed to those who need it, but only by licensed professionals, after it has been researched by the FDA. I know me saying this kind of contradicts my previous statements on doctors prescribing maintenence drugs, but atleast if someone has to have a license to prescribe and distribute the drug, then it will immensely cut down on the chances of it falling into the hands of those people who want to abuse it to get high.  Please, I implore you to take this drug off of the streets. There is a reason that so many other countries have made it illegal; when not used for proper reasons, it can negatively impact, and even destroy lives! Leaving this drug available for purchase and distribution by Americans who either have no clue what the possiblength outcomes of its abuse are, or who actively sell it knowing that it will get their customers hooked (in turn making them huge profits and daily eevenue) is just plain immoral, and wrong!!!

He has always had issues with pain and someone introduced him to kratom a couple of years ago. He has struggled with addiction to it ever since. The problem was made worse since it was so easy to get. He acts as if he is addicted to heroin and can't get off of it. He says it is just as bad as heroin. He does go through withdrawals when he tries. He has resorted to stealing from me so he can get it. He tells me he is off of it and has gotten himself into recovery groups but then he wants to get high just one more time and it is a vicious cycle. Kratom controls him! It is not harmless! He can't control himself because of the Kratom. These people who say that it helps them so much probably couldn't get off of it if they tried. Thankfully, he started taking Naltrexon and now is getting the Vivitrol shots. This is the only thing that is keeping him clean. He was so happy when he heard the DEA was going to make it a schedule 1 and I know the temptation will be hard for him if it is not changed to a schedule 1 drug. He won't be able to be on the Naltrexon/Vivitrol forever and I am very scared what will happen when that stops. I do hope you will make kratom a schedule 1 drug and save innocent people from getting addicted because they think there is no harm in it. That is the farthest thing from the truth. Kratom is addictive and dangerous and should not be sold over the counter.

I spent the majority of my 20's addicted to opiate painkillers and contribute my ability to thrive in both my professional and family roles to kratom. When I was addicted to opioids, I was spending every dime I had on getting more. Trying to get sober without any sort of assistance was completely debilitating and incompatible with my desire to achieve success in my career and be a good father. The drugs that the pharmaceutical companies have decided are acceptable for use as an opiate cessation tool are highly addictive, expensive, dangerous, and difficult to access. Kratom is NONE of these things. With kratom I am able to cope with my frequent back pain without having to resort to dangerous and addictive opioid medications. Furthermore, I am able to afford it comfortably and do not have to worry about running out of money or resources to obtain it. I don't have to worry about going to sleep and never waking up. I don't have to worry about resorting to dangerous acts in order to obtain it. At least, I won't have to worry about those things if the DEA determines that scheduling kratom as a Schedule 1 substance is completely unnecessary and reactionary.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people rely on kratom to remain free from pain, sober, and mentally well. Kratom has not been associated with dangerous crime the way that drugs of abuse have, and that is just one of many reasons why it does not belong on the List of Controlled Substances. I implore you to not restrict people's freedom to find wellness from naturally occurring sources. I am confident that the country is in a better state with kratom being available than without.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5561","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello. Let me first begin by saying that I truly respect the DEA and the work that they do. I believe it is an extremely important and dangerous line of work that you do everyday. Without the brave men and women of the DEA this country would be an all together different place. Kratom however should not be banned or scheduled. This plant has changed so many lives and not to mention saved so many lives also. It keeps people who have extreme herion or opiate addictions from using. It has saved so many from ruining their lives or ending their lives from an overdose or worse. I have also noticed that Kratom has helped individuals who are effected by alcoholism, not drink anymore. I have also noticed when that when Kratom was banned in certain states of the United States heroin overdoses were much more again. The numbers don't lie. I myself have tried this wonderful leaf and let me tell you it has never made me not be able to function at my everyday tasks. It has helped with depression, anxiexty, and many other problems that people struggle with everyday. I am telling that you are making a huge mistake by banning Kratom. Just because heroin is illegal it does not mean that people can't get it easily offbof the streets, but I think with Kratom its going to keep many of our drug users from killing themselves. Once you take away something that god has made that grows on this Earth that is a cure all for many ,  you've taken away the rights and needs of the people. It is wrong to do such a thing especially when there are far more worse things that you should be worried about.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9720","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laine Wireman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Chris Hall, and I have been a daily kratom user for close to a year now.

I am a full time employee as a registrar for a school district.  I am writing in opposition to the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.  I was introduced to kratom a year ago by my brother.  My brother had researched a way to free himself from a 12 yr addiction to oxycontin which had been prescribed to him by his doctor for various medical conditions.  He had never heard of kratom before but found blogs by people who had freed themselves from opiate addictions  by drinking kratom tea.  He ordered some and within 2 weeks with no withdrawal symptoms he was free from oxycontin and has not used it since.  \nI have found that this plant  works better to ease the  pain of my diabetic neuropathy, arthritis and sciatica than any of the drugs prescribed by doctors.  I have never ever felt, foggy headed, drugged or had a negative reaction when I use it, in fact just the opposite.\nI get a lift much like a good cup of coffee. I am very clear headed and more productive. \nMy mother who is 82 also uses it now to ease the pain of old age and finds that she feels more productive also.  She has also never had a negative reaction.  Kratom is not something that is used recreationally.  \nIn conclusion Kratom has been beneficial to myself and other members of my family\nfor different reasons.  To make this plant illegal to use for people who have benefited from it would be a very bad thing possibly causing a ripple effect and driving people to use drugs, the very legal drugs that actually have cause deaths.

The community that I live in happens to be the recovery capital of the world. I've also worked in treatment centers for substance abuse for the past 5 years and have not encountered one case of Kratom addiction. \n\nThe plant is in the same family as coffee and typically used to brew tea. It is psychoactive and does activate opiate receptors but it is not an opiate. It's effects are mild and do not impair the users ability to operate heavy machinery or drive. The kava bars that sell this tea provide education to anyone who is trying Kratom for the first time, clearly serving it in a responsible way.\n\n I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease at a very young age and for many years I've been able to control the symptoms by using this herb. It's safe and honestly it cannot be abused in tea form. I have heard rare cases where people have abused the extract version of this plant but they are far and few between. Reports of incidents where people died or were injured with Kratom in their system are often misreported and always included some other mind altering substance. These events are very low in numbers and are unsubstantial if compared to alcohol related deaths or pharmaceutical related overdose. Both having astronomical numbers. \n\nIn comparison to Kratom there are many substances either over the counter (approved by FDA) or synthetic (unable to be scheduled due to chemical make-up) that are widely available, abused and repeatedly on the news, that nothing is being done about.\n\nIn the field of recovery I have met many people (addicts) who have used this supplement to treat chronic pain, exhaustion, anxiety etc. without having to turn back to opiates which had previously destroyed their lives. For them, Kratom has served as a safe alternative that does not pose a threat to their lives and their families lives.\n\nPlease consider that many people benefit from this herb and if it is banned there will be very negative consequences that will be imposed on good law abiding citizens who pay their taxes and make positive contributions to society. Their quality of life is in jeopardy and in my case I will be forced to turn back to pharmaceutical narcotics that I one point destroyed my life and left me homeless with nothing. I'm lucky to be alive and Kratom has played a major role in my personal recovery.

These pills were highly addictive and turned me into a moody, depressive monster who couldn't function without them. In addition to my addiction, my mental health deteriorated to the point that I was so depressed I couldn't get out of bed in the morning (or afternoon...or evening). I did some research online, and came across Kratom like many others with the same issues I faced every day. Since switching to kratom, I've taken myself completely off pharmaceutical pain pills and my depression has almost completely disappeared. I'm able to function as if I never had major back surgery, and I'm even able to play hockey multiple times per week. If I wake up in pain, I take 2-3 grams of kratom mixed with whey protein powder, and I'm good to go in 15 minutes. I'm concerned about the DEA's reckless effort to place kratom in the same category as heroin and cocaine. The comparisons I've seen by some major news networks of kratom to cocaine and heroin is absolute absurdity, and I've never talked with anyone who's ACTUALLY tried the substance compare it to any hard drugs. Claiming that kratom is responsible for over 10 deaths (rarely mentioning the other substances in the victims system) is NOTHING compared to the thousands of victims to pharmaceutical opiates. Even mentioning the poison control numbers as if they're an issue is hilarious as well - how many people call poison control due to caffeine, tylenol, and alcohol every year? The numbers are multitudes higher than the fractional percentage of people who call about ingesting kratom. If the DEA follows through with the scheduling of kratom, thousands of people like me will be forced to hop back on the opiate train to manage pain. IF THE DEA SCHEDULES KRATOM, MORE PEOPLE WILL OVERDOSE ON OPIATES. Please reconsider and listen to the American people - kratom isn't in the same universe as heroin and cocaine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2321","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Murphy Jr","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, \n\nDo not ban Kratom.

I started taking Kratom almost 2 years ago. I first started taking Kratom for two reasons. (1) My mother and brother were both addicted to prescription opiates due to physician prescriptions for chronic pain and I wanted to help find a way to assist them in getting off prescription meds that were ruining the quality of their life; (2) I was beginning to develop similar problems as my mother and was beginning to be prescribed these horrible medications as a way to deal with those issues at any time. I have slowly watched my mother deteriorate for the last 15 - 20 years. She is only 65 years old, but I have been living with her and my father to help as her caregiver for 10 years now because she appears to have the life of an 85 year old. This has ruined her life as well as my own and ruined the relationship she has with both my brothers and father. The doctor's began decreasing her prescriptions of these medications a couple years ago. The first time I noticed was when she was recovering from her third spinal fusion and the prescription she had said to take 2-4 pills every 4-6 hours as needed for pain, but if she took anything except the bare minimum of that prescription she would run out days in advance of when she could get a refill. \n\nRegardless, the main point was that opiates have ruined my family and I couldn't look forward to them ruining my personal health as well. Instead, I found Kratom. I've been able to avoid opiates as a result. Kratom has never gave me that disconnected feeling that opiates do. I've not noticed any negative effects of taking it. I would appreciate it, as a citizen of this country, that you look at the science and allow for appropriate studies before thinking about making a decision to schedule it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20817","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jaclyn Schoen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for having a comments section in regards to Kratom.  I have used Kratom once and I found it to be extremely mild.  I could barely even feel the effects, but I was more relaxed from it.  Other than that, I didn't feel different.  I know several people who use Kratom for pain and their quality of life would greatly suffer without it.  They do not want to use any opiate pain killers (because they're so addictive) and they tell me that Kratom is not addictive for them, but it gives them enough pain relief to not use any other drugs.  I understand that it is your job and your concern to help keep the public safe, but making Kratom illegal will do much more harm than good.  I do not know of any incident in which Kratom has caused any harm.  I have researched the few incidents in which it apparently caused death, but it is clear that there were many other factors in those deaths and it would be more than a stretch to implicate Kratom as the cause.  Krater is a natural medicine and it seems to me that we have a right to use it, especially when there really is no evidence to suggest that it is harmful while there is plenty of situational evidence that shows it helping people.

In 2009 I had heart surgery to close a hole in my heart, that lead to a stroke, that caused my honorable discharge from the United States Navy. During the surgery the doctor damaged my right phrenic nerve, paralyzing my right diaphragm. For about 10 months after my procedure I was prescribed and used prescription pain killers, to the point where I felt that I was addicted. The doctors called the constant discomfort that I felt as a \"slow pain\" and because of it, for years I dealt with issues of insomnia, depression, and a general lack of energy. I had no energy to play with my 2 year old daughter when I came home and would get annoyed by her wanting to play with her daddy, all I wanted to do was rest. I was in a really low spot. I talked to my doctor about it regularly and he placed me on many different prescription drugs to try and mitigate the issues that the surgery caused. None of them were a permanent solution. At that time, I started to research natural anti-depressants and natural replacements for opiates, and that is where I found Kratom. I found out that the local tobacco shop sold it, so I went and purchased some. After taking it, I was instantly overcome with a feeling of goodness and general well-being. That night, I went home and ran around the yard with my daughter, for the first time since she had been born. I felt new life! I purchased it for a while from that store and eventually came to know several farmers from Indonesia that sold the botanical in bulk, at much more reasonable prices, so I started buying it from them. Through my day to day life, I couldn't help but tell people about this miracle that had brought me back to life, that allowed me to feel whole again, that repaired the relationships between me and my family. In doing so, I found several other people that were interested in trying Kratom. We ended up forming a co-op. Among the people in the co-op were 3 heroin addicts who had collectively overdosed and died over 10 different times, they had all been to rehabs and all had relapsed, they knew they needed an alternative because the addiction was too strong for them to beat. Kratom provided them with a safe and healthy alternative, and they have all been clean from heroin for over 2 years now. Also in the co-op is two alcoholics. These two people have also struggled with addiction, and depression, and the multiple attempts at treatment through prescription medications had failed them both, alcohol was their only solution, until I introduced them to Kratom. One of them for a year, the other for two years, have been sober, and haven't touched a drop of alcohol, because of Kratom.  Another member of the co-op has a rare degenerative disorder, there are only three known people in the world that has this disorder, and one is his brother. His muscles are literally deteriorating daily, and to combat the degeneration, he has to constantly exercise. He was in a constant state of pain and lived with multiple handicaps. Since introduced to Kratom, he no longer has pain, has had energy to exercise, and has an overall positive outlook on life, when no one in the medical community ever gave him a single shred of hope. I have another member of the co-op that is a wealthy business owner. He used to quell the stresses of his life with alcohol, Xanax, and over eating. Since taking Kratom (for about a year now) he only drinks socially and he has lost over 80 lbs. He has not taken a prescription medication for almost a year and the doctor says that he has never seen this man in such good health. Then there are the few people who really don't have anything \"wrong with them\" per se, but they, like everyone else, feel the pressure of the daily lives that our nation's boom and bustle lays upon their shoulders. In stead of turning to unhealthy means of occasional stress relief (alcohol, drugs, sex, etc) they use Kratom as an occasional opportunity to decompress...provide some outlet to the pressure that is created by a culture of constant business and general stress. \nI have never known of anyone to have any adverse reactions from Kratom, never known of anyone who wasn't able to stop use on command and at will. Quite the contrary, everyone that I know that has used Kratom, including myself, has actually displayed increases in all aspects of personal and mental health. Our little co-cp is a representative sample of the population as a whole that uses Kratom. We are productive members of society that have been great contributions to society BECAUSE of Kratom, and the opportunities that it has created for us. We are military veterans, fathers, mothers, employees, employers, church members, clergy, doctors, lawyers, farmers, and sales people. We are normal people, and much of that normalcy can be attributed to Kratom. To take away this natural plant is to do a great disservice to many people in our great nation.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15785","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Phillip Edmonds","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I just wanted to express my feelings on how kratom has changed my life. I was in a head-on car accident in the year 2000 I have been on pain medicine for the past 16 years. It ended up at the doctors that have cared for me in the past have put me on some very strong medications like Fentanyl. It took me over three and a half months to actually get off at this dangerous pain medication. In the year 2014 my daughter died of a drug overdose of what she thought with Heroin instead it was pure Fentanyl. I just could not continue to live off of the pain medications any longer everytime I put on a patch it reminded me of the death of my daughter. I was introduced 2 kratom it has dramatically changed my life from where I was constantly laying in bed in severe pain and the thought of even moving will cause so much pain I had no quality of life. However when I started using kratom I have been able to have a productive life I don't lay around in bed like I used to I'm able to be a better mother and a grandmother. If this product is banned I'm going to have to go back and live the life that I was living for over 16 years. I came so close and you're dying several times because of the doctors over to see me so much with pain medications I have even been hospitalized. But with kratom I don't have to worry about the doctors overdosing me too much that all I want to do is sleep all the time. I'm finally able to move around I'm finally able to walk to the grocery store without feeling so exhausted and having pain shooting down both my legs.

Prior to the last two years I lived with the fear that the pain and discomfort associated with my condition were going to leave me unable to utilize the skills that I have worked so long to develop and unprepared to provide in the near future.  It was at that time I discovered Kratom. \n\nKratom has provided me with relief without the side effects associated with most forms of pain management. Just a tiny amount of an affordable plant from the coffee family allows me to not only do my job, it also enjoy my life outside of work to the point of being able to relive the pleasure of something as taxing as skateboarding with my son. Time is the most valuable thing I own, and the quality of life kratom provides enormously maximizes that time. \n\nI live beyond the expectations of my condition and I thank my lucky stars that I have been lucky enough to have been blessed with this miracle plant.

In fact, our totally random online survey found no evidence of kratom-related deaths and zero support among America's front-line medical professionals for a ban on kratom. We are not going to stand idly by and let the DEA or anyone else whip up a phony panic about a nonexistent epidemic to try and ban a legal product that's being consumed responsibly, with no major problems, by three-five million Americans.\"\n\nKey survey findings include the following:\n\n93 percent of those surveyed are aware of kratom.\n\n89 percent of those surveyed have a favorable impression of kratom, including 81 percent with a \"very favorable\" impression.\n\n87 percent said they would \"not classify [kratom] as a problem compared to heroin and prescription painkillers.\" Another 5 percent said it was a \"somewhat smaller\" or \"much smaller\" problem. 0 percent said it was a \"somewhat bigger\" or \"much bigger\" problem.\n\n90 percent say kratom is not a \"major issue or concern\" in their work experience. More than nine out of 10 ER/EMT professionals say they have never dealt with any major case involving kratom.\n\n0 percent said \"a ban on the herb kratom is justified based on your professional experience.\" About 9 percent said they did not have enough experiences with kratom to form an opinion and another 2 percent said they did not know.\n\n0 percent reported deaths due to kratom and only 1 percent related any kind of health-related issues associated with the herb. According to the poll, the vast majority of times (86 percent) that kratom arises in an ER or EMT situation is when someone asks for information about kratom or reports that they consume it.\n\nThe random online survey conducted via SurveyMonkey focused on panel of ER/trauma doctors, surgeons, nurses, related health care professionals, and EMTs/paramedics. Invitations to participate in the survey were extended directly through LinkedIn groups (including EMS Leadership and Administration, Emergency Room RNs and Management, Emergency Medicine and EMS World) and Facebook groups (including Paramedics on Facebook, FRCS Trauma & Orthopedic Surgery, First Responders, Trauma, Critical Care, and Acute Care Surgery, and Emergency Medical Technician).

It was quite effective in this regard. I personally never experienced any serious side effects, aside from occasional constipation, and nystagmus. Both of these subsided quickly, usually soon after the analgesic effects wore off. Upon cessation, I never experienced any withdrawal symptoms, or major cravings. During this time I also had regular blood-work, and urinalysis performed, both of which showed no abnormalities in regard to liver, or kidney function, which has been a concern for some users, and the medical community. \n\nI have never met a \"kratom addict,\" though they are purported to exist. I lived in a town with a bar that sold kratom, and there were not any people that seemed to become intoxicated by kratom, or expressed any sort of craving, as one would expect from an addicted person, for kratom in my observation of the bar, and town. \n\nFrom my experience, and the similar experiences of those around me, some of whom have successfully used kratom to cease heroin abuse with minimal withdrawal, I do not find it fitting to schedule kratom at all. Perhaps an age regulation is in order, simply in the interest of keeping psychoactive (however mild) substances only in the hands of those responsible for their own well-being. In addition to this, taking action against high potency extracts may be the more prudent thing to do, as they seem to be behind a majority of the problems where kratom is involved.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0290","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a natural and healthy alternative to many drugs and prescriptions.

I started using Kratom a little over two years ago.  I was in a terrible accident when I was 19 years old.  Fell 125 feet from a building while working in Northern Arkansas down the side of a mountain.  I am grateful to have survived the fall, but it has taken its toll.  I crushed a vertebrate in my back which I have had two surgeries to correct.  I managed for a while probably till I was about 30 years old and started to have some major back pain.  Went to the doctor and they recommended another surgery.  I chose not to go through it, just too much to bare for me.  I choose pain management, really didnt know what that was but it was an option that I accepted.  I was prescribed hydrocodone for the pain.  It was a life saver so I thought.  All I really got was an addiction that eventually turned me into an animal that would define the next 15 years of my life.  Running the streets making drug deals, doctor shopping in three different states. Stealing to get by, eventually turned to heroin because it was all I count afford.  I was then put through the ringer by the system.  I really thought there was no way out!  Mental Hospital, treatment center, in patient, outpatient.  Finally thought I found a fix when I was put on Suboxone. It worked for a while but then your trapped.  Your insurance will no longer pay for the doctors or the drug.  I was a paying over $1,000.00 a month just to get the drug that I had become dependent on.  Doctor visit, drug test, and then prescription.  I was in a hopeless situation.  I seriously contemplated suicide, even planned it, I thought this was the only way to stop the madness.  Then while looking for a way to get off of the Suboxone that I was dependent on and could no longer afford and let me tell you this stuff is near impossible to get off of.  I finally found the answer  KRATOM!  I had no idea what it was but read so many success stories of people getting off of heroin, Suboxone, Methadone, any kind of opiate.  I am asking, begging, please dont take this away from me.  A teaspoon of Kratom  twice a day, once in the AM, once in the PM.  Im in a better mood, more energy, back pain at a very low level or none at all.  I sleep through the night. This is a natural solution for me that helps me manage pain and take away any cravings for alcohol or opiates.  Kratom has given me my life back!  I have a steady job, exercise, held on to a marriage of 28 years.  Kratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. I fear this action by the DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic, maybe even my own. I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0698","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Troy D'Albor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 29 year old teacher and violinist, married, with a bachelors and masters degree from a state university.

It's effects are similar to that of a caffeine buzz, and works as a mild stimulant in my experience. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever for this plant to be made illegal. There are no proven or documented negative effects, especially that would qualify it to be considered Schedule I which puts it in the same category as heroin and LSD. This is a ridiculous and ludicrous comparison. In my experience, if I have taken too much kratom for my body weight, I vomit. This reaction is a natural safeguard against any potential overuse. I strongly urge the DEA to look at the research done on kratom.

I learned about it from online research.  It has done nothing but help me cope with the fear, anxiety and distress that the diagnoses has brought on, and I have been more productive and energetic than ever since taking it.  It has also reduced my urge to consume and abuse alcohol.  I have had my eyes tested twice since then, and both times my eye pressure was 17 mm Hg, within the normal range and down from 27 mm when I was first diagnosed in early May.  Therefore, the Kratom has had no ill effects on the disease itself. \n\nI am a 59-year old professional software engineer with 35 years experience and a reputable career behind me.  I am not some \"kid\" on the street seeking a \"thrill high\".\n\nThe argument that Kratom should be banned because it may be tainted with cannabis, synthetic drugs or other substances is a ridiculous argument.  It's like saying someone might taint chocolate with cyanide, therefore we should ban chocolate.  If anything, it's an argument for legalization and regulation so that people know they are getting a product that is tested and verified.\n\nHaven't we had enough of drug lords, street gangs, organized crime and more dangerous street drugs taking the place of banned substances?  This ban will only create more criminals, fill more prisons and replace legitimate vendors with dangerous pushers adding to those already pillaging our communities.  I see no good coming out of this.\n\nI urge you to keep Kratom safe and legal.  Let it's distribution and sale be a legitimate business that employs people and adds to our GDP, not a street activity that adds to our crime rate.  Let responsible adults decide their own risk level and accept the consequences, and not turn them into criminal wardens of the state.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13225","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Thompson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI'm writing my plea with the DEA to not put the substance \"kratom\" onto the schedule 1 drug list.

My dosage has not changed and remained constant every day for multiple years. Kratom has a ceiling effect that has prevented me from using more, or wanting to use more.  Overdose is nearly impossible for me to even imagine given these traits..It doesn't depress respiration and if I did an excessive dose I would feel unpleasant, nauseated, and possibly vomit it out.  This is the characteristic that should make headlines as kratom has its own inherent overdose protection.\nThe opioid that doesn't build tolerances like this is the holy grail of pain management.\nI have remained off other opiates since kratom with quite a bit of confidence that I won't go back.\nSo why would one want to prohibit access to this plant for use and research?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6843","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dave U.","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom appears to have promising medicinal uses (analgesia, withdrawal and addiction management).

My name is Stacey Erwin. I'm a 35 year old mother of 3. Two having Autism. I've been using Kratom for a little over 2 years. Approximately 6 years ag9 I hurt my back at work and have suffered severly up until 2 years ago.   I did everything and anything to NOT take a narcotic pain medicine.   Ive dine physical therapy and injections for 3 years. After all this is still felt no relief. I asked my doctors to them put me on a pain contract and to start pain meds. Which they did for a few months. After researching other ways to relieve pain NATURALLY I started researching Kratom. A good friend of mine also helped me in my search to learn everything I could about it before I gave it a shot.   I found a local herbal shop in my town and bought the strained I thought would help me the most.   The first morning I took Kratom I DID NOT take my pain meds but instead, brewed my first cup of Red strained of Kratom. I drank my tea and within  a half hour felt noticeably better. My next cup I added a little bit k9re and noticed after that d9ae I did not feel ANY pain or have ANY 9f the side effect u would have from my pain medicine. My mood was lifted and my pain was fully gone.  My family especially my 13 year old daughter said that I was much more relaxed and didn't have my daily mood swings I would have when I was taking my normal pain meds.   After a dlweek 9f having 3 cups of Kratom tea I knew I was never going back to pain medicines again. I had found my natural and non pharmacy pain relief I had spend years looking for!!  When I heard the DEA was going to place Kratom as a schedule 1 my heart broke and my worst nightmare had started to come true that this miracle tea was being taken away.   I cannot stress enough how much Kratom has changed my life for the better since I started taking it. My mood and pain have been 100 percent controlled and I couldn't be happier.   6 years ago I thought all hope was lost and was not living life but just existing. Now I'm living my life and spending the time Ive always wanted to with my children instead of laying in bed 22 hours out of the day. Since taking Kratom I have been able to get a job,  move up in the company from a simple cashier to now managing my own store. Please understand that this has help so many people with little to no side effects. I have gone a week or two without taking the tea and did not have withdrawals of any type and was only in  pain.  I'm simply asking the DEA to understand that this tea is NOTHING like heroine and many have used it t9 come off opiates and harder meds or illegal substances.   Kratom has changed my life and I'm the mother,  wife daughter and person I've always wanted to be.   I thank k God everyday for leading me to Kratom.  It's been a true miracle.   That's k you for your time l.   8 appreciate having a chance to tell my story.   I am just one of the many faces of Kratom and I know they DEA will do what is right and allow us to keep purchasing this miracle tea.

I have taken my share of narcotic pain killers which we all know are very dangerous if you take too much of them.

It works similar to narcotics but without the risk of overdose and other side effects. In the last 3 years I have been able to go off of Kratom 2 different times with no problem. I wanted to see if I could and if I could deal with my pain without any kind of drug. Just a very gradual decline in the amount I take over a 2 week period and that is it. \nNarcotics on the other hand is a very different story. I would be very sad to have to become a criminal in order to take Kratom to help my pain each day. Dealing with pain can literally ruin your life and being able to take a safe substance is a great help. \nPlease reconsider and keep Kratom legal. There really is no reason it needs to be illegal other than it cuts into the profits of the Pharmaceutical Companies! Help me trust my country again.

Prohibition benefits only to bandits and to the corrupted people. \n\nThank you for your attention,\n\nBruno Marchal","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21726","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bruno Marchal","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not schedule Kratom, a benign dietary supplement that helps many people better themselves despite physical and/or mental setbacks. There has been a good amount of misleading and outright wrong information being spread around different media sources as of late, and it is important to debunk this misinformation so this plant does not get wrongly scheduled. Despite various internet claims, there has actually only been one death recorded of someone ingesting (solely) Kratom ever; the other fourteen were caused by the person using multiple drugs at once,  as proven by Snopes.com, a fact checking website commonly used in education and politics. Compared to the 14,000 overdose deaths from prescription opioids in a single year as reported by the Center for Disease Control, this is nothing. Furthermore, the 660 calls about Kratom to poison control centers in the U.S. over a 5 year period need to be put in perspective as well, seeing as there were over 300,000 calls related to synthetic analgesics in 2014 alone. It should be obvious where the real danger lies. \n\nTo compare Kratom to heroin like some people and media outlets are doing is absolutely asinine; such an outrageous claim can only be attributed to pure ignorance. A similar comparison of coffee and cocaine could be made because they both act on noradrenaline and dopamine, but there is no impending ban on caffeine, as that would be seen as ridiculous. This potential scheduling of Kratom is no different. Kratom is actually a plant in the coffee family, and although it slightly works on the same receptors in the brain as opioids, it is not an opiate and does not produce nearly as strong effects. When I was in high school, I broke my neck in two places and 7 years later, I fell off a 60 foot cliff and shattered nearly every bone in my face.  I have therefore been prescribed a multitude of hard drugs over the past few years including Fentanyl, oxycodone, Vicodin, gabapentin, Valium, cyclobenzaprine, Tramadol, and some SSRI's to deal with chronic pain; Kratom is nothing like those drugs and shouldn't even be named in the same sentence. All of those drugs produced either inadequate relief from my symptoms, side effects that I could not tolerate, or physical dependence that I was uncomfortable with, making coming off of those drugs extremely difficult and unpleasant yet necessary. While there are some physical symptoms upon discontinuation of daily use of Kratom, they are similar to those experienced when coming off of caffeine, and in many cases, much less severe. \n\nIt is surprising that Kratom is being labeled as a drug at all; it's more comparable to a dietary supplement that happens to help a lot of people, not unlike Skullcap or Lemon Balm. It doesn't really kill all pain, but it provides muscular tension relief while giving a slight boost in mood and ability to focus, with much less potential for abuse (because there's no true high) than synthetic drugs. This may not seem like a big deal for healthy people, but for chronic pain patients, it can mean the difference between living a full life or being bed ridden. We use it like caffeine, only unlike caffeine, Kratom doesn't cause anxiety or stiff muscles, so it's a much more viable option for us, and one that we will be severely hindered by not having access to. Please understand that it is not the health threat that it is being made out to be; it is a plant, just like tea or coffee, that helps many people get through their day without wanting to kill themselves or get high. Thank you for reading my comment, and if you have any more questions, feel free to contact any member of the American Kratom Association.

At that point I was only existing.\n\nI happened to be in a pain group on Facebook skimming over posts, when someone mentioned kratom. That it was all natural and helped with pain, anxiety and depression. I was very reluctant but thought it might be my saving grace. I researched it and joined a group. I was able to get a free sample. I was still very reluctant, but thought what do I have to lose. I took a tsp and at first got no results. A day later I took it again and went about my business. Within 30 minutes I realized I felt my pain was disappearing. I almost couldn't believe it. My pain was gone and I was able to do things I hadn't done in a long time. Like drive in a car for more than 30 minutes, play outside with my son and do housework more than a few minutes at a time. Today I am able to be a functioning wife, mother and woman. \n\nKratom gave me my life back. Instead of existing. I am living. For that I am forever grateful.

People have been using kratom for a very long time to help with anxiety, addiction, and chronic pain. Criminalizing kratom would only hurt we who have found help in its healing qualities. Many places that sell kratom refuse to sell it to anyone under the age of 18, demonstrating that they recognize what the substance is and can regulate it accordingly WITHOUT federal intervention. Criminalizing kratom would only increase incarceration rates, which would be hugely detrimental to our society as a whole. Those who have found relief from addiction may be forced to resort to dangerous perscription medication, which has a FAR HIGHER overdose rate than kratom (and, for the record, nobody has ever overdosed on kratom by itself).

I am 42 years old and work 40 or more hours a week and obey all the laws of this great country called The United States of America.   I discovered Kratom about 4 years ago and have taken it for small aches and pains since.  If you plan on making it illegal, people like me will be looked at as criminals and that is just not right.  I have the right to say what is good for me and what is not.  This is a democracy last I heard and we should have a say in what we want to have legal and what we don't.  I am not out on the street stealing to get Kratom.  I am not hurting anyone.  I am just an every day citizen who wants to take care of themselves the way we should be able to. \n\n     Nobody has ever died from just Kratom.  All those cases (and there really aren't that many) which someone had kratom in their body and died were actually deaths from other medications or illegal drugs.   The worst thing that can happen from taking too much kratom is dizziness and maybe a stomach ache.  No worse than a cup of coffee.  Why is it this has been on earth since the beginning of time but you are just now trying to ban it?  It seems that things were going just fine the way they have been and there is no need for changes.  \n\n     The only good reason I can see for any regulation is to check and make sure what we are getting is Kratom and not something else.  I can understand that.  Please reconsider this ban and have more research done before any major changes in the laws.  I am not a criminal and I like it that way.  I would of course be forced to stop taking Kratom if it was banned and go on without it but I would rather not.  Kratom has the ability to help with pain much better than any Tylenol or whatever there is at the local store.  My own Mother has had pain her whole life and since taking Kratom it has allowed her to get up and do things she hasn't done in years.  You are going to deny her a life that is more active and a little less painful?\n\n     I just really hope you can see there are plenty of good people who will be affected by this ban if it is taken into effect.  We are not criminals...just good everyday working people.  Please figure out another way to just make it safe without a total ban.  It is nothing like Heroin or Cocaine etc...  There is no way you can compare them or have any reason to put them in the same category.

I am currently writing this message on behalf Kratom. I am a 22 year old female that has suffered with reoccurring shingles since the age of 17. I have had many complications due to my severe shingle attacks, and every complication is excruciatingly painful. I have arthritis, post herpetic neuralgia, migraines, chronic fatigue, and an ultimately shot immune system. I deal with constant pain that most people my age won't have to struggle with for years to come (hopefully).\n\nI have been prescribed many opiates, strong antibiotics, and anxiety/depression medications. I've been hospitalized multiple times. During those hospitalizations, I was diagnosed with various illnesses that just didn't make sense. I was a guinea pig for laboratories, an easily recognizable face at doctors' offices, and a medical mystery when everything came to a close. \n\nFor my own health, I (eventually) weaned myself off of the opiates I was consuming. I discontinued the antidepressants and anxiety drugs because they only increased suicidal thoughts and unwanted side effects. Finally, I found a wonderful, safe, effective herb called Kratom.\n\nI've been drinking Kratom as a tea, once in the morning and once at night, for two years. During those two years, I've been able to skip days whenever my pain is manageable on its own without any withdrawals or side effects. \n\nKratom, scientifically classified as Mitragyna Speciosa, is a nonaddictive plant that is in the coffee family. It has zero to minimal side effects. On its own, Kratom has never caused a single death. This plant has been used for years upon years for various medical issues. The DEA's spontaneous decision to place Kratom as a Schedule 1 drug is appalling. Obviously, the DEA is either doing this for big pharmaceuticals to have more money in their pockets, or the DEA isn't knowledgeable of how much Kratom truly helps people. Either way, the DEA is completely overreaching with this ban. Any restrictions on Kratom would be absurd.\n\nAfter hearing my story, please consider to drop this ban entirely. I don't know what I would do without Kratom, but I know that I can't go back to a life that is riddled with pain. Please, assist me (along with the rest of the natural herbal community) to keep Kratom legal. This ban needs to be defeated. Kratom is commonly used to transition drug users off of heroin, percocets, hydros, suboxone, methadone, and so forth. Taking a non-abusable herb from those who truly need it would only cause addicts to return to a toxic life. If the DEA schedules this amazing plant as a Schedule 1 drug then the death toll WILL rise due to overdoses from unnatural, harmful drugs. The banning of Kratom would have grave repercussions that I don't think the DEA intends, but the DEA also doesn't understand how innocent this herb is.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nGod bless,\n\nLauren Jackson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2151","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lauren Jackson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Individuals own their bodies and have the right to decide what goes in them, therefore the substances in question should not be prohibited.

This is insanity, and I suspect, a plot paid for by big Pharma.\n\nRecently, I purchased a bottle of kratom capsules for a friend of mine.  She has become a recluse because she is in so much pain, she can't move about freely and she endures too much pain to leave her home.  I was curious to see if the kratom would make a difference in her life.\n\nShe was in church this past Sunday, something she hasn't been able to do for years.  She hugged me and cried and told me that she had no pain.  She was still taking one prescription tablet per day but felt certain she would be off that soon.  She told me my gift had given her back her life.\n\nTo even think about depriving anyone of this medicinal herb is not only cruel and unusual, it is draconian in scope.\n\nDon't ban kratom!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0441","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dessie Andrews","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"RE: Docket No. DEA-442W - my comments\n\nHello,\n\nI first came across kratom about ten years ago.  I had read online it would help with pain, which my doctor would not prescribe any prescription narcotics for.  I had badly sprained my ankle and could hardly walk even after several weeks.  So I thought I'd give it a try since ibuprofen and advil were not working for me.  After taking a teaspoon of kratom all the pain was completely gone and I was able to get around and continue working, this helped during I time where I had no car and had to walk everywhere to work and to the store for food.  When the sprain finally healed I no longer needed kratom and didn't feel any desire to continue use.  It was unlike past surgeries where I had been prescribed Vicodin.  The Vicodin helped with pain but also left me very nauseous, unable to sleep and can get you high.  I experienced none of that on the kratom I took.  When I ran out of vicodin I couldn't help but feel the desire the keep taking it, but thankfully I only had a small prescription.  It was then that I understood what many people go through when being prescribed strong narcotics for pain.  In my case I didn't need them as the pain was temporary, but I know many people who had to take them for so long they became addicted and after their supply from the doctor ran out they sought other illegal means of obtaining the drug.  \n\n6 months ago I found myself drinking way too much, after a hard breakup with my then girlfriend of 10+ years.  I would quit drinking for several days and suddenly finding myself thinking it was okay to drink just one last time, this cycle repeated for about a year.  So in a effort to stop myself I remembered my first encounter with kratom, and how many said it helped them get off of drugs and alcohol.  So, I thought I'd give it a try.  I began taking kratom  on the weekend when I had time to relax, during those moments when my urge to drink was strongest.  The kratom left me with no desire to drink alcohol whatsoever and I have been clean since that day 6 months ago.  I feel lucky because my uncle died of alcoholism and I was able to stop myself completely.  I still take kratom occasionally, but it mostly just gives me a boost of energy and surprising none of the \"highs\" that many people claim it is good for.\n\nThe one thing that makes me upset about the proposed ban is that we should be stepping away from prohibition as there is no research showing it is at all effective at reducing the drug problem in the US.  It makes criminals out of people who have not committed any violent crimes, where the only victim is themselves.  Instead I think we should not shame these people, and recognize they have a problem and are not criminals.  Kratom, in my opinion, could be a tool used to fight drug addiction, and banning it will not only prevent further research but also turn the many who rely on it as an aid to quit drugs to go back to illegal means of obtaining actual drugs.  I think the best course would to restrict it's sale to people of a certain age, much like alcohol and tobacco is handled.  Considering that alcohol kills 80,000+ people every year, and kratom has killed none directly should be evidence of it's safety as a supplement.  If anything I believe tobacco and alcohol should be on the table for restriction, we knowingly allow their use and know that they kill and ruin peoples lives, yet now somehow the focus is on a plant that most people have never heard of and most use to help them with some ailment. \n\nPlease take my story into consideration, and don't continue this senseless drug war on harmless plants.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12610","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My story starts off at about the age of 18.

I am not a user of Kratom, but I have heard many positive testimonies of the benefits it has provided so many people who had no where else to turn.\n     It is no secret that pharmaceutical drugs administered by physicians is a mixture of preference, financial compensation, and trial and error. With the money monster that this industry has become, it is no wonder the free people are taking it upon themselves to research and experiment with alternative cures for the ailments they suffer from. Admittedly, this could be considered a dangerous practice in the past, but with communal efforts, the internet, and the modern tools and equipment available to professionals, enthusiasts, and activists, it is no wonder that we as a non-government affiliated group can discover alternative solutions to problems we face a civilization.\n     The drastic decision to ban the use of Kratom by the small minority of officials in government office is a disgrace on what I know this astounding country to stand for. This is a decision to be made by the public through a vote. Before any conclusion can be made, the citizens need to be exposed to all the information pertaining to Kratom. Old, current, and further research must be done and distributed to the masses, so that we the people can once again determine what is best for us, as opposed to the similar tyrannical rulings thrust onto us in the past. And when I speak of the information that is necessary, I am not referring to smear campaigns and biased commercials similar to those seen during a presidential election, I am referring to hard unaltered data, old and new, explained by the uninfluenced scientists of the world.\n    This way I have described above, and only this way, can we come to a conclusion on the issue. I myself am not an expert on the matter, but certainly would like to be further educated before I can cast my vote to decide as a country what is best. Thank you for your time and I hope this comment can influence you to uphold the values of our forefathers.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10363","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Chatroop","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a disabled veteran I find incredible value in non-opiod pain releif.

I became much worse in my 20's and by the time I was 30 I was started on opioids to control my pain. I was finally properly diagnosed when I was 34 and fully bedridden to relieve strain on my heart and increase my lifespan . All that can be done is to treat symptoms, there is no cure, so for 8yrs I lay in bed on increasing amounts of medications including high doses of Norco Morphine and Soma. I lived in a fog. I slept my days away. \nI have been married for 22yrs and have 4 amazing children. My husband and kids did not have me in their life like they deserved for those 8yrs and I feel like that was precious wasted time. \nI am medically educated with licenses as an EMT, EMT-I, Paramedic, Operating Room Tech, and Diagnostic Medical Sonographer. I understand how important medications are to us but have learned that we need nature too. \nJust 2yrs ago as I realize quality of life for me is much more important than quantity, I searched the Internet desperate for help that doctors weren't able to provide. I found kratom and after much research decided I had nothing to lose by trying it. \nThe very first day using this herb I went half a day without needing (or even wanting) my opioids. I have a new energy similar to really good strong coffee but no jitters. I cannot handle coffee normally as my condition has caused heart failure and I cannot handle harsh stimulants. I was alert!! I was able to spend time out of bed and with my family. I now spend anywhere from 6-10hrs of my day out of bed (which is huge for me) and am able to do some small chores around the house but mainly it's time I have with my family.  I am able to spend this precious time with them now and only wish I had found this herb sooner. \nI am now on the very lowest doses of opioids and only taken on really bad health days despite the fact my health is rapidly deteriorating. I have no negative side affects from kratom and my body is highly sensitive to medications normally. We all deserve to be able to do what is best for our bodies and this is best for me and countless others. Please don't take this away. Utilize this plant to help people! Allow us our promised freedoms to use natural supplements and help people get healthier again. Allow me to spend my end of life with my family. This herb deserves further research and testing, closing that off will only hurt so many people and one day it may be you that is in need of it. We need MORE options to alleviate illness symptoms not less. We need to see these testimonials as a beacon of hope that nature can help some people and be open to that idea. We need to embrace what nature has provided and not make everything about big pharma and money!\nSave this herb and help change lives!

My fear is that there are countless people who may return to illicit and pharmaceutical drug use if kratom is banned.  I have suffered from depression and insomnia off and on throughout my life and I have personally used kratom and was shocked at the results which included mood lift and ability to fall sleep.

I suffer from several problems, not the least of which is severe Arthritis, Fibro Myalgia, Migraines, Pseudo Gout and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. For approximately 25 to 30 years my doctors were treating my pain with several kinds of Narcotic pain medications. In the beginning low doses helped, but as with any narcotic the need for stronger and stronger doses became the way of life for me.  I was eventually on 240 mg of Morphine a day, as well as 80 mg of percocet.  Both are extremely potent narcotics. Both have nasty side effects including respiratory depression, foggy brain, insomnia, forgetfulness, and extreme addiction.   \n     After many years of taking these strong and dangerous drugs, I made the difficult decision to stop taking them. They had stopped helping my pain, and in fact were making it much worse combined with swelling and other side effects. I suffered terrible withdrawal symptoms for about 2 months. This is not a problem I would ever want to face again, but I still have the pain that led to my addiction. \n     About a year ago I was introduced to Kratom as an alternative to narcotic pain meds. It only took one small dose consumed as a tea to tell me that this was my answer.  At first I was afraid because of all the negative comments on this herb. But after reading further, and talking to many consumers of Kratom, I became convinced.  I use a very small amount about 3 to 4 times a day taken as tea to control my severe pain. I no longer suffer from Mental Fog, insomnia, swelling, forgetfulness or any of the other problems I had before. I have never experienced any feeling of euphoria by using this herb.  I never liked the feeling of being High or drunk so I am glad this wonderful leaf does not give me that effect. \n     I am a 61 year old grandmother and great grandmother. I used to work for Law Enforcement and I definitely do not fit the profile of a \"recreational user\". I have told all my doctors about this wonderful herb and several of them have researched it for themselves. \n     By postponing the scheduling of Kratom, it will be given the chance to be studied and tested to show that it does indeed have great medical usage, and is not just another \"street drug\".  It does in fact have a great usefulness in helping addicts to get off the dangerous drugs like Heroin and other opiates.   \n    Thank you for considering my letter and for listening to the thousands of other Kratom advocates. We all have a story and a voice. \nRespectfully,\nAdrian Madden ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0060","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adrian Madden","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"You are over stepping your bounds in this by enforcing religious ideals in a secular society.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20921","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Derrick Wixon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for this opportunity to comment on Kratom. My name is Brad Allred, I am a 34 year old male, married with four wonderful children, I am a hard working American and have been so since I got out of high school. I have had social anxiety and ADHD my entire life and never went to college due to these issues. I have struggled with alcoholism and addiction for years. I used to drink heavily every night when I got home from work, I just figured that was how it was supposed to be since all of my friends did the same. I noticed I would get pretty angry and annoyed easily when I drank and my family was urging me to not drink when I got home. I tried Kratom instead of drinking and I noticed that it made ALL of the cravings for alcohol go away to the point that I had zero desire to drink, after a while of struggling to quit drinking (it wasn't like it just happened overnight) and using Kratom to help stop cravings I was able to quit drinking completely about 3 years ago! I honestly believe that I couldn't have done it without Kratom's help and I really hope you don't take this wonderful herb away from us!  Unlike a lot of us I was never addicted to opiates, however some of my friends have gotten addicted and have used Kratom to reduce withdrawal symptoms, which they say works amazingly well. \n\nI have now worked my way up to a college level job (Software Developer) and use Kratom to help with my anxiety and some recent back pain issues. I can honestly say that Kratom does not give me a \"buzz\", it just helps me feel like myself. Back when I first started taking it there was a definite \"buzz\" to it, but wasn't really what I would call a \"high\" just warm, comfortable feeling.\n\nI've been using Kratom for about 4 years now and if Kratom was really harmful I would be one to know, I have a tendency to test my limits and have gone as high as 2 ounces of Kratom a day (that's a massive amount) with minimal side affects. I don't believe that you can really \"overdose\" on this substance as it will make you very dizzy and nauseous to the point of vomiting up everything you have ingested. It definetly works best at lower doses anyway.\n\nSome of the side affects I have experienced at higher doses are: dizziness, vomiting, constipation and grogginess. At lower doses these side affects are either non-existent or mild and easy to deal with. I have experienced a lack of sexual drive and some prostate problems which may or may not be related. \n\nPersonally I believe it should be somewhat regulated so that it can meet certain purity standards and should be restricted to ages 21 and up. But please don't schedule it, there are so many people that could benefit from this natural herb and it would be a shame to prevent them from having access when they need it.\n\nThank you for you time!\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6136","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bradley Allred","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"male , 49 , route driver.\n\nAfter being a barely functional alchaholic for 20 years KRATOM helped me to finally quit drinking. kratom alleviated my withdraws and later helped subdue alchahol cravings.

I am a 54 year old female who uses Kratom and supports keeping this plant legal and safe.  Although I appreciate the important effort our government makes in keeping dangerous, mind-altering substances out of the hands of our people and off our streets, it has been my personal experience that Kratom does not fall into this category.\n\nI started using Kratom after reading many testimonies of it helping others with one of my professionally diagnosed, painful medical conditions.  The only drug which I knew to consistently alleviate my symptoms was oxycodone, which I had been prescribed several times while recovering from my many breast cancer surgeries.  For obvious reasons, even If I had been able to get a doctor to prescribe opiates for me for the rest of my life, this would not have been a healthy option.  The logical course of action for me then was to search for a natural herb with no side effects that would mimic oxycodone in that it would alleviate symptoms but without possessing any mind-altering, ethereal-like, or addictive qualities.   \n\nThe Kratom worked exactly like others said it would and I was thrilled with the results.  I don't experience any side effects at all, no weird high or ethereal feelings; it simply takes away my pain and I have been able to actually sleep through the night for the past year or so.  What a blessing!  \n\nI imagine that if I paid enough money and spent enough time, I could find a doctor who would prescribe opiates for my condition; Ive heard they are out there anyway.  But in my mind, that would be a lot riskier to my health and the danger of addiction is very high.  I would choose the lesser, milder, Kratom over prescription opiates any day!  \n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21342","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lori Mooney","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Before this herbal supplement, I was an anxious mess.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

I hope it helps on your decision to not ban it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21007","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dawn Watkins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Best thing every happened.

I am a highly skilled technician in the industrial field. I have never been addicted to any Drug nor have I ever used illegal recreational drugs, I also do not drink.\n\nI do not believe the actions taken here have been a responsible response to what was called a threat to society. kratom has been lumped into the recreational drug arena in which it does not belong. Kratom has not become a wide spread recreational drug because it does not produce the psychoactive effects recreational drug users are looking for. It does however provide chronic pain sufferers as well as several other illness/injury sufferers relief from the pain in what ever form they suffer.\n\nI was in an accident in which I received an injury to my spinal cord causing permanent damage to the pain nerve extending down my right arm and into my fingers. The pain is constant and unbearable. I am unable to sleep ant night and unable to function during the day. I have decided to not use opiate based pain medication due to the addictive properties of those drugs I have used Lyrica with no beneficial results, and Gabapentin gave me horrible side effects.So I have chosen to take a holistic approach and kratom is what I have found to help reduce the pain to a more manageable level. I have never felt or had any negative affects from kratom. I have also stopped using kratom and during that time period I never experienced any negative affects. I believe this to plant to be a useful tool in holistic approach to illness and injury.\n\nI am asking you to please reconsider the decision to place kratom on a schedule 1 ban. By doing so I will not be able to use kratom relive my chronic pain and will have to resort to an opiate based pain reliever. As I have stated before Lyrica and Gabapentin did not work or worse caused symptoms worse then the pain. I understand the difficulties and your position with the drug abuse is currently occurring in the United States but I also expect my government to make research-based decisions. \n\nThank you very much for your time, I would also like to thank you for reconsidering the ban and giving the rest of us enough time find an alternative for our chronic pain issues.

Back in 2010 i was deployed to a disclosed location when my team was struck by a Chinese rocket followed by SAF. I was close enough to the blast that it caused internal damage to my brain. Because of that, my gi tract is completely thrown off because of the direct link to my brain. I dropped 40 pounds in less than a month puking and defecating blood and other things I cannot physically describe. The injury itself was debilitating without a doubt not to mention that everyday migraines. I was given more pills than what one human being should ever take. My journey to recovery seemed like a lost cause. Until on day i was referred to kratom. Kratom has helped my cope with the pain and on top of that, i am able to eat and digest food somewhat properly giving me a glimpse of hope. As a single father, from losing my ex wife because she could not deal with me being sick, became almost an impossible task. Banning this PLANT will only destroy what chance at life i have left. Even my headaches have subsided to an extant thanks to this plant. I urge you to please reconsider your thoughts on banning this plant.I truly believe this plant alone can do more wonders to the comminity if you leave it legal.

Ever since I was at an elementary school level of age, eight years old to be precise, I have suffered from a debilitating case of mental illness, which has the prognosis of manic depression and anxiety most noticeably. The treatment- resistant depression I have been prescribed under doctoral supervision has abject side effects that are more unbearable than the congenital and unmedicated mental illness that I had to begin with. This reality has been wholly devastating and has had a negative impact upon my social interactions, ability to work, focus in school, amongst other various constituents that have impeded upon the best of my intentions. I was introduced to Kratom by a dear friend of mine who has used this herbal supplement as a natural remedy for his chronic maladies. The moment I first partook in Kratom as a result of recommendation, the emanating affects began to significantly mitigate every such symptom that I described above. Non- users have often inquired of me as to whether I utilize this supplement for recreational purposes or for adaptogenic purposes. I respond by explicitly stating that the sole reason for my partaking of Kratom is not for recreational purposes, but consequently because from a phenomonological perspective, I myself have seen the edifying benefits of this chemically stabilizing remedy. Kratom has provided reduced symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress, sleep apnea, suicidal thoughts, and a wide variety of other chronic mental ailments. Kratom has most importantly generated within me a greater sense of self- satisfaction due to how it has maximized my relational, social, and academic capabilities, that would otherwise have been tarnished by the nature of my mental illness, despite the best of my best intentions. The ubiquitous outcry from a vast number of other American citizens who have experienced the similar beneficial effects and the mental anguish liberation given by Kratom makes this national outcry not in the least bit surprising. To neglect the empirical evidence revealing how beneficial this plant has been upon the lives of millions, is to disregard not only the plea of the people, who unanimously desire to upend this Schedule 1 classification, but such a ruling would also violate basic human altruism and a sufficient consideration for the well- being of others. Users of this natural medication are by-and-large productive tax- paying and law abiding members of society. It is unconscionable to think that these members of society would become vilified and incarcerated for the non- violent crime of desiring to medicate themselves from the chronic ailments they never chose in the first place. Please take into consideration my contention for keeping Kratom legal, and please hear the petitions of the multitude of others who have had profoundly similar positive experiences with Kratom. A compromise is only necessary.\nSincerely,\nScott Lambert","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0209","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Personal Account","postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Scott Lambert","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If you ban Kratom there's no doubt I'll go back to pain medication.

If there's one thing I've learned about drug policy while in college it's that prohibition does not work. It encourages illicit markets, gang violence, and makes drugs in fact EASIER for minors to obtain. The  Iron Law of Prohibition states that once a substance is made illegal, illicit marketa are encouraged to make a more potent and potentially more dangerous product. By prohibiting drugs, we have only created a public health and criminal justice crisis in our country. Prohibition has also demonized minorities, and has created generations of poverty due to the harsh mandatory minimum sentencing on nonviolent drug possession that makes it difficult or even impossible to find public housing and apply for federal aid to attend college, among many other things. Scheduling kratom would only make everything that's happened thus far worse. Since our government hasn't stepped up to properly address the heroin epidemic, citizens are taking it upon themselves to try to get off heroin with the aid of kratom. I very strongly recommend that kratom remain legal, and I further recommend that we establish a legal means for heroin addicts to obtain kratom, such as through a doctor's prescription. The DEA must make the right decision to keep kratom legal. This is a matter of public health, not law enforcement. For once, DEA, do the right thing.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6399","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bryan Kirwen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please dont make Kratom Illegal. I am a long term opiate user who have recently received a Pain Pump. The pain pump has not been working initially. I am still on a small amount of opioids orally. I know that I am going to have to stop taking opioids. I am having trouble, turning away from opioids, because of the addictive properties. I had run out of Percoset, and I knew that withdrawal was about to follow. \n\nI rushed out and got some Kratom. I cant believe that this plant has made my withdrawal minimized. Having suffered withdrawal several times, I can say the pain drives me back to get more pills. Well now I know that is not a pattern I have to continue.The Kratom is a simple leaf, whose properties have allowed me to sleep at night, use the restroom, and kept me content, while not being high. The effects of kratom, to an opioid user, are not seen as a drug. Its like a tea, that keeps me from feeling out of my head, as I struggle to get off the Percoset pills. \n\nIf you take Kratom away, there is nothing available to help the masses get off opioids. That is the simple truth. This is a short comment, but its the most important thing. Any Doctor should point to Kratom, when their patient is complaining, that they \"need\" more pain medicine. \n\nAlso, I am noticing it is not practical to stay on Kratom long. Its a plant. Its messy. My trajectory is I will only use this plant because I have to. Once I am done with the effects of addiction, I can safely stop taking Kratom. Its not a substance, that even lends itself to addiction, like the Percoset I have been on for 5 years.  \n\n So I have now been Percoset free for 5 days. This is the longest I have been off Percoset in years. Because of Kratom, I am not staying up all night, sweating, with a fever, and then being to exhausted to go to work. I can have some Kratom, go to work, and maintain my responsibilities at work, while simultaneously getting off opioids, instead of having to make another appointment to go to the doctor to get more. Because, otherwise, I cant go to work in withdrawal, I have to get more opioids, so i look normal at work. Its a horrible way to live.\n\nI am proud to have been given the opportunity to speak out about this and please dont make this very good herbal remedy Illegal.

This drug is so sneaky, it is worst than heroin once it grabs you, that is its danger. Slowly your body requires more and more Kratom to reach the same euphoric effect. Soon, like our son, it consumes your life, requiring close to $100/day to scratch the itch. It is then you realize it's \"got you\". In the same time frame, you loose weight and health, loose motivation, loose your friends and social life, develop paranoia, and have a hard time holding a job let alone keep a simple conversation.  When you try to stop, the 10-14 days of withdrawal is incredibly painful to go through and to watch as a parent. And as mentioned earlier, it his 3rd attempt to stop using. He wants to stop but he cant. Just after 30 days of sobriety, the Kratom urges remain so strong, it keep calling him back. 60 days just as strong; Today its 90 days post treatment and he says there is no relief from the urges to do more Kratom. This Drug needs to be properly understood before more lives are ruined. This is the only drug he used!   \n\nFor those who feel it helps with other addictions?, Please! Our country has spent BILLIONs on treating drug addictions and has made incredible progress and success. This success is by the professional and science base information of trial and error; That is how this country protects its citizens responsibly.  So to think some \"magic plant\", with out any professional oversight, has this kind of power for success is ridiculous and would be dangerous to give Kratom such validation. If its too good to be true, it probably is.  \n\nIf Kratom has an indication to be a great rehab medication, then sent it through the proper channels to prove its safety to our public, that is our Governments #1 responsibility to its citizens.  And if it has a valid scientific proof of purpose, THEN have it administered and prescribed by the proper medical professionals, and not prescribed by the opiate and heroin addicts on the internet. The current unregulated usage of Kratom for other serious addictions, without professional oversight,  is DANGEROUS. \n\nKratom may not have a high fatality rate, but, you dont have to loose a life to ruin a life!\nKratom has been an expensive problem while our son was using, consuming his entire paycheck.\nKratom has been an expensive problem when our son wanted to quit, $38,000 each attempt in rehab (x3 times), plus lost time, lost jobs and follow up counselling. \nKratom has created disturbing paranoia, destroyed our sons personality and social life, and created a person that is more of burden on society than a contribution.\nKratom has taken away a parents most precious hopes and dreams; For their kid to have a happy and productive life.\nDont tell us Kratom is harmless. Dont tell me it helps. Not one once of goodness so far. \n\nI know the DEA has been bombarded by Pro-Kratom users due to their well organize effort.  Dont let these high numbers of opposition be a persuasion.  So please, be responsible to your citizens and protect all of us. Ban Kratom until its further understood.  \n\nThank You\nPaul and Kathy\nDarien, IL   \n \n            \n    \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7333","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-26T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paul Brysocki","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":" Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit.

I do not drink alcohol or take drugs. I submit this formal comment in strong opposition to the DEA taking any measures to schedule the herbal dietary supplement Kratom in any schedule. \nI have been drinking Kratom tea once or twice a week for ten years. The numerous alkaloids in Kratom have a strong antioxidant effect. I routinely use Kratom and other supplements to support my immune system during allergen exposure and migraine headaches and I can verify that Kratom supports mental focus, supports routine and everyday aches and pains, and promotes my general health, comfort and well-being. \n Kratom is not a drug and is certainly not a recreational drug. I have never had any effects from Kratom that could even remotely be described as getting high. Drinking Kratom tea has the same effect as any caffeinated tea or a cup of coffee. Kratom is not addicting. \nAs a law abiding and responsible adult, I urge you in the strongest terms to take no action to schedule this supplement.  \nThank you very much for your time and consideration. \n\nJerry Breslin\nHollywood, Florida","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0759","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jerry Breslin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think Kratom should s?t?ay legal.\nKratom has helped me with my social anxiety.

I could begin to do normal every day task without the fear of crippling pain or incontinence. Not only does Kratom help with pain, it helps with many of the symptoms of Crohns. In fact, I was told about it from another Crohns patient, and I have been telling as many IBD sufferers as possible. Everyone that has used it, has told me that it changed their life, they same way it changed mine.

I became addicted to opiates after getting my wisdom teeth pulled an getting a bottle of Vicodin. Three months after that I got bronchitis an got a big bottle of liquid vicoden called tussionex. Needless to say ever since then I've had major health issues including TMD (Temporomandibular joint dysfunction), Rhinorrhea, Eustachian Tube Dysfunction, an Leaky Gut Syndrome all of which would go away if i took another vicodin. I went cold turkey about two and a half years ago an had no intention on going back with a downside that none of my health issues were seeming to heal on their own. I've went to multiple doctors over that span of time only to find out there isn't any thing they could find that is wrong with me. One doctor recommended Lexapro thinking it was anxiety an a lack of serotonin causing my issues but it did not end up working. I was then recommended the option to try xanax or clonazepam which I respectfully declined. I finally gave up expensive doctor visits an began researching natural remedies such as fiber based diet, proper daily vitamins, an eating healthier overall. I then found kratom about one year ago an my life drastically changed for the better. I was able to quit smoking cigarettes and haven't smoked one in six months with no intention on doing so. It literally mitigated all of my issues I was having by at least fifty percent. In that amount of time I got a new career an am doing great for myself while taking kratom three to four times a day. I have a clean background an have no traffic violations let alone ever been in a accident. I honestly an genuinely believe from the bottom of my heart that it is absurd to even think about banning such a beneficial plant. I don't deserve to live in pain an I love myself enough to know that. Ibuprofen is more toxic an dangerous than this stuff. The DEA should consider banning tobacco before banning this plant.

Motocross is a very demanding sport and there are several injuries i myself could not escape from. The days of my youth continued on and soon i was to be an adult, this consisted of more work and being responsible and honest and having good character. Throughout the years of my twenties i learned how to do just that. 7years into my twenties which is right now. I have been using kratom for 3 years and have never had any problems with it also never experienced any symptoms of abuse for kratom either most of these accusations they say about kratom i have never experienced.

She has neuropathy in her left leg. The pain is so debilitating most days that she can hardly leave her bed in the morning, let alone walk down the stairs or go to work. She has tried dozens of other medication options and none of them worked to quell her pain and allow her to live a functional lifestyle. She was feeling very hopeless about her medical condition until she discovered Kratom. Since she began taking Kratom her pain has become extremely manageable and she has no problem going through her day joyfully. \n\nI myself struggle with back pain and Kratom is an excellent remedy for me on days where the painful sensations are so distracting and exhausting that I have trouble completing the tasks that are required of me. \n\nPersonally, I feel that any legal or illegal substance that is psychoactive - caffeine, alcohol, over the counter medications, etc... - can become harmful when an individual does not know how to moderate him/herself. However, this does not mean that banning a substance is an effective method for insuring that people don't use it or use it responsibly. \n\nI have plenty of experience taking Kratom with moderation and I have witnessed no side effects. \n\nOverall I believe that Kratom is a safe substance that can improve peoples wellbeing and tackle debilitating medical issues and therefore it should not be scheduled by the DEA.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4339","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thomas Vasilopoulos","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban Kratom?

For years I didn't care about anyone or anything, and that's not who I am. 120 days ago I started taking Kratom and completely quit taking the Methadone, Baclofen and gabapentin that I was on. Im only 33yrs old and I am 6'2 and while on the medications I weighed 119lbs, since stopping them I have gained back almost 40lbs and I feel healthier not only physically but mentally because I don't have that dark clouds hanging over me anymore. Kratom has saved my life, my marriage and my relationship with my children, by allowing me to be a functional father and husband, instead of a zombie. It was the best choice I have made in my life besides having a family. My wife and daughters have told me that they have never seen this side of me, and unfortunately they were right. They have only known the me that was on powerful pain medications. I finally feel like myself again. And that means the world to me and my family. Without Kratom, I would still be dependent on medications that I know were killing me, I have received a new outlook on life and I can start to make up for the years I've missed being a un caring zombie. Please do not make my family and myself have to go backwards into a spiral of dependance. By making Kratom illegal,  it not only affects those taking it but also those around them, they have watched the darkness of their loved ones suffering and addictions.

It is a natural, non-addictive, non-mood altering substance that is easy to stop taking once it has served it's purpose...getting off and staying off opiates.\nPartly due to the excessive prescribing of opiate pain-killers, there are now millions of addicts. Most are people like me, hard working professionals who did not set out to become an addict. Kratom provides a natural way to become free of opiate dependency...with no costly and harmful effects. To prevent access to Kratom, to classify it  as a Schedule 1 drug is just wrong. Although I don't need to take it any more, there are many other lives it can potentially save.

I was on opioids, anti-anxiety and anti-depressants prescriptions for 18 years. I honestly don't know how I functioned taking all of the prescriptions I was on. I lost my job, insurance, and my prescribing Doctor, all within 8 months and I had no choice but to get off all the medications. When I was having severe withdrawals I found Kratom through searching the Internet. It was an absolute God send for me. Within 2 days of using Kratom, I was able to sleep and function quite well.  I have continued using Kratom since then.  It helps the back pain, anxiety and IBS-D.\n\nDuring the past year I have been much more clear headed and no longer in the zombie state the opioids caused. I feel like I am normal and my family has also told me I am more alert and happier then they have seen me in many years. I certainly have a more positive outlook on my future knowing I will have the help of a natural alternative. I do not experience any type of \"high\" with Kratom. It does not work that way.

I have used kratom for about 2 years on a daily basis.  This botanical has helped me in so many ways.  It helps me with anxiety, depression, and cravings for harmful substances.  Over 2 years ago i was a full blown alcoholic and perscription drug addict.  These substances ruled my life and nearly killed me multiple times.  Since i found this herb i have been 100% sober of other drugs and alcohol.  I have never experienced any negative affects from using this substance daily.  There are no proven deaths from this substance in an unadulterated form.  This herb has saved thousands.  I know at least 100 people personally who have gotten their lives back with the help of kratom.  It is important to note that kratom does not get me high.  It simply helps me be productive and keeps me from using the perscription pain meds that cause respatory depression that lead to so many thousands of deaths.  Making this substance illegal will lead to even more deaths and will be counter productive in every way you can imagine.  I am doing the best i ever had as a productive contributing member of society since i discovered kratom.  I just got a promotion to my dream job (with a company i was almost fired from over 2 years ago when i was using drugs and alcohol)  I cant imagine where i might end up if this substance is taken away from me.  Please do not schedule this herb.  Thank you for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18791","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gregory Price","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It will be better for everyone, monetarily, our children, communities, officials, everyone (except the persecuting agencies), if we regulate.

It was first introduced to me as a recreational substance. I was looking for an alternative social lubricant to alcohol so I bought an ounce of high quality Kratom, about 10 doses. I had that ounce for more than two years. In my opinion, as a recreational substance, kratom has little value. Eating 2-5 grams of powdered leaf is no easy task and the reward is minimal compared to most other drugs. Even though I had it in my possession for two years, after initially trying it out a few times, I did not use it to get high.\n\nIn June of this year I was involved in an accident that left me hospitalized with a broken ankle, femur, and spine. By the time I recovered enough to walk I had developed a dependency to the pharmaceutical opiates I was prescribed. Quitting an opiate habit is not easy. When the doctors cut me off I could not sleep without the pills. I felt shaky, sick, both physically and mentally drained. I don't think I experienced even 1/10th of the withdrawals a more serious opiate addict would go through, but it was too much for me. I found some people who had some pills. Without the script anymore I had to make them last, so I shot them up using an insulin syringe. When I couldn't find pills I found some people with black tar heroin that I smoked. This went on for awhile, stopping then going back, then stopping, and going back again.\n\nIf you think my story is an anomaly,  it is not. The 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, conducted and published by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, estimated that there were 2.1 million Americans abusing prescription opiates and 467,000 heroin addicts, nearly double the number of heroin addicts estimated by the survey in 2005. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2010 alone there were 13,652 accidental deaths from prescription opiates, and 2,789 fatal heroin overdoses. In this context, the fact that the DEA sites \"15 kratom-related deaths between 2014 and 2016,\" as reason for making the plant schedule 1, seems absurd. And becomes even more absurd when it is realized that all of those deaths involved other drugs. There has never been a single documented case of fatal overdose from kratom alone. I will repeat that, Kratom alone has never killed anyone. Compare that to the 16,441 deaths from pharmaceutical  opiates and heroin in just one year, and explain to me how it is that you think kratom is the problem.\n\nKratom helped me quit opiates. Kratom made the withdrawals more manageable. I might have been able to quit without Kratom, but I don't think I would have stayed off it. I still have considerable pain from my back injury. Not all the time, but some days it can be debilitating. I  would have likely turned turned to opiates, but instead I use Kratom a few times a week to manage this chronic pain. Kratom is as excellent a pain reliever as there is. It is far less narcotic/intoxicating than opiates, even low dose opiates. I can eat a couple grams of kratom and go about my day feeling sober, healthy, and without pain. On top of these benefits, it is nowhere near as addictive as opiates. I can take kratom many days in a row and then stop with no ill effects. Conversely, if I had 3 Oxycodone I would probably just eat the first, but then snort the second... and by the time I was looking at my third and final pill I would be sorely tempted to inject it. I have never felt like a fiend for Kratom.\n\nWithout Kratom I would have almost certainly have gone back to using opiates by now. Please do not take away this vital medicine from me, the thousands of other people who it has helped, and millions it could help in the future. Kratom needs to be promoted not prohibited.  The only logical reason you could possibly have for making Kratom schedule 1 is to prevent it from competing against the pharmaceutical opiates. This is absolutely shameful. Kratom has great medicinal benefits, and a low potential for abuse. Just like a number of other drugs you have listed as schedule 1. Why are you prohibiting research into these potentially useful substances? Why prohibit medical research into Any substance?\n\nDo away entirely with the classification of schedule 1 drugs. Represent the American people, not the pharmaceutical drug lobby.\n\nSincerely,\nMatthew M. Culbertson\nBreckenridge, Colorado","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5215","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Culbertson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't use kratom.

I am currently a full-time musical performer in Denver, CO. I completed my Master's of Music at CU Boulder in May 2015. I primarily play jazz and swing/vintage jazz on the upright bass for my living but also play blues, rock, musicals, corporate/wedding cover band gigs, bluegrass, children's concerts etc. and also perform on trombone, electric bass, and occasionally guitar. I also teach private lessons independently, including bass, guitar, ukulele, mandolin, and more.\n\nI started experiencing symptoms of depression sometime during high school and my first treatments (talk therapy) began during my junior or senior year of high school, roughly 2005. By the time I was a freshman in college the symptoms exacerbated to the point of severely affecting my ability to function and I experienced my first major depressive episode at that time. I first went on an anti-depressant during my first semester of college. Over the next 3-4 years, I was prescribed at several antidepressant/antianxyiolitic drugs at one time or another: Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Citalopram, Effexor, Xanax, and more. I also engaged in on/off talk therapy with little success. The pattern with the drugs was particularly frustrating. Many did not work, some had such horrible side effects that I could not tolerate them, and- at best, in the case of Citalopram which I took last and for the longest amount of time- it worked but was accompanied by tolerable side effects. As time went on, however, the efficacy fell so the dose increased, which improved the positive effects but worsened the side effects.\n\nDuring my last year of undergrad, my friend/roommate recommended I try kratom. He had an interest in all kinds of substances, some good and others not-so-good, but had been a regular kratom user for some time at that point and actually convinced a local business to carry kratom (kratom quickly accounted for 50% of their profit and they subsequently hired my friend). In short- and I could go on- I found that, compared to the antidepressants that I had taken, was extremely effective in combating the symptoms of depression that make everyday tasks and productivity difficult with very few side effects when used appropriately. I was really struggling to reach even the minimum amount of daily functioning at that time and felt hopeless that I would be able to complete my coursework to graduate on time. Kratom relieved the most severe symptoms of my depression, provided energy, helped with severe depression-related anxiety, and basically allowed me to function well enough to graduate college. I'm not sure I would've passed my courses without it.\n\nObviously I am not a medical professional, nor do I pretend that kratom will work for everyone, but I have seen enough friends find relief through kratom that they did not get from pharmaceutical drugs that I'm convinced it has huge medical potential. At the very least, the anecdotal  success given by tens of thousands of kratom users not only warrants but demands serious scientific studies. Fayetteville, AR became a bit of a kratom bubble due to the success of the business that carried kratom per suggestion of my roommate/friend, and I watched dozens of people find success with in for self-treatment of persisting long-term issues first-hand. General anxiety, acute panic attacks, long-term pain management, depression, a safer alternative to opiate withdrawal than the methadone clinics, and more as well as for less serious uses including energy, motivation, relaxation, and overall well-being. Many of these people, including my own mother who has sever anxiety and a number of chronic health issues, use it to this day. And, yes, I know many people who use it either for pure recreational purposes or (as is the case with myself) for both recreational and well-being purposes. For that demographic, the side effects are slim to none when dosed responsibly. When it is abused, the user vomits before any acute bodily risk occurs. In my experience and observations, it is closer in risk of abuse of coffee or marijuana than it is to the life-threatening risks of abusing alcohol, opiates, or a number of drugs. I hope that there will be research into the long-term effects; I have used it daily for over half a decade and have no apparent negative long-term effects.\n\nAfter graduation, I developed a bad alcohol habit that was supported by an enabling girlfriend. I made the decision to quit drinking (and to breakup with the girlfriend) and kratom made it a very easy process. In fact, I decided to get very serious about my music and kratom helped in 4-hour marathon practice sessions that I did 6 days a week for nearly a year and a half before I got accepted to a Master's program in Colorado.\n\nI do not believe there is substantial evidence that kratom poses a health risk to our society and I believe it has extreme medicinal potential. I hope the DEA does the right thing and chooses to open kratom up to serious research.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21325","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gary Sloan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am worried that a lot of people will go back to drugs if it is banned.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17738","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"julie pylant","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't believe this product should be illegal.

Due to the weight gain no surgeon will attempt to do a back surgery, so I suffer with pain everyday. Kratom makes it bearable. I'm disabled and haven't worked in almost 7 years due to my pain. Kratom has given me some of my life back. I have used Kratom for  a year and a half.  I am currently only using Kratom as opposed to pharmacuticals.  I am not able to work but, I am able to enjoy my life a little more now. To make Kratom illegal would mean I would go back to sad state of depression and pain that I worked so hard to climb out of. I think it should be an option for those who suffer as I do to be able to treat themselves with natural plants and what works for them. \nSincerely,\nTraci Bailey\n \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1715","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Traci Bailey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n      I am a 29 Year old Male, an Operation Iraqi Freedom Veteran, and like many others that have commented before me, I am suffering from chronic pain in my back and knees. Aside from the Air Force, I have been working in construction since I was 15 years old and I am currently an HVACR Service Technician. I have been on prescription pain medications many times before with unpleasant  side effects, and they don't even work very well. Since I found out what Kratom was a year ago, my life has been much more enjoyable. I can get moving better in the morning with less pain and more energy, I don't suffer at work while crawling through attics and crawl spaces. When I take Kratom, my back pain can go from crippling to a slight annoyance, or not there at all. I have never experienced any addictive properties or negative side effects while taking Kratom. I have not experienced any withdrawal like symptoms when I stop taking it or run out. There is absolutely no reason to ban this PLANT. No one can get \"High\" from Kratom. It is not a drug. It is simply an herbal supplement that people use to better their lives by relieving pain, anxiety, depression, PTSD and/or saving their lives from an addiction to REAL DRUGS that kill people every day.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13766","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nicholaus Freeman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please see attached file.

I laid around the house with no purpose getting sicker and sicker and more and more scared to leave the house.  I was hospitalized again.  Then when I got out the second time about 6 months ago I started using Kratom on a daily basis.  It has been a miracle!  My mental health is so much better.  I felt well enough to work and found a job and am back to being a productive member of society thanks in part to Kratom.  My psychiatrist tried me on every drug known to man and nothing had close to the beneficial effects of Kratom.\n    I have had no problems with tolerance.  I have not had to escalate my doses.  I take it every day, the same time of day and the same amount.  I treat it like medicine which it is for me.  When I first started using it I would get a subtle but very pleasant buzz.  That went away and now I just plain out feel better when I take it.  I am finally able to enjoy life after so much pain.  Please don't take this away from me.  This medicine is helping not hurting and if you take it away I will collapse back into suicidal depression.         This is no joke to me.  Kratom saves lives including mine.  It is also a life saver for people trying to get off of hard opioids and to people with chronic pain that want to avoid using tolerance building addicting pills.

I am happy and living a productive life. \n\nYou will do more harm than good if you schedule Kratom.

Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works... It uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies. http://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...

U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects. http://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

For those who suffer from chronic pain and/or addiction the use of opiates is often a necessity to physically function enough to participate in community and work a job.  To vote, to take care of children, to work and pay taxes.  Their tax dollars supply your budget.  The ones whose injuries and insurance might be prescribed their drugs, under intense scrutiny, and are considered law abiding citizens.  The overwhelming majority have few alternatives.  Street heroin, methadone clinics, or Kratom.  Your entire organization's efforts against the trafficking and distribution of heroin should be a top priority yet on a street level heroin is cheaper and more pure than ever.  Overdoses are killing far more Americans than ISIS or the Taliban.  The middle east exports black gold, opium and oil.  Methadone and Suboxone are legal alternatives, yet as expensive without insurance and exponentially more difficult to withdrawal from.  The ONLY other alternative is a natural, safe, and affordable substance that provides relief from withdrawal symptoms, pain, and psychosomatic stress.  It doesn't induce a euphoric high to chase, depress the CNS dangerously, withdrawal symptoms are short and mild.

Soon after though, they told me they were unable to give me the proper pain medication I needed to function normally and without pain. I wrote my congressman and the VA basically told him I never went to my appointments, was not in contact with my doctor, et cetera, but I only stopped going because they had been giving me Tramadol which in turn gave me a seizure, then when I asked for something that would actually help, they said they don't give opiates for pain management, so I stopped going. I have been using Kratom and self medicating because for one, it works extremely well, it isn't addictive, and I don't get sick if I go a little while without having it. I wish the VA would cover stuff like this or at least have helped me from the get go, I was mistreated and this is the only thing I can take that will help bring my pain level down so I can function day to day.

Kratoms interaction with pharmaceutical drugs should be researched to insure the safety of those applicable.

Kratom contains no opiates, but it does bind to the same receptor sites in the brain.

I have a family member who has come to rely on this harmless medicine.  As a nurse with many years of emergency background, I am unable to ascertain a logical reason that the government sees a reason to impose such a ridiculous measure.   The family member in speak, had the misfortune of having chronic pain that caused some understandable anxiety after surgery.  This surgery was needed to repair damage left by giving birth.  Unfortunately, the fix was not perfect.  After a brief struggle with mild narcotic addiction, we found Kratom.  Kratom offered pain relief without the sedating side effects left by narcotics.  Kratom is able to provide mild anxiolytic properties as well.  \nWhen I heard that the DEA was going to ban Kratom, I was absolutely floored!  None of the reasons listed for the ban make any sense.  In my vast years of emergency experience, I have NEVER seen a side effect from Kratom usage.  Traditional opoids have taken countless lives.  Heroin deaths are all too common and I promise you that if Kratom is banned, you WILL not maybe but WILL see an increase in heroin related deaths.  Why might you ask, because people use Kratom in their everyday lives.  They are able to do their day to day activities because they are not overly sedated as is the case when taking narcotics.  These same people will always need relief and that will lead them to back to narcotics and in many cases, non-functionality.\nSchedule I drugs include Heroin, MDMA and LSD, meaning that there is no safe medicinal value and the dangers of consumption are high.  Heck, even cocaine has been shown to have medicinal value.  You want to say Kratom has no medicinal value and the risk of death associated with its use is high.  This is simply not true. It is unconstitutional to place it into Schedule I status to \"study\" the drug.  Scheduling a drug should occur after multiple scientific, fact based and non-biased research studies have taken place.  In the mean time, issue a warning, no potential jail time because the DEA doesn't know what it is talking about!!\nOn a personal level, the family member I mentioned is my wife.  She is very sensitive to medicines and has no interest in being doped up for the day.  She has successfully established herself as a housewife, stay at home mom and home school teacher to our 6 year old.  Without any exaggeration, Kratom has been the medicine to make this possible.  Pain is an everyday reality for her but Kratom allows her to function as a normal human being while not being sedated, wanting to sleep and fighting constipation.  I cannot imagine her not being able to have the Kratom and shutter at what we would have to do if you decided to ban it. \nAs a nurse, I see the value in this as well.  I see narcotic addiction daily.  It is detrimental and does take lives.  Kratom provides an opportunity for safe and effective pain relief.  Why would the DEA want to take something away that has been proven time and time again to work, away from everyday people.  Would I trust a pilot to fly me on Kratom? Yes.  Would I allow a surgeon to operate on me after taking Kratom? Yes.  Is it safe to drive a car while taking Kratom? Yes.  Can you care for a child while taking Kratom? Yes.  The list goes on, but I think my point is clear.  This medicine does not endanger anybody taking it or anybody around somebody taking it. \nIt's time to exercise good and moral judgement and drop this potential ban.  If you choose to study it, great!  You will find a great and safe substitution for narcotics.  If your goal is a safe medicine, you have found it.\nPlease don't hurt my 6 year old son by making his mommy have pain again.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17196","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeremy Letkomiller","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Over the last 20+ years, I've had nearly 100 close friends and family members get addicted to pain pills because of being over prescribed.

The DEA has not provided a strong enough argument (statistical, or otherwise) for why kratom is such a terrible threat to public welfare.  It certainly is not worthy of an outright ban and it certainly has potential medicinal value in the realm of addiction recovery, pain management, among many others.  \n\nI started using kratom to help combat a drinking problem I started to develop in my early twenties.  It helped me with rebound insomnia, stress, and lessened my depressive issues.  \n\nCurrently, I use kratom as a pain management aid (I have alot of aches, pains, cuts, bruises etc muscle soreness from my profession), a sleep aid, and a stress management aid.  It is the best supplement I have ever come across that is legally available, affordable, and relatively benign in it's effects (the effects aren't strong or overwhelming, so I can still function and not be intoxicated or anything like that).\n\nTo conclude:  I have personally found kratom to be very useful to me and I would like to continue using it legally.  It does not deserve a outright ban because it is a useful supplement, is benign (i.e. not on the same level as illicit street drugs, does not pose the same amount of threat) and should be available for people to use it freely and legally.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1027","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Wyatt Spruck","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hundreds of thousands of us use this SAFELY for pain instead of Tramadol or NARCOTICS.

I woke up everyday with a head full of anxiety and cold sweats, until I took my first pill (hydrocodone) of the day. Every single day I woke up feeling the terrible effects of withdrawal from a prescription granted to me by my doctor and regulated by you. Yes, the hydrocodone does take away my ankle pain but with it comes the burden of withdrawal, tolerance, and constipation. I decided enough was enough and started researching alternative medicines. I couldn't keep living like that. I tried several different ways to self medicate but none of them worked very well, until I first tried Kratom. After reading stories of people suffering like me, I ordered a 50 grams online just to try it and it and im very happy I did. When I received my order, I waited until the next morning to take it so i could distinguish if it really worked as well as I had read. At 7 am the next day, overwhelmed with cold sweats, I took 4 grams and waited. 20 minutes later my withdrawal symptoms as well as the pain in my ankle completely diminished. I couldn't believe it. I continued to take it for the entire week and day by day i would wake up with less anxiety, cold sweats and my constipation abruptly stopped. After about 2 weeks, I no longer had any symptoms of opiate addiction. I hadn't taken my prescription at all during this time. Soon after, I had an appointment with my pain management doctor and told him about my experience with kratom as well as not taking my hydrocodone. He advised me to stop taking it and continue my normal medication even though I killed my addiction as well as being pain free. I got in a rather large argument with him about how I was medicating with kratom and just flat out told him im done with the pills and wont be needing his assistance anymore. Id become more physically active, more social, and just felt much healthier as well as having no ill effects (besides pain) if I didn't take a kratom dose. No withdrawal, no worrying about my next dose, nothing. All this happened about 3-4 months ago. Then, I recently found out the DEA wants to place it as a schedule 1 substance and it devastated me. This completely natural plant improved my lifestyle much more than i could have ever imagined and now the government wants to tell me I cant continue taking it without breaking the law. This stuff is not heroin, I dont feel \"high\" or dopey on it like I did with vicoden and I dont have any withdrawal from it either. I cant go back to taking that poison, it ruined me for years. I was extreamly dependent on taking my pills, felt lazy, had horrible withdrawal symptoms when i woke up every morning and everytime i had to defficate it felt like i was giving birth to a brick. Furthermore my dosing wasnt even remotely high, 7.5mg hydrocodone every four or five hours. Please listen to people like me, and the hundreds of thousands who share the same story, when we say PLEASE DO NOT SCHEDULE KRATOM. It turned my life around to the point people close to me noticed it. I didnt inform my wife about it until she told me I was acting much more enthusiastic and active than normal. Im actually going to the gym regularly again. Even my boss noticed I was getting more work done in the office as well as not limping around from the occasional bursts of pain. So, I ask one more time, please do not ban this amazing plant. It made my life much better. If anything, ban hydrocodone and its prescription substitutes, they ruined my daily life. To this day, I have not experienced any ill effects from this plant and pray that ill be able to continue taking it. If it does get banned, I will probably just cope with the pain and use aspirin. For the sake of the argument i should tell you how I destroyed my ankle. 3 years ago, I flipped a highly modified kabota (basically a 2 seated quad). When it flipped, my side of the roll cage hit a large rock before dropping of a small cliff. The front left beam of the roll cage (I was driving) broke at the bottom welds and was bent down angled into the floorboards of the kabota. Then my leg was in-between the floor and the broken beam of the roll cage when the kabota fell off the small cliff (7-9 foot drop) and landed on its roof. This forced the beam into my leg, right above the ankle. The ripped steel end of the beam went completely through the bottom part of my left leg, but just barely. Now i have several plates/screws in my leg as well as a reconstructed ankle. The doctors recommended it be amputated it was so torn up, but we decided to try and save it anyway. Im lucky to still have two functioning feet.To this day I still have moderate pain with the slightest movement. Prescription opiates destroy lives, kratom saved me from opiate hell I was in and made me who I was before the accident.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22701","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Recovered Addict Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have heard of some great results for veterans using this drug to help their PTSD.

The only time i had any adverse reaction to it was I took some on an empty stomach and it made me a bit nauseous. Unlike the prescription pain med that make you head a bit foggy and hard to focus kratom actually increases my focus when taken in small doses. I am going to be getting back surgery to correct one of the vertebrae and will want to com off of the pain meds. As long as kratom is still available I plan on using it to curve what ever withdrawal symptoms that will come from being on the pain meds for so long. The research that I have done on the meds that are prescribed  to do this have a high probability of the patient becoming addicted to it instead.

I came to use Kratom about 3 yrs ago when a family member told me about it. I did some research on it and reached out to other people that had used it. I had been taking Tramadol which caused me to have a seizure when I started taking my antidepressant with it (The two do not mix well apparently) After that I took hydrocodone but the side effects were horrible so I decided to give Kratom a try. I took it without any problems until it was banned in my state. We tried to reach out and educate but no representatives would listen to us. Since I have had to stop taking it, the quality of my life has diminished. I really do not want to take opiates again. The side effects were intolerable. They made me lethargic and depressed even more so now I just take a fibromyalgia medication and I suffer daily.  I can't play with my grandchildren as I once did and it's a struggle to get out of bed and go to work. I understand the DEAs concern. With things that have popped up in the past (spice,etc) you are concerned it's similar but I can assure it is not. Kratom never made me 'high' and it actually helped with my depression. It's a natural plant that has been used safely for a very very long time and that's why people like it. It's safer, doesn't make you high, less side effects and is very helpful. No one is robbing their family to get Kratom, it's not a 'street drug' that people are eager to get. It's just not like that and again, that's why so many like it. I can no longer use it but a scheduling federally would put so many people in danger and cause a lot of people to have to go back to other options. How about the people that it has helped get off all of that awful stuff like heroine? Heroine addicts don't really want to be addicted to heroine or any other substance. They need help. People are dying everyday and now here is something that can help save lives. Naturally. Please do not take this option away from the people of the United States like our lawmakers in Alabama have done. Let's all work together to help this country with the epidemic of deadly synthetic drugs and leave an all natural plant alone. This is not the problem in America.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5889","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tami Denney","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban kratom.

I also have arthritic shoulders and irreparable disc damage in my lower back; both of which cause extreme pain.   I was addicted to dangerous narcotic drugs like Percocet and Vicodin for years and it literally ruined my life.   I could not work or function normally on a day to day basis.  \n        I have been using kratom for about 4 years now and it has kept me away from the narcotics and relatively pain-free for the most part so that I am able to be a productive member of society and not just a zombie on the couch all day.   I have absolutely NO BAD SIDE EFFECTS WHATSOEVER AND I DO NOT FEEL ADDICTED.  in fact, I have stopped using it for a few periods at a time and have NEVER had withdrawal symptoms.    \n     I believe kratom should be regulated; age 18 or older.  It should be studied extensively as an alternative pain relief option and SHOULD NOT BE BANNED AND/OR PLACED IN SCHEDULE 1     Many people will die as a result of your decision to do this because they will be forced to go back to the dangerous prescription drugs..

I did some research and came across the natural plant called Kratom, it comes from South East Asia. So, I was desperate to try anything, but knew, I did not want to go back to taking pain  pills,  or Suboxone.  When I took Kratom, within 30 minutes , the withdrawal's started to  fade away, the aches and pains disappeared,  I was able to sleep,  and did not feel sick anymore. For me, Kratom saved my life, because,  it was very easy for me to buy pain pills off of the streets,  but I didn't want to live my life that way. I'm very thankful that I found Kratom,  because, I could have been easily one of the many people who came across the Norco's,  that where laced with Fentynal,  or Heroine,  and easily taken it, and ended up dieing, and leaving behind my two beautiful children, wonderful Husband, and So many other Family members and friends.  This natural plant, Kratom, does not make you feel high, it does not make me want to take more, than I need, like I used to do , when I was prescribed pain pills. Please, do not make this illegal,  it has, and is saving a lot of people's lives, and it does not kill people like pain pills do.

Two years ago in May of 2015, I was in a serious car accident in Dallas, Texas which resulted in my entire life being halted, and dislocating multiple bones and vertebrae.  I had to quit every job I had, withdrew from school, and sunk into a deep depression. I was suffering mentally, and physically while no one really knew what was happening. \n\nShortly after I lost access to getting my medications, I started using illegal drugs like heroin and other opiates to help sleep, eat, and be active. Using heroin once a week became twice a week, then everyday and then a full blown addiction. \n\nI was selling every possession i owned just to get high. \n\nOne day I was searching online like I did everyday to find a solution or a way out of the hell i was living and came across krater on Facebook . Ive compromised every moral in my life for a momentary high or just to feel better. Anytime I tried to stop, I had seizures . I wouldnt eat, I couldnt sleep, and I lost over 100 pounds in 7 months was now at 98 pounds. \n\nI drove two hours to get a sample at a local shop while I was withdrawing. I literally risked my life just to try anything that would work.\n\nwithin minutes of drinking it, I remember the calming wave of peace and comfort in my body/ My body stopped seizing , my temperature fell to normal, and for once in such a long time, I was actually hungry. I ate an entire plate of Spaghetti at olive garden. I went from smoking a half gram of heroin a day, to taking nothing  (Not even krater ) in less than a month. My withdrawals had stopped immediately. Almost completely. I am still in shock.  I was fighting suicidal actions just the night before, and now I was in no pain. \n\nThis was all in October of this year. Now its December 1st, and Im sober. Im employed, Im healing, Im happy, Im healthy. My life went from the gutter to outstanding with the help of a simple plant just like anything else natural like coffee or Marijuana.  I never thought I would have a way out of hell, until kratom gave me the tools to pull myself out. I do not feel any cravings for krater . I drink it when I feel pain in my body, and probably only twice a week at this point. I cant imagine ever scamming people or screwing over family for money to get kratom. Thats absurd. For heroin while Im withdrawing, I would do anything. There is a huge difference and If I hadnt had access to krater, I would be on the news for shooting myself. Honestly I had no intentions of living past october, and my life is forever in debt to the people who provided me an amazing, quality product. \n\nI truly hope you see that banning this plant is going to do nothing but kill thousands of innocent people.

This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research.\nkratom is a regulated dietary ingredient. Kratom is not a drug. kratom is not addictive\n-I started to use kratom upon hearing about it from my mother in law whom also suffers from chronic back pain kratom has helped me obtain my old life back.\n-I've been suffering from chronic back pain since age 13 due to degenerative disk disease, 3 slipped discs, and sciatica. I have also suffered with sever depression and PTSD since i was a little boy due to traumatic events in my life. I have attempted suicide 3 times.  Kratom has assisted me with depression and my pain. I have been on many medications and therapies, none of which were helpful to me.\nKratom should not be made illegal, it has been used safely for hundreds of years. Kratom alone has not caused any deaths. Another thing to consider, is that this ban is opening a larger hole for the black market. Normal citizens whom obey the law will be made into criminals. Our prison system is already excessive in number. \nin conclusion I feel my depression will over take me once again without it. Kratom has turned me into a great man and husband whose able to live a life outside of pain both physical and mental. I have one cup of tea in the morning and thengo to work. I work 12 hour days\n-Conclusion: Kratom is a safe non-opiate tea leaf. I fear this action by the DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic, I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without kratom.\nPlease, i beg you, do not ban kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1154","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Miller","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Randall Smith, I am 58 years old and have been employed by the same company for over 36 years. I oppose any effort to restrict the availability, sale and use of Kratom by adults. \n\nI have gone from being a healthy, active young man to being partially disabled due to chronic pain diagnosed and treated as psoriatic arthritis. Until I discovered Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) five years ago, my life was filled with daily pain and depression. I had been very active in my church, gardening, home remodeling and playing an assortment of musical instruments prior to the onset of the chronic pain, and then I lost the ability to do many of the things I loved due to the pain and loss of movement in my hands, hips, back and shoulders. \n\nHaving had some experience with herbal supplements in the past, I discovered Kratom in a search to find a natural, herbal way to combat the arthritis. Even though I was being treated by a rheumatologist, I was having limited success finding relief with the very expensive drugs (which also carry a long list of possible side effects including, lung infections and lymphoma). I read quite a lot about Kratom before trying it and felt that it was far less likely to cause harm than the FDA approved biologic drug I was prescribed (which cost me thousands of dollars every year).\n\nSince using Kratom as an herbal supplement, I have regained the ability to do most all of the activities I enjoyed, from gardening to playing guitar. My pain levels are very low, my attitude and sense of well-being are up. I look forward to life again, rather than simply waiting to die to end the pain. Because of the biologic drug that my rheumatologist prescribes, and the fact that it can adversely affect several of my organs, I have regular blood-work done so my doctor can watch for any adversities. So far, I am healthier now than I was prior to adding Kratom to my diet.\n\nKratom is an amazingly helpful plant which has been used safely for hundreds, if not thousands of years. It is not a threat to our society, in fact it is more of a miracle helpful plant that has changed people's lives in positive ways all across the USA. Scheduling Kratom to restrict adult use is a shameful choice.\n\nKeep Kratom legal and available to the citizens of the USA! Let us use what nature has provided and do not force us to consume harmful chemicals synthesized by the greed of corporations.\n\nThank you for listening.\n\nSincerely,\nRandall C.

Kratom is no more dangerous than any other legal botanical dietary supplement.. \n\nI am a 29 year old attorney who consumes kratom regularly. I take kratom because it is a healthy botanical that helps boost my mood and gives me energy to get through difficult tasks. At times, I have taken kratom daily for up to a month. I have always been able to stop taking kratom \"cold turkey\" for weeks at a time without any withdrawal symptoms. For me, kratom has fewer negative side effects than caffeine.\n\nI know several people who use kratom for a variety of reasons. Every person I know who uses kratom is a respected member of society who has never been in trouble with the law. While taking kratom, none of us feel or act intoxicated. When I take kratom I feel relaxed and focused. It does not impair my ability to think or act. \n\nAny substance can be abused. As many people have died from water intoxication as have allegedly died from kratom. The possibility of abuse is not a reason for scheduling a substance. Research has made clear that the potential for abuse of kratom is very low. Kratom does not cause respiratory depression. You cannot over dose on natural kratom because your body will cause you to vomit if you take too much. Kratom does not work as a recreational drug because the \"high\" is so mild. Long term use of kratom does not harm the body. For all these reasons, kratom is significantly less harmful than alcohol or tobacco. \n\nBasing drug laws on fear and misinformation is a grave injustice to the people of the US. Putting people in prison and ruining their lives for taking a substance that helps them is unacceptable. Given the extremely low risk of kratom, the potential harm cause by criminalizing kratom far exceeds the benefits. If the DEA and FDA actually care about the american people, they will not schedule kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18104","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Cavazos","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban Kratom.

Since then, I've suffered from chronic pain in my back and hips. I've been to physical therapists, chiropractors and doctors. While physical therapy and chiropractic adjustments have provided some relief, my experiences with doctors has been less satisfactory. I've declined back surgery because the success rate is slim to none. Doctors have routinely prescribed muscle relaxers and acetaminophen-hydrocodone. In my case, both medications have caused more harm than good. Muscle relaxers left me barely functional and they exacerbated my scoliosis. Acetaminophen-hydrocodone hampered my faculties, and as an opiate was far too addictive (I am recovering alcoholic). When I discovered kratom one year ago, I finally found something that works for me. It blocks - or interferes with - my pain receptors to a significant extent, so that I'm able to stretch, move and exercise - which is the true remedy for my symptoms. I now use kratom in conjunction with exercise (pilates) and physical therapy. It's not a perfect solution, but I can function and work a full time job without the debilitating side effects of opiates and/or muscle relaxers. I also avoid the risk of addiction that acetaminophen-hydrocodone poses. If kratom is banned, I doubt I will find anything that works as well for pain while posing low to no risk of addiction.

Due to the nature of the work I do,  I frequently suffer from pain throughout my neck,  back and knees. As a result of this,  I became hooked on narcotics in the past in an effort to ease the pain.  Thanks to Kratom,  I am able to get the relief I need without the terrible  side effects of illicit drugs or alcohol.  Kratom allows me to function perfectly fine and be a hard-working, productive member of society. I also suffer from mild depression and bad anxiety,  which kratom also helps to eliminate.  It helped me to get on the right track in life,  and I now have the focus and drive to better myself in my career so my wife and I can afford to buy a house. \n\n Kratom has been used for hundreds of years,  and is a very safe plant.  Without a doubt, the benefits this plant provides greatly outweighs any risks,  and as far as risks there is slim to none.  I feel kratom should remain unscheduled,  and be available to anyone over the age of 18 or 21. Alcohol is a very harmful substance to one's body, mind, family, and society; yet is legal.  Kratom is such a benign substance and in fact is very helpful,  so I believe it would be a massive error to schedule this plant. It is what is keeping many people from becoming derelicts to society,  and if it is scheduled  I can almost guarantee that drug and alcohol problems will increase as people turn to damaging substances.   \n\nKratom is not a substance to get \"high\" on.  It is a very mild plant,  yet helps with multiple things so well.  It is this fact that it is mild that makes it perfectly safe,  because people can use it and not be incapacitated and incapable of work like other substances. \n\nIn conclusion,  I feel the benefits very much outweigh the risks of kratom,  and that it should remain a perfectly legal,  unscheduled plant.

I myself have dibilitating headaches for which I consumed Tylenol/ibuprofen/bc powder for many years in great quantity in an attempt to lead a somewhat normal life.  That being said, what is in those pills?  How harsh are they on my body?  So much that I was advised medically to refrain from using any NSAID due to bleeding internally that was caused strictly by them!  I found kratom, tried it, not for a high or low but in a last ditch attempt to find a solution to my ailment of which no one but a fellow sufferer could understand.  Kratom was a god send-  no side effects, no fillers, no unknown pill coatings or delivery devices.  Kratom was and is a simple medicinal plant,  - natural remedy long used by those who are native to its regions.  This plant has changed my life , and in a very positive way.  The seller from which I buy has information, pictures, communications, and even trees of her own that come from her supplier.  There are no chemical additives, no byproducts, and no environmental harm that arise from the growing, harvesting, and use of kratom.  The USA is obviously in a predicament with the opioids flooding the street, but we the people/government caused it.  What the commoner does not realize is the heroin, fentanyl, carfentanyl, etc that is flooding our streets and killing our people is due to the fact that the government took away a controlled form of dependency , the pills.   At least when taking a pill you know how much you are taking, if you overdose it's your own fault, you knew how much you were taking.  With the street drugs nobody knows the potency and therefore the first hit is not the same as the second then you die.  This ban is just as ridiculous as the marijuana debate right now, many states allow the use of it, even D.C.  Now that's our nations capital....... yet federally it's illegal?  How ridiculous is that?  Kratom being compared to other drugs as addictive is absurd, and the pitiful poison control statistics related to kratom \"overdose\"?  What a joke.   Kratom itself prevents too much ingestion by inducing vomiting, I have not seen anyone trying to ban alcohol, it's the most abundant toxic drug next to tobacco that we encounter in our lives.  Kratom is a life saver, I have seen the benefits many times over, addicts taken from the illegal pills/powders, users able to withdraw from other things and still function, and the reduction of pain among other benefits.  The best thing we can do is allow kratom and keep it from being a pharmaceutical money maker. The pharm companies as we all know, and the gov has created/allowed , are making record profits by ripping off the every day consumer.   It's time to quit letting the big companies run our country.   Let kratom keep us healthy and safe .  I would hope the next time statistics or the like are brought up in the public eye that we are seeing accurate numbers, real situations, and a comparison to other chemicals that our gov allows to be in every household in the country .","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2134","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anthony Humphrey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my name is Kevin Hogan I am 24 years old and work as a security guard. I personally oppose the scheduling of Kratom as a schedule 1 drug, mainly because my personal experience and the experiences of peers of mine have only been therapeutic and life changing in a very helpful way. I was 21 years old and near homeless struggling to make ends meet to buy my daily dose of heroin I needed to not be sick. I started using opiates as a teenager and got hooked in my late teens.  I couldn't afford rehab and wanted more than anything to escape the trap I had got myself stuck in. I had read about Kratom and ordered some online. I brewed the tea anxiously wondering if my withdrawals would go away and whether or not I would get high off it. Well my withdrawals did definitely stop but I have never in all my use of it experienced a high. I will attest to anxiety relief and slight mood elevation similar to a good cup of coffee but nothing that ever came close to impairing me. I have never experienced respiratory depression from Kratom and I am very familiar with how respiratory depression feels due to my experience with opiates and opioids.  I would warn against scheduling this drug in this class. It could very well be the cheap cure to the opiate/heroin epidemic my community has been facing for the last decade or so.\n  Sincerely, \n  Kevin Travis Hogan","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10522","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin Hogan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, my name is Mike Hall, I ran a halfway house for teens for about 11 years and also worked as a social worker for at risk youth for 5.   Many of the teens I worked with struggled with drug addictions.  Over that time I've witnessed firsthand the adverse affects of all sorts of drugs, everything from crack cocaine, Spice, or even alcohol poisoning.\n\nThe plant known as Kratom, which contains the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, is entirely different.  It is natural, much safer than alcohol let alone any schedule 1 substance, and has many medicinal qualities, including all natural pain relief as well as facilitating a safer, smoother transition from opiate addiction (whether it be pharmacy pills or heroin.)  I personally know people who have conquered heroin addictions with Kratom and now reportedly lead happier, more productive lives. \n\nI personally have used Kratom approximately ten times over the past two years with zero ill affects, and zero cravings.

After investing time into researching this plant I have become confused as far as to why the DEA would even consider banning something that has such healing properties without the addiction that comes from opioids. If you are a real person reading this just take this one moment to put all side interests aside. There are real people, real people in this country who are suffering from addiction to prescription pain killers. Every 19 minutes we lose one life to this reason. Yes people die every day and we cannot mourn them all or feel sorry for them all but when a government agency has the power to help reduce the amount of people who could be dying on a daily basis don't you think that is a duty owed to the people of this country that should be done properly? More research needs to be put into this drug and it needs to be brought into the light. Look how long people thought marijuana was a deadly and a useless plant and now its been proven to have many beneficial properties. As a country we should not be afraid of the unknown, we should be willing to research and learn more about these things in order grow and progress into the future. I hope you have taken the time to read this and understand that this is a serious issue that doesn't need to be pushed under the rug.

I have had 4 back surgeries and was placed on pain medication prescribed by a doctor over 15 years ago. Sadly the medication stopped working and I was placed on more and more opiates and benzos. Most recently I was on a lethal dosage of medications and my quality of life had literally been ruined. I was not able to function, I was dozing off and even had suppressed breathing at times. I found out about Kratom from a friend on a chronic pain website and gave it a try in January of this year. I am now 8 months free from all pain medications including antidepressants and benzos and can now function, be the parent that I need to be and do things that I haven't done in years. The idea that the DEA is trying to take away a PLANT... that is helping people stay off of these medications and actually have a quality of life is ludicrous. There are veterans, parents, grandparents and addicts that are all getting relief from these deadly medications that we currently have an epidemic with. The DEA is saying that they had 15 related Kratom deaths and each and every one of those deaths also had a different drug along with it. There are people dying every 20 minutes from opiate overdoses and yet they would rather take this plant away from us and have people's lives on their hands? Look at the amount of deaths from energy drinks, yet they are legal. I ask that you please read articles...one in particular in Forbes magazine, that gives very accurate information about kratom. It frightens me to think that this will be banned and due to my legitimate pain that experience I may have to go back to opiates. I ask that you please consider signing this letter and joining your other colleagues and helping us fight this battle? I don't see people standing up for their rights to use Heroin, LSD or bath salts. These are well educated, intelligent people who are taking the time to fight for this plant to remain legal. If we were drug users, I don't think we could write emails and make phone calls. Please don't allow this PLANT to be taken away from SO many people who NEED it?

Please regulate rather than eliminate. I've stopped using Kratom since the first potential ban date in September, and have sorely missed it's help in dealing with our conditions. My wife was diagnosed two years ago with rheumatoid arthritis and has used Kratom when needed for pain relief after hundreds of wasted dollars on muscle relaxers and opiate pain medications which caused side effects that far outweighed any relief they provided. The Kratom was more effective than Percocet and Skelaxin combined. It also raised her energy level instead of causing drowsiness, seemed to sharpen her focus instead of causing delirium, did not cause constipation and didn't have a rebound effect or any addictive desire to take more if it was not needed. My personal experience comes from stomach ulcers which prohibit any anti-inflammatory drugs even if I have muscle or bone pain, which I sometimes do from a previous severe car accident and the occasional migraine headache. If I'm experiencing pain that Tylenol isn't able to conquer, which threatens to prevent me from work or household activities, Kratom can eliminate the pain, usually without a trace. My mood is lifted, my energy levels go up, and this for an entire day. It is less expensive and more effective than any prescription I've tried for these same issues, and leaves no lingering effects. Hopefully a solution is possible which dissuades misuse but allows for availability to those who have a real need.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16050","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Theodore Thomas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This supplement has allowed me to successfully manage my depression.

It is being used for chronic pain that has found no other relief, for arthritis sufferers, for successfully withdrawing from opiates and pharmaceuticals that are found to be addictive.\n\nI join with the many who are of the firm belief that this plant and its many, many benefits to help so many should not be one that comes under a classification as a Schedule I drug, or labeled in any form as a criminal offense.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14081","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm an actor and I have a friend who has Crohn's disease and Kratom let's him be able to function at his job, he runs a crew of canvassers and does a lot of walking, Kratom helps him do this job efficiently.\n\nSincerely, \nTrevor Starr","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15949","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Trevor Starr","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello and thank you for your time and consideration,\n\n Kratom has been a miracle for me, a gift from God or whatever higher power or creator you believe. The day I decided to kick my opiates addiction I was scared to death of the of the unbelievable painful withdrawal that I knew was not far behind me. I decided to search the internet for something to help aid me through this hell If they're even was one. I found Kratom and once I did I scoured the internet for as much information on this PLANT ! Next I scoured the internet to find a reputable source to purchase it in its raw leaf powered form. By the time It arrived 2 days later I was knee  deep into my withdrawal symptoms. I took a teaspoon an within 30 minutes I began to feel human not high in any way. I was and I am still amazed by it. I continued to use Kratom daily for about 3 months as aid not to relapse to pills and then decided I no longer needed it by this point I was using 3 teaspoons a day. Being an opiate addict I decided I would not just stop but taper off the Kratom so every 4 days I would take one less teaspoon till I was down to one teaspoon for another 4 days and then I jumped off. To my surprise I had zero withdrawal.\n\n I do find it interesting Kratom was banned in Thailand because it was cutting into their opium trade and now it's under fire in America when were up to our necks in perscription drug abuse. Who has the most to loose here big pharmaceutical or the people who use this plantmedicine in place of synthetic drugs. It's my understanding that  Kratom has the ability to dance around the opiate receptors where as OxyContin screws itself into the bodies opiate receptors. \n\n  I now will Kratom occasionally when in pain rather than using a synthetic drug. Living in California who have had medical for 20 years  and just legalized marijuana for recreation feel good that we as a society are finally turning the corner on the ridiculous stigma attached to that plantmedicine.  I beg and plead that you don't place the same ridiculous stigma onto another miracle plantmedicine in Kratom. I truly believe these plants were put here for a reason. Your decision to place Kratom into a schedule one status would be criminal. It would negatively affect the people who responsibly use the miracle of  Kratom. \n\nThank you,\nRon","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10524","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban kratom. It is not the devil drug that the media & government et al makes it out to be.  I advise everyone who is considering banning the plant to read Forbe's journalist David DiSalvo's experience with kratom:  http://www.daviddisalvo.org/the-daily-brain/2013/4/5/results-of-my-kratom-experiment.html\n\nKratom is a \"drug\" in the way that caffeine is a drug, it's in the same family. The only difference is that caffeine has actually killed people. Kids overdose on it, middle schoolers pop no-doz like candy. Heck - that was the first \"drug\" I ever tried! You want to discuss gateway drugs - look at caffeine.  I went to school with kids who literally overdosed on it and ended up in the emergency room. One thirteen year-old boy died...from caffeine and booze. \n\n This hasn't happened with kratom. Most of the time, when kratom has been blamed for a death - other real  drugs have been in the victims' systems.   Specifically Xanax. \n\nThose \"OK\" drugs are the ones big Pharmaceutical companies push on Americans. Part of the reason this bill exists in the first place (because I guarantee a good portion of government workers had to Google it and hadn't heard of it until it became the media's favorite scapegoat) is because chronic pain patients were seeking out natural alternatives to their legally prescribed dope.  You know, oxycodone, Percocet, Vicodin,  etc.  \n\nThe problem is that kratom worked too well - not only did it relieve pain and make life manageable, it lacked many of the negative side effects of the legal stuff. Heroin addicts turned to it to get off life long prescriptions to suboxone and subutex - addiction \"cures\" that are more dangerous and addicting than actual heroin!  So people talked about it online, dedicated forums to it, and it got the attention of well meaning - but seriously misguided legislators.  Just because kratom has some subtle enjoyable effects (relaxing or energizing depending on the strain) the powers that be don't want us to have it.  \n\nThen, greedy and irresponsible vendors market kratom as a \"legal high\" and ruin it for the rest of us. \n\nYet - no one is pushing to ban tobacco - a drug is guaranteed to kill you (and doesn't even get you high!). Or alcohol - a drug responsible for 88,000 deaths per year.  But suddenly, after decades of demonization Marijuana is OK  (because the war on drugs showed the government just how lucrative that natural herb could be, and all the potential profits they were missing out on).  \n\nLike marijuana, kratom has at least anecdotal healing properties.  Think passionflower. Unlike marijuana - and contradictory to sensational stories - kratom is not psychedelic in any sense of the word.  Kratom's effects on the brain and behavior are minimal, and certainly less than those of marijuana (no one gets paranoid or develops schizophrenia from drinking too much kratom).  Also, as any kratom user knows, if you drink too much, it makes you nauseous.  It's like kratom has a built in mechanism to prevent abuse. Less is definitely more when it comes to this substance. \n\nit's about as addicting as coffee. If you use it daily for a long time, and suddenly stop - you will feel slightly out of it, bored, and a little lethargic. Approximately, the same level of discomfort as quitting caffeine.  \n\n\nTo say kratom should be banned because it leads addicts back into addiction is as logical as banning alcohol because alcoholics abuse it. Addicts are exactly that - they will try to get high on anything - from huffing glue to inhaling their own excrement to guzzling down Robitussin.   \n\nI could go on and on....but this is already epic. I apologize if this comes off as ranting, but  Kratom has been a lifesaver for me.  I need to defend it. I've suffered from anxiety my entire life. I've tried all of those so-called anti-anxiety drugs - from Xanex to Valium - and they make the problem worse. Guess what the side effects of anti-anxiety meds are when they wear off? Anxiety and agitation. Tolerance builds quickly, so you need to up your dose just to keep it working. And these drugs are deadly. Withdrawls from benzodiazepines can literally kill you. How's that for a \"cure\"?  \n\nI also have a herniated disk and find kratom works wonders for my chronic pain. \n\nKratom is a homeopathic remedy that works. The so-called \"high\" can't be compared to Darvocet, let alone heroin. It's more like a glass of red wine followed by chamomile tea. It shouldn't be sold to anyone under 18 - the same way caffeine or alcohol shouldn't be. \n\n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17231","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bekah L","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been a Kratom consumer for approximately three years.

It is highly arrogant of the department to conclude (with little to no research) that Kratom has no legitimate use outside of \"getting high.\"\n\nHave those on the board recommending this decision ever used Kratom? It is very easy to purchase online and can be made into tea like any other herbal infusion. If they haven't, they are not qualified to speak to this issue. Period. It is NOT a recreational drug, it is a medicated herbal tea. And while some may experiment with abusing it, most find that is a poor choice or substitute to cannabis (what they would most likely prefer to use) and never use it again. Like Salvia divinorum (also foolishly restricted and similarly demonized) this is a natural substance that, along with many other plants, can be used very effectively to treat depression and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. It is a far, far safer medicine (with fewer side effects) than many legal pharmaceuticals. Why would the DEA want to restrict the use of this amazing plant? If it is because of the fear that it may be abused, then why not consider further restricting alcohol or tobacco access? Alcohol and tobacco -- while legal -- are far more dangerous and are abused to a much greater extent that Kratom.\n\nPlease reconsider scheduling this medicinal plant.

For years I took opioids to help with my pain. Because I was in so much pain,  I began to need more and more of the medication.  It was the only way I could function daily. Then it went from a dependency to an addiction in just a few months. I didn't know that then. I was in so much pain that I didn't pay attention. I continued this way for 5 years. Slowly,  I began to worry about what I was doing to my body,  wondering if I would die.  The one thing I needed to function was causing me to slowly die,  and I knew it. I knew I needed to stop,  but I didn't know how or didn't know what I should do about my legitimate pain. I am a mother of two.  I couldnt afford to be laid up. \n I started to do research. I very quickly found Kratom as a way to overcome the withdrawals I knew I'd experience with getting off my pills.  At that time I didn't know the other benefits of Kratom.  Immediately I found a shop and bought some to try out. Like anything else medication like,  I had to try different strains.  As i did this I started noticing that Kratom was eliminating my pain,  which is more that I can say for the pills I was taking. I was blown away!  I immediately started to notice I was feeling better.  I wasn't tired.  My stomach issues resolved. My husband even noticed that my old personality was returning.\n I can function more now on kratom better than I ever could on pills/opioids. And I barely felt withdrawls! \nI truly believe that Kratom saved my life!  I have referred other addicts to Kratom who were successful in getting off of their opioids.

The pain is so debilitating everyday from stomach aches to no mobility in my joints, that I cannot even get out of bed some days.  And at this young of an age, to be feeling like I do can cause a man to delve into a deep depression and stress that is almost debilitating in its self.  I have been a pharma guinea pig for new and emerging modern medicine since being diagnosed and have suffered severe pain/damage, and massive side effects and pharmaceuticals are to blame for 60% irreversible damage done to my body.  In other words, I've been on almost every opiate or synthetic medicatio and chemotherapy available and have also trialed over 100 different medicines to try and cure me from my pain at the very least. What happened after this point in my life was very bad.  This is when I found kratom.  \n\nThis wonderful leaf has allowed me to have my life back , with no more pain or depression, and with a completely clear head.  Kratom is god-sent to me and I dont know what I would do without it.  It allows me to get up every morning and be the productive member of society thay I've always wanted to be.  Without fear of addiction or side effects, and without a fuzzy headed feeling that strong narcotic painkillers give you.  And on the better health side, kratom has also raised the ph in my lower intestine, allowing my body to heal itself and healing the damage done from pharmaceuticals, in turn revivng  20% of my deadened intestines and colon within the first month.  Kratom has saved my life and allowed me to ail myself naturally and without side effects.  I can now get up everyday without pain or depression and get things done.  Before kratom I had nothing, and no energy to get the things I wamted because of the pain I was experiencing,  I now own a beautiful home, my own vehicle, have a beautiful fiance that I can now entertain and build with, we are getting married janurary 21 of 2017 and we plan on having 5 kids after the wedding!  I am finally happy and pain free in life, and am able to do the things I wouldve just dreamed about before kratom, without being tied to a dangerous synthetic chemicals or medications my whole life.  Please keep kratom legal, it is and will save millions of people.

Those that continued to attempt to better their lives found out about kratom through one way or another, and finally they had succeeded. I saw it with two uncles who fought in Vietnam, got hooked on morphine and barbiturates which turned into heroin. And this was plain and simple terrifying to see as a young adult let alone as a child. \n\nThen there is my mother, who has some so much for me, sand sacrificed so much and I love her so much. Several years ago she had worsening depression and anxiety where everything from Paxil, to lexapro, to Zoloft in conjunction with Xanax, klonopin, ambien, and more. This did not help and I believe made things worse. This killed me to see. The person I loved so much having to live with these terrible mental conditions was too much for me. I found kratom. I pleaded with my mom that she give it a try especially given its history of use throughout human history, the benign nature let alone it's benign nature relative to all these other medications. She relented after a 5-10 minute conversation. From that day forward she is depression/anxiety free, insomnia free. I can't express to you how ecstatic I was to see this. \n\nPlease don't take this away from everyone that it has been a miracle for. There is no public safety issue whatsoever. There will be if if is scheduled and I am truly terrified. How do we have cigarettes, alcohol, prescriptions handed out like candy being all fine and somehow kratom is the public safety issue. This is simply wrong and I the only reason for this that I can come up with is pursuit of the interests of some segment of the pharmaceutical industry. How can this be done with such little scientific study/cost benefit analysis, meetings with people who have found this miracle.\n\nMyself and so many in similar situations are very frightened and baffled.

If not for kratom I would be completely disabled, sitting around high on one of your regulated pain medications.  Instead I work a physical job and can have a normal life with my family by taking kratom to deal with this issue.  I was taking percocet for this, but I was getting addicted to it, I wasn't able to work, and it was destroying my life and family.  You don't ban insulin needles because heroin addicts use them, or ban spoons because they use them.  Kratom itself is not dangerous, and is mostly used by responsible people who have conditions beyond their control and would like to live normally.  It's funny because at the same time you're trying to ban this, many states are legalizing marijuana and making safe places for people to use heroin.  I guess our wonderful government would rather have another person on disability and addicted to opiates instead.  If people are going to take kratom mixed with something, they are just going to take something else to get high.  They had to illegally obtain one of the drugs they mixed with kratom.  I'm sorry, I have sympathy for Dr Fox, but his son wanted to get high and would've found a way to do it.  I'm curious how many lives are destroyed like mine almost was because a doctor prescribed a regulated pain medication for long term use.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7082","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my name is Kahlib abdehamid, and I wanted to let you know that I have ptsd, I have severe back pain and, i found kratom about 6yrs ago from a friend of mines and also doing research to help me with my problems that I deal with on a daily basis.

I have taken prescription opioid pain medications for most of those 18 years. I developed a dependence on prescription opioids. I don't think I was addicted because I didn't take larger and larger doses to get high, I was taking it to relieve pain and did not increase the dose without the physicians OK. But I did develop a dependence, which anyone who takes opioids regularly would. I also ran into tolerance issues where the opioids stop working as well as they once did. Because of these issues I started trying to wean off of the opioids. It didn't go very well, it was very difficult. I heard about kratom, ordered some and tried some. I immediately lost most of the craving that you get for opioids, this effect seems to remain even after the kratom has worn off. I have heard others say this happened to them too. Kratom needs to be studied for this craving reducing effect. If it is put into Schedule 1 the studies won't happen. I was able to wean myself off of opioids with the help of kratom. I am opioid free now and I only use kratom when my pain is really bad. Kratom does work pretty well for pain relief. It does cause dependence though if you take it every day for a long period, and it does causes withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it after taking it for a long period, although the withdrawal is nothing near the terrible withdrawal from opioids. I only take kratom every few days at the most to avoid dependence. I could probably go without kratom but it sure is nice to have it available when I need some relief. The clinic I was going to recently decided they will no longer prescribe opioids for chronic pain because of the pressure being put on them and the physicians to not prescribe opioids. All the other clinics and most physicians here have done the same. I don't think this is the right way to treat chronic pain patients, but it is how things are right now. So I could no longer get a prescription for opioids if I wanted to. Personally, I would never resort to using heroin to relieve my pain because it is just too dangerous, but other people will use it. Making kratom illegal would just make the heroin problem worse. I think this is a big flaw in the approach currently being taken, making substances illegal and/or unavailable, it just pushes people with chronic pain or pain pill addictions to use heroin, because it is the only thing they can get their hands on. With heroin the strength is unknown, especially with fentanyl and carfentanyl being added to it lately. And that is why people overdose on it, people don't know how much to take from one batch to another. I believe kratom is keeping a lot of people off of heroin. I think kratom should be regulated for purity and strength, but making kratom a scheduled controlled substance would be a mistake.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1317","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gregory Lyon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not place kratom as a schedule I drug.

It does not cloud the mind.  I read, do math, have intelligent conversations (that I remember) all while consuming Kratom. I suffered a severe clinical depression 25 years ago when my husband walked out on me and our two young children. It nearly killed me. I am certain if I had known about and had access to Kratom then, I would NOT have suffered such a deep depression and developed a life-time dependence on SSRI antidepressants and anti-anxiety prescription medicine. There are ample reports that Kratom helps people wean themselves from heroin and other opiates. I can show you the science (BTW, I am a neuroscientist with an emphasis in psychopharmacology). I take Kratom very responsibility for anxiety and depression and would be seeking alternatives if it became unavailable.\n\nThe report of 15 deaths with Kratom detected in the system have been each refuted that Kratom was a contributor. Besides -- 15 deaths in 3 years?  More have been killed by lightening, sharks or gator shark attacks.  Compare that to almost 50,000 deaths in opiate ODs each year in the US.  I'll show you a woman in Australia who died of an \"overdose\" of Coca Cola (she was severely malnourished too).\n\nThe DEA has lost a lot of credibility over the past 4 decades. This kind of nonsense gives the impression that it is massively over-reaching its mission and making a power grab.  Kratom is far less harmful than cannabis, which we are currently doing a giant public health experiment with.  In both cases, though, making these drugs \"Class 1\", along with heroin, runs a chill down the academic communities, who are in the best position to do pre-clinical and clinical trials to determine safety and efficacy.

For a while I pondered on whether my comment on this issue would have any affect. Then I thought about what my life would be like, if I were not able to take Kratom. \n\nPrior to finding Kratom, I was shy, uncomfortable, withheld, and withdrawn from my life the majority of the time. I went to the doctor and tried two different anti-depressants, but all they did was make me feel worse.. like I didn't know who I was anymore. Being desperate, I researched natural remedies for anxiety/depression, and I stumbled upon a Forum where people were discussing the effects of Kratom. At first, I was skeptical. \n\nThe first time I tried Kratom, it was like the world was lifted off my shoulders. Being a mother of two young children, and a full-time accountant - life can be a little overwhelming and almost seem impossible to get through at times. \n\nIt's been two years since that day. And I thank God all the time that he led me to find this miracle plant. \n\nI understand that ANYTHING that makes you feel better, can be addicting. And I admit, that life would be hard without Kratom. But not once have I feared the efffects Kratom has had on me. I never feel impaired, or out of control of my actions. Matter of fact, I speak publicly like I've been doing it all my life. Kratom really has saved me, my mom, my grandma, and my sister.  - My mom was a drug addict/alcoholic, and my grandma drank Vodka all day long.. Until I finally convinced them to try some of my miracle herb. \"Green Stuff\" like my grandma says.. lol \n\nWe all have our problems.. Kratom somehow finds a way to help ease the pain. \n\nThank you for your time. I hope my story reaches someone that needs it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20793","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jacey Brightwell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Dawn Marie Gerhardt..2/8/1956..At 60 yrs of age I'm a 3 times a day kratom user..Kratom has changed my life..I suffer from arthritis..I've had 3 total joint replacements in the past 15 yrs..I had no choice but use pain medication for most of my adult life due to chronic pain..4 yrs ago I discovered KRATOM!

I was diagnosed with a progressive idiopathic disease in 2003. One of the main symptoms of this disease is chronic headaches. Said headaches are not relieved by most pharmaceuticals. Opiates are usually the only option when treating the pain associated with this disease. As a result of chronic pain, I have developed depression and anxiety.  \n\nFollowing the addition of the herbal supplement Kratom to my diet, I have noticed a decrease in my pain, a reduction in my anxiety level and an improvement in my overall well being. I do not feel drugged or loopy while utilizing Kratom; nor do I notice other side effects normally associated with opiates. When I do not include Kratom in my diet, I do not experience withdrawal symptoms. \n\nAlthough my experience is purely anecdotal, there are hundreds, if not thousands of American citizens who share my story. Like me, these people strongly oppose banning Kratom, thereby making it illegal for us to continue reaping Kratom's benefits. Also, rescheduling Kratom as a Schedule I drug, will make researching and studying this amazing herb, all but impossible. \n\nFinally, in order for a substance to be considered a Schedule I drug, it must meet the criteria: a) a high potential for abuse; b) no medicinal value; and c) dangerous for human consumption. The thousands of personal stories told by the majority of commenters herein, make it obvious that Kratom is beneficial to many peoples' health and is either not habit forming or is no more addictive than caffeine. Since there has only been 15 deaths associated with Kratom in the United States and in 14 of those cases there were multiple drugs found in the deceased person's system, it must be concluded there is little to no risk associated with Kratom usage.\n\nIn conclusion, due to my personal experience, along with all available evidence pertaining to Kratom -- it's usages, benefits, extremely low potential for abuse, and doubtful dangers -- I strongly oppose the scheduling of Kratom.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18968","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lisa M","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My nephew has Chrons disease and has had over 6 surgeries.

I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease (ankylosing spondylitis), and I've chosen to avoid pharmaceuticals, because they are too powerful and unnatural, causing depression, grogginess, lethargy and dependence, to name just a few of the various unpleasant side effects. It is also prohibitively expensive and goes against my desire to live as naturally as possible. NSAIDS increase inflammation and can exacerbate autoimmune disease symptoms. I found kratom after researching for countless hours on the internet for natural, viable, safe, and legal options for pain relief. It is very important to me to follow the law, and to have pain relief without sacrificing mental clarity. Before I found kratom, on days the pain was too great to function, I would just lie on the floor with a heating pad and stretch my back as much as possible. Sometimes all I do is pray for relief and hope the next day won't be as bad. I exercise when possible and stick to a strict autoimmune protocol diet that helps keep inflammation to a minimum. I drink kratom tea in small doses 3 or 4 times a week. Usually the pain is worse when the air pressure changes, and during the winter. Alternatives like marijuana and kava actually make my back pain worse, and I can't stand the heavy, disorienting side effects. The only thing that helps ease my pain while allowing me to maintain mental clarity and a humble quality of life is kratom. I entreat you: please do not take away the one thing that allows me to live a (relatively) normal life. To make this herb a schedule I drug is wrong, and I suspect it has more to do with maintaining dependence on the pharmaceutical drug industry than anything else. We should continue to study the potential uses for this amazing herb. Kratom is much less dangerous and addictive when compared to pharmaceutical drugs that provide similar levels of pain relief. Please do not take away my ability to live a life worth living. Thank you for your time, and I hope you consider the many benefits this herb provides to those of us who feel grateful enough to be able to purchase and enjoy kratom for the myriad of benefits it provides.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3820","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adrianne Armstrong","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe kratom is very useful in treatment of pain and those who suffer from withdrawals due opiates and pain meds.

I used to take nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen to treat back pain with success, but eventually had to stop due to bleeding problems caused by the NSAIDs.  I didn't have many options left for treating my pain and started looking at natural alternatives. After doing some research I decided to try kratom. After experimenting with different strains and doses I found that kratom offered a decent reduction in my pain levels.  \n\nAbout a year ago I experienced stomach pain and diarrhea following Thanksgiving dinner. This persisted for entire month and a half before finally subsiding. I visited my doctor and was told I might have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  I did some research and found that many sufferers had food triggers that caused the symptoms of IBS. My diet was not the best at the time and after cutting out foods one by one I discovered that the consumption of gluten containing foods seemed to be the main catalyst for my symptoms. Since this time my diet has improved significantly and for the most part I have remained symptom free. Every now and then I accidentally consume a food item that does contain gluten, and when that happens I am happy that I have kratom handy. When I take kratom after one of these episodes the duration of pain and diarrhea is significantly lessened.\n\nAccording to a scientific journal article titled \"Traditional and non-traditional uses of Mitragynine (Kratom): A survey of the literature.\" by Singh et al. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27178014) the people of Eastern Asia have been using kratom for a long time and have found it to have good remedial value. It would be disastrous if kratom research became difficult to conduct which is exactly what will happen if the above chemicals are placed into schedule 1. Another article titled \"Inhibitory effects of kratom leaf extract (Mitragyna speciosa Korth.) on the rat gastrointestinal tract\" by Somsmorn et al. (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874107006083) describes an experiment conducted on rats that shows that kratom has a slowing effect on the transit of material through the intestine. I believe more experiments like this are needed to determine how kratom can best be used in western society.\n\nOne example of a scientist that is already taking steps to understand the chemicals contained within kratom can be found in this article by Angus Chen(http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/without-kratom-promising-research-opioid-alternatives-may-suffer/). According to Angus Chen, the scientist Susruta Majumdar and his team of researchers have been researching mitragynine pseudoindoxyl which is a mu-opioid receptor agonist and a delta-opioid receptor antagonist. According to Majumdar, antagonism of the delta-opioid receptor can mitigate withdrawal symptoms of morphine in mice. This means that this chemical could be a potential tool for helping opiate addicts through withdrawal symptoms when they are trying to quit. Mitragynine Pseudoindoxyl is produced from fermented kratom leaves which means that if mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are placed in schedule 1, this research will have to halt. I believe that this research must continue.\n\nI strongly urge the DEA to reconsider it's intention to place mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine in schedule 1. This decision will make it very difficult for scientists to conduct the much needed research on this plant.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAnonymous","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22977","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"ANONYMOUS","postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Kary Blanes. I am commenting in regards to Docket No. DEA-442W (Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine). I am a 34 year old woman with 3 children. I have a degree and work professionally as a Forensic Accountant. I found out about Kratom approximately 2 years ago. I have a long history of health issues that include Neuropathy, Levoscoliosis, 8 herniated, bulging discs that are in both my neck and back, a hemangioma (spinal tumor), Degenerative Joint Disease in my spine, carpal tunnel in both wrists and Osteoarthritis in full spine among other medical ailments that create severe chronic pain. I used to go to many doctors including pain management. With each appointment, I was usually prescribed a new medication to add to my already large arsenal of medications. Most of the medications I was prescribed did not work due to a Genetic Mutation (MTHFR C667T gene that is heterozygous (single mutation)) that doesn't allow my body to methylate medications, vitamins, minerals, etc. If the prescribed medications did work, they only worked for a short amount of time before not working or even helping any more. Eventually, I was addicted to 19 different medications that were all prescribed, that did nothing to even help the pain I was in. Taking those 19 different prescribed medications each day as prescribed, meant I was taking 63 total pills each day and 1,890 every single month if the month has 30 days. That is 1,953 pills for the months that have 31 days. I became unproductive due to the severity of the pain, had severe anxiety and couldn't even walk out of my home because of the condition I was in while addicted to so many legal, prescribed medications. I woke up one morning tired of being in a doctor induced zombie state. I quit taking every single prescribed medication against the doctor's orders. I was either going to get better and deal with my chronic conditions naturally or I was going to die from detoxing from the 19 different poisons the doctors lied to me about when telling me the prescriptions were going to relieve some of the pain and symptoms. I lived through the horrendous withdrawals. It took me more than a year to even want to touch anything natural to ease the pain because of how awful the withdrawals from the prescriptions were. When I finally started looking into natural remedies, I found a miracle plant called Mitragyna Speciosa or the Kratom tree. I can function as a normal citizen again. I can take my children out to amusement parks, take them shopping for hours on end, sit on the floor and read books and play with them again. All Thanks to a natural, unadultered Kratom. I have been utilizing kratom for almost 2 years now and it STILL helps! It eases my chronic pain so I can be productive. I can take care of my children, my home, my pets and I can work again! My genetic mutation does not stop kratom from working like it does with prescribed medications. Without this miracle plant, I would have zero relief and would be an addict running to the pharmacy to make sure I don't run out of pills. I would not be able to enjoy life with my children. I would be bed bound again and I refused to continue living that way before, why should I be forced to go back to living that way? I will not go back to that life. Mitragyna Speciosa in its unadultered form is truly a God send for me and thousands of other people who also have chronic conditions. Please don't take it away and take away my children's mother from them. You will be sentencing thousands of people to a life of misery and pain if this natural plant is unnecessarily scheduled next to Heroin. I personally have zero side effects from Kratom besides relief and constipation once in awhile. Thank You for your time and attention to this matter.

When I first contracted a severe case of tendonitis in my right hand the  pain and discomfort and weakness were  so unbearable that I could not even hold a fork to feed myself or a glass of water to drink from. This naturally threw me into a very dark period of depression in which I used prescription opiates to deal with the pain and discomfort of my afflictions. But my half-brothers opiate addiction has shown me a first-hand account of the destructiveness of these substances on the people who use them and everyone around them and I was dead set on not becoming physically dependent or addicted on prescription opioid painkillers. I was lucky enough to do some research and find out about the herb Kratom which has been used naturally for thousands of years with no signs of significant side effects or any accounts of deaths attributed to its use.  Kratom certainly can have some side effects and a mild discontinuation syndrome similar to coffee but the benefits on the quality of lives of the people who have been able to use this herb far outweigh any abuse potential that this could present as demonstrated by the millenia of safe use in Thai traditional folk medicine. Kratom literally saved me from a life of physical dependence and possible outright addiction and even though this is just one anecdotal story among many others, Kratom and its alkaloids need to remain available to study in order to create new and promising compounds to treat anxiety, depression and opioid dependence. Scheduling Kratom and its alkaloids would completely ban any Research into this class of drugs which is proving to be the most promising treatments for opiate addiction and maintenance programs as well as a far less dangerous and addictive alternative to traditional opioid medication. Making kratom illegal would be devastating to the quality of lives of the large population of the u.s. that utilize kratom to treat their pain depression anxiety and other disorders in order to help them live a full and functional life as well as the hundreds of millions if not billions of people who would stand to benefit from the research and subsequent development of compounds derived from the Kratom plant and its alkaloids. This plant has helped me more than I could ever express and it unequivocally deserves the research that could eluminate its potential therapeutic effects. I trust that you will consider our voices when making your decision and understand that the people who benefit from this plant and its alkaloids are no different from yourselves. We simply desire to live our lives to the fullest we can, but know we can't do that if we are enslaved to powerful pharmaceutical drugs.

Please allow any prcesss of regulation of Kratom,  to go only through State Congresses and/or Federal Congress, as our representatives are who we voted solely to make laws, and personally I've always thought that freedom of choice and free market capitalism is what makes America great,   Kratom is a naturally growing leaf, like lettuce spinach ect,  and in supplement form it is still an all natural leaf,  there are no chemical additives like with \"street drugs\".   The Founding Fathers did not use words like \"ban\" and \"not allowed\" in the Constitution, because they didn't even think in those terms,  as they knew that every man and woman is responsible enough to make the knowledgeable choice about anything that any American uses, or puts in there body.     It's just too much of a slippery slope, if the Kratom leaf gets banned,  which leaf is next lettuce?   Then no more salads?      Unlike many medications with many terrible side effects,  I've never experienced a single side effect from taking a Kratom supplement,  simply put,  they help manage pain,  and a lot better than ibuprofen does, and without the liver damage ibuprofen causes.      I ask simply that since the dea is taxpayer funded,  that as a taxpayer, you simply take this into consideration,  and remember,  targeting dangerous street drugs with dangerous chemicals added to them is definetly something the dea should target to keep off our streets,  however all natural  leaves that have grown on our planet for millions of years and is a safe natural way to manage pain,  is not something that should be barred, at least for a million more years!!   \n\nThanks!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9844","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello...

I have been to several doctors over the years to find some relief mainly for my crippling social anxiety, and horrific panic attacks associated with my anxiety. I have been prescribed many medications in the past including but not limited to, buspar or buspirone, paxil, hydroxizine, and eventually clonazepam. All of these medications did little to nothing for me, and the ones that did give me some relief did not even closely outweigh the long list of bizarre and uncomfortable side effects I had to live with. It was truely a nightmare for me, and I started to loose hope that I would ever live a normal life, that is until I heard about kratom. I barely passed high school due to my extreme anxiety although I felt like I should be making straight A's. I have been taking kratom for 2 years and ever since I started supplementing with kratom it has turned my life around! I am currently married and about to have a daughter with my beautiful wife, I make good money as a brick mason and moving up rapidly in the company I work for. For the first time in my life I am living mostly anxiety free, completley depression free, and have more motivation and drive I have ever experience. Kratom has been a godsend to me and I know it had been for many many more suffering from the same or related illnesses. I just ask that you please consider that this plant is extremley helpful and for some the only relief.

I have had personal experience with it and believe it is quite dangerous.  Perhaps not Schedule 1 dangerous... but that being said I also do not believe Marijuana should be Schedule 1 and I know that Kratom is significantly more dangerous and physically addicting.  People need to know what they're getting into if they start using it for recreation.\n\nI was introduced to it at the Kavasutra Kava Bar in Denver.  The euphoric feeling I got the first time was intense.  I enjoyed it very much.  I went back again a few weeks later and again had an intensely pleasant experience and could not believe it was legal.  I decided to do some research and most of what I stumbled across online were websites and articles by Kratom advocates... many of which described it as all-natural and perfectly harmless.  That's also when I discovered there were shops around Denver where I could buy it for use at home much cheaper than at the bar.\n\nWhen I started using it on my own was when things got bad.  At first I was using it in the evenings or on the weekends.  In addition to the feeling of euphoria, I also learned that it had an effect similar to that of Adderol.  Over the next month I was finding it more and more difficult to concentrate on work (I would not use it during work hours).  Knowing at the time it's legal and thinking it harmless, I was not really paying attention to the fact that I was gradually using it more frequently.\n\nQuick disclaimer:  I am a 30yo sales professional working from a home office and I have a prescription for Vyvanse (for adult ADD) and Citalopram (for depression and general anxiety).  However, for the past 10 years my anxiety and depression have been completely under control until this experience.\n\nWhen I was starting to wonder during the work day whether my Vyvanse had lost it's effect, I made a desperate attempt to meet a proposal deadline by taking Kratom to see if I could get my mind focused again.  It worked!  Or at least it felt like it worked.  Looking back I don't think I was as productive as I felt but certainly more productive than when I had not taken Kratom... so I started leaning on it more heavily for work.\n\nIn addition to my inability to focus during work when I had not taken Kratom, I also started to notice increasing levels of melancholy day after day.  Over time, it turned into increasingly intense and constant depression.  I began worrying that my Citalopram was also losing its effect.  \n\nBy this time I had also started dating someone who knew I liked using Kratom and she started getting into it as well.  Shortly thereafter she started experiencing similar symptoms.  She mentioned to her psychiatrist she was using it and (according to her) he about flipped out and started listing off all of the risks and dangers associated with it that have yet to be sufficiently studied and even less sufficiently reported or published in ways that it would be easily accessible to people curious about it.  When she stopped using it, she went through about 1 week of withdrawal.\n\nTurns out we had both unwittingly (yet surprisingly quickly) developed a physical dependence on kratom.  When I found out about this, I stopped cold turkey.  The problem was that I had been using it months longer than she had, probably more frequently and certainly in higher doses (I don't know if it makes a difference but I am 6'-5\" and 240 lbs).  That's when my withdrawal began.\n\nWithdrawal from kratom is absolute shitty hell.  The first two days were pretty much just elevated anxiety and a persistent, inexplicable gloomy sadness.  That quickly spiraled into an intense, unrelenting depression and anxiety levels like I've never experienced.  Then came the insomnia.  Then came Restless Leg Syndrome (I always thought that was invented by the pharmaceutical industry but learned it is for real and it's miserable).  Then came the headaches and the stomach pain.  It also goes without saying that my ability to concentrate on anything was gone and all I could do was lay on the couch or in my bed wishing I were dead.  I was not suicidal but, based on my experience, I believe withdrawal from kratom would be enough to push many people to a suicidal state if they didn't find out kratom was the source of the problem.\n\nThe worst of the withdrawal lasted almost 2 weeks.  After that, I still was not myself again until probably a month and a half later.  I told my doctor what was going on once I had hit rock bottom and he added Wellbutrin to my regimen to assist me through.  I made it through and will NEVER touch the stuff again... and I am someone who enjoys alcohol and recreational marijuana.\n\nKratom is extremely addictive and I think vendors should at least be required to inform consumers that they can easily develop a physical dependence once they start using it.  There are too many people out there saying it's harmless and it most certainly is not.\n\nThanks!     \n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0093","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alex Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Avnish Bangar\nI am in full support of keeping Kratom legal\nThanks","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13372","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Avnish Bangar","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Vignesh Sekar and I am a recent college graduate.

Kratom has been used by the peoples in East Asia for hundreds of years, and we have hundreds of thousands of anecdotal reports which support the relative safety of this plant. I personally use Kratom to help my Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Manic Depressive Disorder (MDD). It provides me a boost of energy and greatly improves my mood in the evenings -- like a more pleasant cup of coffee.\n\nI have been using this plant almost daily for 4 months. I have taken breaks here and there when I have noticed diminishing effects due to tolerance buildup. I have also never upped my dosage continuously to chase the high. I have received only benefits from Kratom's use. To categorize it as a substance with no medicinal value is a travesty and completely against the public's wishes, not to mention the fear-mongering is akin to the Reefer Madness of the last century. \n\nDo I need Kratom? No. Does it help with my conditions? Absolutely. However, there are those in the Kratom community who depend on it for its pain-killing effects due to chronic physical conditions, and weening off harder opiates like Heroin and Morphine. \n\nI urge you to reconsider your stance on Kratom and instead take steps in studying its pharmacology. In addition, a regulated market for Kratom similar to Cannabis would prevent less scrupulous vendors from spiking their product with extracts and synthetic opiods like O-Desmethyltramadol (found in 'Krypton').\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7877","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Vignesh Sekar","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me cope with anxiety, tiredness, pain, and even allergies.

This is a mild wonderful pain killer with absolutely NO side effects. Don't believe me, do the science homework. Look the plant up study the wonderful things this plant does.  Cannabis has the possibility of having a side effect if it is heated and used by either smoking it or cooking it. Kratom is normally taken in a pill form and is used to squash pain, or get off poisonous addictive  prescription drugs, or dangerous pimped street drugs. This plant allows pain suffers to get off toxic prescribed addictive pain killers and lead a normal productive life going to work and paying their bills. \n\nThe world is moving away from all this government control and corporate interest in making a lot of dollars for the powers to be who own the corporations in drugs.  The prisons need to be emptied as well over these healing plant crimes. The prisons should be full of criminals that rape, murder, steal. How about locking up some evil bankers? what about prosecuting crime families that use their money to kill, or start wars for oil, or illegally continue to build pipe lines when ordered to stop. \n\nWill the people in the DEA be part of the movement for good health for your families and friends, If you want to save your children and your families and friends, you need to embrace plants. I would instead, buy the plant, raise it, and help people. WHY do you want to harm people???? why???\n\nWhen the earth changes culminate in a pole shift, plants will be the only medicinal available for the population to fight infections and fight pain. Plants are being studied everywhere, because the human population is waking up to the future earth changes and preparing to care for themselves without a government power over them. Will the men and women in DEA follow along and learn what will be needed to survive the future events, or will the DEA do the wrong thing and try to take a safe healthy plant that is harmless away from the people that need it?  Then I know the rest.. you will profit on jailing the innocent when this plant, just like cannabis, is harmless. Please, please do your homework and stop this process. go after the real drug dealers. Prosecute Big Pharma for killing children with vaccines, and or ruining their lives.

Kratom has had an overwhelmingly positive effect on my life. I would like to give you a small insight on some of the areas it has helped me in. I am a current student that is taking 17 units and just finished taking 19 units in the spring of 2016. I am enrolled in very tough classes that require very much time, that of which I have very little due to my recent promotion to full time at my job where I work the graveyard shift. This means for very busy weeks that I have, and along with all of this I workout just about every other day because I am an athlete and I love fitness, that is what I am studying right now in school.  Another challenge I struggle with is C5-C6 disc herniation in my cervical spine that occurred from all my years of wrestling and football. This can be a very challenging injury since I have already had surgery on it once and do not want to have another surgery soon. The doctors prescribe me with high doses of pain killers to help ease the pain which bring on a whole host of side effects. This is one of the areas of my life Kratom has been life changing for it only results in the relief of pain which leaves me with an extremely enthusiastic state which in return helps me With the very busy schedule that I have. \nI also can use Kratom simply for a slight energy boost rather than multiple cups of coffee which most of my fellow classmates and coworkers do. They end up becoming addicted to it and needing more and more, which I dont with Kratom. In this area is where kratom and began to create major success in my life. Since discovering Kratom I am able to make it through those rough days where I have multiple tests stacked up. I never feel as though I need to have Kratom, it is simply just an extra boost that helps with my energy. With the help of Kratom I have been able to achieve straight As across the board in all my classes, I have been able to make extra money working longer hours at my job, also receiving many awards such as employee of the month. I have had extra motivation and time to spend towards my future which is to open my own gym which I am currently working on. I feel that enough has been said about me to get you to understand the benefits that Kratom has and could potentially have with millions of others. Just understand how big of an impact this would have if the Kratom Ban went through and I can assure that there are many others that feel this same way about Kratom. So I just urge you to take all considerations with an open mind about Kratom and please make an educated decision about the ban. My opinion is that Kratom should be readily available for competent adults to use for the multitude of benefits it brings them.\n\n-Kyle","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6447","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyle Barnett","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nMy name is Jonathan Mintle, I'm 27 and work as Quality Control Manager for a laboratory in central Florida. I am writing to voice my opposition to the DEA's plan to place Kratom and it's active constituents mitragynine 7-hydroxymitragynine, two constituents of the kratom plant, schedule 1 controlled substances. \n\nThis would put kratom -- a plant consumed safely in the U.S for decades and world-wide for millennia, and one that helps millions of people -- on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. The DEA scheduling would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown the primary alkaloids in kratom to be beneficial without causing respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose. \n\nI should start my story by mentioning that my father died from complications due to addiction from prescription pain medication, medication that he had a legitimate prescription for. So I have seen first hand how harmful prescription opiates can be, I have also experienced their dangers myself. I first started using Kratom about 2 years ago when I suffered a work injury that completely shattered my right knee. A large piece of faulty equipment struck my leg and incapacitated me for 6 months. I had a 7 inch plate and 13 screws implanted in my right knee. \n\nWhen the injury first happened I was forced to take pharmaceutical pain medication as it was a severe break and I was screaming out in pain. The relief from pain was effective, but the side effects were severe: nausea, constipation, profuse sweating, agitation and anger, intense sedation and even hair loss. And during my time of absolute NEED for these pills that I was legally prescribed by my surgeon: I grew dependent on them or the rebound pain I felt without them for a few days was horrible.\n\nThe worst part of this though, is where I nearly died in the hospital 2 days after my surgery. I was being given intravenous Dilaudid/hydromorphone and my breathing became so shallow that the doctors had to inject me with Narcan/naloxone, which is what is given to heroin users who overdose. I woke up immediately in agony, my back feeling like it was being snapped in 2, profusely sweating while simultaneously shivering and feeling all the pain in my leg from the lack of medication in my system. My first sight was my fianc and mother standing in front of me sobbing, watching me approach death and hoping that the doctors would be able to save me. \n\nNeedless to say, this harrowing experience scared me so bad that I immediately started looking for alternatives. I found Kratom/mitragyna speciosa after extensive research online. I read hundreds of personal testimonies how it has helped opiate addicts cope with withdrawals and has helped people with everything from pain relief to depression to anxiety to low energy. Considering the fact that I have been prescribed Xanax for anxiety, Adderall for ADHD, all types of pills for depression and pain, I decided the simple leaf from a tree couldn't be any more harmful and it has changed my life.\n\nI no longer take any sort of medication for pain, anxiety, depression or ADHD and instead opt for a few teaspoons of Kratom leaf every day. The side effects are negligible compared to the flurry of problems I experienced with pharmaceuticals, the main one being that I cannot have more than a single light beer when I consume any kratom at all. I get a guaranteed hangover the next day if the two are combined. I would say that's a deterrent enough, but when I take kratom I don't have the desire to drink or get a buzz in any way. It puts me in a good mood, gets rid of my pain, cures any anxiety I have and gives me the same energy that a cup of coffee gives me but without getting me jittery.\n\nI believe that this miracle plant has a place in our great American society but that it should be respected. I propose legislation that monitors the sale of kratom and prevents sale to minors, but a complete ban and scheduling it Schedule 1 would make hundreds of thousands of Americans felons and would put a huge halt on any research being done on it. More thought needs to be put into scheduling Kratom and its active constituents on the Scheduled substances list as this plant without a doubt has valuable and numerous medicinal and therapeutic uses.\n\nPlease keep this amazing plant off the Scheduled Substances list and available for all autonomous adults.\n\n\nGratefully,\n\nJonathan Mintle","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21482","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathan Mintle","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used Kratom in a variety of ways that have improved my quality of life, but by far the most impact has been on my academic performance.

I am a 42yo Healthcare IT developer from Iowa.  I adamantly oppose the DEA's plan to put Kratom, a natural herb that has been used for hundreds if not thousands of years in Eastern medicine, as a Schedule 1 controlled substance.  There has been no proven research that Kratom is an addictive substance and in fact research in Israel showed that Kratom was an excellent means of helping people with severe opiate addiction get off  opiates completely and safely.  I completely support  doing more research into all the pluses and minuses of this herb and all herbs! \n\nFor me personally, I have been a chronic pain patient since I was 12yo with Endometriosis and Interstitial Cystitis for the 1st 20 years and then Fibromyalgia diagnosis in 2004.  I had taken every anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, and narcotic that there is and the side effects were HORRIBLE and my symptoms just continue to get worse to the point that I missed so much work that I ended exhausting all my FMLA level and lost my job. A few months after that I found Kratom and I haven't felt this good in decades. Soon after my Mom and Sister, who also have Fibro and other conditions,  tried it will similar results. My sister is Bipolar and since she started taking Kratom, she has been able to lead a much more normal life having both her pain levels and mental state improved. The best part of all of this is there are no side effects from this all natural herb.  It is the only thing that has ever helped with the mental fogginess, poor concentration and continual exhaustion that have plagued all 3 of us thanks to Fibro. \n\nKratom has been a godsend to my family by giving our children back active and happy parents. At the very least more research is needed to explore all of the possible benefits that this substance has to offer.  What if this herb can cure Multiple Sclerosis or Cancer?  \n\nPLEASE do not classify Kratom as a Schedule 1 Controlled Substances when there is no evidence that this natural herb is anything harmful at all. This herb has given me my joy back and I do not want to go back to the days of being in so much pain and depression that I was essentially confined to bed.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8158","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stacy Pickering","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban kratom, which is a lifesaver for those struggling with opiod addiction.

I've tried a myriad of prescriptions over the years that didn't offer substantial help. In the past, anti-depressants made me feel detached and sometimes suicidal. Anti-anxiety medicine made me feel like a zombie. I elected to wean myself off of these prescriptions over a long period of time; I'd rather feel down and anxious than overmedicated. I recently discovered Kratom. Surprisingly, with this natural plant, I feel like myself again. I feel like I can be a better and more productive Me within society. I've searched high and low for a non-prescriptive option for my annoying conditions and I finally found it, only to discover that it might be taken away from me by being labeled as a Schedule I drug. I hope that this rash decision will be looked at more closely and, ultimately, reversed.\nPlease don't take this wonderful plant away from many who genuinely use it to better themselves and manage the conditions they live with on a day-to-day basis.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5082","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephanie Childs","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"With having back issues since 8th grade pretty much is ruining my life now.

I was in a car accident that hurt my back extremely bad. I was told I had 3 herniated discs in my lumbar as well as a pinched sciatic nerve. It was also then that I was informed at the age of 21 that I also have degenerative disc disease. This news was incredibly tough to take because I have always been an athletic person and love to be active. The doctors prescribed me Hydrocodone, Percocet, and Tramadol over the course of my treatment. I was constantly nauseous and it eventually made me start to depend on these pills, and they were making my life extremely difficult. I was tipped on to Kratom by a friend who also suffered horrible lower back pain from a similar incident. This plant literally gave me the ability to work again without having terrible pain. It also made it so I didn't have to deal with the nausea often associated with prescription pain killers. I also found myself not being dependent on it like I was with the Tramadol.  This gave me my life back. I am back at the gym getting myself healthy again. I couldn't go to the gym on all those strong prescription painkillers. Kratom gave me the ability to get on with daily life without the extreme side effects of most prescription painkillers. I might also add that being a full time student, the prescription painkillers made it incredibly difficult to get schoolwork accomplished, but using Kratom instead as my solution to back pain on the days it's at its worst, I've been able to maintain a 3.83 GPA in my courses and am near graduation. Kratom literally made it so I could accomplish this. I would most likely be stuck at home in horrible pain if it wouldn't be for Kratom. Please consider this comment and keep Kratom legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18193","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is not a danger to the public.

I am not one of the many people that have used Kratom to get off of opiates, or one of those that use it as a natural, non processed aid with physical pain. I am, however, an individual that has suffered from depression my whole life. I never wanted to take medication that might alter my natural creativity or much worse make me dependent on a drug. Many of the medications to combat depression create more problems than they help. I have a brother and a cousin that both committed suicide while on anti depressants. \n\nKratom for me is a highly effective means of combating depression. I am able to use Kratom when needed to manage heavy emotions when they arise. I take a minimal dose of 1-1.5 teaspoons as needed maybe 1-3 times a week. I am energized and motivated once the effects kick in. Instead of slipping into a deep depression, as I may have years ago in these moments, a little Kratom is the difference between getting hopeful and motivated or spiraling into a potentially suicidal episode that could last for weeks. This small dose is beautifully motivating and energizing. My focus is increased and I am very productive.\n\nI recommend Kratom to anyone suffering from depression, but I do caution that, like anything, you want to be careful not to overuse. \n\nKratom is a natural unprocessed medicinal plant. Like any medicinal plant people should be informed of recommended doses and contraindications. This would help people use the plant more safely. \n\nIf Kratom were to be made illegal, it would be deeply disappointing to a person like myself that uses it responsibly and with extraordinary benefit to my life and productivity. It deserves more research not to be locked away from the public. Alcohol, tobacco, prescription meds are dangerous far more so than this plant that has the power to be so beneficial to mental health and wellness for people like myself.\n\nThank you for your time and efforts,\nNailah Heckerman","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18765","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nailah Heckerman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I understand the motivation to assign Kratom as a schedule 1 substance. After all it is a substance that has been associated with death. However the key word here is associated. Quoting from the DEA site, \"DEA is aware of 15 kratom-related deaths between 2014 and 2016\". However the DEA also note that 14  of which also involved other potentially lethal drugs. Therefore     , further investigation is needed to understand the true dangers of the substance. Yet for there to be be studies done on the substance, the agency should wait to assign Kratom as schedule 1. I worry about the public's reaction if the agency does not be patient. Since there are far more deaths from alcohol and cancer from cigarettes than the 15 from 2014 to 2016, the public would not understand why Kratom would be banned whereas alcohol and cigarettes are not. Time and research is needed to understand the true nature of the substances and what benefits/dangers it carries. Before that is done, I recommend the agency warn the public about the potential dangers of the substance but wait on the scheduling.

I am writing you to ask you to please not put the Alkaloids found in Kratom on the Schedule 1 List of Drugs.. Kratom is not a Drug.. It is a completely natural plant that God gave us with very Beneficial Poeperties. I have a lot of friends that used to be Addicted to Opiates and other Drugs, and the only thing that has helped them break the chains of Addiction and live Happy, Healthy and Productive Lives is Kratom. I Believe in the Declaration of Independence which states that all men are \"Endowed by their Creator with certain Unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness!\" The Heavy Drug Epidemic in this Country us ruining countless lives and claiming the lives of so many! I believe that as we have a Right given to us by God (Which means no man or government shall interfere with that) to Live Happy, Healthy and Productive Lives, and Kratom is a Miracle Plant given to us by God that can help people that have been held in Bondage by the Chains of Major Drugs to Break those Chains and become Productive Members of Society that can make something of their Lives! This in turn leads to Families staying United, more Creativity and Innovation in our Country and it benefits the Government because a Productive Member of Society pays more in Taxes and is less of a Burden on the Government that a Homeless person strung out on drugs.. This would also lead to less Crime as Major Drugs tend to be a Major Factor in a lot or Crimes! Just put yourself in the shoes of somebody that has a Loved one whose Life is in Shambles because of Major Drugs or is in Major Pain from an Illness.. Wouldn't you want that Loved One to have a Natural Alternative that could help them with their Pain and get their Life back on Track? \n\nA Buzzword among most of Society today is Progress. We are constantly talking about how we want Progress and a Better Future. With another well known plant, Cannabis, starting to be Legalized all over the country, it doesn't make much sense to make an even less harmless Plant the most Illegal a Substance can be. In my Opinion that is going Backwards and Regressing.. Prohibition of Alcohol didn't work in the early 20th Century and the War on Drugs and Prohibition of other Drugs has never worked either. If anything it has made it worse! When Prohibition is in Effect, People will still find ways to get what they want, only it is all Black Market which means no Regulation which makes it much more Dangerous. We already have a Major Problem in our Country with our Prison System and it being too Full. It Wouldn't make much sense to cause that much more of a Burden on the Government and System by making something else Highly Illegal to where people would go to Prison just for trying to Improve their Lives with a Plant! With so much Progress going on Today, it doesn't make much sense to go Backwards. \n\nWith Tobacco and Alcohol, two of the most Dangerous Drugs and Biggest Killers in our Country, wouldn't it make more sense to spend Time and Resources fixing those Problems and making something like Cigarettes Illegal vs going after a Harmless Plant that has never Harmed anyone, much less Killed anyone, that only Improves the Quality of Life for Thousands of not Millions of People and has been for Thousands of Years? \n\nI really hope you take this seriously and hear people out! If Kratom becomes Illegal when you have the power in your hands right now to stop and prevent that, then you will have to live with your Conscience knowing that thousands of Lives will be Ruined as People won't have a good Natural alternative to keep them off of Hard Drugs and little Kids having to live without their Parents because they either died of a Hard Drug Overdose or are in Prison for being in Possession of a Leaf off of a Tree. \n\nThank You for Your Time and for Hearing Me Out!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20099","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jamie Horton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 50 year old Disabled Veteran.

A leaf that is related to the coffee plant. It is about as powerful as coffee, but without the addictive qualities of caffeine. I have read erroneous stories about withdrawal, and addiction etc. but I can tell you that stories like that do not come from people who are using plain Kratom leaf. I have used Kratom medicinally for over 5 years, to combat depression and anxiety. Much like a person using caffeine as an alertness aide, I am using this natural leaf to take the edge off of my anxiety. It does not cure my anxiety, or remove it completely, however it does provide relief. Kratom provides the kind of relief you would expect from a natural plant used medicinally. Occasional recreational use, I can see that. I can see wanting to grab that sense of well-being that it can provide. A mild, often undetectable in some, sense of general well-being is all this plant has the capability to provide. It does have analgesic properties, and falls into the same category as using oatmeal on a sunburn. It is a natural home remedy, that provides relief to sufferers of pain and anxiety with no addictive qualities, no behavior changes, and no side effects. Again, the stories about such things are not from users of this plain leaf. It simply does not have those qualities, or capabilities and the science that is surely to come will bear that out. As a person who has relied on this leaf for the past 5+ years I can tell you straight out that there is no addictive property beyond that of a mental one, similar to chewing gum when one is nervous. It does not withdraw, and it is not necessary to increase the quantity endlessly chasing a 'high.' This is just not that kind of leaf. It is not something people smoke, it is well known that the plant is most effective when ingested. People are not shooting it in their veins. Kratom does not cause car crashes, or violence. For the life of me I cannot imagine how an effort to ban this leaf has gotten this far. People are selling all kinds of harmful things on the internet, but to ban a harmless substance in an effort to curb the misdeeds of online scammers is not a viable solution. Spend your time going after people selling things that are not what they say it is, by all means. People mix all kinds of things together and create something dangerous but we don't ban the whole recipe. This effort to ban Kratom represents a needless infliction of pain on people who find relief from this leaf. An effort to create more prisoners, perhaps? Whatever the goal is here, it is not public safety. Nobody has ever died from JUST kratom - period, full stop. It is nonsense to try and convince the public otherwise, and again, science will bring to light the true capabilities of this plant and it will be easy to see that this effort to ban Kratom is about something other than safety. People can use this plant to ween off of dangerous opiates, people can use this to REPLACE opiates in many cases. Clearly in the midst of an opiate epidemic in this country, anything that is effective at alleviating that should be distributed freely, not made illegal. As for making this plant a schedule I substance, there is obviously no justification for that, just as there was no reason to make marijuana schedule I. This is the same type of effort, and it is easy to see. I am making my statement anonymously, because I don't trust that I won't be targeted if the DEA/Big Pharma plan succeeds and possession of this harmless leaf becomes subject to a federal prison sentence. This leaf is competition to the opiates peddled by big pharma and that is the only reason it is even being considered for a ban. That is plain for all to see.  People use this leaf to get off of, or stay away from opiates and so in the interest of public safety this ban should be taken off the table completely. Please do not ban this beneficial, harmless leaf.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9640","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"At one point my doctor sent me to a pain clinic and they had me on 3 morphine pills a day then they decided because I had one piece of cartilage left in my knee that I didn't qualify for the morphine and I should just go back to switching between Vicodin and Percocet.

Aside from the fact the Kratom is safe for use - I worked directly with the FDA on Challenge.gov to help solve the opiod epidemic. My personal experience & research can easily conclude that Kratom helps opiate users wean off opiates. Currently, the only \"doctor recommended\" way to taper off of opiates is to get on long-term Buprenorphine Treatment or Methadone. Though these CAN be used to taper off opiates, the doctors prescribing them  are telling patients they have an opiate addiction and will be on maintenance therapy for the rest of their lives. This costs on average $300 a visit to the doctor and $300-$500 for the prescription. Considering opiate addicts, who buy drugs illegally, generally aren't in the position to pay that money or afford thousands at a detox clinic, their only option is Kratom. Banning Kratom is GAURANTEED to do several things; Create an illegal drug market, make the opiod epidemic exponentially worse, death-by-opiate by opiate users in withdrawal taking an accidentally high dose will increase, another beneficial plant with medicinal qualities will be scheduled incorrectly. \n\nWe just legalized marijuana in many states which is still a schedule 1 drug. The irony here is ridiculous. Now, opiate users who are trying to use a natural method with Kratom to quit opiates could be potential victims to harsh laws. The harmless marijuana users in jail will soon be replaced by Kratom users. \n\nRemember this one thing. Nobody wants to be an addict. Sometimes surgeries, accidents, and life events cause a user to require pain-killers (which Kratom does greatly). Using traditional pain killers will inevitably lead to addiction. What options does the victim of becoming an addict have? I'll never forget how terrible I felt after stopping pain meds I was on for 1 month for knee surgery - I learned this was withdrawal from low-dose hydrocodone. I can only image how people being discontinued from more potent pain killers feel in withdrawal - now, knowing they may not have ANY options but to just be an addict forever and do anything possible to get their fix (to stop the pain of withdrawal).","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20483","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adrian Turika","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This ban is going to allow the black market to regulate kratom which has helped so many people including myself.

I myself have fibromyalgia, a disease which keeps me in significant pain most days. It is through the patient community that I learned of Kratom, as a medicine that can be used to alleviate the symptoms of this illness, and many other illnesses in which chronic pain and depression are a component.\n\nIt is sad to me to think that, if this law is passed, many Americans could be taken out of their homes, away from their families, and thrown in jail. And for what ill against society are they guilty? Of trying to treat their pain and depression with a plant God gave us. That to me goes against the very idea of individual freedom upon which is said to be a founding principle of the United States. Not to mention it's just plain, ethically, wrong.\n\nA better solution would be to invest in regulation and mental health resources.\nIf people really have a health problem, the answer is NOT to discard them by throwing them in jail and out of society.\nNo, the answer is to help them. This should be obvious!\n\nThe proposed move would certainly do more harm than good. It could put many patients back into great suffering from which they have received some relief from due to this plant's medicinal properties. It could drive people to seek out pharmaceutical opioids. While that's great for pharmaceutical companies' profits, these drugs are known to be FAR, FAR more dangerous than Kratom! This is a known fact and has even been stated clearly by ruling government agency heads. And worst of all, this move would lead to government agents spending their time arresting sick people. How sick is that!? Not to mention the taxpayer dollars that will be spent arresting these people, handling their court cases and putting them through the justice system, and then keeping them in jail, and perhaps paying for parole services after jail. What a waste. I don't want my taxpayer money spent in that way.\n\nI'd rather our taxes be spent investing in resources to help people who are suffering, rather than trying to punish them further. The war on drugs has done far too much damage to the lives of individuals and communities. Enough is enough. \n\nOh, and don't forget the many people who have used Kratom to get off an addiction to pharmaceutical opioids. That means they are actually improving their overall health, by lowering their total risk. Is this not a good thing? Well, if you are invested in a pharmaceutical company which is losing sales revenue from opioids it might not be, but for actual people who are struggling to live well each day, it can make all the difference in the world.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2617","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Cole","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is known that mitragynine causes no deaths, and helps with pain.\n\nWe have many soliders coming home from the war that use this to alleviate their pain.

As a healthcare provider, I have seen every type of individual come into my pharmacy. I have patients who are honest, who lie, and ones who don't know what they are getting into when they start taking prescription painkillers. In the month of October I had 5 patients come ask me what is the best thing for withdrawals from Oxycodone and related medications because they took to much of their Rx and the MD wouldn't up the dose or kicked them out of their program. It hurts me to seem them like that, even if they, themselves, got into that situation. I know Kratom would help them immensely  \n\nAs for me, I have been in the field of pharmacy for 3 years now and I stand for 8+ hours a day. I don't get breaks, I don't get to sit down, and I am constantly running around. I found Kratom because the pain in my legs became something out of a horror movie. I would wake up in the middle of the night with horrible shin splints and aches that would cause me to tear up. During my longer shifts (12-14 hours) you can most likely see me on video wincing and moving my legs around as much as possible. I have very little experience with prescription painkillers. One time for wisdom teeth and another when I had a testicle infection and taking those pills made me weird so I at least have something to compare to. \n\nI have taken Kratom everyday now for 2.5 years and I have yet to have a side effect beyond nausea. That nausea was brought upon when I accidentally took a Tbs instead of a tsp. It lasted for 1 hour and was not fun but compared to the nausea I have gotten from binge drinking in college, it was a walk in the park. I can honestly say that I never felt like I was getting away with anything when I take Kratom. It was a part of my routine and involved, for me, complete relief from any leg pains after a long day at work. I should also note I have only used one reputable company for the product and it has never been an issue. \n\nOverall, banning this product would be a very bad idea. It has potential to be something that a lot of people can take advantage of if they are considering alternative therapies. As a pharmacist, I would never put something in my body that could hurt me, pharmacodynamically. I understand the mechanism of action, its potential side effects and drug interactions so for me, it was a no-brainer to try it. I have immense success with Kratom and with two and a half years of usage under my belt and no side effects worse then nausea I can say it works for me. Of course we need to study it and make sure it isn't dangerous in unknown populations.

Like cannabis, there is no credible proof that anyone has ever died or been injured as a result of using Kratom. However there has been many cases where people's lives have been drastically improved by using these substances.

I am not a drug addict and never have been. I began using Kratom approximately 10 years ago. I suffered from anxiety and mild depression. Once I found Kratom I was able to push aside the anxiety and depression completely making my daily life much more enjoyable. I had tried a number of different prescription depression medications such as Zoloft and Lexapro. I hated everything about them, I felt like a zombie with no emotions so I stopped taking them and started drinking Kratom tea. I don't have any strange side effects while taking kratom and I can't possibly see how someone could become addicted to it. In my opinion it is like any other supplement a person would use daily after realizing their benefits such as protein shakes, green tea, multi-vitamins, fish oil pills, etc. Just because I use it daily doesn't mean I couldn't stop easily which I have done multiple times over the years just to ensure this. I can also attest to the pain relieving properties of this herb. Approximately 2 years ago I was in a accident that left me with broken ribs, a broken nose and  fractured cheek bone. I received the pain medication prescribed by my doctor and after taking it for 2 days I realized it was having no effect, it made my skin itch and made me irritable. I had also stopped taking kratom at the time to ensure there would be no interaction with the medication. I quit taking the pain medication and started drinking my tea again and immediately the pain was not only tolerable but almost non existent. I can definitely see how the pain relieving properties of Kratom could prove beneficial against taking what are known to be highly addictive pain medications. I have talked to my doctor about Kratom tea and have actually done blood work to make sure my body was not suffering any ill effects from the herb. Aside from the earthy bitter taste of the tea I have yet to encounter any negative mental or physical issues from it. If kratom were to become illegal I would obviously stop using it but I ask that the comments provided by fellow users be taken seriously and considered thoroughly before classifying this very safe herb as an elicit drug. I want to thank you for taking the time to read and allowing me to share my story with you. Thank you and make it a great day.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4522","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Aaron Mote","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Pain is a way of life for the 100 million+ chronic pain sufferers in America and with the growing dependency on prescription opioids for pain, addiction rates continue to skyrocket. I am both a chronic pain sufferer and a recovered opiate addict. Yes, I say recovered, because I truly believe I will never struggle with addiction to opiates again, thanks to Kratom. \n\nEven with the problems and dangers of prescription pain medicines aside, OTC pain medications can be harmful and deadly, too. Acetaminophen (generic for Tylenol) is responsible for well over 56,000 emergency room visits a year and countless deaths. So people want better, safer alternatives with few or no side effects that work to help relieve pain by giving a general overall sense of health and well-being. All without having to take a handful of pills every few hours or adjusting daily life to accommodate heavy side effects.\n\nI found Kratom after spending nearly a decade sick and scared, in and out of doctors offices identifying and attempting to treat, my late stage Lyme Disease. Countless appointments with specialists, led to countless prescriptions (mostly heavy painkillers), little relief, and turned me into a person I didnt recognize. Here I was in my mid-thirties, when all my friends were marrying and having kids, a once successful non-profit campaign director with a masters degree, a once accomplished hiker and mountaineer, now bedridden and zombie-like, relying on my parents to care for me.\n\nI became addicted to opiates and was willing to try just about anything to help me when someone in my Lyme Disease support group led me to Kratom. I started taking Kratom daily over 2.5 years ago --in the form of dried, powdered leaves in tea and dietary supplements -- and it started giving me my life back.\n\nThe FDA and DEA would have you believe Kratom is a new street drug causing an epidemic of fatalities (when there have been none tied directly to Kratom world-wide since it does not cause respiratory depression) with no medical use in the U.S., Yet Kratom  leaves have a long history of safe, medicinal use (all the way back to the 1830's). \n\nThere has been a small problem with \"adulterated\" Kratom products around the world; a problem that does need to be addressed and can be done so by regulating Kratom as any other dietary supplement is regulated, requiring tests for consumer safety.  Responsible  Kratom consumers do not support these adulterated Kratom concoctions or the deceptive marketing techniques being used to sell them. Further, safe, responsible users believe Kratom should be regulated for minors, similar to how  tobacco is.\n\nIf you discovered someone adulterating chamomile tea (or any of the hundreds of herbal plant teas used by many generations for a variety of medicinal needs) and marketing it as a way to feel high, would you prohibit the sale of all chamomile products? No, youd go after the people doing it. Rather than make Kratom a scheduled substance, turning approximately 3 to 5 million consumers into felons, why not go after the people, the criminals who are turning the natural Kratom plant that's providing millions of Americans with safe, natural relief into something dangerous? \n\nThis lack of understanding and recognition of this significant distinction (the Kratom plant, vs. adulterated Kratom products) has led to regulatory efforts by misguided, but well intentioned legislators in several states.\n\nIt's my mission and the mission of the American Kratom Association, a non-profit organization that represents the majority of the 3-5 million Kratom consumers in the U.S.  who use teas and products with the natural Kratom plant responsibly, to bring out the facts and the science about the Kratom plant. Rather tthan try to do that myself here, several scientists and our law firm will provide these to you during this public comment period. \n\nKratom consumers are nurses, teachers, construction workers, police officers, lawyers, chefs, moms and dads who have found a natural way help alleviate the symptoms of many chronic conditions like pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, and my very own Lyme disease. Its returned us to jobs and families and to life itself. It is by no means a treatment or a cure, but it provides us with a general sense of health and well-being that allows us to be productive members of society. \n\nI urge you to consider all of the facts before taking action to prohibit responsible Kratom use and research into a plant that could help the opiate epidemic.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1132","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Susan Ash","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Adam and I am a 38 year-old resident of Montgomery County PA.

IWas prescribed some of the strongest pain killing narcotics known to man. I recovered at an astounding speed that Dr's still cannot explain. I suffered pain every day and could not return to the work force because of my pain and because of the strong pain medication I was forced to live on. The medication made me very zombie like and I had a hard time functioning as a family member let alone an employee because of the side effects. \n    Through a friend I learned about kratom and the pain releaving properties kratom has. I was very skeptical at first and couldn't understand how a plant could do all the things my friend promised without the debilitating effects that my medication suffered me through. I was at a loss.... I couldn't live with the pain and I couldn't live with the mmedication.I felt a life doomed to disability paychecks an inactivity. \n     Then I tried kratom and have never once taken my pain medication again. I live virtually pain free and DO NOT walk around n a zombie state of mind do to awful side affects. I work 40 hers a week and do not collect disability checks. I pay my taxes, go to the store, help friends move furniture, and lead an active life with my son and family..... All do to kratom.

That said, Kratom will work best for most opioid addicts and chronic pain patients and if it had been illegal in December of 2014 I wouldn't be alive. The first time I used Kratom was the first time I saw a way out of my addiction, a way to deal with my horrible anxiety disorder without having to be high out of my mind to do it. I eventually learned Buprenorphine is better for what I needed than Kratom was, but I can't imagine how I'd have ever figured that out without a non-toxic, all natural treatment that was easy to find. Kratom is saving more lives everyday and giving hope to those who haven't had any for years. With the rising costs of health-care, a cheap and effective option that doesn't get you high and can't kill you seems like a miracle in my mind as someone who's worked with geriatric patients (and even some who used Kratom). Banning this plant, with the knowledge we have in the year 2016, would be the greatest sin the DEA or FDA ever committed. People who know pharmacology know this plant can't kill you, and know it is much less addictive than any of the other options. This plant will keep American people out of jail, keep them in the workforce, save on government entitlement programs and give everyone a natural option. I literally see no negative at all in keeping Kratom legal, I see dozens with prohibition. Please, choose to do the right thing.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1450","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Mann","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA,\n\n I commend you for having the good sense to restrain your urge to ban Kratom long enough to get some actual feedback before doing so. As the public overwhelmingly supports keeping the stuff legal please think for a moment that the consequences of banning it might just be far worst than any supposed harm it has causes. Please are going to use drugs. That is a fact of human nature and you can't change it. But you can give them less harmful drugs to choose from (Kratom vs. \nHeroin) and reliable information about the dose and potency that will allow one to achieve the effect they are seeking without forcing then to play Russian roulette with some garbage spiked with fentanyl. Forcing people to use unregulated drugs because there are no decent legal alternatives is what causes people to overdose and die. Surely you understand this. The War on (some) Drugs is a cynical farce that has done more damage and ruined more lives that straight drug-use ever has. And you are the ones who have the choice to stop it cold, even tho your bottom line depends on it. Please don't be a coward and drop the ball just to line your pockets. Let kratom be.

My goal in writing this is to compel you to understand how important kratom has been in my life over the past year and how detrimental a change in scheduling could be to myself and many others throughout our country. I was diagnosed with bone cancer in my right leg in March 2004 and underwent nearly a year of chemotherapy and a limb salvage surgery, which had some complications. I have significant nerve damage and chronic pain, along with many more long term effects of my treatment. Dont get me wrong, I am very grateful to be alive but the pain and long term effects of cancer treatment dont go away. Over the years I have had to depend on opioids to live a normal life, even though they themselves caused a lot of long term side effects! Earlier this year, my pain management physician explained that the DEA was making it even harder for her to continue prescribing opioids to me even though I truly needed them to be a thriving, successful member of society and go to work. I cant explain how difficult it is to have a chronic invisible illness. It became apparent to me that I needed to explore other pain management options quickly and thats when I learned about the benefits of kratom. I did so much research and read everything I could about it and figured I might as well try. Well I have to say Im so happy I did because kratom has kept my pain level under control and I have no taken opioids since March 2016! Please remember I took opioids on a daily basis for years to be able to function. Kratom does not have any scary side effects, like opioids do! There are just so many benefits to this plant that its hard for me to explain them all. My main goal is for you to understand that chronic pain is a very debilitating disease and when I wasnt being treated I was very depressed and had some suicidal thoughts because I didnt want to live my life in so much pain. Kratom is a plant and been used for hundreds of years and it has helped so many people, please dont take that away from us. There is absolutely no reason why kratom should be scheduled, especially in the same category as heroin! It is insulting to me that someone would compare my kratom use to heroin use. Please dont make a rash decision that will take away the medicinal research being done on kratom, from everything I have read I truly believe kratom shows great promise in the medical field and will help many people in the future! \nThank you in advance for your time,\nAshley","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8092","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ashley Fancher","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16561","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Donna Thelander","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a great alternative for pain relief and relaxation.

I am expressing my opinions regarding the DEA's decision to classify Kratom as a Schedule I drug. I take kratom daily to help with several health issues and my life would be negatively affected if this happened. I am 30 years old and developed arthritis in my back in my early 20s. Because of this I developed an addiction to prescription pain pills. My life revolved around them and I could not stop no matter how hard I tried. Because of this I put myself into a methadone matienence program. The $400 monthly out of pocket cost for the program quickly became too much of a financial burden for my husband and myself to handle with 2 small children to care for. In addition to the financial costs, I was having nasty side effects from consuming such a large quantity of methadone daily. I detoxed out of the program, and even doing a taper the withdrawal symptoms left me unable to function. I came to close to relapsing back to my prescription pain pills from my back pain reemerging and the crippling withdrawal symptoms. After a desperate Google search I became educated on kratom. I cant begin to describe to you how amazing that day . The plant as like a beacon of light to me in an entirely dark world. It took away my withdrawal symptoms and by back no longer hurt! This is something narcotic pain pills had only been able to do in the past. There are also no side effects like with prescription drugs. The cost is something my family can afford. True kratom does not give a buzz or a  high feeling. The most Ive ever felt from kratom is a coffee like burst of energy and improved mood because my pain is gone. I have also suffered from depression and anxiety since my teenage years. I had been on strong medications to treat this off and on throughout the years, also with side effects. Since finding kratom I have not had to resort back to those medications. In addition to kratom&apos;s pain relieving properties, it significantly improved my anxiety and depression. I do take kratom daily, bc of the dramatic improvement on my life it has made. With kratom I have been able to discontinue several strong medications with known side effects, including death in certain cases, with a natural alternative that has no side effects. I am an educated person. I graduated magna cum laude and have a degree in Medical assisting. I have obtained certifications in Medical Coding and Billing, EKG, and Phlebotomy. I can hold a job now, and be a functional memeber of society. In getting up and gling to worm daily. Something I was not able to do before. I&apos;m going to be honest. Im scared. Im scared that if the DEA follows through with there intent to classify Kratom as a Schedule 1 I will have to return to use of prescription pain pills again. I dont want to live that addict lifestyle anymore. I am on a good path, and I am happy. There are hundreds of thousands of I the testimonies out there just like mine. Please dont take our right away to choose a natural alternative to prescription medications. Kratom has made such a significant improvement our lives. Please, please dont take this away from us. We should be allowed to choose a nstural alternative. Your not just taking out plant away, if some cases your taking our jobs, our families, or our ability to get out and function. Your taking our freedom away by removing our access to Kratom. Please reconsider.

I know it may not seem like a big deal to you, but it's a huge deal for me. I have a disease called Ankylosing Spondylitis. It's a seronegative autoimmune spondyloarthropathic disease that makes your joints (primarily the spinal joints) become inflamed pretty much constantly, which eventually can cause the growth of excess bone and random fusions. I have been afflicted by this disease in some form or another since I was around 13 years old; I am now going on 36. I've had 21 spinal procedures, some of which were fusions to break and correctly reset the fusions the spine did on its own. I've tried to hide how much it has progressed but it's gotten to the point that I really can't anymore. The past few years have marked a sharp decline in my mobility and my quality of life in general. Part of my sternum is fused in place now by the disease, making breathing sometimes difficult and painful. Two of my bottom ribs in the back have fused together, which also doesn't help with the breathing thing and twisting around in certain positions is literally impossible. Over the past few years I've had increasing degeneration in pretty much every major large joint (hips, knees, shoulders, etc.) that is incredibly painful - painful as in I don't even know how to tell people the type of pain I deal with on a daily basis - and it doesn't stop. The hip involvement sometimes incapacitates me - I spend days on end more or less bedridden (luckily I work from home) and miserable. This past year the disease has kicked itself into overdrive - I've been suffering compression fractures in my spine, the discs in my jaw (I didn't even know you HAD discs in your jaw!!) have become involved making it difficult to open my mouth to speak or eat. At a random benign eye doctor appointment to get new glasses it was discovered that the disease has also affected my eyes with a fun round of Keratitis Sicca and Uveitis. I've tried very hard to hide the pain, but it came to a culmination during a series of steroid injections in my spine earlier this year - one of the compression fractures became super inflamed (you know, the *opposite* of what was supposed to happen) and made pretty much any type of movement excruciating. I've been through well over 2 decades of pain management, physical therapy, surgeries, experimental treatments, meds, compounds, biologic medications, holistic treatments, reiki, yoga - you name it, I've likely tried it, and it likely either failed or it is an opiate or a narcotic which is near impossible to have an enduring prescription of where I live. In an hour of desperation I was reading one of the AS support group message boards I frequent when the subject of Kratom came up. The more I read, the more I was convinced these people were insane. I was in so much pain, I was bordering suicide just to stop it. I was at the point that I couldn't take the pain anymore - so I figured \"Hey, might as well make one last attempt before I throw myself in front of a train.\" I researched Kratom vendors to make sure they were legitimate and strains of the plant, selected a couple of little pouches of powdered leaves and ordered. When the pouches arrived I gulped down a teaspoonful and watched the clock. As the minutes ticked by I felt that I'd been had, then gradually I felt a calmness I hadn't known in ages. I bent down to pick something up off of the floor and realized... There was no pain. None. I started crying - full on sobbing. I didn't remember what it felt like to *not* be afraid of moving, of taking a breath... Of LIVING. I wasn't stoned and spacey like with MJ, I wasn't launched into the ether like with Percocet, I wasn't throwing up uncontrollably like with Vicodin. I could think clearly, I could move - I could FUNCTION. I played with different strains and dosages to find one that works for me, and I've slowly been learning how to live again. I had this life taken from me, and I never thought this could be my reality again. While I know this is in no way a cure, it has enabled me to function like a normal human being - something I haven't done in years. I went from crying in bed for days, watching endless TV, popping pills and getting painful spine injections to... now. I ran 2.8 miles Wednesday. Thursday I ran 2.5 miles.  Friday I hit a summit at 3.15 miles. I scrubbed my floors, did my dishes, built contraptions to keep cats out of the bookshelves, dusted all of the said book shelves and I have begun rearranging the bathroom - and that's just last week alone. So please - I know I'm only one case, but there are many, many people like me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15004","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kimberly Redden","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Keep this legal!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10724","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Glenn Bies","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helped my mother get her life back.

I just think that the more options which are available to people, the greater number of people can experience relief from their various symptoms, given that different people respond to different drugs in different ways. For example, I feel as though I could safely utilize marijuana in a medical context but I personally find the side effects too unpleasant  so I probably wouldn't go that route even if it were available to me, but I heard about Kratom and from the description it sounds like it could be a safe and effective treatment for my chronic pain. I appreciate this forum and hope that the decision would not be made lightly to criminalize Kratom until much more research can be done, because I've heard that once done this is very hard to undo.

Before I was introduced to Kratom, I lived in near constant pain.  I serve lower back disk degeneration, spina bifida that went undiagnosed until 2012, ankylosing spondylitis, arthritis and bone spur growths on my L3-L5 vertebrae as well as sacralization of my L5-S1 (this is where the bones fuse together over a long period of time).  For a really long time I was a lot of pain and no one could tell me what was wrong with me. Using the pain scale that is popular with doctors and hospitals I lived with a constant 5 pain level everyday, and that was AFTER taking more medication then I should have been taking.  I was told that it was weight related, that I needed to be more active, to take tylenol and ibuprofen - lemme tell ya nothing worked.  I was never allowed to actually take any sort of narcotics because I have a major depressive disorder and narcotics are like candy to people like.  They spin you up and get you really high without actually taking all of your pain away.  And...of course...I went through a period time where I was very resentful of people who could take narcos.  So jealous in fact that I started stealing my friends medication to take and got myself in a lot of trouble.  \nI sought rehab, went to group therapy and went back to taking aleve and motrin and praying that it would help the pain and nothing did.\n\nThen my friend told me about Kratom.  She helped me get my first couple of samples and I couldn't believe it.  It took a day or so to kick in but I woke up and had not pain for the first time since my early 20s.  I mean, like seriously 15 years.  I walked to take my bus, walked the mile to my job, pain free.  And the next day was the same.  And the next, and so on.  Now I don't know what I would do.  I really just can't see myself having to go back to being in as much pain as I was in.  There isn't a procedure that is going to help me, nor will physical therapy.  I've done physical therapy, I've looked into it all and I literally just have to live with it for the rest of my life.  If I don't have the ability to take Kratom to assist with my pain, my quality of life will be severely diminished.  I'm getting to point in my age and disease that I will have to start looking for some aids to help with walking long distances (which is something I do everyday since I have to take the bus and walk to get to work).  \nPlease, reconsider putting Kratom on the schedule.  Also consider removed Marijuana.  Nature was intended to help mankind.  Kratom helps so many people get off narcotics and heroin, it would be travesty in the face of the opioid epidemic to take away something that helps so many people avoid overdose and death and improves their quality of life.  \nThank you for considering this.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5254","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jasmine Gribble","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom holds great promise as a step-down from opioid addiction.

I am also the victim of a drunk driver. A drunk driver hit my car head-on at 45 MPH. As a result, i have long term severe chronic pain resulting from my injuries. For many years, I was prescribed strong opiates including a fentanyl patch supplemented by 6-12 norco per day. It struck me, while working closely with heroin and opiate addicts, that the same medications I was prescribed legitimately, were killing people. So, I took actions to taper off of these medications. I felt like a hypocrite using medications that were killing my clients. I took nothing but ibuprofen for nearly a year before I heard about Kratom. I was still experiencing severe pain, that ibuprofen only took the edge off of. I have been pleasantly surprised by the results. My pain has been under better control than when I was on the narcotics. However, I never feel high or 'out of it.' Kratom has been an immense help in coping with my medical issues. I also believe that I should be the person who decides what goes in to my body. I am well educated and don't feel that the government should decide for me, what I put in to my body.

I am one of millions of average Americans who go to work, pay taxes, and contribute to my community. I have also used Mitragynine, aka kratom, many times.\n\nA little less than a year ago, I damaged the sciatic nerve in my right leg. After developing a dependence on legally prescribed painkillers for a similar injury several years before, I had no desire to subject myself to the mind-numbing effects and subsequent withdrawal from them again. After searching for a possible route to alleviate the intense pain I was experiencing, I stumbled onto an online forum talking about kratom.\n\nDubious, I nevertheless decided to order a sample and see if it did what other users described. Imagine my surprise when after one dose I was finally able to sit without pain. I could make it through a day at work without having to get out of my chair and walk around every 15 minutes. I could drive without crying. For the next six months, while my leg healed, I continued to use kratom in order to help me get through each day. \n\nI bought some for my father, who has similar leg and back issues. Exactly as it had for me, it allowed him to continue to live his life with minimal interruption. It turned chronic, debilitating pain into something manageable. And, most importantly, we were both able to stop using it with no withdrawal effects whatsoever once the pain was gone.\n\nI understand the purpose of the DEA is to protect the American people from the harmful effects of illicit and illegal substances. However, before that happens, I would like to know that due diligence has been paid to determine what--if any--those are, and to ensure all the potentially helpful effects have been discovered as well. Without further study and classification of this family of plants, there is no call for putting something that helps millions of people into the same category as drugs that harm or even kill. Making kratom a schedule 1 substance before it can be properly studied and evaluated is not only irresponsible, it needlessly harms thousands of users in this country who use it responsibly. That is why I urge the DEA and the rest of the United States Government to reconsider scheduling these substances, and instead to pursue the action of study to determine what, if any, the short- and long-term effects might be, and then and only then to take action if necessary. \n\nThank you for reading my comment.

As I child I cried myself to sleep almost nightly and the many doctors I went to could only tell my parents I had \"growing pains\". At 16 I was started on Darvaset after no other medications helped the constant pain. I tried sports and dance hoping exercise could help, but I got injured too frequently and just could not keep up with the other kids. So, I used my time on schoolwork and learning graduated both high school and college with a 3.6 gpa earning a Bachelors Degree in Biology and then went back to get a second bachelors in Secondary Education. I became a high school Biology teacher got married, had a family, and went on to earn a 3.98 gpa in my Masters Degree Program in Environmental Education. I taught for 5 years but eventually had to leave my job because the pain was getting worse all the time and I could barely make it through the day and missed many days due to illness and complete and total exhaustion and fatigue. I am now a 35 year old woman with 3 children and just want to give my kids the best life that I can as a stay at home mother. Through the years I saw many different doctors and specialists and was diagnosed with many things, such as Lupus, Fibromyalgia, Degenerative Disc Disease, and more. My narcotic medication needs grew and grew until 5 years ago I was on the strongest fentanyl patch available and Nucynta as break through medication. My life was nothing but laying around feeling out of it. I was basically dead at 30 and my children were unable to enjoy so many things kids should because I was unable to leave the house most days. \n\nAfter 2 years of fentanyl, I couldn't take it anymore. I found out about Kratom after researching alternative therapies and herbs for pain control and decided to give it a try. It has given me my life back. I slowly got off of fentanyl and went down to a low dose Nucynta that lasts all day. I can play with my kids, do things with them outside of the house, go to the grocery store, and I can clean my house again without becoming completely drained! During the time period that I was getting myself off of fentynal I also saw a new doctor who sent me to the Genetic Diseases Department at The Cleveland Clinic with a hunch he knew what was wrong with me. After visiting with a geneticist and genetic testing I was finally diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, a genetic connective tissue disorder that is degenerative and at this time is only managed through symptom control. I know I will continue to get worse and will lose a lot of mobility, so I want to enjoy every minute I can. I now have braces to stabilize the joints in my hands, back, and ankles and have had 2 surgeries since my diagnosis, and will need more in the future. I still have bad days and my pain will never be completely gone, but Kratom has saved my life so I can live it and saved the memories my children will grow up with. I have never had any of the awful side effects I did when on all the prescriptions over the years, but I cannot stress enough that I have NEVER EVER experienced a \"high\" as I did with opiods, and cannot imagine Kratom could ever become an issue and abused for non-medicinal purposes. Please don't take away what could be a shinning light in helping chronic pain sufferers and a real hope for decreasing opiod use and fighting this epidemic. I know we need something to help fight against drug abuse and use for non medically necessary purposes, and I don't think it's fair to be punished for that abuse by losing Kratom, an amazing herbal remedy. I also hate having to jump through hoops to get my monthly prescription for the Nucynta I still take. I will need opiods to help me for the rest of my life and I hate seeing what this war on drugs is doing to all the real chronic pain sufferers. We have to be important too, and matter just as much as the abusers that are creating the problems! The last year has definitely made me feel like my government has chosen the abusers who don't follow the laws, over me and I have been left behind to struggle to be physically able to get my medications and am now constantly treated with suspicion.\n\nI fear what will happen to me. Without Kratom I'll be back to my life of not living due to heavy prescription narcotics, or be paralyzed from pain and fatigue. What choice is that? What kind of mother is that for my girls? I'm not a drug addict, I just want to be able to be close to normal and experience my life. Please fight for my family and fight for every pain sufferer like me who doesn't want to be high, just desperately wants to live! I have fought for so long for my life to matter, to be full of love and learning, and to give something back as much as possible. Now, I need someone to fight for me and to prove I am important, my suffering and pain is important, and my government supports me so I can live my best life even though I'm not a drug abuser, illegal user, or a criminal. Please hear me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0202","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kristin Perkins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I suffer from anxiety and depression for over 30 years.

I appreciate the DEA's willingness to reconsider its \"emergency\" classification of kratom, and this opportunity to share what kratom has done for my life.\n\nI was formally diagnosed with anxiety and depression eleven years ago, and social anxiety has dominated my personal and professional lives for as long as I can remember. It is not \"shyness,\" or necessarily even an indicator of introversion. It is a very specific reaction to social stimuli. For me, it manifestsreliably, almost every timeeither in loud, crowded rooms or at any time in which people (especially strangers) are raising their voices in my direction. My heart races, my voice doesn't work, and my flight instincts take over. Even after ten years as a practicing attorney, it can still strike anytime there are other people around, for nearly any reason.\n\nI spent the next eleven years after my diagnosis dedicating myself to a legal career, and the balance of that time building the solo law practice (now a three-attorney firm) which I still run today. On paper, my day-to-day sounds like a social anxiety nightmare: regular court appearances, lengthy client meetings, managing staff and attorneys, and spending far more time than I would prefer on the phone with strangers. And it can be, even for as much as I have learned to manage and mitigate the worst of it while getting results for hundreds of clients.\n\nKratom both stimulates and gently relaxes my mind and body in a very specific way which leaves me more engaged and attentive to the people around me. It helps me to let go of the constant internal battles which anxiety otherwise create for me so that I can truly be in the social moment in a way that I have never experienced before. (And not in the loose, fuzzy, careless way that drinkers or cannabis enthusiasts know, but with myself fully intact and operating with a near-perfect lucidity and precision of language.) In short, it does everything for me that prescription anxiety medication promises consumers with none of the side effectsup to and including physical and mental dependence. I routinely go three or four days without consuming kratom with no noticeable physical or mental side effects. \n\nI informed my doctor at my annual physical in October that I had started using moderate amounts of kratom to curb my anxiety. He certainly would have been within his rights to give me a stern warning about the dangers of buying exotic, unregulated powders from the Internet... but he just nodded. He told me that he had only just recently looked into it after a few patients had asked, but that from what he understood I was not taking any risks with my health so long as I continued to responsibly consume in moderation and without mixing it with other substances.\n\nAnd he was right. I have been in good health for the past year; no mystery ailments. I had a round of blood tests (including a liver checkup) done in October after a year of semi-regular kratom use and everything came back healthy.\n\nIf the DEA pushes forward with this historic mistake, I will lose something which has demonstrably improved my quality of life. But I lived without kratom for 35 years, and if it comes down to risking federal prison or finding other ways to cope with social anxiety I know that I can live without the additional benefits of kratom.\n\nFar more than for myself, I am concerned for those who have been able to manage chronic pain and overcome their opioid dependence with the help of this amazing plant. It is kratom's unavailability, and not its legality, which poses the real \"imminent threat to public safety.\" It deserves careful study and consideration. \n\nI read and studied the original Notice of Intent, and was frankly appalled both as a citizen and an attorney how poorly-sourced and conclusory it was. I remain convinced that kratom has never been the sole cause of death or disability for anyone, and I do not believe that it ever will be. If the DEA truly intends to take the extraordinary step of classifying kratom as a Schedule I substance, it must meet the equally extraordinary burden of proving that kratom actually meets this standard. I commend the DEA for withdrawing the NOI and permitting a period of public comment, and hope that it will act with similar thought and consideration as it considers next steps.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19427","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matt Cameron","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a blessing for people against opiates.

I have used kratom since 2010 on an as needed basis to help manage these problems associated with scoliosis. I was born with the condition and after having visited numerous doctors, the overwhelming consensus was to simple work around the condition, strengthen the surrounding muscles, and not have any type of surgery. Kratom has helped me successfully manage these issues and it has always been a mild, 100% controllable form of natural relief. I am perplexed by some of the news stories that have been linked to kratom and wonder if the journalists are even discussing the same product that I have used. In more than a half decade of taking this product, I have never once encountered any sign that indicates kratom is a dangerous substance much less something that merits a Schedule I classification. I absolutely agree that more research should be conducted but banning a product without understanding its full merits seems, at best, short sighted as our nation seeks meaningful solutions to the opioid epidemic and how we manage physical ailments.\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9864","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was very nervous to put a comment on here because I don't share my personal life with many people.

I strongly oppose the DEAs proposal for making the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine schedule 1 controlled substances.\nI started using Kratom 3 years ago and have not had a single health complication due to its use.  Please read below my personal journey as to why and how I started using this amazing plant.\nAs a child, I grew up in a violent and abusive household.  Being exposed to my fathers dealings of drugs and violence on a daily basis had caused me to suffer from post-traumatic stress and anxiety as an adult.  Before using Kratom, I would wake up in the middle of the night with severe panic attacks. Intense fear because of my anxiety would overwhelm me throughout the day for no reason which had affected life decisions, my marriage, and the ability to maintain relationships with co-workers, family, and friends.  At some point it became very apparent that changes needed to be made. I am not one to take prescription pills, or products that claim to be derived from natural sources as they are filled with many processed chemicals, so it was very important for me to find a product that was completely natural and had proven results. After tons of research and very careful consideration, I chose Kratom, and it has helped with not only coping with the effects of a trauma filled childhood, but also dealing with life issues.\nI am a father of 3 year old triplets, two boys and a girl, and a 1 year old daughter.  My triplets were born prematurely and had to spend 2 months in the NICU.  One of my sons had intraventricular hemorrhaging (bleeding on the brain) and my daughter has downs syndrome.  Two of my triplets have special needs, and receive multiple therapies on a daily bases, which can be overwhelming at times. Being a father of four under the age of three has many rewards, but undeniably has just as many challenges. My biggest gift to them is to be the best dad that I can be despite my personal obstacles. \nPlease take the necessary measures to preserve the integrity of this plants use and availability, so that there is continued scientific research to further develop its purpose.  More importantly, make sure it stays available for millions of people that are suffering from a variety of mental and/or physical illnesses as a truly natural non-addictive product that works!\nThank you for your time and consideration on this matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13226","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 40 year old professional, wife, and mother.

I am 48 years old.  I am the Director of Data Operations for an international digital content measurement and monetization company.  \n\nI oppose putting Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. Schedule 1 controlled substances are thought to have no medical use, which is not\nthe case with Kratom.  \n\nI have had chronic pain since my early 20's.  First with migraines, then with extremely painful menstrual cycles. Most recently, I have\nneuropathy in my leg and restless leg syndrome.  I also suffer from social anxiety.  My doctors have always treated my pain with opiates and\nmy anxiety with SSRIs.  I was at the point where I had a prescription for codeine, zoloft, xanax and gabapentin.  These have various side\neffects; nausea, weight gain, increased sweating, tremors, drowsiness, headaches, irritability, depression, and addiction.\n\nI was very tired of taking pills in the morning, lunch and evening just to make it through the day.  I wanted to improve my life, so I did some research into\nnaturopathic medicine.  During this research, I came across people who used Kratom.  A local store sold it so I spoke to them about their\nexperience with it and decided to try it.  The thing a like about Kratom is that it has many strains and can be used to treat various symptoms.\nI can take a small amount and have the same effect of drinking coffee.  If I use a different strain, it calms me and allows me to concentrate.\nI can take some to help me fall asleep at night without having a hang-over feeling that some sleep aides cause.  Most importantly, I can\nuse it as an analgesic. The best thing about it is not having to take an opiate. I no longer take so many pills just to stop pain that I make myself sick\nand cannot make it to work.\n\nWhen the company I purchase Kratom from announced the DEAs intention to put it on the Schedule 1 controlled substance list, my heart sank. All\nI could think of is having to go back to the opiates and anticonvulsant medication.  \n\nOpiate addition continues to grow in the US.  In 2014, 18,893 overdose deaths related to prescription pain relievers\n (www.asam.org/docs/default-source/advocacy/opioid-addiction-disease-facts-figures.pdf).  The DEA has stated there\nwere 15 Kratom-related deaths between 2014 and 2016. This statement is a bit misleading as there were many other factors that contributed\nto these deaths (www.snopes.com/kratom-banned-by-the-dea/).  \n\nI simply don't understand the DEAs position on placing Kratom on the Schedule 1 list.  The Kratom community is made up of people that simply want an \nalternative to prescription medication that has a less risk of addiction and adverse side-effects. \n\nThank you for your consideration.    \n\nTracey Kilpatrick","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14501","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tracey Kilpatrick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern,\n\nAs a sufferer of chronic back pain I have tried everything the doctors ordered to find relief including physical therapy, chiropractic adjustments, Massage, TENs therapy, and as a last resort prescription pain medication.

I believe it is unjust when comparing this product to already legal (and far more dangerous) substances like alcohol, tobacco, and opiates.\n\nI have served honorably with a 60% medical discharge from the United States Marine Corps Reserve after being diagnosed with an Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis).  I started taking kratom in October 2016, due to complications with refractory disease and years of looking for relief from associated chronic pain.  Kratom has provided me with relief from chronic intestinal pain in a way I haven't experienced while either in the hospital on opiates or from being prescribed different pain relievers (more opiates can I want to remember) from Pain Management Clinics here in town or from the local VA Medical Center.  It has done more for alleviating my depression than the majority of antidepressants I have tried, which to date is approximately 7.  To put this chemical, which is letting me live a normal life both physically and mentally, into Schedule 1 is a poor decision when you can, in good conscience, allow opiates and tobacco and alcohol to remain legal.  Think of the preventable body count that could be avoided by restricting those substances.  I believe there should be further clinical tests to search for any deleterious long-term effects, before a rash move to Kratom as a schedule 1 substance.  I have yet to experience any negative side effects from the small or medium doses I take when I'm experiencing increased pain from bloody bowel movements or active inflammation in my intestinal lining.  Kratom has quickly become a way for me to feel normal again, in a way that I couldn't maintain being on opiates or most antidepressants.  It has also prevented me from needing copious amounts of Tylenol (I cannot take ibuprofen or NSAIDs for my disease, which severely limits my options for pain relief) and doing long-term damage to my liver (I often take the maximum of 4,000mg a day).  I think it should remain legal and citizens should have the choice to partake in Kratom in the same way I can partake of any other legal substance that may or may not have negative side effects.  And again, as I have not experienced negative side effects, it baffles me that it is set for Schedule 1.  Please reconsider, there is good evidence that Kratom works for pain relief and relief from the torment of clinical severe depression.

I am in between jobs right now. I struggle with high functioning anxiety/depression, and PTSD. Before I found out about Kratom I was having horrible panic attacks 2- 3 times a day. I was sexually abused as a child and it went on til I was 19 years old by my grandfather. The abuse continued after by other members close to my family. I had horrible relationships and have always struggled with confidence. I am an overanalyzer. I learned how to ask one question 50 different ways so I would have to get stuck. Over time, this turned into anxiety/depression. I abused drugs when I was younger to get out of my mind. I didn't do it to party, I did it to find peace from feeling worthless and useless. Nobody ever stood up for me so I had to find my own way. I finally gave up on the drugs because they were to expensive and I was to honest to do dishonest things to get them. I tried going to counselors and even tried getting on anti- anxiety medicine but it never worked out. I couldnt afford it. So I just did the best I could. Fast forward, thru many failed jobs because my anxiety/depression I was left many times without a job and homeless living in my car. Ive thought about suicide but couldnt ever bring myself to do it. Because what if...what if things could get better?! A friend introduced me to kratom at my lowest time. I had just lost another job and was having 2- 3 panic attacks a day. I was at my bottom. A friend shared what she had and the first time I tried it I was amazed! It totally took my anxiety away that Ive had a lifelong struggle with. The first time in many years I felt normal and had peace. It allowed me to function again. Please do not take away Kratom! It's not a cure but it has enabled me to live and be happy for once in my life. If you take it away, I'm scared to think what might happen. I don't want to go back to the place I was at. Please! Do NOT ban kratom!! Thank you for your time.

I was bitten by many many ticks when I was 11 and 12 years old, during the time of some experimentation being done on mycoplasma germs about 30 miles away. I also coincidentally happen to have a very debilitating form of mycoplasma. I told doctors I was sick for many years after my body started to tell me it wasn't well, but they did not believe me. I got progressively worse as time went on, starting with neurological symptoms, progressing to nerve sensations and pain, and then overwhelming fatigue. I was told it was in my head, or that it was all due to depression. Some doctors told me I had growing pains when I was still fairly young, and others blamed it on lack of exercise. Why would they even say that, when the whole reason I was complaining is because I could not do the things I used to do?\n\nI used to run close to five minute miles, but now I'm lucky if I can even make it upright for five minutes on my really bad and fatiguing days. Running and doing other active things outside was sort of my downfall. If I had stayed inside leading an inactive lifestyle, I wouldn't have had nearly as many chances to get bitten by ticks. I started to lose faith and trust in all doctors, since they kept ignoring me when I told them I was sick, and as all the medical professionals I saw gaslighted me into that belief, I eventually believed I was imagining it all, that it really was in my head, so I gave up for a long time. Certain things helped me over the years, and other things seemed to help, but also caused me other problems (alcohol for example). I am surprised I lived through this, and that I continue to be as strong as I am. I might just be lucky, since it hasn't yet attacked the places where it can with others, causing death within months to a few years.\n\nI have over twenty various conditions, most chronic and some fully systemic. Some I can slow progression by taking supplements and other things, and most have no permanent cures. Some will take constant medication, and some can be prevented to a degree, or at least masked to some extent. There have been times where I've taken over 60 pills a day. It's very hard to live like this, and when I was healthy, I never imagined a person could feel this way, even on my worst days, or in my worst nightmares.\n\nWhen somebody asks me what it is like, I explain that it is like a constant flu most of the time, but instead of being able to sleep through it as a sick person would, and having it go away in a few days, it never ends. On top of that, I have to perform and function in life while I have the flu, unlike the people that get a lot of rest. They get better. I cannot rest twenty-four hours a day, and it's pointless to do that, since my muscles would only atrophy, and it's too painful to sleep for very long periods most of the time anyway. I have a lot more symptoms constantly barraging me aside from a simple flu, but I describe it this way, since most people know what the flu is like. The other stuff is a bit more difficult to get into with somebody healthy.\n\nWhy are we focused on scheduling HERBS, not even something as bad as alcohol(WHY IS THIS NOT SCHEDULED?  IT FITS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE BY DEFINITION), where they are actually changing it from its natural form. Alcohol was responsible for a third of all traffic-related deaths last year, and kills over 100,000 people a year. Medications like NSAIDs kill 8,000+ a year.  Why is addiction considered worse than death in this country?  I have CONSTANT PAIN! I don't get it. Addiction is treatable, and is very temporary, compared to a lifetime of non-stop pain. Doctors will not provide poor people with adequate pain medications when they have pain, unless it falls under specific types. Only high self-pay doctors prescribe pain medications, so there is a discrimination gap, and banning kratom will only increase that gap, allowing doctors and big pharma to monopolize more pain medications, and keep people who need it in agonizing distress. It's sadistic, and if there is one, I hope God is going to pass judgement on those that are doing this to people who suffer. The ones who take these things away don't even know what one percent of this suffering is like, and never will in their lifetimes...  We are the ones who deserve the most given to us. Our lives are harder than most other people, and taking away even more from our functionality only makes things worse.\n\nKratom helps me and others like me function in an already unfair world where we are at a disadvantage economically, emotionally, and add almost every aspect of living to the list. Adding yet another herb, related to coffee at that, to schedule I here will just hurt many because of... who?  Why is there even talks of a ban?  I don't see anybody robbing banks because of their kratom addiction. It's laughable to me, but big money is no doubt behind it. Don't let it win.There is just not enough room here to explain my condition properly,this is preposterous.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7113","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joe Dunbar","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My mother and sister have both benefited greatly from Kratom for both its pain relief and mood regulating properties.

I'm a 31-year old from Virginia, and Im your constituent. I'd like to voice my extreme opposition to the DEAs Intent to Schedule the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, which would make the herb Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), a schedule 1 controlled substance. Doing this denies it has medicinal value which is entirely false. Kratom is a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions naturally and more safely than prescription medicines that are used for these conditions. There are numerous military veterans using it to treat their PTSD and pain issues from war as well.  It is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem and helping addicts recover to become functioning citizens again. This scheduling would prevent further research which, to date, has shown Kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\nI was in a bad car accident at age 19 and injured discs in my low spine as well as my neck. This has affected every aspect of my life. After exhausting literally hundreds of conventional treatments, I had to have back surgery. The surgery failed and my pain has only gotten worse over the years and Ive had to redo many of the treatments. My treatments included physical therapy, painful steroid injections, trigger point muscle injections, dozens of anti-inflammatory drugs that have eaten away at my stomach lining, chiropractors, acupuncture, and massage therapy. As a last resort I was prescribed to opiate pain medications and nerve pain medicines that gave me such horrible mental deficits that I had to leave my job working for the federal government supporting our troops in the military. I decided that I would no longer take these awful medicines and started researching medicinal herbs.\nI was unable to get a job again until I discovered Kratom. It is the only thing in 12 years that controls my pain without killing my brain and making me unable to function physically and mentally. Kratom has entirely saved my life and allowed me to be a productive member of society. It does not intoxicate me like the pain medicines did so I am able to think clearly and function normally. After finding Kratom, I was able to hunt and fish again, enjoy my vacations, go to social events with my wife, and help around the house. It has given me the ability to do all the things I loved doing before my back injury. Before finding Kratom, I was almost completely unable to participate in anything like that. My wife and I felt for the first time that we had a handle on my problems, and felt we could finally be happy again. That was until the DEA announced their intent to outlaw this miracle cure! It literally feels as though my life is imploding again like it did when I was 19 years old. I truly believe I will be forced to stop working and go on disability. I will once again be unable to do any of the things I enjoy in life. \nIm asking you to please not deny the medical uses and take away this miracle herb that helps so many people.. I fear this action by the DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic and will cause millions of chronically ill people like me to become disabled again. I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without Kratom.\n\nSincerely,\nBrad Worth Bell","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7717","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brad Bell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello. My name is Steven Hadley, 37, former professor of art. I am writing in regards to oppose the DEA putting the supplement kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. Four years ago, I developed a pain in my left abdomen and flank that plagued me every day since. I lost my job, suffered severe depression, anxiety, and suicidality as a result of the intensifying pain. One year ago, I qualified for Medicaid and am now on a hopeful path to diagnosis and treatment but there has never been any medication, surgery, or treatment that has alleviated my pain completely or qualitatively since onset. Under Medicaid, I have established a relationship with a PCP and numerous specialists who are now helping me. One method is through pain management via opioids. Even then, I would still spend much of the week in bed, trying to sleep through the pain. Two months ago, that changed. After reading an article about the possible banning of kratom, I researched the subject regarding its uses, effects, and possible adverse effects. Upon learning that it could treat chronic pain, I decided to order a sample and try it. This supplement, a naturally occurring plan, has given me back a quality of life that I thought I might never experience again. I have been able to cut my opioid dose in half and spend much less time prone, trying to wait out the spasms. I implore you to please leave kratom off of the banned substances list. Now that I have some semblance of a life again, I am extremely fearful about your upcoming decision. If kratom is placed on the schedule 1 list, my dependence on opioides will have to be increased despite the opioid crisis America is currently facing, and I will undoubtedly go back to a life spent primarily in bed. I understand the interest that the US government and pharmaceutical companies have in kratom and the damage it could do to their profits but, again, I implore you, please put the welfare of an ever growing community of kratom supporters above the profits of Big Pharma. None of us know what the future holds nor how long we have. What I do know is that kratom has given me back something I had lost years ago, hope. Please don't take that away from me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20722","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steven Hadley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Melinda May and I am a 30 year old wife, mother and customer service manager.

Recently I discovered Kratom as an alternative to opioid meds and it works. Period. With the current war on drugs, the CDC Guidelines, and my state's (NC) 58 page directive on prescribing opiates, one would think that the DEA would stop removing every single form of relief that we have available to us.

I work as an Electronics specialist at a facility that produces cryogenic liquid/gas storage and distribution vessels.\n     I strongly oppose the proposal of DEA to place the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, two constituents of the kratom plant, schedule 1 controlled substances. I feel this is outrageous to place something that is so incredibly safe and uplifting to the same category as substances that can drag us down! Kratom is a natural Herb, and by No truthful study or investagation has it been shown to cause harm or death. \n     I came to try Kratom, ten or more years ago, after reading articles of the uplifting qualities of the tree leaf. I had some years battling depression, countless medications that kept me in a foggy reality and a worse state then when I started. I tried Kratom and it helped me stay clear and focused without the horrible side effects. It helped me get back to a normal life without all the side effects, and the best part I wasn't chained to it like antidepressants. I could use it when needed and stop when I wanted. \n\n     I hope what I've said here is helpful in realizing this natural tree leaf called Kratom is a gift from the Earth and shouldn't be feared. We all should have the right to healthy living and the right to achieve it in a safe and beneficial way.\n\nSincerely \n\nGlenn T.

You see, I suffer from Marfan's syndrome, a connective tissue disorder which also affects my heart valves.  I regularly dislocate joints doing daily tasks, and it can be quite painful.  I never really wanted to go down the painkiller route because I have seen first hand what it can do to people's lives, and how it's ruined and killed hundreds of thousands of people in America.  And about 3 years ago, I was introduced to kratom.  Kratom, in it's purest form, is a perfectly safe alternative to dangerous prescription drugs and alcohol, as well as an effective anti-depressant if used correctly.  I know that there are probably hundreds of people who claim to be addicted to the stuff, but that is no reason to ban something that hundreds of thousands of people use responsibly for real reasons.  That is why I'm writing today, to urge you not to ban kratom and ruin what for so many people has been a way to manage pain.  \n\nTake for example, Alabama.  Alabama recently banned kratom in April, and in May and June, heroin and other opiate overdoses more than doubled in Alabama because of it.  While i have never been addicted to any opiates, i have read hundreds of testimonials of people who do struggle with it and have found that kratom has literally given them their lives back.  We as a country cannot risk banning something like kratom with the fentanyl/heroin epidemic like it is.  It would be putting thousands of lives in jeopardy who otherwise would probably be using if kratom was still legal instead of heroin/other dangerous opiates.  Please see it in your heart to not rush to a decision and allow for proper medical research on kratom to come to fruition before a decision is made.  \n\nSincerely, \n\nWilliam Coons","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6314","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Coons","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have had chronic pin for most of my life due to spinal deformities and injuries, migraines, arthritis, and fibromyalgia. I recently discovered kratom and tried it in lieu of taking the prescription opioids given to me by my pain management doctor.

In my case, one legal plant is taking the place of three prescription pharmaceuticals for me, and without any altered state of mind or \"high\". Keeping kratom legal and accessible would enable researchers to study this plant further so more scientific journal articles may be published regarding its effects, pharmaceutical drug interactions, and contraindications. There are those of us with multiple illnesses who are genuinely interested in seeing this research advanced by the scientific community, without fear of repercussion on the part of the researcher. This would be a win-win for both the public and the scientific communities.

I am a mother, wife, sister, daughter, and I am Kratom. I, as we all are, am a victim of this toxic world in which we, as Americans, have been subjected to live. By toxic, I am referring to the toxic foods, chemicals, products, medications, etc. We are all damaged by these toxins in varying degrees, one of which is pain. Pain is a very common presentation in our daily lives. For me, it was constant. The pain drug companies love me because I am a forever patient, living with a degenerative spine. The pharmaceuticals offered by the doctors only furthered the toxicity creating more pain and damage. Kratom was my FREEDOM OF CHOICE option for ORGANIC pain relief. Drugs are not organic, and in this toxic soup our country has created, some bodies cannot handle synthetic ingredients ANYMORE. Kratom is a leaf, processed no more than drying and powdering, and sold raw. For someone like me, this is the only safe way to enjoy anything anymore, AND MY RELIGIOUS RIGHT TO CONSUME AT WILL. If you ban Kratom, it will solidify your bias toward pharmaceuticals in the PUBLIC EYE. This is guaranteed. By the FDA halting customs, it shows the bias already. Please, even if for your public opinion reputation, do not ban kratom. Kratom helps substantially more people than it hinders, and this is becoming more widely known, subsequently creating awareness to the immorality of the said ban. Kratom is less habit forming, in most opinions, than coffee. I am sure anyone reading this comment would know someone devastated by a ban on coffee. I happen to enjoy both coffee and kratom and believe coffee is much more habitual. I submitted 2 previous comments, but haven't seen them posted, therefore I am submitting this one to try again. This is an addition to my other comments, so it is different in it's information. I would like to reference docket number DEA-442W.

Again I thank you for your time reading this and I pray that this leaf remains available to the public, the way God intended; free to choose to use for any reason desired.

I have worked for the same company for over 35 years and currently hold the position of Senior Production Planner. I go to church every Sunday and I am a member of the choir. I am in good physical condition but have had arthritis in my knees for several years that I treated with ibuprofen, Meloxicam, Tramadol for flare ups, and cortisone injections 2-3 times a year. A little over a year ago a family member suggested that I try kratom and I was amazed at how it helps ease my pain without making me feel drugged. Since I started taking kratom I have stopped taking both ibuprofen and Tramadol, and have only had one cortisone injection in the last year. I do still take Meloxicam daily and I take Kratom as necessary for pain flare ups. I am now exercising regularly and I am about 15 pounds lighter than I was a year ago. I come home at the end of the workday and take walks and play with my granddaughters instead of falling into my recliner until bedtime. I can work in my yard on the weekends and not be a burden to my children. I am much more active now than I was before taking kratom.\nI was so proud of my state earlier this year. Instead of blindly passing proposed SB830 our elected leaders listened to the people of North Carolina and amended the bill to restrict Kratom to those 18 years of age and over, and ordered a study by the Senate Health Care Committee to determine the safety of its use, which is a very sensible approach.

He is a father, husband and sole bread-winner of the family:\n\nDear DEA,\n\nPlease remove Mitragynine & 7-hydroxymitragynine which is in Kratom from becoming a Schedule I substance.\n \nI am 29 and suffer from a herniated disc, chronic neck pain, TMJ, arthritis in my neck. I support a family of four on a single income. I have been to many doctors with little success for treatment. I have found that Kratom improves my quality of life after a hard days work. It isnt comparable to any drugs, marijuana, alcohol or other stimulants.  Kratom helps to improve my quality of life that I suffer with chronic pain. Please dont make this herb illegal. Cervical injections, botox injections, chiropractic care, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, yoga exercises have not helped with my pain.\n \nKratom is a well-known, well-researched herbal substance drawn from the leaves of trees within the coffee family. The number of cases of documented harm from kratom use is remarkably low, both as an absolute matter and when considered against the extensive history of use of kratom, both inside and outside the United States\n \nMitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are two of the primary alkaloids of this plant. These two compounds are not synthetic and should not be lumped together with  \"bath salts\" or \"spice\".\n \nKratom has been used as a medicine by many people for thousands of years. It is a potent remedy for physical pain, anxiety and depression, and could be used to aid with opiate withdrawal by those who would like to quit using illicit drugs such as heroin. Kratom is NOT a hallucinogen and should not be classified as such. Adding mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as a Schedule I substance is rash and unjustified prohibition, resulting in a foreseeable increase in street drug-related crime, as well as a punishment to those who are currently using it responsibly to treat various ailments.\n\nThe reason that there are no deaths solely attributed to Kratom is because Kratom does not affect your respiratory capacity. It does not slow down your central nervous system. It's potential to do harm is virtually impossible.\n\nKratom has very limited recreational capacity.  The White House petition has over 100,000 signatures for the \"Please do not make Kratom a Schedule I Substance.\" \n\nThe federal government has invested significant resources to develop alternative pain management strategies. This includes a study funded by the National Institutes of Health in partnership with the University of Massachusetts and the University of Mississippi to investigate the use of Kratom as a remedy for opioid withdrawal. This study led the researchers to apply for a patent identifying the Kratom extract, mitragyinine, as a useful treatment for other addictive drugs besides opiate derivatives. The DEAs decision to place Kratom as a Schedule I substance will put a halt on federally funded research and innovation surrounding the treatment of individuals suffering from opioid and other addictionsa significant public health threat. Remember the DDear Colleague Letters of Senator Hatch and Congressman Mark Pocan.\n \nWe hope you realize the threat this scheduling causes the people seeking legitimate use of this special plant to improve our quality of life.

To schedule Kratom will prevent thousands who were taking opiates whether prescribed or illicit to remain clean and drug free, it will insure many who have pulled themselves up by the bootstraps, out of a bedridden state and managed to get off opiates and other drugs and or pharmaceuticals to better themselves, find a job, reconnect with families and rebuild their lives after tragic accidents and illnesses will fail and return to their sedentary lives dependent on the government. \nTo make Kratom schedule one or to place unnecessary restrictions on its availability will cause my veteran husband to lose hope as he tries to cope with memory loss and anxiety after two brain bleed strokes. The medication the VA offers my husband is either ineffective or creates a mind numbing fog he cannot find his way out of. In addition, after taking every drug imaginable for fibromyalgia and discovering I am allergic to nearly every approved medication to treat this illness I found Kratom. I spent the last 20 yrs in pain and after consuming Kratom one time, I found myself pain free with no side effects at all! I do not consume Kratom every day because insurance will not cover it. I save it for the horrendous flares I know are  going to strike any time, anywhere. Scheduling Kratom will prevent research and my hope of one day wearing a patch made from Kratom that will last around the clock. This will be my miracle. Today, Kratom allows me to feel normal without side effects, it gave me my husband back. Please do not ban or place restrictions on Kratom. You will be delivering a blow to many people who will not survive. You will be destroying lives unnecessarily. Kratom is harmless in its pure and unadulterated state.If you must ban anything, ban the products marketing Kratom as some amazing high. This is misleading and false advertising.

Prior to that time period I was addicted to prescription painkillers and heroin. My life was in shambles and I wasn't able to function and be a productive member of society. Today, through using kratom, utilizing the AA program, and through therapy, I am able to have a life. I have a job, a girlfriend, a home, and pay all my own bills. I view kratom no differently than a maintenance drug like suboxone or buprenorphine. The incident rate of relapse for opioid addicts is extremely high. I have not relapsed since January of 2014 on prescription painkillers or heroin.\n\nKratom has had a very positive impact on my life. The kratom community is one of the strongest I have seen. We are all there to help one another. This plant has properties unlike any other that practically prevent abuse. I believe the DEA along with the FDA or any other government agencies should invest in researching this miracle plant. I don't want to see the active alkaloids patented and sold like another pharmaceutical drug. This country is in an opioid epidemic and I was a casualty. Now, more than ever, we need kratom. \n\nI implore the DEA to not schedule kratom and to allow it's continued sale whilst more research is done. If it is made illegal I believe a lot of those using it to treat chronic pain/drug addiction will return to dangerous prescriptions and heroin. There will be more unnecessary deaths.

Im writing to urge you to keep Kratom legal and available in the United States. I was stunned and upset to hear that the DEA was considering banning the plant in the U.S., as it is a very mild, harmless leaf that helps far more people than it could ever harm. \nMy experience with kratom began over a decade ago when my anxiety became severe enough to hurt my ability to be a good parent and to function at work. While I had a daily medication  Effexor  I still suffered from periods of high anxiety, and initially asked my physician for Valium. When she declined to prescribe more than few pills per year, I realized I needed something else to help me cope. Drinking alcohol was one option, however hurt my ability to work and be a good parent. After some research, online, I came across kratom and decided to give it a try. \nKratom not only calms my anxiety, but has also curbed my desire for alcohol.  It relaxes me enough that I can work productively and have no need for a drink to escape anxiety. If I had gone with Valium instead, I might well be addicted to it, forced to look for illegal sources of the drug. \nKratom is no more addictive than coffee. If you use it every day for a long time, you can become mildly dependent. But coffee isnt illegal, nor are cigarettes and alcohol, which are much more addictive.  On kratom forums, very few mention troubles quitting kratom, while most others praise it for helping them get off opiates or alcohol. Ive often heard people say that kratom has helped them manage chronic pain and avoid having to take opiates in the first place. \nIve never had a bad experience with kratom, except for once or twice when I became nauseated from drinking too much. That is why you cant overdose on kratom  you vomit first. Ive also dealt with many kratom sellers, and none have sold bad kratom or cut it with other substances. \nBanning kratom will pull the rug out from thousands of people who need it, like me, and force many to seek it illegally, no doubt leading to more decent people crammed into prisons already overflowing with minor drug offenders. \nKratom isnt a dangerous plant and any such reports are either invented or based on kratom being combined other substances. If a person drinks coffee with alcohol, opiates and valium, and they wind up in a hospital, is it the fault of the coffee? Look to the real culprits  the drugs with potentially fatal, effects. Kratom simply isnt capable of killing someone, unless they drown themselves in a vat of kratom tea perhaps. \nIn your war on drugs, please remember that kratom is your ally, not your enemy. \nRespectfully, \na mom in Massachusetts","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15576","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 50 year old Disabled Veteran.

I have also known people who have used kratom to help them get off opiates for pain and/or help them with withdrawal symptoms to help them stay off opiates they had become addicted to. Kratom itself does not appear to be addictive. I have not experienced any adverse side effects from kratom use. If it were to become unavailable to me, I could potentially miss work/school because of the lack of sleep anxiety causes as doctors are highly reluctant to prescribe medications that help because of their adverse side effects or their fear of reprisal for prescribing too much/too often.\nThe negative incidents I am aware of involved combining kratom with another prescription medication that caused seizures. In response to this, I consider other natural remedies such as St Johns Wort, which, if taken with certain prescription medications renders them either too effective or not effective. Warnings come with prescription medications that interact with supplements or food to inform patients of these potential harmful side effects and the same could be done for kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3121","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Personally, I have never used Kratom.

I have several medical issues that cause me to have chronic pain.  I have several bulging and degenerating discs, bone spurs on my spine and scoliosis.  I also suffer from osteoarthritis that is continuing to get worse; some days I find it hard to tie my shoes, write or even type.  Typing is essential to me because I am in school to get my MS in Substance Abuse Counseling.  I also have a job in retail as well as a job cleaning corporate apartments for another company; being able to move is essential to me.  \n     My story begins back a little over 10 years ago, I began seeing a pain specialist who began treating my chronic pain with Percocet and Vicodin.  I believe he was over-prescribing me when I stopped seeing him.  I then began buying oxycontin on the streets.  Soon I was doing heroin to treat my incessant chronic pain.  I got help to get off the heroin with Subutex but the withdrawals were worse than the heroin withdrawals.  After consulting with my regular doctor, I went off the Subutex cold turkey with the help of beta blockers and Klonopin.  As I am sure you are aware, I could no longer take prescription pain medications due to my addiction.  I did some research on natural, herbal solutions to manage my chronic pain.  I found Kratom.  \n     Although Kratom does not completely eliminate my pain, it makes it tolerable so that I can do everyday things like work and cook dinner for my husband.  Kratom does not cause the euphoria that prescription pain medication or heroin did.  It only helps to manage my pain and the depression that coincides with that pain. I have never had a problem with taking too much Kratom.  I did, however, overdose on heroin once and Percocet several times.  When I am not in pain, I have more energy; I was even able to enroll into a Master's degree program to become a substance abuse counselor.  I am studying to be a drug counselor and Kratom is helping me to do that.  What kind of example would I set if Kratom should become a Schedule I drug? \n     There is a severe epidemic in this country of prescription pain pill and heroin addiction.  Making Kratom a Schedule I drug would leave some people no choice but to go back to prescription drugs and illicit drugs.  I wasted too many years of my life in a euphoric stupor to help ease my pain.  Please do not take away the only thing that helps me that lets me maintain a clear head and is not lethal.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n\nAlicia D Zvonar","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17358","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alicia Zvonar","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Haven't tried it personally but have read and heard a lot of good things about it from users.

Please keep kratom available as a natural pain relief alternative for my health. I have suffered through debilitating pain due to degenerative disc disease for over fifteen years. I have tried multiple treatments for the pain, including nerve blocks, injections, physical therapy and quite a few addictive opiate pain medications. The pain meds helped, but due to the side-effects, I try everything that I can to avoid them until absolutely necessary. About two years ago, while searching for alternative treatments for my pain, I discovered Kratom. I cannot convey to you in words the difference it has made in my life. I have been able to cut down on my use of opiate medications to almost zero. I do not experience any negative side-effects with Kratom, except possibly a little tiredness, and for me at least, it helps almost as much as the doctor prescribed meds that I had been forced to live with for so many years. I have found Kratom to be no more addictive than my morning coffee. I know from experience that Kratom is not dangerous. I honestly find some of the stories that I have read about the dangers of taking Kratom laughable. I think the government needs to educate itself and really listen to people who have experience with using Kratom, before attempting to schedule this natural plant that does nothing but help people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8101","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Connie Nestor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I happened to stumble across Kratom since my wife struggled with migraines and we got some for her to try to help maintain her migraines.

One day I ended up getting  a terrible headache, which I don't usually have, and thought I'd give it a try since it was just sitting there. It helped my headache, but that isn't reason I get it today. I suffer from terrible RLS that drives me batty at night. Well that particular night I noticed my legs felt decent and I was able to sleep really well. So I began experimenting with the Kratom to figure out how much to take, when and which strain to relive my RLS. I've narrowed it down to taking a little bit just after lunch and a little bit around 6pm and my RLS is practically gone at night. It's SO wonderful! Although the powder is tough to swallow, I deal with it as it works so well for my RLS.

I purchased kratom about three years ago following advise of a friend who suffers from depression as well.  Three years later I remain under medical care and continue to take 1 antidepressant \"brintellix\", however, since I started supplementing with kratom, I no longer feel groggy because I was able to stop taking medications such as Xanax or lorazepam. I went through a period of horrible withdrawals from all the benzodiazepines and I never want to return to taking those horrid medications ever again. I drink kratom tea once a day which keeps me focused and motivated to accomplish my daily goals instead of living through scattered days praying to survive one more day.  Sometimes I go several days or even weeks without taking kratom and I have never felt any withdrawal symptoms described by some sources. Coffee withdrawals, on the other hand, are very well pronounced by cravings and strong headaches barely alleviated with common OTC analgesics.

I cant just run to the doctor and have her prescribe something for the chronic pain from a debilitating back injury and fibromyalgia. I was born with bipolar disorder and any medication that warns of mood changes can quickly trigger life-threatening side effects, so I dont even risk them. Opiates guarantee depression, so I cant take them either. And Im not content to spend my life fighting pain rather than write and enjoy my family.\n\nThat is why Kratom has been such a godsend. Not only does it help me manage my chronic pain, it doesnt affect my mood any more than a good cup of coffee does. Unlike many prescription drugs, it helps me sleep, but doesnt leave me stupid and hung-over the next day. I havent needed to up my dose and am still taking the same four grams at night and two in the morning that Ive been taking for over a year. Nor do I crave it, like I once did the taken-as-prescribed benzodiazepines (which triggered a suicide attempt, by the way). Kratoms side effects are minimal, especially compared to most prescription drugs. And finally, Kratom costs me less than $100 month instead of the $300 or $400 I would spend on prescription meds, which is a pretty big deal for someone like me on a limited income. \n\nPlease remember that Kratom has been used in Southeast Asia for thousands of years without societal collapse. The people there enjoy it as tea, which I find hard to imagine, because its so bitter that I do not relish drinking mine every day even though I greatly appreciate the pain relief it affords. \n\nI am writing to tell you that scheduling Kratom would seriously diminish the quality of my life, because Ive yet to find a safe, effective substitute, and I really do not want to resort to swallowing handfuls of ibuprofen, which will ultimately destroy my liver.

Banning kratom will simply push it onto the black market which cannot be policed, lead to more arrests of non-violent people, and most importantly, it will harm people who are trying to break free from opioid addiction by using a plant substitute. Look at what happened with alcohol prohibition: Alcohol went on the black market and people died from dirty batches. Legalizing, taxing, and regulating it eliminated this problem and led to a profitable market; the same should be done for kratom. Right now, you have very few reported deaths from kratom use, many in which kratom was mixed with other substances which then led to injury and/or death. If it becomes schedule I, it is essentially outlawed as is much of the promising research on it and the number of deaths will skyrocket because people will simply buy it on the black market thereby creating a far worse situation. So, I respectfully request that kratom remain legal as a ban benefits no one but drug companies who view it as their competition to far riskier, expensive synthetic drugs.\n\nHave a good night.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0918","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 30 year old ISA Certified Arborist living in California and I have been using Kratom for almost 5 years now. I played college football in my early 20's and had my kneecap sheared almost all the way off during a practice. This tore off nearly all the cartilage from under my kneecap and after numerous surgeries, the doctors were unable to replace that cartilage. So, long story short I have almost no cartilage under my kneecap, leading to daily, constant pain.  The only solution doctors provided was to prescribe me opiate pain killers. This lead to a terrible quality of life. It is very tough to enjoy your friends, family and daily activities when you are either in terrible pain or an opiate induced haze.  When I discovered Kratom for myself, all this changed. It dulls the pain but without the impairment that comes with opiate pain killers. To be pain free without being intoxicated has literally changed my life. I can hike with my wife and dog again without being in terrible pain during and afterward, whereas I wouldn't have been even able to hike on painkillers.  I can also use kratom without fear of addiction, withdrawal, or possible overdose. I have gone periods without kratom with no withdrawal effects, which is definitely not the case with opiates.

This plant has been used safely in SE Asia for hundreds of years, and there are no records of deaths solely from the plant. The handful of deaths (far less than acetaminophen, alcohol or tobacco) associated with kratom were in combination with dangerous opiates, including the horrible product krypton, which contained o-desmethyltramadol. Because there is clear medical utility, low potential for abuse, and no real health risks (including respiratory depression), it makes no sense to put kratom in schedule 1. People will turn back to dangerous opiates, and people will die. I understand there are pharmaceutical patents being pursued for analogues of kratom alkaloids. If this is why the DEA is considering scheduling kratom, its a treasonous betrayal of public health for private profit.

It takes time and an expensive specialist to pin point which it may be which I haven't had the opportunity to do. Oh yes I did have health insurance before but it didn't cover much of the things that a person would really need the most out of medical like a specialist. Anyway back to the point this plant kratom is the only pain relief I get. I only use it on occasion now when I really need it. I have at one point when my back was bad for an extended time used kratom daily for a couple months once a day. It lasts 8 to 10 hours so that's all I needed. It's way better than any otc meds as they do nothing. Also it's way better than my prescription they gave me as it did nothing but cause bad withdraws from one bottle. Wow I couldn't believe how addictive the prescription pills are. Now Keaton I took all that time straight and when I quit taking it I felt nothing at all. No addiction feeling whatsoever and the euphoria they claim is crazy strong like heroin is a lie. It feels more similar to coffee to me. I'd capsulize it and take 10 of the \"00\" capsule for a dose. This would be a god send for my joint pain and give me a coffee like energy level. Keaton is after all an herbal medicine so why is the fda and dea involved in attempting to make a non addictive when not abused herb illegal? Abuse is no excuse because if that's the case goodbye paint, gasoline, cough and cold medicine, alcohol, aerosol, many many others. Health issues as an excuse? Cigarettes and other cancer causing mildly euphoric extremely addictive tobacco products which have no medical value are legal but you think kratom should be illegal because it treats pain? Is this because the pharmacies are losing income from their trolley l truly heroin like addictive pills because of in my experience totally non addictive kratom? Let's get real and face the facts. There is no reasons to ban kratom and that's even if you prove abusers have health problems from it. Let's do a study on non abusers and that should be the real answer. And even then it can't be worse than tobacco cause there's countries where you can see 85 plus year olds that have been eating a ton of kratom their whole life and still chewing the stuff and healthy as can be.

Of even more importance, it has the ability to help those truly and hopelessly addicted to narcotics kick that habit without side effects, withdrawals, or getting addicted to some new substance. I and many others can attest to each of these claims. From experience, it is about on par with coffee in terms of its addictiveness and one does not get \"high\" from even very high doses. The worst effect that can happen is nausea.  If the ultimate goal is public health, this decision is going to make us all worse off as a nation. Kratom is a safe alternative with important medicinal uses and has changed the lives of so many Americans.

While I have never used kratom myself, I know that it has helped many people avoid opioid use, cope with chronic pain that cannot be managed other ways, and cope with mental illnesses such as PTSD.

Allowing (or allowing but regulating) the use of kratom would be one way to practice harm reduction.\n\nSo far, there is no evidence that kratom is any more harmful than many other legal substances, and it seems to be less harmful than many -- for example, alcohol causes many deaths each year.  I have not seen any reports that link kratom use (alone, without other substances being involved) in the US to deaths, and certainly not the number of deaths directly caused by alcohol and tobacco.\n\nBefore this (or any substance) is banned or classified as a schedule I substance, more studies should be done to determine possible benefits of kratom, as well as possible adverse effects.

I feel the state and federal governments have overstepped their bounds during my lifetime. There is a water fall near Fairmont, WV, called Valley Falls. We used to go there and swim during the summer. Now we are restricted from even going down on the rocks that create the falls. I do not really know why the restrictions were imposed on the public but I think they were imposed to protect us from ourselves. This is the action of persons in the government taking away the publics right of self determination. They assume the power and the right to point a finger and decide what is best for other people without seeking the opinion or consent of those affected. It should be the unrestricted right of every citizen to decide for themselves what risks they will or will not take with regard to such things as where to swim or what kind of naturally occurring drugs or pharmaceuticals they wish to use to address their health or recreational needs.  It should not be the role of government to dictate to individuals concerning such small aspects of a persons life. If I want to risk hurting myself at Valley Falls swimming that should be solely for me to decide. \n     I feel the same about such things as Kratom and other natural things many people consider medicines or recreational drugs. I do not use Kratom or marijuana but I do use the leaves of the Neem tree for infection control. Since early childhood I had bronchitis almost every year at least once. The last case I had I treated it with the Neem leaves and I haven't had another case of bronchitis since then. That was four years ago. Never in my life have I gone that long without bronchitis. \n     I respectfully appeal to the DEA to protect the right of the American people to be self determining in the use of Kratom and not schedule it at all.  I would request the DEA treat Kratom, marijuana and other such drugs with the same hands off policy used in regulating alcohol products. Alcohol is a far more destructive substance to society than any of these plant substances (excluding tobacco) put together. Tobacco is another freely available substance that is even more destructive than alcohol. It would seem that alcohol and tobacco being readily available to the public would relegate Kratom and marijuana to an equivalent status in view of their low incidence of harming society or even individuals. As with alcohol or tobacco the choice by an individual to use such personally harmful substances should be left to that individual.\n     Allowing public comment on this has raised my respect for the work the DEA does. Making arbitrary laws and policy with arbitrary enforcement on the people of our country without their consent is undemocratic to say the least and,at worst, dictatorial, which creates resentment and resistance toward government agencies for what is viewed by many as an abuse of power. Thank you very much for the chance to share my thoughts on this topic.\nStanley Roger Boyer\n       ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2622","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stanley R.

I first came about kratom 6 years ago as an alternative to pain reliefe. I was in an accident that left me in constant pain. The medication I took made it to where I could barely function in the real world. Over time I became enslaved to the narcotic opiods I was prescribed which, now looking back, made my pain seam even worse and brought out a darker side of me. When I first used kratom I noticed a great difference in pain reliefe, much more than I expected! What surprised me the most is over the following days and weeks I was able to stop my opiod medication with out sever withdrawal symptoms. Compared to opiods kratom seamed to not have much if any psychoactive central nervous system effect, though I have not researched this, I can only say because I never once got \"high\" off it like my narcotic opiods. The darker side of me that opiods brought out was tamed and locked away so to speake over a time of healing. Today I walk around living a functioning lifew for me and my family. Not a slave to a pill like I use to. I owe all my appreciation to kratom for this and enjoy how it still brings appropriate reliefe from when needed.

On the other hand, the positive affects it has had on my life would be too numerous to list in this short letter.  \n\nI spent my career as a public servant: first as a Captain in the United States Marine Corps and, for the last twelve years, as an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney.  I am currently assigned to our Special Victims Section and primarily prosecute crimes in my county against women, children, and the elderly.  In my career, I have also prosecuted hundreds of drug related crimes.  I understand why certain drugs are illegal and agree 100 percent that certain drugs should be controlled and made illegal to possess.  Everyday, I witness first-hand the devastation that certain drugs can have on a person and on the community.  Kraton, however, is no such drug. \n\nKraton is a safe natural dietary supplement that is in the same family as the coffee plant and is just as safe.  I have been using kratom, as needed, over the last four years to combat certain mental health issues with great success.

I hope you strongly consider my views and others who have expressed their opposition to scheduling kratom as a controlled substance.

There will always be those who abuse prescriptions regardless of consequences. I am one of the people who suffer from not only degenerative disc disease, but also have survived several auto accidents, in addition to congenital defects in my lumbar spine. I have had a large spinal fusion a few months ago after 14 years of putting it off through fear of potential disability. I am only 45, and have a 4 year old who I want to have a good life, and memories of a father who could actually play and otherwise interact with him.\n\n     So for several years, I had been in pain management. Which my previous doctor's approach was to throw 120 hydrocodone or oxycodone at you, and you were supposed to shut up for a month. I fired him in February 2016, as I didn't want to be stuck on that junk for the rest of my life, and worked with my GP until September and my fusion surgery.\n\n     Kratom has greatly improved my life. I can get good pain relief, while also being able to interact with my family/coworkers. I feel better, as I can get away from opiate medications and allow my body to rest. This has slowed down my tolerance to the opiate medications, and allows me to stay with a consistent dosage. Typically, the kratom makes me not need the opiate medications, except on very bad days.\n\n     I hope you can see the sense in not banning kratom due to how much it helps people like me. If too much is accidentally ingested, your body will vomit it back up, instead of opiates causing respiratory distress, among other effects.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7814","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gary Ludwick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I oppose the DEAs Intent to Schedule the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, which would make Kratom (Mitragynaspeciosa), the most severe classification of schedule I.  I have consumed kratom a handful of times myself. I found out about kratom from a tea shop that served kratom as a relaxation aide, along with kava root, chamomile, and other common herbs and spices that are rather well known and DEA/FDA approved for food. Kava and chamomile are both touted by retailers as relaxation aides as well. I have a clinical anxiety disorder and find kava root to be helpful. With my limited experience of kratom, it seemed to be helpful in the same regard. Not once did I feel a compulsion to continue significant use. In the 10+ years since I first tried it I've only done so maybe 5 times. On the other hand, I am a recovering alcoholic; haven't drank since March 16th, 2015. I clearly have the genetic disposition for addiction, but have no desire, intent, or compulsion to consume kratom any more than I do coffee, green tea, or kava. It's obviously not an availability issue, as a simple Internet search to buy it from numerous vendors is a mouse click away.\n\nThis notion is echoed by existing scientific literature. Studies have shown kratom has a low risk of dependency or addiction. Furthermore, their observations clearly show potential for use as an aide in opioid addiction treatment. Given that opioid abuse is seeing a resurgence in recent years, and has been an ever-present problem for humanity, there's a dire need for further inquiry into the potential for kratom's clinical use. I have had conversations with multiple people that have suffered an opioid addiction, tried kratom, and found it a useful tool in their recovery. They're not stealing from their families to find their next high anymore, and are ostensibly living healthy and successful lives now as hard-working, tax-paying fellow citizens. I personally have nothing to add to this particular objection, as I have never abused opiates, but their stories of being able to kick a well-known, painfully strong addiction with help from a simple non-addictive herb, is astounding.\n\nDespite all this, I am not necessarily an advocate of the substance for any particular purpose. My main objection, as stated above, is that we're considering as a nation to place a felony ban on a substance that apparently\n\na.) has a LOW potential for abuse.\nb.) HAS currently (albeit preliminarily) accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\nc.) There is an ABUNDANCE of accepted safety for use.\n\nKratom has records of use since at least the 19th century, yet to date not a single person has died as a direct result of kratom consumption. Studies have shown it doesn't cause respiratory depression, the leading cause of death in opiate overdoses. The kratom plant nor it's constituents are not classified as an opiate, as they are not a part of the opium family of plants. Rather, kratom is a member of the coffee family. Let's also keep in mind that hundreds of thousands of people die every year of heart disease, often precipitated by the federally-approved yet medically-confirmed lethally high diet of fats, sugars, and tobacco.\n\nIt is estimated that fatal doses of caffeine for humans are between 3 and 20 grams taken orally, depending on body weight and tolerance. An average cup of coffee contains 1/15 or less than an estimated lethal dose. Yet America drinks this substance daily, with no fear of this threat. If the concern is for public health, we're looking in the wrong place. The DEA's current proposal is to criminalize kratom with the same severity as heroin. This comparison is patently false given the current literature. Despite this, and sound evidence for a potentially highly effective method of drug abuse recovery, the DEA is proposing that we regulate and add more legal mechanisms to waste our tax payer dollars, and our nation's finest law enforcement's time, trying to enforce this to keep our society safe from a substance that's very likely as safe for human consumption as the traditional coffee plant.\n\nIF the DEA must schedule kratom, let's be reasonable and place it in schedule V so that clinical testing for potential as an addiction remedy may continue. However, it's not currently shown to have dependency or abuse risks, so my opinion is to leave this concern for the FDA to review its existing approval as a food additive or dietary supplement. Further research is necessary, but please do not lock kratom into a scheduled status where history proves it will never return from. I'd rather not see my tax dollars wasted worrying about a non-toxic species of coffee. I think there are far more pressing issues both of these agencies need to attend to, such as protecting us from the very real, very dangerous and predatory drug cartels, both black market and corporate.

As far as the psychological changes the plant inspires, they're much more akin to kava kava (without the liver toxicity) or coffee (a close relative of the plant, with the difference here being that fatalities from a kratom extract are unheard of whereas caffeine poisoning is well documented).\n\nThere seems to be some confusion that came about because kratom seems to alleviate some of the excruciating withdrawal effects that come along with \"cold turkey\" cessation of opiate use. This causes someone uninformed to think that kratom causes euphoric effects associated with opiates, which isn't reality. As well from this, some are lead to believe that there are some of the same dangers, specifically respiratory depression. This isn't the case, and kratom \"overdoses\" without other substances being involved are unheard of.\n\nMy personal experience is that the effects of kratom are self-limiting. Unlike opiates where X amount may result in a \"buzz\" and Y amount will result in respiratory depression and possibly death, X amount of kratom results in a mild but perceptible improvement in one's sense of well-being and Y amount results in a queasy stomach with no increase in beneficial effects. \n\nThis same self limiting effect is undoubtedly partly responsible for kratom's reputation as a \"cure\" for opiate addiction. Ex-opiate users frequently state that kratom doesn't combine well with other drugs, opiates especially. It's not that kratom increases the lethality of said drugs, it simply makes them far less enjoyable. To put a complicated biological process in layman's terms, kratom blocks the avenues (receptors) that drugs use to produce their euphoric effects. This is why kratom overdoses are unheard of (receptors are blocked with harmless, plant based substance) and why kratom is considered by many to be a superior, safer option in contrast with Suboxone or methadone treatment (although I don't completely discount those treatments as viable forms of harm reduction as opposed to no treatment at all, or worse yet, incarceration).","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1270","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tristan Pullam","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please allow Kratom to be researched by the FDA.

From my perspective its shows the DEA needs to do further research, and allow citizens to pursue our own paths to health. When I first heard of Kratom it had a negative reputation, then I looked further, and spoke with people firsthand, and soon found a totally different story. A story of how it has benefited people who otherwise were less than functional for various reasons from addiction to chronic pain. I began using it as more of a supplement for preventive health maintenance, taking about .1 to 2 grams of whole leaf daily, on average. I found a definite increase in my overall well being, less body aches, quicker recovery, I'm an active 52 year old, so that alone was incentive to continue, and improved sleep.

I am no longer taking my other pain meds all day long, just an occasional Doans or Tylenol at night. I would much prefer to be able to take something natural than to worry about what the massive amounts of medications are doing to my liver.

That was about two years ago and I never turned back. It helped me overcome some ailments and live a more normal life. It didn't make me feel depressed and it didn't make me feel high,  just made me feel normal. Normal is what I've wanted for so long so this plant means so much to me. To this day I've completely gotten my life back and then some more,  I owe it all to kratom. Even my mom has said \" you're a better you than you ever been since taking kratom.\" It's too true and I thank God for finding this plant. Please reconsider this ban, this will affect a lot of people's lives in a negative way and it scares me that I might go back to where I was two years ago. I know Florida decided on not to ban it after their research showed a low risk and wasn't a danger to public health. I have a lot of confidence that the FDA will find the same results, this plant has so much good than bad. I mean everything has a negative to it, even food or too much sun exposure, that's just reality. This situation is way bigger than just me and on Aug. 31st, I thought oh wow, this is going to be bad for me and some other people but that's it. Well I was way wrong, there's so many veterans, single moms, and ex addicts that got their life back with help from this plant. It's very moving and I hope you'll feel it too.

I have been involved in harm reduction since 1999. I live in Lucas County Ohio. Ohio is hard hit by the opiate crisis.

The latest  estimates from the Lucas County Sheriffs Department estimates we have 10,000 active opiate addicts.

Kratom is a safer alternative to heroin and or pharmaceuticals that are being abused while waiting to get into these limited spots. \nKratom has been used for hundreds of years to help individuals to safely abstain from using opium and heroin. I have personally seen individuals turn their lives around.  There are 97 overdose deaths a day in the United States according to the Surgeon General. If Kratom is made illegal or made so restricted that it is unavailable to those adults in need there will be an increase in opiate overdose deaths. There will be increases in suicide from uncontrolled pain. \nWe have a plant that has been helping addicts for hundreds of years safely. Restricting its use by adults would be sentencing individuals to death. Im not being dramatic, Im being a realist. There is no scientific data to support the banning of this beneficial plant.

But I can at least share my story as to why. My name is Donna. I'm 53 yrs of age. At present I am a stay at home parent and home school my son. I was a teacher, kindergarten and Sign Language, which I had no choice to give up both due to health issues.  I have Fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, ruptured and herniated discs in my back. With all the symptoms that accompany each of these life had become unbearable, to the point I felt I was a burden to my family and thought they would be better off without me. The guilt of not be a functional mom to my children was just as hard, if not harder than the symptoms.  I researched and tried many natural alternatives to all the medications that accompanied these diseases but to no avail. That was until I found Kratom. I spent a couple of months researching Kratom and found thousands of testimonials on how it helped so many get a better quality of life back. I could not live the way I was living so I had everything to lose by not utilizing this plant. With the help of Kratom I have been able to stop all the harmful pharmaceuticals I had been on. I am able to be that functioning mom my children need and deserve. I am able to sleep again, able to walk around free of pain, able to go out and do my own shopping, able to go fishing with my sons. I am able to live a  better quality of life again! This has also given me a stronger and more positive attitude that I had once lost. I found the strength and courage to become healthier in all aspects of my life. Trying to better my overall health was impossible to do while living in such pain and despair, so to me Kratom has been a blessing! Most importantly it has given my children their mother back as they deserve.  I speak personally but I feel this for every child with a parent who has any kind of ailment that could be helped with the benefits of this plant. It is a shame that a God given right such as a plant grown from the earth should even be controlled by man yet alone be banned.

Kratom is a natural supplement derived from the  tropical trees of Southeast Asia. Before explaining how my life has changed as a result, I should provide some background information as to my lifelong struggle with chronic and often debilitating pain. \n\nI was born with scoliosis, and suffered both chronic neck, back, and shoulder pain for as long as I can recall. I also have endometriosis, which significantly affects my ability to function for one to two weeks of each month. I was ultimately diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit disorder in addition to (and potentially resulting from) the near-constant pain. I became unable to work, and was granted Social Security Disability Insurance at 30 years old. Prior to this, I was employed at a residential music school for young adults with intellectual disabilities. The pain and resulting anxiety/depression became too much to manage, and I was given no choice but to leave after 8 years at the school. \n\nThe following two years were spent going back and forth between appointments:  x-rays, physical therapy (3x/week), individual psychotherapy, OB-GYN appointments, chiropractic sessions, etc. Each of these were financed by state-funded health care, which cost tens of thousands of dollars per year. I personally spent hundreds on therapeutic massage, at-home electrotherapy, joint pain relief, acupressure pillows, and daily medication to manage my symptoms. For depression, I was prescribed (at different stages) Prozac, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Lamictal, Clonazepam, and Methylphenidate for ADHD. I was also prescribed a low-dose estrogen birth control, to control endometriosis. I felt very little relief from my symptoms, and ultimately began to spend my days in bed, utterly useless to myself, my family, and society in general. Those around me (including medical professionals) encouraged me to try medical marijuana, but my tolerance was so low that it only exacerbated my anxiety. It was then suggested that I try a natural supplement known as kratom.\n\nI had heard about kratom, but was dubious of any natural supplement that boasted not only pain relief, but focus, energy, and minimization of anxiety. After months went by with no reprieve from my pain, I asked myself: Why not try it? What could I possibly lose that I havent already lost? Though I read articles on the addiction potential, I was fully aware that much of what is presented online derives from personal opinion, and often leans towards catastrophic thinking and fear-mongering. I already knew what opiate withdrawal felt like, due to having been prescribed opiates for pain relief in the past. I now felt prepared to try something different, and would do so independently. Once the kratom arrived, I carefully measured 2 grams, and mixed it with water. It tasted like a cold, somewhat bitter tea, and I didn't have much hope for relief. Then, I gradually found myself unaware of the pain. For the first time, it seemed to naturally dissipate, as though the scoliosis and resulting disruption of my cervical spine were mere afterthoughts; distant memories rather than constant reminders. I did not feel high as some may suggest. Nor did I feel euphoric. I simply felt well enough to resume the activities of daily living that I had previously felt unable to do. \n\nThere are questions about whether sudden termination of kratom use will result in withdrawal symptoms. I can attest to the fact that I did not personally experience these symptoms. As with any substance (or in this case natural supplement), a person will typically revert back to how he or she felt prior to having taken it. So do I feel unwell when I do not take kratom? Yes I do. But that is because I felt unwell for YEARS before discovering it. Recently, my anxiety has resurfaced in the form of kratom regulation in the United States. I must ask- what is the purpose of this? Is it easier to force people to take potentially damaging substances which have become increasingly difficult to obtain medically? Should we take kratom away from those who benefit for fear that a small percentage of individuals-already predisposed to addictive tendencies- may abuse it? The same argument could be said for alcohol or even cough syrup, but we still offer people the opportunity to demonstrate personal responsibility through safe use in moderation. \n\nSince I began taking kratom, I have resumed my degree (which I abandoned a decade ago). My hopes are to continue my path to wellness, and someday be less reliant on others to exist. I urge you to consider my story. I am a truth-seeker, with no immediate gain by writing this. Everybody deserves a quality of life, and kratom has been such an invaluable asset to so many people in our country.  Thank you for your time. I strongly appreciate your consideration of this matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1549","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gina Rege","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I'm wanting to let you know that there that are so many good things about kratom It has completely changed my life in so many ways.. It's definitely been given a bad name and it's nothing but a healer, a miracle plant from God, nature  in my opinion. I'm 36 now but at the age of 19 I was in a very serious car wreck that changed my world forever. I lost my mother and  also physically, emotionally, & mentally lost me. I'm on disability cause there's no way I could work. I have way more bad days then good. Never know from one day to the next how I'm gonna feel or how bad I'm gonna hurt. I've been on pain killers off and on throughout the years. From hydrocodone, methadone,  oxy's and even dilaudid. Nothing seems to work long enough though and always have to increase dose or it's just impossible to get a good caring doctor who actually thinks your life matters enough to even prescribe something for your pain. Addicts and junkies have ruined it for the ones truly in need just to live somewhat remotely normal lives. Well one day I posted on a chronic pain group talking about how much I hurt and how much I wanted to give up. That I failed my 4 kids as I spend most my life in bed or home not feeling well. Anxiety at an all time high. Well an amazing lady commented and asked if I have heard about kratom? I never had and was surprised as I have looked into pain remedies forever since that's all that's on my mind living with it 24/7.  So I decided to research this amazing herb and discovered it was something I wanted to try. I mean it couldn't be to bad it's apart of mother nature so I thought it's worth a try. The first time I drank my kratom tea I felt like a changed person. Truly it helped my pain, anxiety, sleep, everything. I could function completely fine as it doesn't alter your mind in anyway. Just helps you feel human. Like I can go on a walk with my dog, play with my four kids, do things I hadn't in forever. My kids noticed a change immediately. They know about kratom, it's a plant that I believe was put on mother earth to be discovered for its greatness. I don't believe it to be addicting like opiates and drugs but to comfort a person to live somewhat normal life. I much rather have kratom play a role in my life then depending on pharmaceutical drugs that have been dished out to me my entire life making me feel like a lab rat. I got many bad days still as fibromyalgia, anxiety, and severe chronic pain can be agonizing. But more better days. On my good days which are becoming more frequently I could even maybe imagine myself going back to some kind of non streness job at some point. I want to go back to work more then anything! I don't enjoy waking up everyday feeling lifeless. But with kratom it helps calm my anxiety, control or manage my pain, you can't overdose on it like drugs. When I heard it could be placed as schedule 1 I thought really? How? This herb/tea is not mind altering in anyway. Not like a high on drugs. Since I've discovered kratom I have lived and witnesses nothing but amazing  things. People managing there pain naturally. I see no reason to take it away. We should get to decide what we put in our bodies. As long as it's not hurting anyone else. This isn't it's helping thousands of people live somewhat pain free normal lives. Don't take that from us. People walking again who thought they never would. People waking up with hope . Since this threat as become present I have been a anxiety mess. I stopped 100% my dilaudid 1 month ago lost a good friend to a fentyal overdose. Kratom could have prevented that. Please take all of our comment letters to heart. Listen to what we have to say. I say kratom is changing lives and for so many. Let us live somewhat comfortable normal lives naturally and not on prescription meds forever. I'm tired of being sick and feeling like a lab rat stuffed with drugs that don't work. Do it for my kids, they need me to be a functioning human. With kratom I have hope for a better future. If it's taken I'm afraid I'm back were I started. Pretty much hopeless. I'm really trying to live without all the meds for once after 20 yrs. #IAMKRATOM!!!! SAVEMOTHEREARTH!!!!

I find it to be a safe and effective alternative, natural, and I don't have any \"dependence\" on this as I do with medication.  I have no cartilage between my upper and lower legs in the knees, I am only 40 and Dr's don't want to do a knee replacement on someone as young as me, but I live in Michigan.  During the cold months it is sometimes unbearable to walk, bend, get out of bed because the cold really affects my pain level, Kratom helps me to function without making my thinking fuzzy for work.  I don't want it to be banned, then I would be back to vicodin and percocet, and eventually needing more for the same relief.  I do not want to be dependent on those, they come with withdrawal.  Kratom does not come with withdrawals, and when the pain is really really bad, one of those pills will actually work, and I don't need to take more than 1 or maybe 2 a day on those really bad days.\nI feel it would be a disservice to ban kratom from the market.  It has helped countless people, and I've seen people use it to get off opiates, and it is much easier to stop using Kratom after getting of opiates.  like I said, no withdrawal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2738","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lori Anklam","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I love kratom, and the reason is it allows me to function throughout the day.

My kind, compassionate, active and humorous husband has been struggling with a pinched nerve in his neck from a car accident since he was a young child. The pinched nerve is a medical condition that has hindered his ability to work, to play a more active role in our young girls' lives, and his capability to generally live a happy and pain-free life. On top of his chronic pain this wonderful man suffers from mild to severe anxiety. \n\nDue to his diagnosese he has been prescribed multiple medications in his doctors' various attempts to manage his anxiety and pain. The prescriptions range from Xanax and Valium to Percocet and Vicodin. The list of his prescribed medications continues in a seemingly endless pattern but I won't bore you with too many of the dark and disturbing details. As you can imagine, many of these prescribed medications treated some of the symptoms and conditions he suffered from, but at the expense of creating worse symptoms and conditions. These medications temporarily took away my husband's physical pain, but they also took away my husband. He became an addict. \n\nRecovering from his addiction has been a long and tedious road, and it continues with both its ups and downs. It's a hard balance when your only relief from unbearable pain is becoming a person your closest family and friends cannot recognize as their loved one. In this long and sometimes seemingly hopeless journey, there has been only one form of relief: Kratom. \n\nKratom has offered my husband a solution to his chronic pain without the side effects of the drugs that had been previously prescribed to him. 'Side effects' seems too mild of a term to describe the way he has suffered from overdoses, withdrawals, drastic personality changes and multiple grand-mal seizures due to prescription medications. He is able to use Kratom to manage his pain without becoming lethargic and the worst version of himself. \n\nI have watched my husband suffer from his addictions, suffer from pain, suffer from suffocating anxiety, and he is the last person in the world who deserves to suffer. I know that it takes a tremendous amount of strength every single day to not become lethargic from prescription medications as a coping mechanism for his unwarranted suffering, because I see his strength everyday. He choses to be there for me and our kids but I know that without the opportunity to ease some of his chronic pain with Kratom this would not be a possibility. Kratom has honestly given me back the unbelievably kind-hearted and patient man I married. Kratom has given me back the man that prescribed drugs and medications and doctors took away from me. \n\nI began writing this to explain the impact that Kratom has had on my life. With everything that Kratom has given me, and done for my family, it seems impossible to put the positive impact Kratom has had on my family into words. For the DEA to consider classifying Kratom as a schedule 1 drug without further research into the benefits and positive solutions this plant has to offer is still simply mind boggling to me. I cannot beg enough for the DEA to reconsider this decision and conduct more studies about this plant and its impact on individuals and families who have suffered as mine has suffered. I will not stop fighting for my husband's right to live his life as pain free as possible. I will not stop fighting for Kratom to be readily available to him to ease his suffering. Nobody deserves a happy and healthy life more than my husband. And nobody should have the right or power to take that ability from him.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21476","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Misty Stevenson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Good day to you , I am two years clean from a cocktail of Pharmaceutical medications witch was truly killing me ..After a car accident in 2000 I was put on many meds over the years ..I would stop taking them for a while but the pain was too great. .so I would again go back ...after three failed marriages I was told to try kratom for my pain .

Severe pain has been part of her life for years.  She sees a pain management specialist, but really never experiences total relief from her pain.  She spent most days in bed unable to function due to pain and side effects from the pain meds.  Until she tried Kratom.   For the first time in YEARS she has hope and can function.  She has experienced tremendous pain relief without the side effects of traditional pain meds.  She is working for the first time in years.  When I heard all the negatives about Kratom getting people high, I decided to try it to see what the side effects would be to my daughter.  I felt no different.  All anyone has to do to see if this belongs on the same category as Heroin is to try some.   If Kratom is taken away,  I will likely lose my daughter.  She has hope for the first time in years.

I had been taking narcotic medication since 2003.  The last five years I've taken 60 mg of morphine three times a day, and two 5mg Percocets  four times a day.  I no longer take any narcotics for pain.  I've been off narcotics for three months and 15 days.  I couldn't have stopped taking narcotics without Kratom ( Mitragyna-Speciosa). I'm in college now, through vocational rehabilitation, and I stopped taking narcotics in the middle of the first month I was in school.   Without creating the withdrawals would have probably kept me out of school. Taking Kratom to get off narcotics  is the only reason I was able to stop and continue going to school with only minimal withdrawal symptoms.  I now take  Kratom three days a week which are Monday Wednesday and Friday. because of crate him I can function normally at school and be pain-free.\n         Kratom is not addictive, and can be used to help people stop taking narcotics. It also helps with anxiety and depression. I suffer  from both, and Kratom allows me to function normally without pain. I was taking 3  l5mg Clonazapam for years, the switched to, 3 a day,10 mg Valium .  I also take Lexapro for depression, two 100 mg tablets a day .  Because of  Kratom, I no longer need to take any (Valium) anxiety medication, and my doctor cut my dose of Lexapro to only one 100 mg tablet a day. \n         Kratom  has been a godsend for me, and I know for a fact that the scientific research shows that there's hardly any negative side effects.   I know this because in my English comp to class ,  I wrote a research paper on Kratom.  I found all the scientific research and studies using Vincinnes University online library, particularly Academic Search Premier  database. Part of the Essay was that I had to write a section about the opposite view, which was that Kratom is bad.  It was very hard for me to find negative research, comments, and any negative information to prove that Kratom had negative side effects, that it was dangerous, and bad to use.  I used 10 different academic and scientific sources to write this paper. Meaning I've read the research. \n       In conclusion,  there is no need to classify Kratom,  which is truly an herbal supplement,   In the same category as narcotic drugs.  Kratom is just a dried leaf ground into a powder. It is not processed, it's purely an herbal supplement.   If the DEA classifies this supplement as a narcotic, I know for a fact that it will  be harmful to many people. In my case I would have to start taking narcotics  for my pain again. After 13 years of taking narcotics I'm so happy to be done with it. I take 6 g of powdered Kratom when I wake up, and a smoothie of chocolate almond milk and a banana.  Kratom  is the best thing that is happened to me. I never thought I could function, make straight A's in school, all without narcotic pain and anxiety medication.  Essentially my plea is this, please do not classify  this herbal supplement as  a narcotic substance .  I'm happier than I've been in a very long time, and making  Kratom illegal would absolutely destroy my life. I'd put me right back into needing narcotics, anxiety medicine,  which would in turn affect my grades in school because of the side effects and cloudy headedness of narcotics. That could even make me be dropped out of school,  because of a defect my grades,  which would be wasting taxpayer money. I'll provide you with any of the academic, and scientific papers, if you need me to,  contact me and I will send them.  I met personally with my congressman yesterday about this particular topic. beg you, please do not make powderd  Kratom (Mitragyna-Speciosa)  illegal and hard to get.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13322","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Bennett","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI think that research on potential benefits vs adverse effect should be conducted before making Kratom illegal.

If you wish to regulate, regulate concentration and combination with other substances which are not natural, i.e. drugs - thats your agency mandate, not to worry about what grows wild or under human cultivation.\nSecond - Several members of my family are chronic pain sufferers. They need access to natural alternatives to the synthetic pain killers and pharmaceutically enhanced  natural opium byproducts which are killing so many today. If you regulate Kratom, they will no longer have the option of trying something natural with less abuse potential.\nI have other concerns a plenty, starting with the proposition that there ought not even be an FDA to begin with, but this isn't the place to assert such matters.

I am a 29 year old, working, law abiding citizen. At age 24 I developed a chronic pain disorder that will be with me for life. I pursued all traditional forms of therapy and still work closely with my doctor for physical therapy, the occasional injection, etc. \nI would like to make it very clear that kratom doesn't replace modern medicine for people who are chronically ill. We still need our doctors. For my particular condition, opiates are not only undesirable, but completely ineffective for my condition. Its not that I need an opiate that is stronger - quite the opposite. I need something that modern medicine cannot give me. I do not need another opiate; I need nature, exercise, meditation, vitamins, and physical therapy. I need a balance of old and new medicine. I achieve pain relief that takes me through a work day, and has kept the ever daunting reality of disability at bay for now. I am still paying taxes, still paying into the system that keeps this country and the DEA themselves afloat. My choice to use kratom certainly does not hurt anyone else, and actually benefits society by allowing me to continue working and paying into the system. Without it, I would be nothing but a burden on the system.\nI have read a lot about \"15 deaths being associated with kratom\". I would like to know how many of those people also had coffee in their system? Could caffeine intake not also be correlated with health issues? I would like to know how many of them were on SSRI's? I would also like to see some type of scientific evidence that can explain visually, how kratoms alkaloids caused anything to go awry in their bodies. Can you please have an expert paint a picture for us, and detail how it affects the body and what happens, leading to death? I am very curious, as the 100000 people that I interact with are alive and well.\nFurther, I would like to know what exactly the goal is with a kratom ban? If there is nothing to protect us from, than what is the purpose? \nThank you for taking the time to read my commentary and questions. I do not wish to come across as rude, but since this decision will impact the rest of my life, I would like to know that its being made only after the most sound research from a non-biased third party. \nSincerely,,\nAnonymous tax payer from MA","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18461","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia, Paranoid, Schizoid and Depressive Personality disorders, later consolidated somewhat to Schizoaffective disorder (Schizophrenia + Depression) along with the personality disorders in 2010 after having battled these illnesses most of my adult life. As a child I was bullied and dehumanized consistently by my peers, I do not know if this was a symptom of my problems or a cause. All I know is the harsh anti-psychotics I was put on after I went into the hospital following a suicide attempt that (lucky for me) my hallucinations and voices helped stop, as \"they\" did not wish me dead at that time, and allayed my fears of hospitalization. Once I was out things were not so good. I was on a dopamine antagonist even though I was severely depressed. Any physician should understand what a mess that is.  My psychiatrist heard my same complaints of constant depression, lack of willpower to do anything, and chronic insomnia for five years and just kept writing the same scripts. Things have gotten better for me with two new psychiatrists in the span of a year. One thing I must mention is that persistent insomnia is one of my greater battles, it determines whether my next day will be livable or totally suck. I was recommended Kratom by a Naturopathic Doctor, whom my state does not recognize, and while using it only twice a day I was definitely doing better. I could be energized during the day and actually do things like write fiction, my only calling, and in the evening I could gradually get tired and fall asleep with little outside management. This compared to without it when I'd sleep or lie down 18 hours a day and do nothing more than play video games for an hour or two. I had to quit Kratom after a few months because my insurance of course would not cover it even though they can cover 30 pills of Latuda, or pharmacological Satan as I call it, at $1155 dollars a bottle. Kratom reduces all my symptoms from anxiety to depression, prevents me from using alcohol to fall asleep, and altogether gives me a greater quality of life. I have not done it in a few years but with the businesses scared and cutting prices I may actually be able to afford it again. I only ever took it twice a day as a tea, sometimes for months and the only side effects were mild constipation followed by very mild diarrhea when I stopped. Nothing of consequence, in other words. Do not schedule this plant as you will hurt many. I know you are in bed with the Pharma industry but their pills cause only early death (look up Latuda's side effects) while this plant immensely helped my quality of life. I have never OD'd and never suffered from it. I would personally take a natural plant any day over the junk the pharma companies are spitting out without even understanding what their true effects are. We must see a sea change in this country. Let what's natural heal us, not the unnatural that costs billions to create. Please allow me to be one of the people you can proclaim \"healed\" by Kratom. If it becomes illegal that will just be one more excellent answer to my problems gone.

My name is Kristen, and after being pregnant, or breastfeeding for 5 years straight, I found Kratom. After I weaned my last child I became sad and lethargic. At the time I wasn't quite sure whether I was sad that I weaned, or whether I was depressed due to hormone fluctuations. I visited my OBGYN and explained how I was feeling, and they prescribed Zoloft. I know that Zoloft is a godsend to many people, that was not the case with me. It made me feel 100x worse and when I decided I would just stop taking it the symptoms were unbearable. I was having electrocution feelings and severe migraines. Migraines are pretty typical with me, have been since the age of nine. I decided to look for natural remedies for depression and migraines. After much online searching I came across Kratom. I ordered myself some and waited. The shipment arrived and I took half a teaspoon, my life has been better ever since. I fairly quickly got over the sad feeling a few weeks later, making me think it was a mild depression due to hormone fluctuations. This was two years ago. I still take Kratom on a daily basis and have only had FOUR migraines in two years. I couldn't be happier. I am flabbergasted that Kratom is made out to be some big bad heroin/cocaine cross addictive drug. That's very misleading and false. Kratom is addictive, just like my two coffees per day. Coffees also help with my migraines, but for maintenance of my migraines Kratom is my go-to plant. It's all natural, doesn't alter your feelings or energy levels and works subtly but wonderfully. I stopped taking Kratom for two months to try other herbals and my migraines came back with a vengeance. There absolutely was not no severe withdrawal symptoms. For me, I got the typical symptoms I get when I don't drink coffee. I was tired, headaches, not sleeping well, or over sleeping. These symptoms were mainly gone in about three days. For me coffees withdrawals last well over a week. This plant isn't bad. I have no idea why it got a bad rap. My only assumption is the Dr. Phil show that aired about Kratom. Unbelievable. It was then I realized that people believe whatever the TV tells them. It's a simple as having a few people go and try it. You will see that the misinformation is widespread. It's a simple plant. It helps so many people. So, PLEASE don't do this to us. We want to have the choice to treat ailments naturally. Have a wonderful day, and I hope you truly research and see that it's an amazing medicinal plant.  It's not killing people and it's not hurting people. Yes, some people have died with Kratom in their system, but they've also had antidepressants, alcohol and other drugs in their systems. There's no way it was Kratom alone. Every years tens of thousands of people die from prescription related deaths. Please, don't make us take prescriptions that don't agree with our body.   \n\nHave a wonderful day,\n\nKristen DeWitt","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1591","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kristen DeWitt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning any drug harms consumers and makes it almost impossible to hold distributors accountable.

I have considerable experience with pain management and the treatment of addiction. I have personal experience with the use of Kratom. I first began taking Kratom just over 1 year ago, for the treatment of pain arising from bilateral Achilles tendinosis. Before taking Kratom, I was taking a maximum dose of ibuprofen. I have a brief history of opiate addiction and would not allow myself to take prescription opiates. I knew I would be at risk for recurrent addiction and require escalating doses. The pain relief has been excellent and I have maintained my dosing schedule for the past year. I also have a history of depression that was never treated successfully with prescription pharmaceuticals. With Kratom, I have noted additional benefits in the area of mood stabilization, with an overall Improvement in my general feeling of well-being. I know that I could very easily be on 4 or more different prescription medications for the treatment of my orthopedic problem and depression. I doubt that their use would result in the current quality of life that I enjoy with Kratom. I must  point out that each specific  effect  of Kratom is subtle at most. There is no specific effect that  is anymore  significant  then other  effective herbal remedies. There is absolutely no opioid-like euphoric effect. For that reason the addiction potential is nonexistent. For me, it is simply safer than chronic high dosages of ibuprofen. Therefore, my personal experience with Kratom has been excellent.\n\nAs mentioned above, I have experience in the treatment of addiction. Without going into detail, I believe that Kratom is an excellent aid for someone experiencing opiate withdrawal. I would be happy to explain this further if requested.\n\nI believe that the Kratom available from reputable sources, ie coming straight from nature, offers a complex and extremely well-balanced blend of positive benefits, not matched by any available prescription pharmaceutical or combination of such. I strongly support further research into its chemical composition, the varieties of available strains and their medicinal benefits.\n\nI have reviewed the available data on the reported deaths and complications the DEA attributes to Kratom. I absolutely believe that it is not only safe but also extremely beneficial and should remain available to the general public. It is absolutely absurd to place it in the same category as the current schedule I drugs. I am aware of innumerable stories of other people benefitting tremendously from Kratom.\n\nI strongly encourage the DEA to refrain from scheduling Kratom.\n\nSincerely,\nBrandt Lapschies, MD","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21451","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandt Lapschies","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, my name is Evan Michael Biter. As a previous opiate addict, I found kratom to be the best way to relieve all withdrawal symptoms. I have tried drug rehabilitation of all types. The one that worked without causing serious side effects and adding more vices to my list was kratom. I'd mix it with maple syrup. Usually a couple tablespoons to every 3 grams of dried leaf powder.

By banning this natural remedy, not \"drug\" nor \"substance\",  you are taking lives away from the people of this country. This should be promoted not made unobtainable by our people. Kratom in its natural form is the only way it should be legal. Ban the extracts. Ban the chemical form of mitragynine and its fellow alkaloids. Keep these leaves and the powder form open to us as a supplement to benefit our health. Do not control it and let the private sector turn this into another chemical that causes overdoses due to their inability to correctly distribute such chemicals that affect the central nervous system. Kratom has never caused a death because kratom on its own has a variety of alkaloids at low potency. When kept as a powder it is hard to consume more than 10 grams of it. Even in its capsule form. I'm a 22-year-old male from the northeast area of the United States. I have my index and middle fingers on the pulse of the youth of this country. I have nephews and nieces between the ages of 1 month and 15 years old. Trust me when i say that the youth that are doing drugs, aren't looking to go through the internet to purchase this bitter and rough powdered leaf and down 40 grams to get high.  That dose is far more likely to cause intense nausea and a headache than it is to cause any type of rush. At its core, pure, without any additives, kratom relieves anxiety, stress, and balances one's mood at its best dose of 7 grams. I'm 220 pounds so I take more than most to get the best effects. I've never had the urge to try more than 10 grams. It's mellow at its peak and after that its not even worth taking more because of the side effects. None of which, by the way, are dangerous. It might make you vomit or very itchy, but it will not make you want more. I've taken it on and off to deal with the downs of this rollercoaster we call life. I felt level headed, rational, free from basic stress and anxiety, and as if I could finally think clearly for the first time in my life while being able to handle the pains of being on my feet at work for sometimes 10 hours per day, 7 days a week. You're making a mistake if you ban kratom. It helps addicts in remission live and be productive citizens because kratom eliminates the feeling of needing heroin, oxycontin, morphine, or even suboxone. If place a ban on unaltered kratom powder, you're only hurting the society you work so hard for. Please excuse my language but when you are done traveling to D.C. and are feeling beaten down by the country you work your ass off for while trying to keep out freedoms, sit down, and take 5 grams of the powder and see what it does for yourself while its legal instead of basing your laws on perspectives of perspectives. Put yourself in our shoes and hold us undesirables in your hearts... Because some of us work hard to become desirable and reinstill ambition in our lives and this PLANT... It helps. It truly and honestly works. If its not fatal, why the rush to ban it, make it into a pure chemical form to see what it does, and let the private big pharma corporations market it as a new and manmade dangerous narcotic. Leave this plant alone, and you will save lives in more ways than one. Thank you for your time. I appreciate everyone who reads this and I am for trying to make better lives out of the broken souls of the people in this country. With a clean record, clean nose, and clean heart, I put my faith into you all.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8545","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Evan Biter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I have been using Kratom for about 2 years daily now.

I would like to express my opposition to the schedulingn of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (AKA \"Kratom\"). I have been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a painful and debilitating, inherited condition. There is no cure for my illness and I have struggled to manage the symptoms throughout my life. About a year ago, Kratom was recommended to me as a possible treatment for pain and other ailments. It allowed me to begin living my life again without strong and addictive controlled substances. Kratom is not any more addictive than caffeine, and I can say from personal experience that using Kratom regularly does not lead to tolderance or a need for increased amounts. It also does not produce a \"high\" like prescription painkillers. Kratom has a mild, relaxing effect that is similar to drinking chamomile tea. Restricting Kratom will undoubtedly block patients with real health concerns from finding alternative treatments to opioids, including myself. Kratom has allowed me to work full-time, care for my child, and function in society. Please do not add the only thing that has truly helped my disorder to the controlled substance list.\n\nThank you,\nLaura","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13456","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I know several people who have used kratom.

Given the nature of the topic, I would like to withhold my personal identifying information from the public in order to protect my professional reputation.  That being said, I am willing to be portrayed as Stephanie G., Pennsylvania to offer some credibility to my statement.\n\nMy partner has suffered from chronic pain for the past 15 years.  This is a result of a combination of bilateral meniscal tears in his knees due to a dirtbiking accident in his teens; and years of hard labor, working in the carpentry and electrical trades in extreme conditions.\n\nHe was thoroughly vetted by his primary care physician, who has prescribed multiple different NSAIDs that did not relieve the pain.  To seek other methods of relief, he obtained referrals to both orthopedic surgeons and pain management physicians.  These practitioners also prescribed oral and topical NSAIDs, and, at other times, oral or injectable steroids.  MRI imaging revealed no repairable condition, but his pain persists despite treatment.\n\nIn addition to chronic pain, he also suffers from debilitating anxiety.  Again, he has been prescribed several different medications, ranging from antidepressants to antipsychotics and anxiolytics.  At best, some of these took the edge off, and at worst, muddled his consciousness and restricted his ability to function.\n\nFrustrated with repeated treatment failures, he began to seek alternative therapies to relieve his pain.  He found Kratom, and perused every bit of information he could find about it.  After locating a reputable distributor, he began trying different strains.  Please understand how sincere I am when I say that Kratom has made a more positive effect on his life than any of the dozens of prescribed medications that conventional medicine relies on.  With Kratom, the pain and the anxiety wash away, leaving his mind clear and his body active.\n\nI am not speaking on behalf of an addict.  I am describing the hardworking man that rises long before dawn to put in 8 to 12 hours of hard work in sweltering summer heat and freezing winter cold.  The doting father that comes home to spend time with our 5-year-old son, and strives to teach him everything he can to be sure he grows up to be an honorable, respectful member of society.  There is no evidence of addictive or immoral behavior, by any definition of the terms.  He does not drink, and he does not do drugs.\n\nHe takes Kratom to live a normal life, and I plead with you as a partner and a mother  do not rob our family of the one thing that lets him be happy and comfortable.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17902","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephanie Glenz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Im in favor of keeping kratom legal","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13939","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Symank","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was listening to Chris Bell on the Joe Rogan Experience.

I'm 25 years old and currently I work from home. When I'm not working from home, I work with computers. I live in the great state of Washington and I have personally using kratom from just over two years now. I started taking kratom as a replacement for the pain medicine Percocet and serveral types of anxiety medicine. From a young age I have suffered from severe anxiety and depression due some traumatizing childhood events. I was on anxiety meds from the age of 12 until I was twenty two and I felt like an absolute zombie. Then came the pain medicine. I tore my meniscus at the age of sixteen and from then on I injured it more times than I can remember. Which has inevitably led to me now having diagnosed osteoarthritis. It causes me great pain nearly every single day, which caused me to become reliant on my prescribed pain medicine. Which also made me feel like a zombie. Then a friend told me about Kratom. After she explained what it was and how it worked, I went home and did some research of my own and ended up ordering some. At first I was very skeptical. I couldn't imagine how this random plant could help me. But it did. It took away my pain and anxiety and I had my first restful nights sleep in years. I now take Kratom daily to help me get through the day with no pain or depression. It helps me walk, it helps me sleep, and keeps free of my deep depression I grew up with. Without Kratom I would be stuck with addicting pharmaceuticals. And that is not a life I want to have again. Kratom is not deadly. It does not get you \"high\". I believe more research needs to be done and that Kratom should not be banned. If it is banned, it will hurt thousands and thousands of people who rely on it for many different medical reasons. Thank you for taking the time to read my story and I hope it sheds some light on why it helps people. Please consider not banning this helpful plant or its properties.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1269","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have taken 30mg of Hydrocodone every day for 5+ years to help treat a back injury.

It can be used to treat anxiety, chronic pain,  depression, and could help people recover from opioid medications. Kratom is not something that could hurt a person if used responsibly. If the DEA is worried about people abusing Kratom, then it should be regulated just like alcohol is. Kratom is safe. It is a tree native to Southeast Asia, and is in the same family as the coffee tree. It is much safer than alcohol. According to The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,  nearly 88,000 people die from alcohol-related causes each year, and alcohol is legal. From 2014-2016, there have only been 15 recorded cases of people dying from Kratom. To put that in perspective, over 15,000 people die annually from NSAID's like asprin. Kratom is clearly much safer than alcohol, and asprin yet thr DEA is trying to criminalize it. I think there are more important matters to focus on, like helping people who are addicted to awful drugs like heroin, meth, crack, etc. The DEA should be worrying about drugs that kill people in mass amounts every year.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21276","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a US citizen over 18 years of age who has been using Kratom for 6 months as a general wellness herbal supplement.

It has saved so many lives & changed them for the better. It's a tree leaf. I've seen it save & return many people to a normal noon drugged life when they were assured they'd eventually die from the legal & non legal drugs that most got hooked on because their doctors instead or properly weaning/titration them from there medications they'd been prescribed so they looked for something to stop the pain & agony they were feeling. \n\nMy cousin was an Heroine addict whom by now would have died surely, being that I know I personally have brought him back to life after he overdosed on it.. since he found kratom (a tree led) he has not done any Heroine in over three years. He's now become a functional human with a job, a life, & he may not be totally free from pain, but he is not taking approved big Pharma meds which got him turned into a drug addiction after his doctor abruptly cut off his pain meds after he'd fallen 3 stories off a bldg he was helping build (construction worker) - he's also has cancer twice - each time the So called pain meds abruptly stopped not properly titratated off- instead to writh in pain & seroius dt's.. he would then go find Heroine to help himself not be writhing in pain. \n\nHe along with 1000s of people if the kratom is deemed schedule one will be back on the streets looking for a solution to their pain, alcohol addiction, muscle spasms,& issues with their anxieties .. with the fact that the Heroine out there these data is just killing people from one dose, I'm & my entire family are horrified for him & many others whom have found a natural way to relieve their pain reliever to stop his street drug to combat his daily pain & the drug addiction that doctors put him into. \n\nIf the natural leaf is outlawed just like Marijuana was, there are thousands of people that are going to die from street drugs & go back on their Heroin - Crack - methamphetamine - & anything else they can find & DIE. Is this what the dea & government want to KILL thousands of people by outlawing a natural plant? As an example - alcohol alone kills people daily & it is legal, big Pharma meds that are making rich people richer & poor people poorer are also killing people daily. \n\nIf the government makes this a schedule 1 drug even temporarily the government will be committing murder against so many people by taking a naturally grown leaf with no alterations or chemicals in it. It works by effecting the opiate receptors in the Braden to make a person not feel the extreme pain or want for their non-legal & legal pain medications that caused their addictions in the first place.

During that time I have been very involved in helping many addicts. I write regarding the status of the herb Kratom.\n\nIn recent years, I have helped many people get off of prescription drug addictions, primarily opioids.  Withdrawal from opioid addiction is a horrible, horrible experience.  I went through it once after having to be on a pain killer for nearly a year due to a severe chronic sinus problem.  Fortunately, we were able to correct my problem with surgery and I no longer need medication.  But the physical withdrawal was dreadful.  The medications my doctor prescribed to \"help\" the withdrawal did very little - almost nothing in fact.\n\nAfter that experience, I learned that Kratom could be used to alleviate the withdrawal symptoms - it seems to be better than any other for this use.  I have recommended it now to a number of people who are getting off of prescription opioids, and it has been remarkably successful.  It is now the \"go to\" street approach for many getting off opioids, with very limited side effects.  Certainly none of the problems associated with methadone, etc.\n\nI did quite a bit of research myself before recommending this as an avenue for others to use.  The small number of incidents where problems occurred (emergency room visits) seemed almost entirely to be confused by concurrent use of \"designer party drugs\" in addition to the Kratom - drugs which are known to cause seizures, etc.  While my research was anecdotal, I could not find an incident where someone had a serious problem that was clearly the result of reasonable Kratom consumption alone.  \n\nThe FDA and DEA must not ban or heavily regulate this hugely beneficial herb, particularly not in a sudden way.  To do so will leave thousands with no way to effectively get off of opioids.  Any such decision must be based on SCIENCE, not on anecdote or scaremongering.  THAT SCIENCE IS CURRENTLY NOT IN PLACE. Even placing Kratom on Schedule 2 as a prescription without several months of warning will create a vacuum until the standard medical/pharmacy pipeline is figured out.  And \"big pharma\" will have little interest in providing Kratom.\n\nI urge you to set up proper scientific studies and undertake the SCIENCE that is needed here, and to make any decision about changing the categorization of the herb based on the research.  I believe firmly that such research will reveal a number of beneficial uses of Kratom for chronic pain relief, but also document the hugely useful method of combating our current epidemic of opioid addiction.  Right now, in the midst of this epidemic, is NOT the time to remove one of the most effective methods of coping with withdrawal.\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5075","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Jackman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not place this plant as a schedule 1 drug without proper review.

For those who suffer from chronic pain and/or addiction the use of opiates is often a necessity to physically function enough to participate in community and work a job.  To vote, to take care of children, to work and pay taxes.  Their tax dollars supply your budget.  The ones whose injuries and insurance might be prescribed their drugs, under intense scrutiny, and are considered law abiding citizens.  The overwhelming majority have few alternatives.  Street heroin, methadone clinics, or Kratom.  Your entire organization's efforts against the trafficking and distribution of heroin should be a top priority yet on a street level heroin is cheaper and more pure than ever.  Overdoses are killing far more Americans than ISIS or the Taliban.  The middle east exports black gold, opium and oil.  Methadone and Suboxone are legal alternatives, yet as expensive without insurance and exponentially more difficult to withdrawal from.

A year ago I was introduced to Kratom. It works WONDERS for me relieving my (often) unbearable pain. \n\nI usually take 4 Norco and 4 Oxycodone a day.  Mine and my Doctor's ultimate goal is to completely take me off the Oxycondone. For the past year I have taken my Norco and in place of the Oxys I'm using Kratom with FAR less damaging side effects both physically and internally. Should Kratom become illegal, I will be forced to return to the horrendously toxic opiate, Oxycodone. \n\nThe plus side to making Kratom legal is that it could take 10's of thousands of these \"legal\" opiates out of circulation and off the streets which, for the past 2 years, is what the government is pushing for by forcing medical Doctors to take away the pain pills that those in chronic pain so desperately need! \n\nThe Kartom users can cut down the distribution of heavy opiates in the general population and allow those who require Norco, Oxycontin and other pain medication to continue receiving these prescriptions in order to survive each painful day.

Around 6 years ago I was diagnosed with Lyme Disease which was reported to the CDC. I did receive the proper antibiotic regimen which greatly improved my health; however, I still had several lingering symptoms. Working with my doctor, I went through several pain, inflammation, and anxiety medications that would subside my symptoms but did not give any further benefit. My days were numb, forgetful, and groggy. I had problems sleeping, grew fat and lazy, and didn't function at 100%. I did not feel like a productive member of society, so I went looking for alternatives. I worked with a naturopath to find natural alternative cures to my symptoms. After a couple of years of experimenting with various supplements, exercises, and diets, I came across Kratom. Since using Kratom I have been able to become healthy again. I am a father, a great employee, and a husband again. I'm able to control my symptoms, and keep them at bay. I have been able to get regular sleep, can function better at work, be able to keep up with my children, and help out my family when needed. I know exactly where I would be without the use of Kratom today, stuck in a rut while constantly band-aiding multiple symptoms without resolving the root of the problem and getting myself healthy. \n\nKratom has helped me greatly and I've heard several stories about it helping others. Kratom should remain available while further tests / studies are done, so that so many like me can remain healthy and productive.

There are many anecdotal case reports on internet forums and other online communities of acute hepatitis, hepatic cholestasis, and other serious liver conditions developing in very close correlation (bordering on causation - but there is a lack of controlled research) with kratom use. \n\nKratom may not cause hepatotoxicity in all users, but the prevalence of anecdotal reports on the internet, my personal experience trying it (resulting each time in upper right quadrant pain and elevated liver enzymes), is concerning. This substance should not be allowed to the public freely. Especially not in \"head shops\" and other locations that sell \"legal highs.\"\n\nThere have been rat and mouse studies done on kratom which directly show damage to liver cells. \n\nThe talk about kratom \"saving lives\" and helping people is a lame excuse to keep a legal high, legal. Claiming that it is of plant origin is not a good reason to maintain its legality. There are many naturally occurring plants that are exceptionally toxic, and many man made chemicals which are exceptionally benign. \n\nThere is no quality control surrounding kratom. The shops that sell it are merely capitalizing on a high margin, addictive substance. Users think they are doing themselves a favor because kratom is \"natural,\" but that is not good logic for assuming it has not toxicology concerns. \n\nMoreover, people are just trading their other addictions for kratom addiction. The majority of people pressuring the DEA to keep kratom unscheduled, are selling it, or addicted to it. People can potentially develop irreversible damage to their vital organs by using this, all the while thinking they are doing something healthy. \n\nThe drug interactions between kratom and other substances and prescription medication are unknown. This is highly dangerous, as kratom has more than one (in fact, many) active alkaloids. \n\nIf kratom is to be sold, it should be studied, and then forced to adhere to rigorous quality control standards. People may be ingesting leaf powder (which is all coming from Southeast Asia) that has pesticides, mold, bacteria, or other toxins present.

However, after listening to Chris Bell and doing some independant research of my own I have found that Kratom has a massive potential for helping people deal with opioid withdrawal. Making this drug illegal would cripple efforts to study it and cause a significant number of people to turn back to opioid addiction without this option. \n\nIt is my belief that the only crime Kratom is guilty of is having a shitty name. When someone says Kratom the first images that come to my mind are eastern europeans in some Chernobyl type housing project injecting themselves with this stuff. But, that isn't the case. Kratom isn't sending people into crazy highs or a drugged out state. Instead most users seem to agree that it acts like a 5 hour energy shot combined with advil. There is nothing dangerous that results from this drug at least not at first glance. Long term affects aren't as clear so more research is necessary. \n\nPlease do not make something illegal without at least researching it first. I understand that there are claims it has killed people, but those claims need to be investigated more thoroughly. Besides overdoses on opioids kill millions more than the fifteen or so anecdotal accounts credited to Kratom. \n\nI'm not sure whose job it is to read these comments or what your personal views are on this matter.

I discovered kratom about 6 years ago.  After doing research into the nature of the substance and its mechanisms of action, I gave it a try.  I never experienced any sort of 'high' similar to what I am only familiar with from the Vicodin I was prescribed when I had my wisdom teeth removed (and once when I hurt my back).  I did, however, feel more energetic and motivated like I do when I drink caffeinated beverages, but without the 'jittery' feeling.  This has been a great benefit as I have gone through the process of starting my own business.  Most notably, it does not interfere with my thinking, something which is of the utmost importance to me.  I do not consume alcohol or other intoxicants because of their mental effects.  Even in a relaxed setting or for entertainment, I simply do not like anything which degrades my ability to reason.  I was surprised when the DEA announced their intent to make kratom a Schedule I substance through abuse of their power to do so under 'emergency' conditions.  There is clearly no emergency whatsoever in terms of kratom.  Those powers were used appropriately when synthetic cathinones ('bath salts') were scheduled.  But in the case of kratom, harm is non-existent.  I do not insist that no harm could ever be found, but that is clearly something which has not happened yet.  The deaths that the DEA reported in their motion as kratom being \"involved\" with were all, to a one, concerned with people who died with cocktails of many different drugs in their systems.  Not a single one of them could be argued by an honest person to have been unlikely had kratom been omitted from the mix.  Research also does not support this, showing that kratom does not contain an agonist of the specific opioid receptors which result in respiratory system depression.  Unless or until legitimate peer-reviewed research shows a clear health threat greater than all legal substances, I can not support scheduling kratom (or any other substance for that matter, that standard applies across the board).","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2413","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dustin Rodriguez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a retired business owner who was prescribed narcotics for severe arthritis pain for several years.

It is literally the same as coffee; sure, you can drink too much and it will make you feel a bit sick, and if you were to combine it with more serious drugs, it could be dangerous or deadly.

My name is James Clark Tippens. I'm 52 year's old suffer from chronic pain due to Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Frequent Shoulder Dislocation. Due to generalized laxity of ligaments, I have combanation of diagnosis known as Bankarts & Hill-Sachs lesion. Also some deterioration of the L4 & L5 disks in my back. Needless to say I'm familiar with chronic sometimes debilitating pain. I had ben taking Pharmaceutical Brand Pain Relievers for close to 10 years. It was a verry difficult time for me to maintaine my family relations with a constant feeling of alienating myself only wanting relief from the constant pain I was feeling & knowing that I was never really myself on these Pharmaceutical Pain Relievers as thay tend to put my mind into a sort of Zombified Trance whenever I was at family get togethers? Not to mention my wife beging me to stop taking these horrible mind numbing personMedsy erasing dangerously deadly drug's. I was constantly trying to please my wife in getting off of these medications but alway's relying on them when my pain level's got to a point where I needed relief. It all came to a head when I visited my doctor for a situation where I felt verry sick & he took some tests. He immediately came in the room after he stepped out to speak to his nurse. He said you need to go to the hospital immediately. Lucky for me my wife was there with me as she was concerned about my sickness. My wife then drove me to the Hospital as thay rushed me into the ICU. Apparently my blood showed sings of Complete Renal Failier. I spent 4 day's in ICU at Saint Josuph's Hospital in Burbank Ca. I had wondered what had caused my Renal Failure? I had occured to me that it might be due to the amount of Acitametaphine mixed in the Pharmaceutical Pain Relievers which was recently lowered due to the amount of death's caused & increasingly growing to 16 thousand a year deaths caused by Pharmaceutical Pain Meds.\nAt that point I knew I had to finally find a way to get off of these medications for good. I Emptied my soul feeling totally powerless against this deadly medication that was sure to kill me if I didn't stop taking them? I truly believe a mirricole occurred at the point I Preyed to God. Please Loard why can't there be a natural God made Pain Reliever that would take my pain away without killing me or turning me into a Zombie that takes me away from the present's of mind to be able to enjoy my life & loved ones? I looked at my phone that i asked Google this verry question. Two seconds later I saw the name Kratom on the screen. I researched further & thought I can't be soo? But after thinking try a little. It can't hurt? Maybe it's a direct answer to my prayer? Needless to say. It truly was. I believe that whole heartedly.

Kratom is a natural herb that is very close to, but different enough from the molecular composition of opium that it doesn't get you high like opiates do, is non-addictive, inexpensive and allows heroin and other opiate addicted people to kick the habit with no withdrawals and minimizes the craving for the drug. It is all natural and has no negative side effects, is non- addictive and it is also a very effective natural treatment for breathing ailments such as asthma and insomnia and anxiety disorder. In a nutshell the hardest heroin user can switch to Kratom with no withdrawals and quit after 2 weeks with no cravings. The problem is it's natural, non- addictive, it gets people off the pharmaceutical tit and the street drugs and there's no money to be made from it, much like many other natural, but effective cures and treatments as has recently come to light with cancer.\n*There are numerous problems for the pharmaceutical and heroin industry if Kratom is allowed to continue to be sold.  Because it is gaining popularity with people who want to get off insomnia and anxiety medication and pain killers, heroin and other addictive and unhealthy drugs rather than treat themselves with addictive, expensive and dangerous pharmaceutical drugs it is being illegalized and turning many law abiding sick people who choose to treat their illnesses with natural, inexpensive and healthy herbs into felony criminals.\n*In the pharmaceutical world there are two drugs, which are basically the same, but one prescription has two drugs for treating opiate addiction. They are suboxone, which contains the strongest known opiate subutex and naloxone. Subutex is the Opiod and naloxone nullifies the effects of all other opiates accept subutex, and the other prescription is plain subutex. Subutex is acknowledged as the most addictive opiate or opioid in the world, more so than herion and oxycontin or oxycodone. But it is the medical worlds main alternative to heroin, oxycodone,  oxycontin and hydrocodone addiction. They switch the addicts to a more expensive and more addictive drug and call it pharmaceutical rehabilitation.\n*The reason I keep bringing up subutex and suboxone is that it is a large part of why there's so much opposition to illegalizing kratom. I used to have a roommate who was a heroin addict for 20 years. After getting out of prison he went to a doctor and got a prescription. The doctor visit was $300 and the prescription for 90 8mg tablets of suboxone  was about $300, My roommate was unemployed and just out of prison, but he got the doctor's appointment and prescription and it continued for years. The only way he could afford to pay the doctor, the prescription, rent and other bills was by selling his extra suboxone pills for $20 each. \n*The average prescription for suboxone or subutex is 90 to 120 tablets of 8 milligrams that cost between $250and $400 a month.  Each tablet is equal to about 1 gram of high quality heroin. The hardest addict can't use more than 1 to 2 tablets of subutex or suboxone per day. It costs $250 to $300 for the doctor's office visit each month and $250 to $400 for the prescription for every month. It is well known to everyone inside and outside the medical community that the only way 95% of jobless and homeless patients can afford this drug is to sell it to other drug addicts, especially since it is impossible that any human could take and feel the effects of even half of this standard prescription.\n*Before the U.S. invaded Afghanistan they grew and produced no opium, it was a death penalty offence. Since the U.S government conquered Afghanistan, they have not only become the number 1 producer of opium in the world, but they produce more than the rest of the world combined. To understand this you must know that many of our soldiers spend their tours protecting the poppy fields of the drug lords. Look it up on Yahoo and YouTube to see countless soldiers' testimonials and their objections to aiding this insidious business.\n*I can't prove who is behind the heroin trade, but some group with the power to control our military is and they will definitely profit from the illegalization of Kratom. If you have a family member or someone you care about who is or has been addicted to an opiate drug, please, contact you legislatures, go to websites and sign petitions to stop this illegal ban on this natural cure of one of the most destructive plagues in our world. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19982","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lance Whitman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello. I have been permanently disabled and on SSI since 1993. I want to offer you a slightly different perspective on the Kratom ban and what it means to government money. My 23 diagnoses are not material here. My 40+ different pain medications and supplements throughout that time are also not important. This... is:\n\nI have benefited from kratom's alkoloid properties for chronic, debilitating pain for almost one year now. I have successfully postponed additional surgeries intended to help in relieving more pain (very small chances for very expensive, government paid procedures). Where I used to spend up to 85% of my life in bed or on the sofa incapacitated, I now run errands, clean my home, help my neighbors, have a garden and even went on a camping trip. Before the September ban announcement, I was looking for employment, and to begin the process of ending SSI and medicare benefits. I was looking to become a part of my community again. I was no longer bogged down with prescribed narcotics that make me high, addicted and dysfunctional. I am under several Dr's care, who are aware that I have safely withdrawn from and ceased the use of prescription narcotics and are supportive in managing my health and all of its improvements through our new health plan. \n\nBecause I was no longer bound to bed/sofa, I became more physically active, lost weight, and built up core muscles which are crucial to my particular disabilities. I was getting better as a side effect to kratom, not just \"managing\" my pain from a depressing indoor prison. Please fund testing, make it available for research and regulate for the safe purchase a supplemental tea that has the potential to not only help individuals like myself, but potentially benefit the federal balances as well.\n\nId like to add that I searched out healthier options to my health plan after I was told I needed to have a morphine pump implanted into my body, forcing me to take drugs even if I didnt want them. I find the idea of this to be barbaric, cruel and using the duress of the chronically ill to become sprockets in the Pharma machine through addiction. There NEED to be safer, healthier alternatives than this. You can help make certain that there are through safer, less addictive, healthier choices like the alkoloids in kratom can offer. If I get a flu with the morphine pump, the constraints to my breathing from the narcotic can KILL me. Kratoms alkoloids provide the pain relief without the high, addiction or the breathing suppression that opium based narcotics have.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12192","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kim Burlington","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Morphine is schedule 2 because of its use as an analgesic.

Because chronic pain is a very distracting, loud scream in my head that is very distracting and can override my brain and is a very out of control feeling. I do not like to live with that screaming - it is very difficult.  I have lost so much to pain. The only option, after trying every prescription medication- about 20 in all - was to live the rest of my life on a Fentanyl patch.  Having tried every prescription medication recommended I was lost.  I knew after 10 yrs of trying that I would have to give up my clear head and decision making abilities and  became an addict knowingly. That has alot of very depressing thoughts that come with it.I have always been a strong leader and I loved being meaningful. But that is not available on long term opioids, that is a known. There is a fog that covers your mind on these medications and made me feel constantly frustrated and unable to think clearly. However, that scream is in my head at about a decibel of 8 every moment in my day. so I am still at a disadvantage. \nHowever, two yrs. ago a kind soul heard my struggle on social media and let me know there was one more choice. I could drink a horrible tasting tea, made from a leaf off a tree, and it may help my struggle. I researched thouroughly the science behind, read as much as I could, talked to as many people as I could including doctors, and was encouraged to try it. This kratom tea has helped me more than any medication had. I had my mind, I could think clearly, I could read again -  and comprehend. AND the pain was relieved. I grew to understand how civilizations before survived - with a yucky tasting leaf. I have been using kratom now for two years as a dietary supplement. It has provided me great relief, I have my mind and my intelligence and I am thriving. I need these alkaloids in my life. I understand clearly the job of the DEA, and their purpose. And I stand along side them in their mission battle, with my kratom. It is absolutely not harmful. It is a lifesaving supplement to my life.  Please let the science speak and do not schedule my plant, Kratom. It is helping me live my life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18739","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Caryl Mittge","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not schedule Kratom.  Please regulate it as a supplement as would be the proper thing to do.  I am a 54 year old, college-degreed grandmother with multiple, very painful, conditions:  Spinal stenoisis, degenerative disc disease, 2 seriously degenerated discs, 1 herniated disc.  I also have fibromyalgia courtesy of FDA-approved statin drugs.  I have had years of physical therapy, injections, etc. and was under opiate pain-management care from the head of neurology at a well-renowned hospital in my town for many years. He was not a \"pill-mill\" doctor, and  I was a model patient who followed all the rules.  My doctor retired, and the doctor who took over his practice decided to place a policeman in the waiting room.  I was not going to feel like a criminal because I had chronic pain, and I'd begun to really fear for what I could do differently.  I started to research what could help me with my chronic pain other than opiates, which had left me unable to do so much and had so many bad side-effects. I wanted something safe and effective.  After much exploration,  I discovered Kratom and ordered it from a well-reviewed vendor.  I thought it would be difficult to transition to this supplement from major opiate use, but it wasn't.  In fact, Kratom helped my pain more, and it also gave me a gentle boost of energy that was so needed after years of opiates.  It gave me back my life.  Now I run a busy business with my husband and can chase after our grandson several days a week.  None of it would be possible without Kratom.

I was taking multiple pain medications and having to alternate them as there were different side effects from taking them.  It ranged from severe nausea to headaches to extreme lethargy.\n\nAfter finding the Kratom powder, I no longer had to take the pain medications.  Due to the different variations of strains, I was able to not just manage my pain at night, but also during the day without having to jeopardize my awareness at work.  I was actually able to function with more energy and focus than I did before.\n\nEven after my recovery, I'm still able to benefit from the use of Kratom.  There have been instances where I've come down with a stomach bug and I've had little to no energy.  Once my main symptoms subsided, I was able to return to work earlier and participate in my children's activities with the assistance of Kratom. I can take it when all I want to do is lay in bed with extreme fatigue and I'm able to continue on with my day and participate in life with my family.\n\nKratom has given me an alternate to the addictive narcotic pain medications for my post surgical recovery and it has also allowed me to battle normal sickness and symptoms and drastically reduce my downtime.  It has also allowed me to maintain my focus and energy level at times when I'm feeling down and low on energy.  I do not have signs of addiction as I have no need to take it every day and I do not have any withdrawal symptoms when I am not taking it.\n\nKratom has been such a benefit to my life and I can't imagine how beneficial it has been to those with chronic illness and pain. It is simply the perfect herbal supplement that can be added to any lifestyle for any reason.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18626","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin Shillings","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"How could you even consider banning kratom?

This has been verified by medical professionals. I have tried self-medicating and using 'their' chemical methods. Both yielded very negative results. Finding Kratom has been a minor miracle in my life. For once, I feel just--normal. Contrary to popular opinion among government officials, it is not a 'get high' item. It is most definitely NOT a chemical 'salts' or synthetic substance. There are no deaths associated with its use, when used alone. It has centuries of actual human usage to quantify the safety and efficacy of it when used properly. I am pleading with you to let me keep feeling well.

This would put kratom, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller. I came to using kratom as an alternative to opiod pain killers for a spinal injury that I suffered years ago. I currently work as a massage therapist and nurse in a large chiropractic/physical therapy/pain management facility. I spent years having to take Percocet, OxyContin and Neurontin; all of which caused disastrous side effects in my body. They caused severed gastrointestinal issues, which went on to require surgery which could've been avoided had I not been taking these drugs. In addition to that, the Neurontin caused me to have severe depression and suicidal thoughts. No one should have to suffer from side effects like these. The first time I drank kratom tea I felt relief and a huge weight lifted from my shoulders. I stopped taking all of those dangerous medications, and have been able to manage my pain by taking kratom when I need to. It has helped tremendously with my pain and allows me to practice yoga, workout at the gym and even run 5k's virtually pain free! Kratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. Im asking you to please contact the DEA. Please send a letter or request an oversight hearing asking to delay this emergency action. I fear this action by the DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic. I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without kratom. If you have questions about kratom, please visit www.americankratom.org.

She has been on her medication for almost a decade and does not like the fact that she is dependent upon it to live life. If she doesn't take her medication she gets very sick and cannot function so cold turkey was not an option. We found Kratom and while she is not totally off of her medication she is able to go longer between each dose while still being able to function. I have also used Kratom for chronic sciatic nerve pain and have noticed that while my pain goes away I do not lose normal functionality. A few years ago I had to take low dose opiate pain killers, prescribed by my doctor, to stop the pain but they left me unable to function like I normally do. I even had to stop my normal position at my job which was driving around making deliveries for a supply company. While on the opiate medication I could not concentrate and was very drowsy. I do not work at that job anymore but I wish I had found Kratom back then so I could be pain free and fully functional. It is not an addictive substance as opiates are.

I live a normal healthy life, stay active and treat everyone around me with respect and kindness. When i was 16 years old i was diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune disease that attacks your joints and muscles thus making it painful to stay active. there were times that i was unable to get out of bed, attend school and even had to miss out of work. a few years went by and during that time i was heavily medicated with multiple prescriptions and  had no signs of improving or going into remission from my flares. I was introduced to Kratom tea about 2 years ago by a friend who was dealing with chronic pain as well. the tea made me feel much more relaxed and clear headed then the medicine did. it made me feel more at ease with my pain, while i still take medications i have definitely cut back on a lot of them and manage my pain and stress with the natural tea and some medicine qas well. My life has completely changed. so you can imagine how upsetting and scary it is for the DEA to come in and try and schedule this natural supplement as a schedule 1 substance. i am outraged by this action, in an already opiate plagued nation the last thing we need to be doing is taking natural alternatives away, and specially with the lack of research or facts to back up this decision. i truly wish that our voices are heard and that my life, along with millions of others is not negatively impacted by this decision. This natural tea needs to remain available, if there needs to be more regulations then i say thats fine, but to completely ban something natural truly violates our rights and seems unethical from our government institutions. my personal fear is that i don't want to be dependent on my medications, and to not have options for my own wellness and ultimately have to surrender my choices for a better healthy life is terrifying.

I work as a front desk clerk at a hotel.  For the past couple of years, from the stresses of life among other things such as depression and anxiety, had started turning to alcohol, drinking almost nightly with a strong dependency that I'm sure would have eventually become a full blown addiction.  In May, I saw a friend mention Kratom for his chronic depression and how it helped him.  I thought, why not give it a try and see what it does for me.  This herb has been a magical lifesaver for me.  I take it daily - in the mornings to get going, and at night after work to pick me up and calm me down at the same time.  I have not touched alcohol for 2 months, my chronic foot pain from standing at work all day is gone at night, and I have such a better outlook on life.  Sometimes I take a small dose at work to help keep me going.  Taking kratom away would be detrimental to me and my quality of life.  I would likely return to alcohol and my job performance would suffer.  There is absolutely nothing dangerous from kratom - it's amazingly changed my life, and many others - and helped remove them from dangerous opiate and alcohol addictions.  I don't even want to think of what my life would be like if I lost Kratom.  It has returned me to being a positive, productive member of society.

I have found kratom to be very safe myself, in the last 3 years Of my daily use I have only noticed benefits from this incredible botanical. The most important for me was the improvement of my sleep, increased endurance and focus at my job, and also, I have seen an increase in my own sociability because of less anxiety. I have told many people about kratom because of the benefits I have received from it. I have given kratom to many people and everyone has had positive benefits. I have never heard of anyone having a negative reaction to kratom except nausea.  Many testimonies of kratom use have associated the plant to curb or end addiction, especially heroin addiction.

Yet the National Institute of Health (NIH) Biomedical Research Excellence (in partnership with the Universities of Massachusetts and Mississippi) gave two grants to a team led by Chris McCurdy to investigate the use of Kratom as a remedy for opioid withdrawal. Preliminary scientific analysis shows that Kratom could offer substantial harm reduction, considering more than 28,000 deaths in 2014 alone from accidental overdoses of opioids including legal painkillers and illegal drugs like heroin. Mitragynine Pseudoindoxyl,compounds derived from the active ingredients in kratom (mitragynine) look promising.  The compounds appeared to more effectively relieve pain in mice, compared to morphine, without many of the dangers and unpleasant effects caused by opioids. Also, mitragynine pseudoindoxyl developed analgesic tolerance more slowly than morphine, showed limited physical dependence, reduced respiratory depression, and reduced constipation. This study led the researchers to apply for a patent identifying the Kratom extract, mitragynine, as a useful treatment for other addictive drugs besides opiate derivatives.  In another article, I read that there are at least three patents pending for medical uses for the Kratom derivative. I can't remember all sources, but one was Larry Greenmeier, Technology Editor of the Scientific American. September 30, 2013 and another source was The Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,a study conducted by Susruta Majumdar, PhD, assistant attending chemist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. If kratom remains classified as Schedule I, researchers would have to apply for a Schedule I research license and hope that the DEA would be able to supply enough quality kratom to all of those hoping to study it, although it is unclear how that would occur. And it takes five years to grow the plant in a lab setting.\n\nI have not forgotten the 15 known deaths related to kratom between 2014 and 2016, stated by the DEA. I read that two partners of the law firm, Hogan Lovells, representing the American Kratom Association (AKA) had serious concern over the 30 fatalities that the DEA had linked to kratom possession or ingestion. After further review of the reports, it was determined that Kratom alone was not the cause of the 30 deaths. \n\nAlthough you asked for facts instead of anecdotal remarks or stories, I will try to make it short. I am a 62 year old caucasian female and my occupation was Registered Diagnostic Medical Sonographer, also registered in Xray Technology and Mammography for approximately 30 years. In 2009 I lost my job because of episodic memory lapses and cognitive impairment. I was having skeletal pain which started several years earlier. After I lost my job, I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. The IBS, sleep apnea, insomnia and polyneuropathy followed. I had been on Norco, an opiate-based prescription medication for more than several years when my pain management specialist discontinued the listed painkiller. Since April 2016, I am in daily pain with the exception of three days in the past 30 day period. After reading a few Internet blogs, I chose to try Kratom. I have never smoked pot or taken any illegal drugs. Kratom, when I take it, some of my pain is relieved and I don't experience any euphoric \"high\". If there was no kratom, I planned to drive to the beach in another state and just stop eating and drinking water. I have no quality of life when I am in pain! I have tried other Fibromyalgia medications and complementary therapies without success, so the remaining options are miniscule. Based on 2011 statistics, I am just one of 100 million U.S. adults, living with chronic pain. Kratom helps relieve pain.\n         \nMr. Rosenberg, thank you for taking the time to read my comment. If you have already decided  that Kratom is as dangerous as heroin and LSD, again I ask you, please reconsider.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11326","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Frances B.

Heroin and methamphetamines are two primary examples of drugs that should be properly regulated to help protect the public and our society. \n\nThat being said, the government should not unreasonably restrict substances that haven't been shown to be significantly detrimental and have been shown to have significant benefits. \n\nThis is the case with Kratom. It has been shown to reduce/eliminate the withdrawal effects of opiate abuse while being much safer and less addictive. This has allowed many opiate addicts to better their lives, deal with pain, and stop using opiates. \n\nLittle to no one is claiming that no studies should be done on Kratom. I can confidently speak to the fact that everyone i have spoken to believes proper trials and studies should be conducted to better determine its uses and dangers. That being said, since it has been generally known to have little dangers and significant benefits, scheduling it as schedule 1 is ludicrous. Not only will this prevent people who may seriously need it from getting it (such as opiate addicts), but it also prevents studies from easily being done on it and will likely lead to it being permanently schedule 1 despite its legitimate uses. \n\nAll of this is especially relevant considering the growing opiate addiction and abuse epidemic that is present in many (especially central) states of America. \n\nSo with all of this in mind, scheduling Kratom as schedule 1 is unreasonable. Instead it should be scheduled as 2 (or more, ie schedule 3 or 4 or etc.) so that trails may be done to properly determine its effectiveness while people who are still in need of it are able to get it so they don't instead turn to opiate abuse again.

PLEASE LEAVE KRATOM UNSCHEDULED.\nI am a 35 year old mother of a 16 yr/old daughter. I have used kratom to assist in my daily life for the past 5 years. I broke my neck at the age of 14 when at the time doctors decided it would be better to medicate me and not do surgery. So at the age of 14 i was prescribed Norco -10/325 mg, 8-12 a day as needed & Soma - 350 mg, 8-12 a day as needed for the next 7 1/2 years, which soma has been taken off the market due to the massive amount of brain damage it causes,. During that period i was on multiple other medications to control the many side effects of the original medications. I have had a cervical fusion @ C 5-6, hysterectomy (before age 22), 3 wrist surgeries, shoulder repair surgery, spinal nerve stimulation implanted & removed which resulted in a 19 month paralization of my right leg from thigh down. Multiple spinal injections from low back up to 1st vertebrae in my neck which never lasted or worked to alleviate any of my pains. Things i am diagnosed with include degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, chronic neuropathy, muscle atrophy, sciatica damage, muscle fasciculation, Peripheral neuropathy, diverticulitis, dyslexia, adhd, anxiety & depression. Five years ago i was at the peak of my pain and operations and living in my parents home because i could not support myself or even have a normal job or life. I had to live with people to make sure someone else could take care of my daughter. I have worked numerous jobs for short periods of time my entire life based on the acceptance of jobs being bale to deal or tolerate my health issues and operations, until i was on over 17 prescriptions at 1 time and my child, who was 10 at the time, checked on me and found me lifeless and not breathing. I had been given by my doctor Adderall XR 40 mg a day & at the same time liquid Morphine 25 mg as needed for pain. The combination my doctor said was ok made my child find a near dead mother twice! at that point i decided to completely detox myself from any medications and look for a natural supplement that could help assist my pain and life. I came across a tree leaf called KRATOM and it helped to flip my life around a full 180. I no longer take any medications, not even allergy. I never push my body or pain above my limit and now ive had the same job for over 3 years, i live on my own with my daughter, i support myself and i still hurt every day but nothing like i did when i had to physically depend on prescriptions. if i didn't have a pill my body would react in withdrawal and severe illness however if i do not have my kratom my body is fine. I do not have withdrawal ever from kratom. No one can overdose on kratom. No one will go through withdrawal, your body only shows you where you really hurt but your body does not require the use of it. Every single thing i am diagnosed with is assisted in feeling better and healing when i consume kratom. I have never felt better than i do now, 5 years free of prescriptions medications all because of a tree leaf that is nature, no additives, no enhancements or synthetic ingredients. PURE NATURAL TREE LEAF. used as a tea, a tincture, in a pill form, ice cream, a bath soak, and more. Just like basil, rosemary, oregano, vitamin c, melatonin, lavender oil and other natural plants used for many reasons. Please be smart and allow the american people to seek nature for relief and not be a criminal for trying to feel better and be more active in the world and community.

Most of the problems described in the literature are associated with overdosing or mixing it with other substances.  Furthermore, banning opiates has done nothing to mitigate the overwealming crisis of abuse and overdosing that occurring in this country and this substance has the capacity to keep people away from heroin.

Kratom is just a simple herbal supplement. I have friends and family members who either use it on occasion or use it regularly. The same as other herbal remedies they are minor non addictive and create no harm. When I heard this was being considered as a schedule 1 I couldn't believe it. What's next coffee or tea? I believe that lobbyists are putting pressure on all Herbal Remedies because the drug companies and manufacturers are losing money. They would rather have patients addicted to different prescriptions then use Herbal remedies that help. Ginseng give people energy. There are many others. More and more the wrong things are happening. Stop doctors from writing out prescriptions as if they had no meaning. Check the internet and you'll find substances that are harmful being sold. Focus on the problem don't look 4 simple remedies that caused no harm. My mother died of cancer. Although she had to take prescription medication this also helped her get energy in the morning and be able to live life the best she could until she died.\n\nI hope the government comes to their senses and focuses on the problem not another herbal remedy that they want to exclude. These supplements are not the problem. Dangerous drugs are.

I am a chronic pain sufferer - costochondritis, a dislocated/popping floating rib on my left side, reversal of cervical lordosis, and fibromyalgia. Not until I found this incredible, healing plant was I able to live without pain, but also without dependency or addiction. Painkillers stop working and require a higher amount for pain relief. They form physical, as well as psychological dependency. Painkillers and pharmaceuticals also harbor incredibly high incident rates and deaths by accidental overdoses. On another note, it is so wonderful and convenient to use Kratom as an herbal and all-natural pain remedy without needing a prescription for it. Many people have Kratom plants, which they pick the leaves off of. Nature is a beautiful thing, and when we bring in the question of making this wonderful, natural plant's leaves into a synthetic prescription drug, issues will arise. Kratom must be kept legal, and there is no doubt in any of our minds as we fight for the right to Kratom that if scientific research was conducted, the results would be in the plant's favor. \n\nI have been taking Kratom daily for many years. Due to other gastrointestinal medical conditions, painkillers caused constipation and terrible side effects. I wish I could have a video diary chronicling my daily struggles pre and post Kratom. This plant is ABSOLUTELY medicinal by nature, yet mild enough to where one can continue performing work and daily tasks without any of the terrible side effects of pharmaceuticals. Those who take Kratom truly cannot comprehend how or why this plant can even remotely be questioned. It is the equivalent of having melatonin or chamomile for insomnia. Mitragyna speciosa (Kratom) is a tropical evergreen tree in the coffee family (Rubiaceae). With this logic, coffee should also then be banned by the DEA.\n\nI CANNOT believe the DEA would like to schedule this plant in the same category as heroin and cannabis. Cannabis is now legal in certain states, yet even cannabis has an incredibly powerful effect and a high from its THC content. There is absolutely no high with Kratom. \n\nThere are many individuals who abuse anything they can get their hands on. Our very cleaning products are abused through huffing. Nutmeg has psychedelic properties if ingested in large quantities. This fight is NOT about Kratom being \"dangerous,\" but about a mindset and an understanding that is incredibly lacking. I can go on and on... \nPlease take a moment to search \"IAmKratom\" on YouTube, and watch the thousands of videos of sufferers who have found relief through this natural herb. \n\nPlease, please help those who responsibly use Mitragyna speciosa, along with chamomile, sage, and other healing herbs.

Her doctor had her on norco and it wasn't helping and after doing some DNA testing she determined that her body does not metabolize opiates very well. That is why it helps with some of her pain like toothaches, but doesn't even touch the stabbing sensation she feels every day of every month because of her incurable condition. Even hysterectomies do not always take away endo because it can spread to intestines, and even other organs like the lungs. It causes legions and scar tissue everywhere and is extremely painful. She had a surgery that didn't help at all.\n\nThis plant mitragyna speciosa (aka kratom) is a mild plant related to coffee. It's not an opiate although it acts similarly. It is much more effective against pain and it doesn't give her the high, fuzzyheadedness of pain pills. It leaves her clear headed, virtually pain free and she can take care of our daughter while I work and feel like she has a wonderful mother. Before She found it She was suicidal because she just wanted to enjoy her life with the baby we always wanted and not be curled in a ball in pain all day. She doesn't want to feel like a burden to me and our daughter and her other loved ones.\n\nPlease do not take my wife away from me.  I only just got her back from all this pain a couple of years ago.  Her doctor is aware that she takes this plant and is glad she found something that helps her.  Don't take her from me and our daughter.  She is so happy right now and so full of life.  She wants to teach yoga when our daughter gets in school.  Don't take her dreams away from her by forcing her back into her chronic pain and suicidal thoughts.  \n\nThis plant should be available for responsible adults.  Teens and children probably shouldn't have access to it until more research is done, but it has had no ill effects on my wife in the 2.5 years she's taken it or any of her friends that take it.  It's only given their lives back.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and thanks for letting us comment.  Please have some empathy for chronically ill people and don't turn them into criminals or take their plant away.\n\nSincerely,\nCasey","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1264","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Casey Burton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to voice my opinion on the scheduling of Kratom,  In a society that is increasing the with the problems everyday of opioid drug overdose.

I'm 33 years old, and I've had chronic spinal issues for 13 years. Over the past decade, my doctors have prescribed any number of narcotics to \"manage\" my pain. I have taken so much hydrocodone over the years, and nearly became addicted. My tolerance for opioids and muscle relaxants was very high because of this, which caused my doctors to prescribe even stronger medications. Thankfully, after doing extensive research on holistic ways to manage chronic pain, I found kratom. With the help of kratom and physical therapy, my pain has decreased significantly and my life has become much better. I'm not sure if you know how damaging chronic pain can be to your whole body and mind. Living in pain day-in, day-out causes your life to erode and wilt. You stop wanting to move, for fear of a flare up. Your brain gets conditioned to expect pain and suffering every day, which leads to depression. My family, my career, and my mental wellness were all greatly affected by my chronic pain. Kratom has been a godsend to me; It has taught me how to enjoy life again, and realize that I can live without the constant fear of pain. Please consider the life-altering ramifications of banning kratom, and the millions of Americans it will harm. More research needs to be done on kratom, and that will be nearly impossible should it become a schedule 1 drug. Our healthcare system is set up to get people addicted to drugs, and then blame them for their addiction. How could we ban a holistic and safe drug while permitting doctors to prescribe lethal amounts of ACTUAL narcotics? Banning kratom will have devastating effects on individuals who have used kratom to week off of narcotics. There have been 0 deaths DIRECTLY attributed to kratom alone. If your concern is for public safety, you should ban alcohol and cigarettes, as they have DIRECTLY caused the death of millions of Americans.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15917","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Foster","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern:\n     Kratom has single handedly help me beat a bad opiate addiction.

I was then put on prescription opioids hydrocodone/apap and later oxycodone. These medications worked fairly well but had terrible side effects of intoxication, dizzyness and severe constipation, followed by my unknowingly developing a physical dependence on them. I was introduced to kratom by a friend and was amazed by the way it gently easied my pain without side effects or intoxication. When I learned the DEA was looking to ban this gentle plant I was, to say the least shocked. After years of personal use I know kratom is not any more intoxicating then a cup of coffee ,and in my experience, no more addictive. After doing some research I also learned the kratom plant has been used safely in many communities in southeast Asia for hundreds of years with no overdoses ever reported. In the US I know the plant has been widely used for over a decade, as I have used it myself for 11 years with absolutely no negative effects on my health. I really hope those in the DEA will make an informed decision on the ban that's been proposed. I would like to believe the DEA is a respectable organization that would not attack such an effective non addictive supplement as a drug they should treat like heroin or cocaine. My faith in the DEA as a legitimate taxpayer funded government organization would be permanently altered if kratom were treated as drug worthy of restriction. The quality of my life will be decreased significantly by the decision to ban this plant and I will participate in every option I can find to try to reverse this if it is banned. I ask that you please, reconsider this ban as it will help nobody and harm many\n\nSincerely, Audra Fox","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8068","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Audra's Fox","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I oppose the DEA  putting Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. \nI am 64 years old and a retired special education teacher.

I supported her habit for about 6 months after her perscription ran out by buying pills off the streets and saw some very depressing situations people were in.

I believe kratom should stay legal.  I have seen first hand the tremendous benefits of a small amount of drinking kratom as a tea in alleviating depression and pain, for my wife who has had an enormous amount of struggle with major depression and chronic pain (years, not months).  Since she began drinking kratom as a tea earlier this year, she was able to discontinue use of narcotic pain relievers, and her mood has improved immeasurably. Recently she has been able to go back to work and maintains a positive and motivated attitude.  She has \"recovered herself\" from a cycle of pain and depression, and I believe this is owed to the kratom tea she drinks several times a week in addition to her continued relationship with her health care providers and therapist.  She is the person I met when we first married before the depression and pain became out of control and despite her vigorous efforts with mental health care professionals, antidepressants, therapy and being an active advocate for her health.\nI have not seen any signs of dependency, addiction or abuse.  I was anxious about the use of painkillers which were all prescribed legitimately and conservatively over the past three years. Ultimately they became dangerous to her mental health, contributing to dysphoria and more serious depression.  Since she has started taking kratom tea, she is not reliant on narcotic medications on a daily basis, and they are now \"a tool\" for when the pain is unbearable and not relieved by anti-inflammatories, cold packs, heat or physical therapy.  She does not need nor does she drink this tea daily or more frequently, she is informed, intellegent and responsible with the unfortunate issues of chronic pain and depression.  Please keep kratom legal for all the individuals who are seeking a healthy way to manage pain and depression and end the cycle of being dependent on narcotic medications.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21026","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Dwyer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban Kratom.

The fact that Kratom may have been avaliaible commercially in the US for as much as the past 30 years or more  indicates to me that whatever focus that has suddenly arisen on it is more a result of half-thought out media hysteria and moral panic rather than a clear look at how it is affecting its existing user base. Much of our policy on substances that have incredibly high LD-50 doses seems not to be based on potential physical harm to the populace but on a moral or culture decision on how people live their lives. We should not be making crimes out of recreation if the risk is minimal or noexistent, nor should we be making potential medications that could drastically improve lives unresearchable in the name of 'protecting' us from recreational mind-altering substances.

Placing it into schedule 1 would effectively stifle all potential scientific research in this area.  While I believe some form of regulation may be needed, if there is a possibility that this may be shown scientifically as an effective adjunct treatment for opioid addiction, then the compound should not be placed into schedule 1 in order to preserve our opportunity to learn more about it.

In a time of many other pressing concerns during which the government is already wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on other dubious drug enforcement policies, this organization can not and should not be wasting more money on prohibition of what appears to be a fairly benign substance that poses very few health risks, especially compared to some of its pharmaceutical alternatives and which will likely be shown to have myriad benefits if given the time to be studied.

Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12860","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Evan Soares","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My son has been trying to get \"clean\" for almost two years now, he went from prescription pain medications to heroin to methadone.  It would have been easier to stay on the heroin and withdraw from that than to try and get off the methadone.  He is unemployed, and qualifies for state medical assistance, which pays for his methadone.  However, the privately run clinic he goes to has no intention of helping him \"get off\" the drug that is their big (government subsidized) cash cow.  The medical assistance he gets does NOT cover rehab or detox services, but will continue to pay for his methadone indefinitely.  There is no counseling or advice given to these countless poor addicted souls who wander in and out of the clinic's revolving doors on a daily basis for their \"dose\" to help them get off this evil LEGAL drug that becomes their slave master on a daily basis.  \n\nThat being said, my son has grown tired and angry of this hamster wheel and being sabotaged at every turn by said clinic to get himself off of the methadone.  He has spent countless hours researching and has put together a step-by-step program he can do on his own that will help manage his withdrawal symptoms and put an end this methadone misery he lives every day.  One of the integral ingredients in his program involves the use of Kratom, the very drug that now the government wants to step in and and get their hands on, which I am certain would make it just about impossible for someone like my son to get.  He broke down into tears when he read of the possible restrictions that were about to be imposed on Kratom should it become a Schedule I substance.  The use of Kratom, along with numerous other supplements, herbs, oils and vitamins, has given him the first shred of hope he has had in almost two years that he may one day lead a drug free life again, free from the shackles of methadone usage. I beg you to keep this substance readily obtainable and not make it a Schedule I drug, so that my son and others like him have a means to get through the living hell of methadone withdrawal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3934","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Elizabeth Peckenpaugh","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a wholesome leaf that should be classified as it is; a natural dietary supplement.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22757","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shane D","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom. There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22243","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Walter New","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To be honest I've never tried it but I know too many people who have died from opiate addiction and I encourage more research at least.

Kratom has helped my life so substantially. It has aloud me to be a more active and just really helps me through my day. I was originally searching online for legal alternatives for marijuana because I had go quit for job testing and I came across Kratom. The first time I took it I was skeptical just like everyone else and I came to realize it didn't taste good at all, very bitter but it was very EFFECTIVE! Not overwhelming at all but the effects and very useful for pain management, energy, focus, anxiety, a c depression as well as immune system health. Although very subtle compared to most substances it is a very nature effective medicine. I think any \"deaths\" associated with Kratom use were either linked to use of another substance or just scare tactics. This plant is a life saver to anyone struggling with opiate addictions or general drug and alcohol addictions and is very none toxic which is why a lot of people use it over opiate painkillers and other harmful substances. I ask you please as a citizen representing hundreds of thousands of other citizens. Please do not take away our medicine, give it a chance and leave it up to the individual. Let's tax and regulate it like anything else. We don't need Kratom on the black market because that will endanger more of our innocent citizens.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22081","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Curtis Little","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have five intelligent and smart sons. My husband and I have fought hard in keeping them well focused and active. I have two engineers, Major in the Army and a Surgeon. The youngest is addicted to prescription drugs. He was an innocent bystander when he was hit by a stray bullet from a drive by shooter. That was the day his world collapsed. He almost lost his leg and remains in chronic pain. He was kept on pain medication for 7 years when the physician tried to wean him off. It didn't work and the physician would no longer prescribe him medication. When my husband and i started noticing that things were missing from our house, we found out that my son has been stealing and pawning our stuff to buy opiods. We have tried getting him rehab but have exhausted in trying to find one that will take his insurance. One hospital told us that they only take pregnant women and that opiods were not consider \"highly dangerous\". I found out about Kratom about a month before it was to be banned and my son was all for trying to see if it would work. He is currently staying with one of his brothers in Texas because apparently it is not legal in our state to use or purchase.  So far he said it appears to take \"the edge\" off his obsession. It's still too early to see if this will work for him but he said he \"almost feels normal again\". I truly hope this supplement is not banned because it appears to be helping a lot of people with chronic pain, drug addiction and research.
