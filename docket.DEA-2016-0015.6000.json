I recently learned about Kratom when I was researching withdrawal symptoms for legal prescription pain medication. The  benefits of kratom far out weigh and side effects of taking it verses the side effects of opiates! The pain relief of a NATURAL PLANT is something everyone should be informed of.\n\n In joining groups I have noticed many many users were former drug addicts and have become drug free due to the use of the NATURAL PLANT KRATOM!!  How can we not allow someone who wants to get them self clean the use a Kratom?? That just seems totally ridiculous to me. Please for the love of our great country, do not place kratom in the schedule.  Way too many people benefit from the use of (again I say) a NATURAL PLANT!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21610","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been beneficial to me.

By adequate research I mean that there should be conclusive proof in MANY peer reviewed and replicated tests and experiments. Even then only the most dangerous substances should be added to the Schedule 1 list for 2 reasons. Number one it is not the governments job to play parent. America is a free country and adults own their bodies, the government does not own their body and should only be able to tell people that they can't do something to their own body except in the most extreme cases. Number two, once the substance is on the schedule 1 list it makes it extremely difficult to continue research into possible medical uses. Unless ALL possible uses have been thoroughly tested and found ineffective than it should not be listed as a substance with no medical use. \nBased on the scientific literature available, it is clear that Kratom does not have anywhere near enough research to make any decision on it whatsoever. Until much more research is done a free society should demand that this substance remains legal and open. There are few death associated with it, and all of those included many variables that make it impossible to pinpoint Kratom as the cause. The evidence that it is addictive is extremely weak and the most common narrative expressed by users is that it is not addictive. It also shows promise in helping people with pain and opiate addictions.

I am a 53-year old legal professional and fitness, yoga, and martial instructor.  I  consider myself a responsible adult and do not consume drugs to get 'high' or 'party.'  I have struggled with alcohol overuse as a way to self-medicate for PSTD, anxiety and depression. I have been prescribed numerous medications that do not help this affliction.  I have substituted the use of kratom tea and support a locally owned tea bar  which is a safe place where no alcohol or smoking is permitted and socializing is encouraged.  Kratom and the tea bar are a god-send.  Kratom is a non-addictive, healthy, coffee-like herb that can help alleviate the suffering of millions and should remain available to the citizens of our nation and not be classified as a class one drug.  We simply have too many of our citizens suffering addiction, anxiety, pain, etc to be denied the benefits of a non-addictive herb by the DEA. And as a tax-payer, I would prefer those DEA dollars be spent on research into reclassifying medicinal 'drugs' such as psilocybin which research is showing is amazing useful in treating PSTD.   I tried Kratom tea for the first time in October of this year (2016) after researching the benefits to those suffering like me. I have had amazing results by drinking a couple cups of kratom tea several times a week.  It has calmed me considerably and I have no compulsion to drink alcohol.  A further benefit of kratom use is that I have not needed any of the prescription medications I relied upon, including blood pressure and anti-anxiety meds, depression meds since beginning its use.  I desire to have access to kratom for as long as it continues to soothe and normalize me.  I am also aware that kratom is an alternative to strong prescription opioids and in recovery from alcohol and other addictions so I expect that my fellow US citizens will be able to benefit from the use of kratom rather than continue suffering because of wrongly placed classification by the DEA.  And the economic benefits of more tea bars is a plus.  Therefore, I strongly oppose the classification of kratom as a class one drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8266","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lauren Moquin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To classify Kratom add a schedule one drug would be a huge injustice to everyone who uses it yup improve their lives.

I am  aware of the DEA's intention of reclassifying the herbal supplement Kratom.  I am a chronic pain patient who has been prescribed various medications to address my pain in an effort to help improve my quality of life while living with a disease that has no cure.  None of the medications, including narcotic painkillers, have sufficiently addressed the relentless pain that I face each and every day of my life until a friend told me about kratom.  Kratom has been a blessing in my life because I can take a dose and be virtually pain-free for hours without the terrible side effects and without feeling impaired, which is so often associated with opiate painkillers. In my opinion, the DEA is making a terrible mistake if it really has the best interest of the American people in mind, with this reclassification.  Eliminating the herbal supplement Kratom will likely lead to more deaths and overdoses of opiates if people have no other options to treat their chronic pain.\n\n\nPlease reconsider this reclassification for the people like myself, who have been helped immensely with their Chronic Pain issues.\n\n\nThank you,\n\nArlene J.

I later went on to receive a doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine at Bastyr University in Kenmore, WA. I was provided significant research based training on botanical and nutraceutical therapies. I also received a Masters in Science in Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine. I am well read in many herbal traditions throughout the world along with an understanding of the ethnobotanical uses of Kratom. These traditional uses and experiences are very valuable until we are able to catch up with the scientific understanding. It is important to note that there have not been any deaths associated with Kratom outside of the United States and that the ones in the United States were associated with combined illegal or prescription drug usage. I will also mention below about how I believe the whole plant will always be safest and that extracts on the market have likely been adulterated. \n\nWhen I was first introduced to Kratom as an undergraduate student, I was intrigued about how plant alkaloids could affect the central nervous system. Kratom, had quite a few alkaloids of course and so it was interesting to try and understand. What I came to realize was whole plant medicine creates a complex alchemy of activity that is not always a simple sum of its individual parts. When one isolates one substance from a plant and concentrates it, it becomes a pharmocologic substance with completely different activity than the whole plant and its associated chemicals (The Chinese herbal system classifies different preparations as entirely different herbs altogether). An example is cocaine VS the entire coca leaf. \n\nI experimented eating Kratom first in an extract concentrated form. I felt that it was simply stimulating and mood elevating much like the effects of coffee. If I took too much I might get nauseous but I personally have never vomited from it. Kratom should not be mixed with alcohol as it will amplify the effects usually in more of a negative fashion. Alkaloids typically are conjugated in the liver then go out through the urine. With low to moderate dosing, liver toxicity seems very minimal (supported by animal model studies). It is possible that the high concentration of epicatechins (antioxidants similar to those found in green tea) may have some protective effects on the hepatocytes as well. This has not yet been proven of course which is why we need time to properly research this plant. \n\nThe extracts, over time, became increasingly more \"toxic\" in the sense I felt they were too stimulating with increased side effect including nausea, headache and insomnia. I decided that if I was going to use Kratom, I would only use the whole plant. I read a recent article: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27752985 stating that these extracts may have been adulterated with higher concentrations of 7-hydroxymitragynine. This makes sense as 7-hydroxy only occurs in small amounts in whole plant and its activity is likely modulated by multiple other alkaloids including mitragynine. \n\nWhen I currently use Kratom, I only use it in a whole plant form in a tea preparation. The effects are mild and I have never personally experienced any withdrawal symptoms even with regular usage. At my peak of use I went 6 months straight drinking about 1tbsp of dried leaf material in a tea every day. I abruptly stopped two months ago and have had no physical withdrawal symptoms. I thought about not having it for about 2-3 days after I abruptly discontinued but this was more of a psychological withdrawal than outright physical.\n\nI have personally used Kratom for chronic pain related to a neck injury I suffered in my late teens. In addition, I have been depressed and anxious off and on for much of my life. I later realized that Kratom too has some mild serotonin modulation through the 5HT2A receptor system. These antidepressant effects often last several days after one dosage. Recently, Kratom has helped me be better able to participate more in my busy life with more clarity of thought and mind and less pain/depression/anxiety. I experience no negative side effect with occasional usage of this plant (2-3x/week on average). \n\nI have recommended Kratom medicinally in the past to those with chronic pain that have not responded well to conventional treatment. None of them have become addicted. Most of them had benefit from it. A few reported that it was ineffective. Some people are sensitive to it in that micro dosing of plant material (less than 1 tsp) is needed for desired effect but any more would cause nausea, insomnia or other negative effects. \n\nIn my medical opinion, a list of reasonable safe medicinal usages of this plant include: chronic pain, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, lyme disease, dysmenorrhea, anxiety and depression.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2965","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jamie Kunkle","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please allow me to begin by saying that I consider it imperative for the DEA to reconsider the scheduling of this very natural substance.

They have tried several pharmaceutical drugs with me that I've had adverse side affects and not much relief. Currently, I'm still working with professional M.D.s, but honestly the best relief, though mild, has been from the tea I make from Kratom.

I also recently quit Cymbalta, which had more adverse side effects than the expected benefits. I strongly believe this plant has been helping me regain a portion of my health that I've been missing for so long. I could go on, but conclusion is a plea to anyone and all that is listening..

Physicians were not optimistic of his surviving at all.  He spent a considerable amount of time in intensive care, and he had three surgical procedures during the first week  with more to follow over the next two years.  As soon as he reached the emergency room, my son began to receive powerful opioids in attempts to control the pain, which was so great that the medications were insufficient.  He remained on morphine and other opioid analgesics through his hospitalization.  When released from the hospital, these medications were continued for his pain.  Although they did not control his pain well at all, they left him in an almost comatose condition.  He could not take care of himself at all, and the pain continued non-stop.  He became quite depressed due to the apparent futility of his condition  pain that was not being controlled by the prescriptions, his inability to function, his inability to work, his inability to interact with friends and family, and his having to be on the dole from the government.  Yes, there were times that he was suicidal.  It was terrifying as his father for me to see him like this  and to know that, at any time, he could have chosen to end his young life.\n\nIn one of his rare lucid moments, he began to search (online) for information regarding alternative treatments, and he discovered kratom  story after story, testimony after testimony of lives having been saved and full functionality having been restored through the use of this product (a leaf from a tree in the coffee family) for various medical conditions, one of the primary ones of which was both acute and chronic pain.  This product has been used successfully to treat a variety of conditions for centuries in the orient, where the tree is found.\n\nMy son bought some kratom, and the results were nothing short of miraculous!!!  He was able to eliminate the use of all prescription opioids after months of use without even experiencing symptoms of withdrawal!!!  He found that his mental state improved rapidly, and he was able to begin to take care of himself, get exercise, and, fairly quickly, begin to look for employment.\n\nNow, approximately six years later, his life is radically different.  He started his own business several years ago, which grew from a one-person operation to a total of seven employees, who have been paid twice the minimum wage and received full benefits!!  Only three years after the start-up of the business, the companys CPA said that she never had seen a new business grow so rapidly  ever!  The taxes paid by the business amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars each year!\nAt the present, the action of the DEA against the sale of kratom has taken its toll on my son and on the millions of others who have relied upon kratom for their well-being.  The businesses across the United States that have been legal sources of kratom have stopped selling it because they cannot afford to take the chance of possible prosecution at the worst  or being stuck with stock that they are not permitted to sell at best.\n\nMy son, who had continued to use kratom for relief of his pain and depression, now largely is unable to work due to his inability to obtain kratom easily.  He refuses to return to prescription opioids because of their various dangers  including their deprivation of functionality and almost certain addiction.\n\nThe DEA is depriving my son and his family of his life!!!  Without having access to kratom, he is much less functional  totally.  His company that has been so successful under his leadership has fallen apart, and the employees have lost their jobs.  Tax payments by the company have fallen to a tiny fraction of what they have been until this fall.\n\nWe (and our sons wife) are very afraid that we are losing our son once again.  At best, losing him to depression and loss of ability to function.  At worst, we are facing the possibility that his depression might lead to the threat of suicide (which he threatened in the time soon after his accident!).  WE NEED HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WE NEED KRATOM TO REMAIN LEGAL AND AVAILABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nSincerely,\n\nBrenda P.

It helped tremendously. Not just for the fibro and anxiety either.

My doctor is aware of my kratom use and supports it. I do not like scripts. I never have, unless I really need them. I've had 2 rounds of blood work done since I started consuming Kratom and everything was a-ok. I've taken frequent breaks with no withdrawl symptoms.

Over the last 7 years I have interacted with hundreds of individuals whose lives have been positively impacted by Kratom. The scientific and medical research suggests many useful benefits of Kratom, and if it were made a scheduled drug this would greatly limit the future research that could be done on this amazing plant. I believe that Kratom does not pose an imminent threat to public health, and the few negative effects that individuals have reported are far overblown and exaggerated. I do not personally know a single person whose life or health has been endangered due to Kratom. When compared to many other products freely available to the public, Kratom falls very far down on the list of potentially hazardous products. We live in a day and age where there are many, very serious threats to public safety, including opiate and prescription drug abuse, resulting in 35-40+ deaths per day. It would far better serve the public to invest more resources into fighting current, and very real, threats such as opiates, as opposed to scheduling a substance that does not pose a large risk, at all. If Kratom were to be scheduled, it would do FAR more damage than if it were to remain legal, and would require resources we simply don't have to be put into enforcing these laws, which will only put innocent people in jail and ruin the lives and families of thousands. Please consider this, and every other piece of evidence out there, when making your determination.  Lives are at risk here, but not for the reasons the DEA may believe. Show us, the public, that we can still trust and have faith in our government to make rational decisions that serve the public, and not private interests. Prohibition has been a costly and failed battle over the last 100+ years. We need to find a better option that doesn't destroy lives and families, create black markets, turn innocent people into criminals, and benefit corporate interests at the expense of the public our government is supposed to represent.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20538","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anon Anon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I took kratom for about two years to help elevate my mood.

I am writing to you as a former heroin addict. I thank God every day that I am not involved with heroin anymore. However I know that I could not have gotten completely sober without as much as a transitionary month long period where I used Kratom to wean off of heroin. I am aware that Methadone and suboxone are the other alternatives to my own approach, but these two drugs are dangerous and addicting opiates just like heroin is. I have multiple friends who have gone the route of methadone or suboxone maintenance and the problem for me with those routes is the cost and the amount of time it takes to be completely off of every single opiate. Opiate maintenance is a godsend for many while a money drainage for others who cannot afford it. It took me one month and $40 to get off of heroin without much difficulty. Most people on methadone that I personally know have been in the program for a year on average. There is no reason it should be this way.  Heroin is cheaper than ever right now with the epidemic and it frightens me because I know that the cheap price and extreme potency of heroin is where it draws it's power from. I understand how weak my argument is because I am only using personal anecdotes so I will present another one. \n\n       Prescription opiates and illicit opiates are on record for killing hundreds if not thousands of Americans every single year. I challenge you to find one death strictly involving Kratom. I am not trying to be arrogant.  If you do find one please publish your findings  so I can admit to being at fault.  Many Americans use kratom as a substitute for dangerous narcotics whether it be for chronic pain or maintenance. If you really want to fight the opiate epidemic take this into account before banning Kratom. The average dose of kratom is 4-6 grams. The iron law of prohibition has shown in the past that criminals only respond to prohibition by smuggling smaller more potent chemicals. This is taking place right before our eyes with the fentanyl/carfentanil overdoses being reported across the nation with more and more frequency. Instead of dragging more heroin into the country these criminal organizations are just putting stronger substances in their own heroin. \n\n      I say with utmost sincerity that I would rather have your organzation spending my tax dollars on going after drugs that  professionals have on record  actually  killing  people opposed to kratom.  If kratom were to be banned then that would imply time and money spent on kratom busts. The time and the money is much better spent busting people for selling drugs that have been proven fatal.

I have a very close and wonderful family with two high achieving teenage boys in high school. I own a very successful local business that employs 7 people full time. \n\nI also suffer from moderate depression and anxiety. I have used western medicine and tradition talk therapy over the years to manage my symptoms. Due to side-effects, harsh withdrawals, and a natural disposition toward naturopathic remedies I found that most pharmaceutic solutions are not a long-term solution. It was easier to just deal with the symptoms and the reduced quality of life.\n\nI found Kratom last year, and it was a massive relief. Taken in small to moderate doses it completely eliminated my symptoms. The mood enhancement allowed me to let go of the struggle and concentrate more on the important things in life like family and work. My business has thrived since I started taking Kratom and all those around me have benefited.\nI DO NOT take this herb to get high, but rather to balance out a serious propensity toward an uncontrollable anxiety and depression. Taken once a day about 4-5 days a week is all I need. I am responsible in my dosages and take care to take a break every week as to not increase tolerance. When I stop I do not experience much withdrawal with the exception of some occasional sleeplessness. \n\nThe few times I took more than my usual dosage I has the unpleasant experience of nausea. This passed after an hour or so, and was a reminder that there is no way for me to overdo it.\n\nWhile I feel that this herb should be regulated like any other substance for ingestion, I do not believe that it should be scheduled with other very hard drugs with no medical uses. To cut-off the possibility for further research and force the use of the drug underground will have adverse effects on the possibly millions of individuals who are now using it responsibly. Disallow any adulteration of the leaf and make the minimum age to buy be 21.\n \nThank you for your consideration allowing public comment on this very important issue.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1993","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"J Simpon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not wish for kratom to be restricted.

In 2005 I was diagnosed with a degenerative disc disease in my lower back which caused me constant pain and discomfort. It make working very difficult and exercise nearly impossible. I had to take a desk job that required no heavy lifting and over the course of a few years I gained 70lbs. My docotor, a spine and scoliosis specialist prescribed me various drugs including oxycodone and tramadol. After a while my tolerance built to the oxycodone and I had to take more to get the same effect. I developed chronic constipation and a dependence on oxycodone.I realized I was headed towards addiction so I began looking into other options. I had tried physical therapy, injections, massage therapy, hydrotherapy and on and on but none worked well enough to get me off of painkillers. In 2010 I found kratom while doing some online research. I ordered some from a reputable vendor and tried the recommended amount in a tea. It gave me quite a bit of relief and I thought if I used I could lower my dependence on other medications. Within a month I found that I didn't need painkillers at all. Kratom gave me enough relief from the constant ache that I was able to ween myself from all prescription pain meds. I was able to start excercising and lost 75lbs within 18 months. I began coaching my eldest son's soccer team and could stand long enough to play bass guitar in a band again. My energy returned to what it was before my diagnosis and I felt as if I had my life back. I still have to do physical therapy and I visit a massage therapist. Kratom does not completely eliminate the feeling in my lower back but it takes it from a dull, aching pain to a mild discomfort. If kratom is banned I don't know what I'll do. I don't want to go back on painkillers and I don't want to stop being active. I don't want to go back down the road to dependence, obesity and isolation. Please do not ban kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8760","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Glosson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am commenting in reference to <DEA DOCKET 442W>.... I use Kratom on a daily basis to help my anxiety, depression, and pain management as a result of diagnosed fibromyalgia.  I found Kratom about 6 months ago when my mother told me about finding it online.  She had read about it, and researched it quite thoroughly and thought it might help out with our conditions, and she was right.  I am a stay at home mother, and after the birth of my second child a year and a half ago, I started having a lot of physical issues.  I started to be unable to lift my baby, and my pain was almost unbearable.  I finally got a dr to listen to me and my MRIs uncovered some damage in my back and neck, etc.. And I started undergoing treatment/tests for autoimmune disorders.  While nothing other than Fibromyalgia has been diagnosed so far, and the discs that are bulged, etc.. I still have to be seen to rule out other things.  But I started using Kratom when nothing the Drs was prescribing was helping, and I wanted a natural source of relief.  And Kratom does that for me.  It keeps me moving and functioning for my children and fianc.  I was even able to garden this year.  Which I didn't think was possible last year.  Kratom keeps me focused and alert rather than groggy and sedated like medications I have taken in the past for pain relief or anxiety relief. So I can't imagine my life without Kratom now.  Not because I am addicted.. But because of the life it has given back to me and my children.  They got their mommy back.  I have a chance to go back to work if I want and it will be bearable because of Kratom.  Which keeps our society moving because it keeps more people off disability.    Kratom can virtually keep people out of rehabs too because of the withdrawal benefit it has.  So those are two governmental programs right there kratom can save.. So it seems to me there is really only one logical choice.  The people are clearly for Kratom, and those who aren't are getting false information about it.  I've taken Kratom with my other medications with no problems.  I just do so wisely.  There are even Drs who will tell you to continue it with your medication regimen and to just space out 4 hrs apart.  If the research continues, this can be properly relayed in instructions for people to be properly educated.  So if it works why take it away? Tylenol kills and it's still on the shelf.

Since my diagnosis in 2009, having multiple surgeries and other medical issues, i have been using narcotic pain medications to ease pain and allow me to tend to my daily responsibilities.  While the medications help to a certain extent, they also come along with numerous negative  side effects including dependency.I've been suffering not only from a combination of pain and side effects of multiple medications, but also been diagnosed anxiety and depression.  After searching for a more natural way of dealing with all of above mentioned issues, I discovered Kratom.  Since that discovery last February I have decreased my narcotic medication from daily use to approximately 7-10 days a month. I've also had the pleasant result of feeling some of the depression lift. There are actually days when I am happy and feel relatively good!  Data shows Kratom ALONE is about as addictive as coffee and in the rare cases a Kratom related related death has occurred ( compared to the thousands each year from narcotics ) there in almost all cases been multiple drugs in the person's system. Banning Kratom would most definitely be a huge mistake and those using it responsibly will be forced back in to a vicious cycle of drug use (some possibly illegal) and possible deaths. More research would be a positive thing, but making Kratom a Schedule 1 would hurt people like myself and researchers the ability to access Kratom.\nThank you for your time and consideration  \nSharon Thompson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2906","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sharon Thompson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Having this as a schedule 1 drug is ridiculous.

These pain conditions make it impossible to sit down at a desk for more than 20 minutes at a time. Without pain management, I must stand at my desk most of the day, which is difficult because of chronic knee pain and bursitis in my right hip. I have been told by several doctors that there is no known way to cure any of these issues, they can only be treated with medications. My situation was so bad a few years ago that I even considered suicide. \nSince discovering kratom two years ago, I have been able to keep my pain under control and I have been able to live a productive life and remain a tax paying citizen instead of trying to qualify for some type of government disability. \nI am not a drinker, I am not a smoker, I do not use marijuana, and I am not someone who abuses prescription drugs. I have a college degree, a professional job, I am a parent, I do volunteer work in my community. If kratom is moved to schedule I, I will be forced to take much stronger pain medications such as Codeine Tylenol or Oxycodone. These pain killing medications carry a high risk of addiction, and many people who get addicted to opiate based pain medications move on to harder drugs such as heroine. Thousands of people overdose on painkillers each year also. I don't want to take that risk. \nThe health issues associated with kratom could be easily addressed with federal regulations limiting their availability to those who are 18+ and packaging that warns users not to mix kratom with drugs or alcohol.

I have further seen how it has created a black market that directly enriches criminals and terrorist organizations. If an adult would like to consume Kratom to improve his health and well-being the Government should not ban the substance. Criminalizing Kratom would create a black market for the product on the dark web where there will be no regulation or oversight of what is being sold to consumers.  \n\nProhibition does not work. The US attempted to prohibit the consumption of alcohol and it had deadly results. The prohibition of alcohol led to dangerous moonshine that blinded and killed people as well as the rise of criminal bootlegging and large organized crime. Heroin is a schedule 1 controlled substance yet its use is at an all-time high. Further, deaths from heroin/opiates are at a record high because the scheduling of heroin led to it becoming an underground product sold by criminals with no oversight. These criminals add adulterants such as fentanyl to the heroin they sell on the street, which leads to unnecessary deaths. \n\nI have read many studies regarding the use of Kratom to help  individuals recovering from heroin addiction. Outlawing Kratom will take away this tool for recovery and it will absolutely lead to unnecessary deaths. \n\nThe Federal Government should not be regulating morality. It is reasonable to restrict sales to minors or even to require an FDA warning against consumption but to outlaw the plant or its derivatives is beyond reason.  \n\nKratom has been used for decades by individuals in the US and hundreds of years outside the US. As far as I am aware only 15 deaths have listed Kratom use as a possible cause. 14 of those 15 cases involved the mixing of Kratom with illegal substances. However, even if one considers all 15 of these deaths to be somehow related to Kratom use it would not justify the banning of the substance and would absolutely not be a reason for an emergency scheduling of the substance. Alcohol kills more people in a single day that Kratom ever has. Tobacco products kill more people in a day that all kratom involved deaths on record in the US. The Government is willing to tax and build wealth off of the death of tobacco and alcohol users so this reasoning for a ban is flawed. \n\nMoreover, both alcohol and tobacco use pose dangers to non-users. Second-hand smoke kills and causes asthma. Alcohol leads to violent crime, drunk driving, and otherwise but non-users in harm's way.  This is not the case with Kratom. Someone taking a kratom tablet does not give off any second-hand smoke to injure those around him. 33% of traffic fatalities are the result of alcohol consumption. Conversely, Kratom ingestion has not been connected to a single traffic fatality in the US. \n\nThis country has a drug problem. The problem is the crisis of imprisoning people for using substances that are scheduled arbitrarily and unsuccessfully. There is no reason for Kratom to become a controlled substance. It cannot be justified. \n\nThe criminalization of Kratom use would serve no purpose but to enrich criminals, terrorists, and private prisons. \n\nI urge the Federal Government not to pass any laws scheduling or outlawing Kratom.\n\nThank you for your consideration in this matter. \n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6777","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Caraccio","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 23 year old grad student with fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis.

It is much less destructive to me than taking opiates. A hell of a lot safer for me than trying to kill the pain with alcohol. Does alcohol work? Yes, but it does not leave me functional in the least. Have I taken too much Kratom? Yes, I got very sick to my stomach. That was it!\n     Does this plant help with pain? I know it helps my pain. I chose to try it because I read over and over again, of people just like me (IN PAIN) and they claimed it helped them. Does it kill all of the pain? No, but neither do the prescription meds. Does it help me function? Yes! I have become a very independant person thanks to being able to kill my pain enough to work and to even play a little.\n   Ive had several problems with my back and shoulders.  My arm/shoulder now hurts so bad I can barely sleep some nights. I cannot reach straight out in front of me and pick up a coffee cup. It hurts months on end. If I try to do any tree work using a hand saw I am in unbearable  pain.  I also have DDD and even sciatic nerve pain from time to time. I have had cluster headaches since I was 4 or 5. I broke my skull when I was 7. Life long allergies; allergy shots for over a decade of my childhood. Rheumatic fever when I was ten.\n      I worked climbing, trimming and removing trees for 25 years. I served my country for 3 years, Airborne! I have 2 children that are grown and productive individuals. I have accomplished much in my life and have a lot of life left. At times my headaches were so frequent that I did not want to live any longer. Think, major brain freeze that lasts for two to three hours with someone stabbing an ice pick into one of your eyeballs and you come close to what a cluster headache is. The last cycle ended around 2001 and every now and then I feel a twinge like one may be coming on, but Thank God they have not yet. They will be back one day.\n        LIving in pain is DEATH. It completely rewires the brain. You cannot do anything you want to do. It is not a life.\n    Do I still have pain? Yes. Can I function? Yes.

I have found it and have a life as close to normal as one can have working nights and doing physical labor with a bad back and neck.  Just as my life is getting back to normal after nearly a year of school and I have made a plan to just deal with things on my own and use the money for something useful instead of throwing it away on useless insurance. I cannot afford the cost of insurance and then co-pays. The specialist and pain clinics are not affordable, I tried.

By all means restrict the sale of it to keep it away from minors and insure the purity of the product but dont change it. Please do not make it illegal. It is very helpful for my pain. I do not want to die from pain medication. Pain medication is never prescribed in dosages that will allow you to live. If you do not get enough of it, you cannot function and if you get enough of it then the end of it is death. Pain management needs every way it can be given to work. This plant called Kratom helps me live. Over the last 4 years I have found a much better way to help with my pain and to be able to function in society. I want to work and be productive. I want to live.\n\n\nThank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15848","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Jenkins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep Kratom legal.

About 6 months ago i discovered kratom, i did plenty of research and spoke with many before i tried it. And all i can say is that it has changed my life around. A cure for my progressive disabilities...no; HOWEVER  if i can get more pain relief , less depression, no side effects as with pharmaceuticals  and have overall MUCH better outlook on life, and be able to be more productive taking only kratom vs. 9 diffrent rxs i had been on, then for me it is extreamly important to me and those who know me and have seen the changes in me, for kratom to not be banned. The thought of having to put all the pharmicuticals in my body again is one that i cant nor do i want to think about.

I fell back into the addictive mind set due to overwhelming pain I experience from work (plumbing)and daily stresses of having to maintain a healthy lifestyle,  I was taking norcos daily for the last 4 months, until I finally came  across Kratom which truly saved my life, it freed me from all the pain, aggression, and moodswings I would experience while taking the norcos. Kratom has a stigma due to non users not experiencing the effects of what this beautiful plant is capable of and speaking from a biased persepctive due to personal beliefs. It is a leaf of faith that can truly assist and help many addicts overcome their opiate addiction. Given that I have been involved in a lifestyle of addiction for the past 16 years, I know many people who still have addictions problems, and me being the loving, caring and compassionate individual I AM, I offered some Kratom to several of my friends who suffered with opiate addiction, who's lifes were truly broken, bent and on the edge of dying, now they don't need to rely on a impure substance  such as oxycotton, norco, heroin, for they experienced the true, natural, pure effects of Kratom. Conclusion of the matter is this, just because you don't agree with it, doesn't mean that it's not saving the lives of 1000s of other individuals who suffered with addiction. This is a beautiful and sacred plant that needs to be treated with respect and understanding. Thano you for allowing me to express my thoughts and feelings about kratom. May you all have a blessed and peaceful day.  \n\n                                     SINCERELY, Christopher Smolek.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12920","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Smolek","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Good afternoon, \n\nI am asking you to please hear what I have to say.\n\nThere are many responsible Kratom users. I am one of them. \n\nWithout it I can barely sit up without holding my own head up because of the pain. \n\nKratom has been used for thousands of years and helped millions of people! It is a natural plant that has been put on this earth that does not have to be modified in anyway for people to get the benefits from it.\n      If you make Kratom illegal then that would be just like making coffee illegal.  Lavender.  Chamomile.  All of these herbs/plants have benefits to them. \n\nWe understand that there are always going to be people that abuse anything they can get their hands on but my argument is this:\n\nWhy are you willing to punish the hundreds of thousands of us that are responsible, good people that are contributing to society in a positive way? Why should we be punished because of the irrational thinking of someone that chooses only to feel buzzed?  If a drug user can't get Kratom then they will move on to much more dangerous things, I can assure you. \n\nWe are doctors and lawyers and singers and musicians. We are white collar workers and blue collar workers. We are counselors and plumbers and chef's and actors and broadway stars.\n\n  Making Kratom illegal is not going to do anything but create underground networks of people growing it, force addicts to move onto much more dangerous drugs and cause tears of agony to hundreds of thousands of people that suffer from pain on a daily basis. You will literally be DESTROYING so many good people's lives! :(\n\nSir/Madam,\n\nIf you take away Kratom, you will take away my life.\n I will no longer be able to tour the world.\n I will no longer be able to be a good mother to my son. \nI will no longer be able to help other people when they are suffering. \nI will no longer be able to sing my Gospel music and inspire those that are broken and have lost hope. \nI will no longer be able to sing at Charity Events.\n I will no longer be able to talk to a suicidal friend that wants to take their lives and give them hope and help them find happiness because I WILL HAVE LOST MINE. \n\nIn taking away our Kratom, you will take away the quality of life for HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS  of good people.\n\nIf you take away Kratom, you will punish all of the good people that need this so they can in turn help the very people like the ADDICTS, that are abusing it!\n\n You are taking away the quality of lives of so many of us.... those of us  that can help the very group of people that you want to make Kratom Illegal because of. \n\nYou will take away the quality of life from teachers that can help give addicts a good education. \n\nYou are taking it away from counselors who can inspire an addict. \n\nYou are taking away the quality of life from an entertainer like me that spends her entire life encouraging and inspiring others. The list goes on. \n\n  We are responsible Kratom users.  If you want to help addicts and cure them of addiction, then please don't punish those of us that are also helping you in this fight!\n\nWe are the voice of help. We are the voice of inspiration and we are the voice of wellness.\n\nPlease listen to our plea's. \nPlease have some heart and hear our cries.\n\nThank you\n\nClaire","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3845","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Claire Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My family is from the Pacific Northwest. My great grandfather retired from the railroad, my grandfather from a pulp mill and my father was a machinist at a paper mill. He also became the oldest man in our county to pass the deputy sheriff's physical and become a reserve deputy sheriff at the age of 40. He spent his 'spare' time as president of our county's volunteer search and rescue and learned to pilot their helicopter. \nWhen growing up I learned that the law was the law. There were no gray areas. If you didn't agree with a law, you wrote an initiative, gathered signatures and tried to change it, but you followed it. \nI remember my 18th birthday because it came three days after the election that year and I had to wait another full year to exercise my right to vote.  I have not missed an election in the following 40 years. \nI have been an automotive bookkeeper since 1977, working for three major automotive companies in my area. I have been a law abiding , tax paying, contributing member of society my whole life. \n16 years ago I had to stop working and apply for disability due to degenerative disc disease. From that point on my life changed dramatically. I was put on opiates to manage my chronic pain. My life soon began to rotate around my next dose of medicine  and I became the grandmother who read, played card games and board games, and sat quietly with my grandchildren because I was not able to get down and play with them. I could watch them at the park but could not participate. I had trouble attending their concerts, their soccer games and other activities. My life was centered around my pain, period. \nIn February I found kratom and my life has been changing for the better ever since then. I am attending birthday parties, playing with my grandkids and even got in the pool with them for the first time this summer. We played a little frisbee. \nI am vacuuming my own house, doing my own grocery shopping and I could go on and on..\nWhile my pain is by no means gone, and my incurable disease is not cured, my life is greatly improved. \nKratom is legal:  in my state, in the US, in Mexico, and in Canada, as a natural herbal supplement. \nI have been watching the war on drugs since it's  inception. I am not naive enough to believe that kratom will no longer be available, if it is placed on a  schedule by the DEA. \nIf that happens I will have one of two choices. To go back to the depression of a pain filled, useless life on opiates, or to become a felon. Me;  a felon, (!?!?!)\nover a cup of tea that improves my life. \nThis is not the America that I grew up in.\nThere are many terrible things out there that should be scheduled, alcohol and tobacco come to mind, but this all natural leaf is not one of them. \nKratom is safe, it's affordable, and it's effective. \nPlease step out of the ring, there is no fight here, for you. \n\t?\t\nSincerely,\nNancy J Sawyer","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2481","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nancy Sawyer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Do not make Kratom a scedual 1.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11941","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Montana Moser","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been taking kratom as needed for my chronic pain conditions, and other medical issues.

Also the fact that I don't view Kratom as a drug. It's a plant, nothing is added or altered with it. I'm not a person who looks to get high, or needs to relax. As far as the knee jerk reaction to ban this doesn't make any sense. If statistics were a factor, than why haven't you banned alcohol with over an 80,000 alcohol related death rate per year. With all the research I've been doing, i can't find any Kratom deaths from Kratom alone. If you do the research on prescription drugs, the damage they do to the human body, not to mention the success rate they actually have, versus the kratom success rate. You might be surprised with the results. Please take your time, do the homework and make a decision based on fact and statistics. Maybe start with a simple law to limit sales to individuals over 21 years of age. Please don't jump without looking! \n\n        Thank you for taking the time to read this. Vinnie.

I have personally seen many of my peers get very hooked on these same pain med's, and I was very scared to go down that path. One day I was watching video's online and I saw a News article about this plant from south east Asia that was related to the coffee plant and had been helping people all over the country kick their opiate habits and was also being used by other people to ease their chronic pain. After doing some Intense research, I noticed there were hundreds of testimonials from people praising this plant for being a great natural alternative to opiate pain medication without being Highly addictive and not having all these crazy side effects like other pharmaceutical opiates have, Especially respiratory depression\n\nI decided it was worth a try since it was legal. I bought some online and was completely amazed how well it worked!! I was now able to go to work, take care of my family, and not have to worry about being led down the dark path of pain pills! i'm not going to Lie, There is a slight mood lift you get from kratom, but it is nowhere near what would be considered an actual \"High\". It is more like a feeling of relief that you don't have to live in pain anymore!! That alone is enough to put anyone who suffers into a good mood.\n\nI would also like to point out that there was one accidental side effect from kratom. I use to drink alcohol every night after work to try and ease my pain, Without even trying, Kratom completely removed the Urge to Drink Everyday!! It was really amazing since I had no plans on quitting drinking, but since I have, my life and my marriage have been better than ever!!\n\nAnd now the DEA wants to take that away from me and many others with similar stories??\n\nMy story is nothing compared to the stories of countless people who were able to get their lives back by using this all natural and very safe and effective tree leaf. For the Government to come in and say that this plant has NO medicinal value and belongs in a class of drugs that are extremely dangerous and Highly Addictive (excluding Cannabis which also should have never been made Schedule 1in the first place) is an absolute travesty and is completely absurd!! I have personally been using Kratom on and off for 4 years and I have never felt one ounce of withdrawal. I Never did end up having surgery and to this day my pain in my shoulder is maganged very safely and easliy with kratom\n\nThe bottom line is, kratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important Dietary uses and has changed my life. Many of us in the community feel that the DEA is abusing it's power for the purposes of the pharmaceutical Industry. We know that big pharma has already Patented the two Compounds Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine for the purposes of being synthesized and we already know that they have a new pain Killing drug called PZM21 that is synthesized directly from these two compounds. I'm not saying that they shouldn't synthesize these compounds for people who want to take them through their Doctor, but to BAN those alkaloids for the purpose of the drug Industries monopolization of them is downright dangerous and Immoral. For me, I will go on with my life without kratom, But for the people out there who have diseases like Endomitriosis, Fibromyalgia, Rheumetoid Arthritis, ETC... This Ban will literally put some of those people in very bad positions! Just Imagine people who suffered for 15-20 years because of the pain regimens they were put on by their doctors, who have finally found relief in this plant, They now will ALL be left in the dark only to go back to their doctors and get addicted to these terrible pain killers once again!! I can tell you one thing, I would NOT want to be in their shoes...Would you??\n\n\nAt the end of the day, This ban on kratom will be more dangerous to society than this plant ever will be, In Alabama, Heroin Use skyrocketed after they banned Kratom, If you think the opiate problem is bad now, Just wait....\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9025","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Teseny","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, I do not think Kratom should be banned.

As a recovering alcoholic and prescription pill (opiate) abuser, this amazing plant has given me a new hope for a life without addiction. Not only has it subsided my cravings to drink and do drugs, but it has returned me to a life of normalcy, without dependency, without fear of living in affliction and has allowed me a renewed and productive life. I no longer crave alcohol, I no longer crave pills. I use Kratom in moderation, as I don't feel a need to use it every day. It keeps my cravings at bay, where nothing else had helped me in the past. Kratom should not be banned, it should be celebrated. It's my cup of coffee when I need a boost in the morning, and my cup of tea to help me sleep at night. If you make this plant illegal, I'm absolutely positive you will see a rise in opiate abuse. Please listen to our words. You don't understand if you've never been afflicted, but not understanding should be no reason to make something illegal when the benefits are so obvious. I pray this message is read, I pray to keep my life of normalcy that Kratom has helped me retain.

I am a loving husband and father of one son. I am writing to express my disapproval of the DEAs intent to place kratom on the Schedule I list of controlled substances. Kratom has helped me maintain a healthy, active lifestyle, and to be a better father and a more engaged, productive professional. Criminalizing kratom would result in a huge setback for people who -- like me -- have found a way to help improve their lives in a natural way. We are harmless, and only interested in being the best parents, professionals, and humans we can be.\n\nI discovered kratom in 2011. At the time, I was heavily medicated for depression, overweight, and had no energy to spend time playing with my four year-old son. I was falling asleep at my desk at work and struggling to be productive. I was also drinking at least several days per week. After a week of trying kratom, I had energy again. Within a month, I was playing kickball in the backyard with my son, even after a long day's work. Instead of taking naps after work while he watched TV, I was a dad again. At work, I began contributing again, and it was quite a novelty not to nod off during a meeting!\n\nToday, my career is back on track. Im working to improve my skills as a software engineer daily (and nightly). I now work out four times a week and enjoy power lifting, and am about thirty pounds lighter than I was five years ago. My interest in/desire for alcohol has also decreased, and my alcohol intake is limited to weekends. Overall, I am a healthier and happier person. While I wouldnt make the claim that kratom has been a panacea, I can say it has been a catalyst thats driven me to make better lifestyle decisions and ultimately become a healthier person.\n\nPlease consider the thousands of us who are good, decent, tax-paying citizens. We are loyal employees, spouses, and devoted parents who simply want to be healthy. Undoubtedly, the pharmaceutical industry has -- and will continue to -- provide important and life-saving drugs. That doesnt mean that we shouldnt have the choice to seek alternative natural treatments for ourselves. We are not criminals.\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1039","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rob Seaver","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I started taking Kratom 2 years ago after several doctors told me they couldn't help me with my chronic pain due to cervical disc disease.

After that I came home and googled \"alternate pain remedies\" and up came Kratom. I did a lot of research into Kratom before purchasing. When I did it was from a reputable company with good testimonies. The first time I took Kratom was amazing, my pain slowly eased without any side effects and no feeling of a high. I couldn't believe the results, it's all natural and a miracle that I felt so much better. When I learned of the news that the DEA was trying to take away Kratom I was beyond devastated. I know what my future would look like without Kratom-pain that no doctor was willing to help with. This plant has changed my life and I know it has changed lives in thousands of others. I'm scared to think what life would look like for me and thousands of others. There already is an epidemic of street drug use and I fear that there isn't a choice but these for thousands because doctors are unwilling to help those that suffer chrtonic pain like me.

As a senior citizen on a limited fixed income it can be difficult  to obtain medical treatment or medicines especially when unanticipated conditions erupt.  Having Kratom available has afforded me an extremely efficient  and cost effective pain reliever that  is far more effective than the over the counter standbys and is easier tolerated as well.\n\nWhile I am aware that there are segments of society that abuse or overly rely on certain medications it is necessary to keep thing's in perspective.  Perhaps a rethinking of the current pain management perspective is in order.    The current narrowing or all together eliminating of certain pain managing medications needs amending in the opposite direction that a ban on Kratom would be taking it.  Physical pain is one of the core causes of human suffering.  It's time the draconian attitudes concerning these effective medications were eased.  While they offer the illusion of protection they are leaving many people in the misery of chronic and or sever pain without sensible recourse.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3353","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 42 year old professional women from Louisiana who suffers from fibromyalgia.

My neck muscles are also involved, and this causes daily headaches, some of which are severe, as they affect my occipital nerve and cause what are called 'suicide headaches'; I now understand why that term is used, as this kind of pain pushes you into a desperate place to try and alleviate the pain!\nEverything I have tried so far, under the direction of my primary doctor, nerve specialist, and physical therapists have failed: ibuprofen or aspirin, ice, heat, physical therapy, strength and endurance training, physical activity, laproscopic surgery of my right rotator cuff (not the problem!), cortisone injections, and even radio-frequency ablation of the facet joint nerves in my neck!!\nNothing has healed or even helped my neck/shoulder problem, and this year I've been experiencing nerve pain going down BOTH my arms: my left thumb goes numb and becomes weak enough that I'm afraid I will drop something I try and lift; and my right arm is now having serious problems as well. I am afraid that nerve damage is affecting my hand dexterity and strength.\nI DO NOT take opioids for this severe pain, although I understand that many people do take opioids for severe muscle and nerve pain.  \nI recently found kratom to be very helpful to manage my terrible physical condition. Kratom is allowing me to work productively at my job (which I'm sure is more helpful to the government than me being on disability forever!), it is relaxing my muscle spasms to the point I can actually get some relief and have some productive results from exercise, and it is helpful for my severe nerve pain and headaches.\nPlease do NOT make a plant that has traditionally helped people for hundreds of years to find relief a Schedule I drug!!  Mitragynine speciosa needs to be rigorously examined and tested by scientific and medical institutions to determine its value to society. It is NOT physically addictive and has very little side effects, compared to prescription narcotic opioids. From what I understand, there is a national crisis happening right now because of American dependence pain-relieving opioids...wouldn't it be helpful to offer an alternative to prescription narcotic addictive drugs and assist people to get away from that horrible dependency?\nAs I said, I do NOT use prescription OR illegal opioid narcotic drugs, so that is not an issue for me, but constant nerve and muscle pain is a REAL problem for me, and I have found that kratom really helps me to feel better, be more productive, and to have less pain.

After many physical therapy sessions and drug (medication) counseling, I was able to return to work.  A typical day would start out by taking two #10 Norco just to be able to get moving, mid day I would need another pain pill, and by evening (bed time) I would need 2-3 more pain pills to sleep.  This cycle went on for years, until my brother told me about Kratom.   After tying it and finding the strand and dosage that worked best for me I am no longer taking the Norco (Vicodin).  I feel much better physically and mentally.  I am able to work longer shifts at the hospital, l where I am a sedation nurse.  I have never been, or felt impaired from kratom to not be able to do my job safely.  I have told a lot of my patients who struggle with the same chronic pain about kratom, and have heard back from them how much better they feel, finally getting off the narcotics.\n\nI understand the DEA wanting to regulate the production of kratom to maintain its purity, but to classify it as a schedule 1 drug is crazy.  I hope that you do your own research, and even try kratom yourself to see that it is not harmful.  I also hope it remains legal, otherwise I will be forced to go back on narcotics for my pain relief, I've been off for over 3 years.\n\nThank you,\nLisa Balestreri  RN","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1713","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lisa Balestreri","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern. \nMy name is Sarah, and I am a married, have a job, have children, and a 4-year degree.

I consume it on a daily basis and it has improved my life substantially. Kratom does not make you feel \"high\" or cause addiction.

Yet DEA/FDA refuse to accept the facts, and will not listen to common sense and reason. Why are they so determined to ban a harmless tea leaf? Are they corrupt agencies? Are they basing their decisions on a hidden political agenda? This seems to be the case, since no reasonable person would consider Kratom an \"imminent threat to public health\". Their negative claims against Kratom are a flat out lie.\n\nKratom should be freely accessible to all Americans who choose to use it. The government should not ban this safe and useful plant. They have NO legitimate reason to even be concerned about Kratom in the first place.\n\nPlease stop wasting OUR tax money on this pointless Kratom witch hunt.

I was skeptical at first because I personally do not believe in herbs.  I take over the counter meds when in pain which is rare.  However,  everything that he said about it peaked my interest but I was still apprehensive. \n\nMy reason for finally trying/taking kratom was for temporary back pain.  I strained myself at work and typically just deal with it.  I recall having a busy work week and needed relief from my pain to be productive.  I took kratom and didn't think it was working cause I didn't feel anything.  Since I wasn't sure what to expect I continued my workday and believed kratom was just another gimmick.  Anyhow, I completed an 8 hour day with NO PAIN!   What's great is I didn't even realize it till the end of the day.  I thought to myself that my body must have healed itself.  Unfortunately,  it was back the next morning.\n\nThat morning, I wanted kratom but didn't have any.  I couldn't believe the difference in my productivity (lack of) and the pain I had...wow!   I then realized that this herb was different and did work!  I didn't feel it working because it worked so naturally. \n\nMy back pain eventually went away over time but kratom helped me through it!   I continued taking kratom because I noticed a drop in my anxiety level.  I also noticed how alert and focused I was which is essential in my line of work. I am able to keep better relationships with customers due to being in a better mood.  To include, kratom actually made work fun for me and I am an electrician in Florida!  I work in very high temperatures.  I noticed kratom made it bearable.\n\nTo summarize,  kratom worked for my pain, anxiety,  mood lifting, made me more productive and the heat tolerable, helps me stay focused, energized, slowed down in drinking alcohol, and cigarettes are lasting longer cause the taste is not as good.  \n\nSince kratom I am able to wake up at 4:45 am, five days a week without dreading my day.  I feel tired at first but then take kratom and it gives me the energy I need to get going.   I can actually skip that cup of coffee in the morning!   \n\nSo, with everything I've experienced and have learned about kratom I am at a total loss as to why kratom in its purest form would be banned or an emergency schedule 1?  The agendas are not matching up.\n\nAt this time,  I am in hopes and plead that the DEA keeps this herb legal so that I (a responsible adult) can continue purchasing kratom and using it accordingly.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20640","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Corey Revard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Ive been using natural suppliments for 11 months now, Kratom is one of them.

This is not a drug that many people, if any, are turning to get high on. I can assure you that. Its effects and withdrawals are more subtle than caffeine.

I also take care of my disabled grandmother. I have many health issues that cause me great pain, constantly. To name a few: Endometriosis, pinched and dilated fallopian tube, dysuria, ovarian cysts, fibroids, painful ovulation/ menstrual cycle, gastritis, esonophilloc esophagitis,etc. Before I had my secobd c section my pain was monthly, from age 14. After the c section, which was done improperly, I was in constant pain, it's been almost a year now. In the beginning of the year I fought my doctor just to receive pain medication and fought to have tests done. My primary doctor refused after a while to provide pain medication, nausea medication, any medication at all. I'm currently picking a new primary yet in the meantime I found myself facing a life of pain, viewed from bed. Then I was told by a good friend about kratom, having been without pain relief for a month I was sure I'd just have to \"deal with it\" as my doctor told me I should do. Yet I was surprised to find out, it worked, better than any pain medication, and I got my energy back on top of that! I was able to stop going to the hospital, which I've been to 23 times this year alone. After a little while I even noticed my gerd was no longer a problem. I was able to stop taking my Zantac for that, and eat food normally again. The first time I tried kratom, I cried, tears of joy and relief, I was able to play with my kids again, do things normal people do, and I am still amazingly grateful for it. Please, please dont take that from me, from us, I've never had a withdrawal from kratom, no ill side effects, only help and hope. Please don't take that from me, from anyone, I beg you. Don't take me from living my life with my children and grandmother. Without kratom I don't know what I'll do, I can't go back to the hospital every week again because they won't see me. I'm fighting so hard to get a doctor who treats me like a person, even so I'd rather I never even have to look at a narcotic again in my life, because they only make me worse off. Again, I'm begging you, don't take that from me, from anyone.

I am 42 years old. I co-manage a business and I am also a freelance writer. I am a cancer survivor and I also have endometriosis with adhesions and severe tendonitis. I have lived with chronic, oftentimes debilitating pain for most of my adult life. I had a rare form of soft tissue sarcoma which required 3 major surgeries to remove. It seemed as if the surgeons could not figure out where my cancer ended and my body began. Despite the fact that my right leg looks as if it has been ripped from my body and stitched back on, I feel lucky to be alive. This was, and is my reality. I live with the fact that my cancer can recur at any time. \nI discovered kratom by accident about 6 years ago. After years of being prescribed loads of opioid painkillers, anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications, and dealing with the plethora of ill effects that always seemed to outweigh the benefits, I was ready to throw in the towel. I began exploring more natural alternatives. One afternoon a friend of mine offered me some capsules which contained some powdered leafy material. He told me it was a plant called kratom, and claimed that it had been very effective with helping him live a relatively normal life after dealing with injuries he suffered in a construction accident. I was skeptical, but I decided to give it a go. I am very, very glad I did. \nLong story short, kratom has helped me on multiple levels. I have a job where I am on my feet all day, every day. Kratom has eliminated my reliance on fistfuls of ibuprofen and prescription drugs just to get through my day. I consume the same modest amount every day, and it is always effective. My pain, depression and anxiety are all manageable thanks to this simple healing leaf. \nAfter enduring the nightmare of cancer, I was offered the opportunity to apply for disability benefits. This was unacceptable to me then, and it is still unacceptable to me today. I knew I could do better, and with the help of this plant I have a very abundant life when prescription medications threatened to rob me of the ability to provide for myself, and to be of service to my family. \nIt is important that we cut through all the hysteria and sensationalism and really get to the heart of the matter. Based on my own personal experience, I feel as if kratom is relatively harmless on the spectrum of addictive substances. Please reconsider the temporary scheduling of this plant. It is helped far more people than it could possibly ever harm. Thank you for your time. \n\nSincerely, \n\nTracy D.

It has helped me treat depression, anxiety, and pain very inexpensively.\n\nI am surprised that at the same time marijuana is becoming legalized in several states, kratom is under consideration to be scheduled.  Furthermore, kratom has keeps me from using substances like alcohol (which is known to be addictive, and very harmful to the health of the user and others around the user) to control my severe symptoms.  \n\nIf kratom is is scheduled, I will not be surprised if heroin use, opioid medication abuse, and alcohol abuse all increase.  In addition, more deaths from the use and trafficking of these substances will likely occur.  Furthermore, it will add to an already overloaded prison population as more people are charged with possession of substances.  Finally, other medications available over the counter are more dangerous than kratom, such as Tylenol, which can be fatal at high doses, whereas kratom is not.\n\nScheduling this substance will only harm the people of the United States.  I am extremely disappointed that it is being considered, and that the DEA recently tried to rush it to schedule 1 status.

I am a 40 year old homemaker who discovered kratom through the news coverage of the possible ban in September.  I have been using it since the first part of September.  I have benefited greatly from Kratom.  I use a very small dose (1/4 of a teaspoon) a few times a day. I get no \"high\" feeling whatsoever but my pain levels from a chronic condition are mitigated greatly and my energy levels are better.  I have two small children that have benefited from me finding this, as well, as I can keep up with them and do more things with them than I am normally able to do. \n\nThis herb should not require a prescription anymore than St John's Wort or 5-HTP does.    Adults, not the government, should be able to choose whether or not they want to use kratom, just as they can use any other herbal supplement. I don't think responsible use of kratom is unsafe in any way or form.  People are doing much more damage to themselves from cigarettes and alcohol that are totally legal.  Sure, it may be abused by some but they are in less danger than those that abuse prescription drugs or alcohol.  \n \nI believe categorizing kratom as a schedule 1 controlled substance would be taking away the rights we have to choose our own path.  If I, as a woman, have the right to rip a baby out of my womb because it is in my body and I don't want it there, then I should have the same freedom to put what I choose into my body.  This is not a \"drug\" that needs to be controlled.  In 2014 18,893 people died from Pharmaceutical Opioid Analgesics according to the CDC. 15,000 people a year die from misusing over the counter NSAIDS.  Any deaths that can be linked to kratom use that I can find, anywhere, were due to using it in a large volume in combination with other drugs.  There is nothing to show that those deaths wouldn't have occurred anyway from the users abuse of other substances. \n\n So, in conclusion, don't do it.

My doctor prescribed me 100 Vicodin a month for  bulging discs in my lower back. I took them as directed at first, but they ceased being effective and I started doubling up and taking them in between doses. I started running out before the months would end. I was on them so long and so regularly that I would get very bad withdrawal symptoms if I went more than 18 hours without a pill. I started getting scared that my \"medication\" was taking over my life. I gained weight because pills made me lethargic, and my back pain kept me from being active.\n\nI knew I had to do something to break the cycle. I searched the Internet for ways to cope with the withdrawal and clear my system of the pharmaceuticals. I kept seeing \"kratom\" in forums for opiate recovery. I ordered a package from a reputable vendor (based on customer reviews) and took my last Vicodin. I didn't have another apt with my doctor to renew my prescription. \n\nThe next afternoon, I began getting the typical withdrawal symptoms. A day later (and after a sleepless night) I called off work due to the withdrawal. Coincidently, my kratom arrived. I took a dose and 15 minutes later, I felt relief. This allowed me to spent the next 5 days in relative comfort compared to the usual pain. In addition to easing my withdrawal experience, my back pain was mitigated. Kratom gave me a chance to break the cycle of prescription pain killers.\n\nI received a few epidural injections for my back and declined my doctors offer to renew my Vicodin prescription. I thank god kratom came along when it did or I fear my drug usage could have spiraled out of control. Nowadays, I take kratom a few times a week and at times forget about the chronic pain that took me to pills in the first place. Although it has been almost a year since I took pills, I still experience cravings. It seems kratom helps with that as well. My condition improved and I'm more active and have since completed a half marathon and 18 miles of a cross country running relay. My life has dramatically changed for the better since I discovered kratom and used it to quit painkillers.\n\nMoving forward, I would like kratom to remain legal and accessible to addicts, pain patients, and anxiety sufferers. I can understand and appreciate government oversight and regulation, but ONLY IF KRATOM REMAINS LEGAL AND AVAILABLE. If scheduling occurs and kratom is unavailable, i fear that kratom users would return to their previous addictions.

This is Dennis Pelton. I am writing you today in order to voice my concern about the DEA banning the mitragyna speciosa (kratom) tree. I was first diagnosed with clinical depression at age 16. I am now 43 years of age. Since age 16 I have tried every pharmaceutical drug available to treat biochemical depression. None of them helped my condition. I only found relief for my life threatening condition after discovering & consuming kratom leaves. \nI have successfully used the leaves to treat my condition for the past 8 years with no negative side effects. If the kratom ban actually get's enforced. My greatest concern is for those that have served our Country & have come back from Iraq/Afghanistan & use kratom to treat permanent injuries that they have suffered overseas. I also feel for the elderly that use kratom to treat arthritis, fibromyalgia & many other medical disorders. The leaves of the kratom tree are saving hundreds of thousands of lives. Many will be forced to choose between staying alive & functional or obeying the arbitrary whim of the DEA and possibly dying! Or at the very least going back to a miserable life of suffering! For many this is not just a difference of opinion. It's a difference between life or death! \n     The banning of kratom will also be a burden to the health care system, insurance & government. Thousands are functional only because of kratom. Without access to this miracle plant they will go back to collecting a disability check instead of being a productive member of society. Kratom is paid for by the consumers. Not by insurance corporations or government (tax payer). However, if kratom is no longer accessible. People will have no choice but to go back to burdening the health care system & government. \n     Furthermore, has anyone actually taken the time to think about what the enforcement of this kratom ban would even look like? Picture wheelchair bound Iraq & Afghanistan veterans in handcuffs! Picture grandmothers suffering from fibromyalgia in handcuff's! This is after DEA thugs dressed in all black, wearing black ski masks kick in their front door! Videos of wheelchair bound disabled people in handcuffs being wheeled off to prison! Then after they get bailed out of jail they tell the press how they had DEA thugs point fully automatic weapons at their heads! It would be a public relations nightmare for the DEA!\n     In closing I strongly encourage you to join Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Congressmen Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Congressmen Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.) & their colleagues to stop the ban of the mitragyna speciosa (kratom) tree. Take care & may God bless you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10442","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dennis Pelton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I became aware of kratom and this forum from the joe rogan podcast.

I do not personally use Kratom, but my roommate uses Kratom and I have seen the most remarkable change in her since using this plant. My roommate is a recovering addict who had lost her job, her child , her car and her family over using pain pills. Since she has started using Kratom over 5 years ago, I have watched her gain all that she lost back. I have seen her gain her child , start a career, go back to college and finally live a responsible life . I am a college educated woman who has a supervisor job with a top Fortune 500 company.  I would not be her today commenting on this issue if I did not believe to amazing benefit Kratom has on a person. I ask that the DEA not ban this plant due to the numerous possible benefits this plant has . We as a society have lost millions of lives over the opioids available on the market today . So I had that you reconsider the ban on this life saving plant. It changes lives, it saves lives and more importantly, it has saved someone I love dearly life.

I have been with my husband for 20 years and our daughters are aged 16, 12 and 6. We are just your typical all American family. My daughter's enjoy many extracurricular actiavites, one does cheer and the others plays basketball and volleyball, the youngest seems to want to be a mixture of her sisters.  My husband runs a state funded company which provides home modifications for the handicapped and elderly, he loves his job.\nIn my mid 20's, I had my first anxiety attack while trying to go to college for nursing. It was one of the scariest things I have ever had happen to me. It was as if I suddenly lost control of what my mind was doing to my body. I tried seeing a Dr. In order to finish school, but the fear of the anxiety attacks and the fact that I kept having them, made me withdrawal instead.\nOver the years since then, I have tried antidepressants and benzodiazepines to cope with my anxiety which led to depression. Yet, the side effects of these meds proved worse than the illness. The antidepressants Changed me as a person and even though they took the troublesome anxiety away, they also took the good anxiety away. We all need some anxiety to help us stay away from bad choices. After realizing this and dropping them, the withdrawal from them was an awful experience, cause jolts through my vains for weeks. Still, I tried different ones and still they all were generally the same. The benzodiazepines made me tired and slightly high, which was never something I wanted.  So, I spent many years finding any way possible to avoid leaving my house, because that usually kept the anxiety at bay, although it was depressing to feel like a prisoner to my house with my mind being the jailer.\nUntil I found kratom about a year ago. I was searching online for natural supplements that could aid me in fighting off these symptoms and was lucky to find kratom. I was very skeptical, but within a week, found myself feeling like myself. I never felt 'high' only a slight boost in energy and less fear of the unknown. This past year has been wonderful, I have been to all of my girls sporting events without one single incident. I have been able to volunteer more, which is a great way to combat depression. If this supplement is taken from me, I fear I'll once again be a prisoner to my mind and stuck in my home with the contant fear of the unkown and looking for every and any excuse to not do the things I love and enjoy. I also fear for our society, since recently reading how this one substance has helped so many addicts. I live in an area very negativity affected by the opiate epidemic. I would love to see the word spread about kratom, so these people could maybe get their lives back too. Although our means are different, I believe we are all victims of our minds (whether addicted or anxious) and this is something that really helps. Please reconsider your ban, as I assure you that anyone seeking this for a buzz or high will be greatly disappointed. Yet, anyone looking to take back control in their lives will find real relief in nothing more than a morning supplement. \nP.s.

As a person who has multiple autoimmune disorders, I have done research into many prescription meds, treatment modalities and outcomes on more things than I could count. My life came to a screeching halt when my autoimmune issues took over. I have religiously followed my doctors orders, taken my meds and have no real relief. Upon learning of organ damage, I began to search out homeopathic solutions. Many of my support groups spoke about kratom. I could barely contain my excitement until I learned I lived in a state that had made it illegal. I cant break the law and risk jail time for a naturopathic assist to my health so that idea was scratched. Then, I was invited to a friends condo at the beach for a long weekend. Car trouble turned a 3 day trip into over a week. I hadn't packed enough meds and since my prescriptions had just been refilled, I was not able to get a prescription transferred to help me while on this trip. I suffer with fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, chronic pain, hemicrania contuia, IBD, Sjogrens, Rayauds, anxiety, depression, DDD and other symptoms/issues related to the aforementioned ailments. Just a half day into my med shortage, I was desperate. My friend we stayed with offered some kratom tea made from powdered kratom. I immediately started more research and decided it was worth a try. I was amazed at how much better I felt. No high or even a slight buzz, just overall feeling better. My IBD had flared from the trip and my symptoms from that quickly subsided. I continued with the tea while out of state and I have to admit, I overall felt better than I had in a long time. Not wanting to risk trouble back home, I started my regular routine of meds.  I had no ill effects from stopping the kratom tea...NONE AT ALL. My symptoms from my varied conditions did come back along with the side effects of the medicines I regularly take. I decided then and there that homeopathic/naturopathic options need to be available to people like myself. I do also take honey, cinnamon and turmeric and after my personal experience and first hand knowledge, consider kratom tea to be along those same lines. It is (or was to me) a plant based alternative/adjunct to the harsh chemical compounds that make up the prescription medications that have caused organ damage. Is it a cure?  No.  Is it a drug? I would have to say NO. There is so much potential yet to be explored and by putting this plant and its compounds on a Schedule I list, you are taking away the possibility that this will receive research funding to see just exactly how much help it could be. It is so important that this plant be studied and used for whatever value it may have to a persons overall well being. Many of us are not wanting 'drugs' or a 'high', we simply want to be able to function at a near normal level. Please do not add kratom and its components to Schedule I. It is nothing like the substances that are there such as LSD. I personally felt no 'high' effects, no altered consciousness. This is the opportunity to leave this plant in the hands of people who seek natural ways to deal with their health and wellness. Think about how many times you have heard to eat a banana to stop a headache...does that make a banana dangerous or put the banana tree on a Schedule I seem reasonable? I think not. Adults need the ability to choose plants, natures bounty, as alternatives to their own health and well being.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3067","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was prescribed hydrocodone for many years.

I have received on-going medical care since I retired from the military, which has included surgery, physical therapy, and multiple types of over-the-counter and prescription medications. Despite these efforts, I continue to suffer daily from severe pain. I currently take three prescription medications to control my pain. I have sought out alternative methods of pain relief. The best alternative pain relief that I have found is kratom. I am aware that the DEA has significant concerns involving kratom. However, from my personal experience, I can testify that kratom has a high medicinal value with no negative side effects. I have been using kratom for nine months. It helps my pain tremendously and has helped my depression. I have never felt high from kratom. It does not negatively affect my mental state I take kratom while I am at work and I have always remained clear headed and alert. I have never felt addicted to it and have never felt any withdrawal symptoms if I go without it for a few days. When I first started taking kratom, I accidentally took too much. I felt nauseous and vomited. However, my body experienced no other reactions from taking too much kratom and, after I vomited, I immediately felt fine. Kratom has significantly improved my quality of life and allows me to keep my prescription medicine at low doses. I am asking the DEA to not make kratom a schedule 1 drug, as kratom gives me, as well as many other people, a natural and safe way to treat their medical conditions without relying solely on prescription medication or resorting to \"street\" drugs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16257","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"re: \tURGENT -- DO NOT BAN THE SALE AND USE OF KRATOM\n\nThe DEA is insistent on banning the purchase and use of kratom.  Apparently they feel as if Americans are in immenent danger and that kratom is an opioid-like substance. Now, you're likely wondering \"What's kratom?\"  It wouldn't surprise me -- very few people are aware that kratom even exists. \n\nIt is a gentle herbal supplement used primarily by older individuals to provide safe, non narcotic pain relief from arthritis and other aches and pains. I personally use kratom due to arthritis pain in my hand. I use kratom ONLY for flare ups and stop using it as soon as the pain subsides. I have never experienced withdrawal symptoms with discontinued use. \n\nThere are many users who obtain relief from opiate withdrawal.  Since I've never been an addict, I can't describe its benefits for withdrawal. What I can  attest to is that kratom is NOT an addictive drug, it is not a synthetic party drug, it is not popular with millennials -- many of whom have never heard of it. The demographic of a typical kratom user  is 45-65 years old, suburban, middle class, employed. Generally all law abiding people. \n\nKratom is not used merely to obtain a \"high\".  On the contrary, users quickly develop a tolerance to the \"euphoric\" side effect. Any attempt to misuse kratom to obtain a \"high\"  will result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and jitters but it will NOT result in respiratory arrest.\n\nAnother serious matter would be shutting down an entire industry. This ban would likely put tens of thousands of people out of work.  You must seriously consider the domino  effect as well.  The loss of this industry will cause irreperable harm to the economy. \n\nYet another fact to consider is that President Obama worked very hard to overturn prison sentences of nearly 400 non-violent offenders. Adding a law against the sale and use of kratom will refill the prisons and overcrowd them with thousands of peaceful, law abiding people to become felons.\n\nI've never even been arrested in my 57 years of life. I won't break the law, so now I'd have to begin the use of prescription narcotics. My doctor has offered to prescribe percocet, 10mgs, 3 times a day. I truly don't want to go there. I don't want to become an addict at this point in my life.\n\nThere is a group of senators (bipartisan) who are starting a \"Dear Colleague\" letter opposing the ban. I sincerely appreciate their concern in this matter and their effort to at least research kratom before banning it.\n\nI'm sure you know that as soon as the media runs the story about the pending ban, EVERYONE will want to try it--it'll be that \"wanting what they don't want you to have\" category. \n\nPlease consider the importance of keeping this mild herbal supplement legal for sale and use. I know you will do the best you can. \n\nSincerely appreciated.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5593","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Burns","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have never used Kratom but it seems to help people like veteren's and people that don't want to get hooked on pain killers.

Kratom is merely an herbal remedy with very mild effects that happens to work.  Kratom doesn't take your soul. Kratom users have a choice to do the right thing. They are able to choose the friends and acquaintances that fit within their moral guidelines.  This is huge for those who are trying to stay away from dangerous medications or illicit drugs. Kratom can rescue someone suffering from chronic pain and/or addiction.  They are given a chance to live a normal life again. The people who decide to stop taking kratom are given free will. They have the choice to do what they believe is right. In this regard, they can stop taking it at any time. The plant is a natural godsend. The taste is only tolerable by those who are treating their ailments. I've noticed others won't even attempt to ingest even close to the large amount it takes to have even the slightest effect. Also, It's undesirable to take too much. It's very similar to drinking too much coffee. One wants to stop. In my scenario it has been great for killing mild but chronic pain and has truly given me a chance at Life, Liberty, and pursuit of happiness. Generally speaking Kratom users are peaceful, law abiding citizens who are really just trying to do the right thing.

This is less then alcohol and the only reason I could think of this being made illegal is to keep people hooked on prescription opiates, Herion, Methadone or Suboxone. Three of these being legal and even if it is even a little bad for you there is no way its as bad for you as the four I've listed and honestly do you really think people on herio. really care about whay s good or bad for you?

The way the media is handling this, is like reefer madness part 2 its filled with lies and propaganda, and I wouldn't be suprised if people claiming its killing people are doing so because they need something to blame. 0 Deaths have been as a result of just Kratom use because its impossible to overdose on, the 14 of those have been debunked and shown to have had other drugs in they're system, and with the 1 death unaccounted for was probably done so with another some other drug that isn't being tested for like phenibut(you can find a lot of drugs online that can kill you and their being no way to test for them). It also has been proven to not cause respiratory depression (how opiates kill you) and you're body throws out what it doesn't want. \n\nRight now people are getting kicked off pain pills with addictions and horrifying at an alarming rate and without Kratom they're forced to buy pills on the street or Heroin(or they start with buying pain pills and end up on Heroin because its cheaper). This has helped friends of mine quit drugs like these, people in need of pain management, and also people in recovery that do not want to use opiates for pain or stay off opiates in general. Currently in the opiate world we have headlines like: \"78 deaths in 2 days\" because of a bad Heroin batch(my moms Ex was caught in that and died) \"28 deaths in 4 hours\" \"Fentanyl Overdose Deaths In Ohio At An All-Time High As Midwest States On Alert Over Opioid ODs\" and \"Heroin Laced With Elephant Tranquilizer Linked to 8 Overdose\". And this plant is really what we're worried about? Really? I think you guys really need to look at are drug laws, our prisoners, and the od count and really ask ourselves if this is working. The Drug war needs to end, and when you're banning plants keeping people of drugs, you really need to revaluate this epidemic. Enough is enough.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4068","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Corey Bettick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helped me get off of opiates, and gave me the chance to have a baby born without NAS.

For almost all of my teenage years I struggled with opiate dependancy. It slowly moved from hydrocodone to oxycontin, to opana, then to IV heroin. I ended up homeless, in the hospital multiple times, in jail, and at the end of what I could take. I' also struggle with some horrible back pain that has left me bed ridden for ten days at a time, in the most excruciating pain I've ever felt, and unable to move even the slightest bit without screaming in pain. All of this came to an end when I found kratom. The back pain still exists, but it's now managable. Ive been heroin free for over 4 years, have regained my hobbies in music, built my collection of guitars and amplifiers back up after selling it all, and ive joimed a band. Ive maintained a job, have my own place to live, I have a dog, and my friends and family back. I couldnt have done this without kratom. It's been such a saving grace for me, and with no ill side effects aside from some constipation when ive taken some larger amounts after working kn a car, or playing a show and moving all of our gear. This tree leaf has so much to offer for so many who deal with pain and cannot take opiates like me because of addiction. It's been a mericale for so many reasons. All of the storise that are told have got to speak a million words of praise. No withdrawal, no side effects. Please don't take something so harmless away from so many that benefit so much from it. Thus would turn us all into criminals. Wwte not a bunch of stoner teenagers. It's plain unconstitutional.  Thank you for reading. I'm greatful every day to not be living in a parking garage through minnesota winters, and to not be in that place I used to be.

I have been a firefighter for over a decade.  I see first hand the devastation prescription opiates has caused in addicts, their families and communities.  Kratom is a safe and proven solution to getting addicts off of RX drugs. A ban on Kratom is dangerous and many former addicted of RX opiates will return to abusing opiates. Lives will be lost and overdoses will skyrocket as a result of a Kratom ban.\nI first came in contact with Kratom several years ago after an injury had me on RX opiates for 6 months.  I felt addicted to them. As soon as I stopped taking them, I would feel sick and not be able to get out of bed..  I tried Kratom and was able to successfully stop using the RX as well as using dipping tobacco. Kratom took care of the pain and lessened the withdrawal affects until I was off of them. It did not make me feel high, under the influence, or altered. It gave me a burst of energy similar to coffee and enhanced my mood.  I honestly believe Kratom probably saved my life as well as many others.

I don't see any positive benefits that could result from the ban. It may force people who are using it to take prescription opiates for their pain which have negative side effects for some people  There is also tons of anecdotal evidence that it is less addictive than prescription opiates. I did a quick search for scientific articles on kratom addiction potential compared to other opiates and couldn't find any (although I would hope the DEA looks at all the scientific articles with a non biased viewpoint before making any decision). A schedule 1 classification will basically prevent any further scientific research on the drug to see its effects. It's my opinion that no drug should be banned for scientific research as schedule 1 drugs are always going to be used whether they are banned or not and it's always better to have more information. The scheduling of kratom may also cause users to seek alternative illegal sources of the drug or other drugs which could be be more harmful to their health. Lastly I know a few people who use kratom for pain management as an alternative to prescription opiates who take it in a responsible manner. The 3 people I know who use it claim it improves the quality of their lives. Why take that away from them and the millions of other Americans who use it  for medicinal purposes?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22319","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Yarbro","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe that scheduling kratom would not only be a mistake on the DEA's part, but would end up posing a great threat to public health as they deprive a free people of a natural remedy for opiate addiction.

Kratom enhanced my life in ways that only a healthy, harmless, valuable natural medicine could. I will explain the various reasons why I believe kratom should not be made a schedule 1 drug and why I believe it should be available to anyone who would benefit from its positive life changing effects.\n\n     Prior to me discovering kratom i had many negative experiences with mental health issues, unhelpful medications, and addiction. SInce I was 7 years old I have struggled with OCD, ADD, depression, anxiety, and addiction. For 17 years I was prescribed medications that mostly  either didn't help at all or actually made my mental state worse than it already was. Some of these medications gave me a temporary feeling of euphoria that within 8 hours turned into very negative damaging thoughts and feelings. This lead to me becoming addicted to these medications. I eventually resorted to using destructive man-made drugs like methamphetamine and heroin in order to kill the pain that I felt within myself due to my mental dysfunctions. The result of this was me becoming heavily addicted to mainly methamphetamine. \n\n     In the depths of my methamphetamine addiction I came across a description of kratom and the benefits of using it as a tool to overcome various issues ranging from pain relief to the healing of mental issues. At first I was skeptical about it, but after using it for the first time I was sure that it had positive potential. I had become very impressed with it after a few uses. It was then that I decided to use it as a way to overcome my methamphetamine addiction and my mental health issues. I quit using methamphetamine altogether that very day. I used kratom to successfully subdue my unbearable cravings to use methamphetamine. Without kratom I would certainly still be using methamphetamine. After using kratom to overcome my meth addiction I began using kratom to deal with my excruciating anxiety and deep depression. Kratom relieves my anxiety and depression exceptionally, while exhibiting no negative side effects. By eliminating my anxiety kratom in turn subdues my OCD. Because of this I now have a safe healthy natural medicine that alleviates my mental pain. I now can work on changing my thought patterns in order to completely eliminate my mental disorders.\n\n     Ontop of all this, kratom has helped me to quit smoking. Kratom gives me clean efficient energy and focus that is superior to most stimulants and certainly feels much safer and healthier. Even though kratom provides me with valuable energy it also helps me achieve deeper more significant sleep. Since I have began using kratom I have managed to avoid almost all of the viruses that my coworkers, friends, and family whom I was in close contact with were sick from, wich leads me to believe that kratom is a powerful immune system supporter. Kratom has completely helped me change my life for the better and should absolutely remain 100% legal.\nThank you for allowing the public to comment on this.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2183","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't believe the federal government has any right to decide what humans can or can't put into their bodies, including potentially life-changing benefits those substances give us. give Kratom and cannabis a chance.

People aren't taking this to get \"high\".  At the most, the recreational effects are that of a cup of coffee where you might feel your mood slightly elevated, but there is no impairment.  The benefits to people that have chronic pain or have become addicted to either legal or illegal drugs are outstanding and should be studied more closely.  We're talking about a natural beneficial plant that has been used for thousands of years by many cultures.  \n\nOne story that really touched me is about a veteran with PTSD.  Without Kratom it is difficult for him to go out and face people because he has so many nervous ticks that he can't control.  It's even hard for him to talk because it's difficult for him to control his facial muscles.  When he takes Kratom the symptoms are almost non-existent.  Could you imagine taking this away from him and telling him that he will have to try a pharmaceutical drug that is much worse for his body and has much worse side effects and, in a lot of cases, is addictive.  My guess is that whether or not it is legal someone that really needs it is going to still find a way to get it.  Are you proposing that we put these people in a cage or give them some fine, even though they aren't adversely effecting anyone else, just because they just want to feel better???\n\nFinally, i just want to say that I've never taking Kratom myself, but have read many testimonials on the beneficial effects and lack of negative side effects.  I'm just a concerned citizen and the idea that the government take away the freedom of such people horrifies me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12458","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marc Briganti","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"this is a plant, gods kingdom, not yours","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18583","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Candis Murphy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For yrs I have struggled with body pain and recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia.

I also have major depressive disorder, anxiety, PTSD, insomnia, seizures, cognitive disabilities and balance problems since my brain injury. A lot of my back problems are a result of being injured while I was a fire fighter. I have been prescribed every opiate analgesic there is and at on point was taking enough to kill most people two or three times my size. I weened myself down to lower doses, then got hit with the brain injury. I heard about kratom and decided to try it because I hated feeling loopey from the opiates. It was a life changing decision for my whole family. This herb made me feel well enough to get out of bed every day. I have energy to play with my 2 grandsons and I can now help around the house. While I may not be allowed to drive, just being able to fix a meal or clean up occasionally has returned my sense of purpose. It's been over 14 months since I thought about suicide and that was at the forefront of my mind from the moment I awoke until I fell asleep because I thought myself just a burden. I can't impress on you enough how important it is to just have a feeling of well being! Please don't take that choice away from me because I don't know that my family or I could survive it.

This tea has has been so beneficial to us! I only use Kratom occasionally. I suffer from chronic lyme disease, and sometimes I really need help dealing with the symptoms and discomfort. I was a bit skeptical at first, but the results were truly amazing. I was able to find relief for nearly all of my symptoms with no side affects. Kratom has been even much more beneficial to my wife, who uses it every day. She has been a nurse for nearly twenty years, but her pain has been getting progressively worse, to the point that she would be incapacitated without the help Kratom offers her. She has degenerative disc disease, a severe whiplash injury, lyme, fibromyalgia, and her knee is completely deteriorated. Kratom helps her to function every day, and without making her feel \"high\". She would have no quality of life without it and would be bed bound, I'm sure. She deserves to have some relief, and to be able to live her life. She is a grandmother, and my best friend. She helps a lot of people, and is a kind hearted person. Please understand that Kratom is harmless and natural, and can only be beneficial to a lot of people.

I have been using kratom for over five years. During that time, I was able to break a cycle of addiction that I had to legally prescribed pain medication. Additionally, the depression I was suffering for many years has been lifted, and I know longer have to take antidepressant medicine that which often had terrible side effects. \n\nThroughout my time using kratom, I returned to college and received my Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering. This is something that I never could have done before. The legal pain medicine and antidepressant medication kept me in a mental fog, and I often found it difficult to even get out of bed. \n\nI support a federal age limit placed on the purchase of kratom, as well as a restriction on the sale of \"blended supplements\" that contain ingredients other than kratom. My understanding is that many of the negative reactions a minority of the population has suffered were due to consuming products containing other substances. I also realize that there is concern for minors using any mind altering substance, and I fully support \"regulation\" in this regard. I believe that kratom should not be packaged in a way that appeals to minors, similar to how tobacco products are treated. However, I urge you not to \"restrict\" the sale of this natural botanical substance to responsible adults.\n\nI am very thankful that the DEA has postponed any action, and I pray that the right decision regarding this wonderful plant will be reached. Many people I know would be devastated were kratom to be made a scheduled drug, and, unfortunately, I believe I would be one. \n\nThank you for your time and service to the public.

Scheduling this plant and its constituent alkaloids will only cause harm for those that rely on them to live normal, functioning lives. Many current users of this plant have been able to function while getting clean and detoxing from using harmful drugs such as heroin and pharmaceutical opioids. \n\nI personally did not start using Kratom for the above purpose, but rather for other reasons. In my personal experience, Kratom has helped me successfully interact with society when previously I would have had a difficult time functioning. In my job I interact with upwards of a thousand students and visitors during my work week. Debilitating anxiety has at times in the past prevented me from performing my job. I do not wish to take prescription benzodiazepines to treat this condition. I would rather seek out alternative, non-pharmaceutical options that, as an adult, I am fully within my rights to pursue. Kratom does not provide an opioid high like many news organizations and misinformed \"experts\" continue to claim. Unlike opioids that kill thousands every year, Kratom is not made in a laboratory (Some news outlets continue to falsely refer to it as a synthetic designer drug.), it does not cause respiratory distress at high doses, and will cause a unpleasant physical reaction if too large a dose is taken, discouraging abuse.\n\nWe all have a right to consume any number of nutritional supplements that we see fit to help improve our daily lives. Taking kratom is no different than taking Kava Kava, Chamomile or Blue Lotus tea. It has been used safely for thousands of years, and until recently it was unknown by the majority of the American public. Please defend all Americans' right to consume supplements of their choice as they see fit. Please do not pursue scheduling Kratom. The community of people benefiting from its use is too large, and too many lives will be harmed by its scheduling. The fear mongering by those who do not fully understand this plant has gone too far, and spread too many lies in its wake.  Please do the right thing and listen to those of us who's lives have been changed for the better by this plant.\n\n\nSeth O'Shields","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7754","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Seth O'Shields","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I wholeheartedly disagree with the potential ban against Kratom for the following reasons.

But to claim kratom is addicting, like opiates, is an insult to those who have ever had to stop taking natural or synthetic opiates. \n\nThe reason I continued taking kratom after stopping tramadol was because I have horrible restless leg syndrome, which only have been previously eased by tramadol. I have taken several drugs that are prescribed for RLS, nothing has worked. I have taken things ranging from gabapentin to pramipexole.  Not only do they not work, the side effects are horrendous. I am not productive without elimination of my symptoms and can not work in the field for which I have spent years preparing if my symptoms have to continue. \n\nI know the reason the DEA wants to ban this is due to mere pennies being lost by the drug companies and the fact that the pharmaceutical companies want to patent a version of this alkaloid, but there will be a greater monetary loss for the government if people cannot take this leaf that is helping so many. People will not go back to pharmaceuticals, like the drug companies so falsely think. Trust for the drug companies has been shattered. People take kratom because prescription medications don't work. If it is banned, people will either switch to illegal narcotics, like heroin, or they won't take anything and will be unproductive members of society, costing the government more money in disability payouts. Alternatively, methadone treatment will cost the government more. Similarly to what happened in Alabama when kratom was banned and people went back to heroin. This cost the government more money in disability and treatment.  This so-called war on drugs has been transparent from the beginning. It is not a war on drugs. It is a war on people wanting to get off prescription medication.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1604","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Im a 48-year-old woman. I have college degrees. I dont take recreational drugs. In fact, I rarely even drink alcohol. The first 32 years of my life were filled with abuse and trauma of various sorts from various sources. Ill spare the details, but Ive spent the last 16 years coping with the permanent PTSD all of that left me with. \nSeeking relief, Ive tried everything from therapy to meditation to prescribed drugs. The antidepressants from the doctor were the worst. Its great they help some peoplebut not me. I wanted so much to be healed. When one antidepressant left me an apathetic zombie, Id try another, and that left me irritable and mean. During the few years I tried antidepressants, I made decisions that I still dont understand. I got fired from two jobs. I reached my highest weight, more than what I weighed when I had entered the hospital to give birth. I told a family member you couldnt pay me a million dollars to take those again. I tried so hard, but they just didnt agree with me.\nI discovered kratom while searching online for an alternative remedy. I found that a few grams, a few times a day substantially reduces my debilitating depression and anxiety, certainly more than anything else Ive tried. I still have good days and bad days, but the overall severity is greatly reduced. \nIt doesnt make me high. Interestingly, Ive found no need to increase the amount in the three or so years Ive been using it. It seems to have a topping off point that doesnt change due to tolerance. It just balances. A few people may have used it to get high and ingested excessive amounts and got themselves sick just like they could by abusing caffeine or over the counter medications. \nIs it addicting? Well, Im also addicted to my steroidal asthma inhaler because it helps me breathe. As for kratom, when I run out, the same allergy and mental health symptoms that it relieves returns, but that is all. \nVeterans with PTSD and chronic pain sufferers deserve relief, so do former opioid addicts.  I wont break the law, so please dont take away this healing plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20279","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, \n\nI'm emailing in support to keep Kratom legal.

I also want to preface my comments by telling you I work for a non-profit that runs an early intervention substance abuse program for teens 12-17 in Colorado.  I'm in the trenches, I see what poorly regulated policies such as Amendment 64 and the failure of the federal government to protect citizens from harmful drugs has done to the youth in Colorado and to their families.\n\nMy son has ADHD as well as an addictive nature. I'll make his decent into drug abuse brief by stating only that as it so often is for teens dealing with ADHD this combination led to his drug use in high school that started with MJ.  When he no longer got the high from MJ he eventually became addicted to Oxy when he found an unscrupulous doctor willing to prescribe him very high doses of Oxy without so much as an MRI or Xray for back issues.  We later found out through genetic testing that my son has a certain gene mutation that blocked the full absorption of the Oxy.  Had he not have this particular marker, he would have died from the Oxy.  \n\nEnter the next hell, Kratom.  A friend suggested Kratom as a way to detox from the Oxy, it still gives you the high like Oxy and it's legal and safe.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  My son was taking the Kratom by the spoonfuls and washing it down with a glass of water numerous times throughout the day using an entire bag a day.  He became just as lethargic, just as dangerously thin, just as unmotivated, just as depressed and anxious, just as explosive as when he was taking Oxy.  He lost several jobs, a relationship, teeth and I'm convinced if it went on much longer he would have lost his life.  Instead of enjoying the most wonderful time of a twenty something's life, he was very much dependent on us because he had no money to move out spending $30 a day on Kratom and could not keep a job.\n\nDetoxing from the Kratom took several long and agonizing weeks.  Any drug or \"safe\" herb that does this kind of damage to anyone should never be legal.  Although he is completely drug and Kratom free, I can still see the physical effects the Kratom had on him and I'm afraid to even think about the health issues he might experience when he is older from the lethal doses he was consuming.\n\nHis \"crutch\" excuse was always that he needed it for back pain, however, now that he is off the Kratom he rarely complains about his back.\n\nThe DEA has ignored what's going on in Colorado with MJ legalization.  It has had a devastating effect on our teens as I see it everyday working with them.  This failed experiment has proven that regulation does not work and has given our youth up as collateral damage.  I implore you to do the right thing and uphold the ban on Kratom.  We were lucky to be able to intervene and help our son but many families are still struggling with heart wrenching situations as their love one self destructs before them.  The biggest problem we see in our youth is the removal of the perception of the harm of MJ and other drugs.  We do pre and post tests with our teens and over the last few years their perception of the harm of all drugs has gone down considerably.  Don't do the same thing with Kratom.\n\nLifting the ban has been very unfortunate as so many addicted people had probably gone through the detox phase already.  Kratom is NOT a safe alternative to Oxy or Heroine, it's just one more in the mix.\n\nIt's time the voice of reason starts being heard over those who want to continue to support their habits despite what it does to families and our society.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n  \n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1998","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marie Terry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom.

I found out about kratom from my wife's cousin who used it to treat his addiction to substances effectively, and I can see how.  He recommended them to my wife after she stated her constant struggle with getting off her prescription medications due to lack of health insurance to cover future doctor visits.  My mood has felt lifted and enhanced, motivated and energetic again (in a natural and focused way, and non debilitating way) and my pain reduced from a chronic 8 to an almost 0.  I find no addiction to the plant.  I simply take each morning to help with my problems, as does my wife.  I disagree with the ban of this plant because I do not believe it comes anywhere near a controlled substance.

My and is Shannon Riley and I am a 36 year old woman with an extensive education and aspirations. I am in the process of starting my own business and have otherwise spent the past 6 years as a professional in the media. I would like to share my experience with Kratom.\n\nWhen I was 14 or 15 years old I had gone to the hospital with rapid heartbeat, chest pains and dizziness. I literally thought I was dying. The diagnosis was a panic attack and anxiety. I had this occur a couple more times throughout high school and college. While I had received professional help from psychologist during my high school years I chose not to take any medications. I had learned to have this as a part of my life. After my undergraduate years, I started to not only deal with anxiety, but also depression (my family has a significant history of depression and anxiety). Finally, I had to again seek help for these symptoms as they were interfering with my day to day functioning, at which time I was prescribed anti-anxiety (Xanax) medication and a multitude of attempts for different antidepressants. I did feel like things were better than they had been, however I was starting to have other symptoms, which were mostly a feeling of not feeling at all. I was told these were side effects of the medication and tried yet another attempt at different depression medication. This lasted for the better part (or more) of a decade. I graduated with my Masters degree in 2010, at which time my brother came to celebrate. I had not seen him in about 2 years and he pulled me aside to ask what was going on with me. I did not understand what he was asking until he told me that I seemed vacant and not the same person that he had known for 30 years. That is when I realized what detrimental effects these antidepressant and anti-anxiety drugs were having on me. While dealing with the anxiety and depression was horrible, I wanted to be able to be the person I once was and feel again. \n\nThis is when I had started talking to good friends and going online to seek alternative options for my depression/anxiety. I went through a period where I tried some herbal options on the mainstream health supplement market and unfortunately, they did not seem to have an impact. I was talking to a good friend who also suffered somewhat from anxiety, but had chronic pain from a knee injury. He had been prescribed pain medication, but instead found Kratom and found it to have helped him enough where he did not use the prescription, as he had described the similar side effects that I had experienced with anti-anxiety/depression medication. In this conversation, he mentioned seeing that Kratom was also used for anxiety and depression. I looked online into Kratom and its uses and the research that I could find regarding side effects and potential issues with Kratom use and decided to see if it would help me. I made a tea with it 6 years ago, and have not looked back to the alternatives. I use it daily and situationally if I feel anxiety coming on. I have not experienced a panic attack the way I used to, my depression has lessened extensively, but what has helped me more than anything is that I can feel this way without compromising happiness for indifference. While, I know there are contentions about the effectiveness and usage of Kratom, I can only speak for myself in that it has helped me to regain enjoyment in my life. I truly hope the restriction on Kratom by the DEA is whole heartedly reconsidered, as I could not imagine the alternatives for myself. \n\nThank you for the consideration,\nShannon Riley\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22991","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"1980","postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shannon Riley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\nDear DEA,\n\nI urge you not to place kratom (mitragynine) on Schedule I of the CSA.\n\nKratom does not meet the criteria of Schedule I. There is virtually no evidence as to this drug's potential for abuse, though it appears to be much less addictive than opioids or alcohol. There have been no documented deaths attributable to kratom alone, and autopsies finding\nmitragynine have no scientific basis to conclude that it contributed to or caused the death. Anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that it is a safer alternative to opioids: it has fewer side effects, doesn't repress breathing, and can help a user overcome opioid addiction. Where is the public risk from this drug? Opioid addiction has become an epidemic in this country. Stifling research into mitragynine's potential medical uses benefits only sellers of opioids.\n\nThere is now a small but dedicated community of kratom users. Their recountings of its use as a pain reliever, sleep aid, and effective substitute for opioids are strikingly similar to the personal histories of medical marijuana users. \n\nAt 66 I am now one of those medical marijuana users. With access to marijuana I have avoided using large amounts of NSAIDs, but may in the future need a much stronger pain medication to treat the symptoms of degenerative spinal disc disease. A drug derived from kratom may, if research is allowed, provide an alternative to opioids for me.\n\nPlease, show that you can consider all aspects, good and bad, of this traditional herbal medicine. On balance it appears that it may REDUCE risk to the public by offering a safer alternative to opioids. \n\nThank you,\n\nCatherine Ries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7225","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Catherine Ries","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n I have 3 ruptured discs in my back and have been in pain therapy for years.

This is not a drug for enjoyment it is a lifesaver. Don't ban it. Promote it. I agreed with the ban on bathsalts and \"insence\" but I can not agree with banning kratom. The customers who buy kratom are working people looking for an alternative to addictive pain killers. They just want to be in control of there pain and there life.

I found it to help me feel less fatigued and help curb the symptoms of anxiety and depression that have been a struggle for me since I was a kid.\n\n\nMoreover, kratom has helped me to move away from alcohol dependency, as it provides stress relief without alcohol's negative side effects or dangers. From my experience, kratom can be habit forming, much like coffee.\n\nI grew up in Upstate New York - I've checked in with my high school friends and found the opiate epidemic has reached some of them as well. My coworker's mother was addicted to Hydrocodone for years, and was able to get off of them and start living again by using kratom as a supplement. This gives me hope for my friends in the Northeast, but that hope is squashed if the DEA moves forward with scheduling.\n\nI'm fairly sure that members of the DEA have family and friends dealing with opiate dependency, and I have love in my heart for them. I want them and everyone else to have a better chance at living a happy and healthy life. \n\nIn conclusion, I oppose any scheduling of this plant or any of it's active compounds. Instead, I recommend the FDA recognize Kratom for what it is: an herbal supplement.

Over the last few years, I have personally began experimenting with legal drugs including kratom. In the near future kratom will be reviewed with the potential of being placed on the DEA's list of schedule 1 drugs.\n\nThe reason I am writing this letter is to share my experiences with the drug and my concerns with it being placed on this list. Firstly, the drug is often used for the purpose of pain relief. Thought the drug can give the user sedative-like side effects, this can be avoided by consuming the drug at low dosages. If kratom were to be placed on this list not only would the product be unavailable for public use, but also potential research purposes in the future.\n\nSecondly, kratom is not a synthetic drug, created specifically for recreational purposes. Kratom is a crop that can be grown in any individuals backyard, given the right care and environment.\n\nFinally, because of the nature of the drug, kratom isn't a plant that would cause problems for non-users. While particular drugs such as PCP are known to create erratic behavior in the consumer, potentially creating danger for a third party, the consequences of improper kratom use are directed towards the consumer. My question to you is: do you believe that an individual should be punished for the products they personally consume in their own private residence? This is the likely scenario for the majority of kratom users.\n\nAny person able to access the internet today has the ability to find for themselves the proper way to handle products like kratom, and how to use them responsibly. When I first began consuming kratom I used the internet to discover the correct dosage for me to receive the plants anti-anxiety properties. The plant has helped me to combat my struggles with social anxiety disorder and is used rarely and in small amounts. If the DEA decided to classify kratom as a schedule 1 drug, the have essentially decided that people like me cannot be trusted with their individual autonomy and are not generally able to decide for themselves whether or not kratom can be used to benefit their lives. I hope that in the coming months kratom will not be classified as a drug and that the potential for research into the plants pain relief properties will remain open.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10872","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 52 years old and used Kratom for pain management while living in GA with my daughter. \nI wax unable to take care of myself because a severe adverse reaction caused from the antibiotic Levaquin.

I am a 33 year old software architect/engineer with a BA in psychology and strong interests in biology, chemistry, and neuroscience.\n\nOne of the side effects of working on the computer all day is that -- regardless of how much care one puts in to ergonomics, stretching, proper exercise, and good working habits -- it eventually takes a toll on the body. I have been to a few physiotherapists, orthopedists, and related specialists, but have not come away with anything that alleviates the issues I've had with my neck. \n\nAside from the neck issues, I am in good physical and mental condition; this makes things all the more frustrating. My experience with standard medical care was less than satisfactory. Exercises and stretching help, but cant be used as spot fixes on days when things get really bad. Pharmaceuticals can work as spot fixes, but leave me feeling worse in the long run; they reduce my motivation, make me tired, and have unacceptably negative influences on my ability to think and remember things. That leaves me with a choice between being in pain but functional, or achieving temporary relief at the cost of job performance. This is not an acceptable trade-off. \n\nEnter Kratom. After doing a lot of reading, looking for some natural supplement that might help, I came across Kratom. The research on it is limited, but its been around long enough to guess at safety for personal use, and didnt appear to have any major negative effects. In short, it sounded like a lot of herbal or alternative medicine. Not a lot of evidence for effectiveness, but nothing too adverse, and plenty of positive  reports. \n\nThat was about 2 years ago. I've been taking Kratom for about 2 years now; about 8 months continuously the first time, followed by a break for about a year, and approaching 10 months this time.\n\nI find that Kratom has a positive effect on my well being. Kratom allows me to function better. Kratom results in less pain and more energy, without forcing me to sacrifice mental clarity or physical ability. While I hesitate to say that its exactly like coffee, I would suggest that its effectiveness, tolerance, usage, and experience quitting is pretty similar. Its kind of a calmer version of the first cup of coffee for the day. I just feel better generally; the pain in my neck fades out of the picture and I can proceed through my day normally. \n\nIf I forget to take it, or skip it that day, I feel about the same as if I skipped my coffee. If I stop taking it, it feels exactly the opposite of quitting coffee; instead of being groggy for a few days, I have trouble sleeping for a few days. \n\nWhile I do believe that regulating Kratom in a very general way -- namely with an age limit -- would be wise, any measures beyond that are liable to have a significant negative impact on the well-being of millions of people who use it as an alternative to heavy-duty pharmaceuticals in dealing with mild-to-moderate pain and general malaise.\n\n\nTo state things clearly, though less personally:\n\nI believe that Kratom should be regulated as a supplement, available to those 21 and up, and with no additional restrictions. \n\n\nKratom has been around for quite some time with limited negative consequences. Millions of Kratom users represent only a small fraction of emergency room visits or poison control calls, and there is an  apparent lack of mortality in sum total when considering incidents involving Kratom alone (non poly-drug). A large body of anecdotal data suggesting that Kratom can, and has, been used to successfully transition off of opiates (harm reduction). There are many current Kratom users, some like myself, who take it in place of pharmaceuticals with severe adverse effect profiles, to generally improve their quality of life. And, there is significant research interest in Kratom (two papers published in the last 6-8 months, along with a patent) that would likely suffer a chilling effect as a result of more stringent regulation.\n\nWhile Kratom may not be entirely without downsides, it appears it has much more in common with herbal supplements than with pharmaceutical drugs. Things like Coffee, Cats Claw, Ashwaghanda, Bacopa, St. Johns Wort, Kava, various forms of Tea& all have both positive effects, and potential negative effects on the same order of those exhibited by Kratom, and all are expected to be remain legal for the foreseeable future. Please make the correct decision, and group Kratom in with its herbal supplement kin.\n\nPlease consider my comments, and the thousands of others made on the topic of Kratom during the review period in making your decisions about the fate of this plant, and, more importantly, about the potential fates of the millions of people who use it in pursuit of improved well-being.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21777","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Davids","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"i am not as educated as most people, i have never tried using the kratom plant. but after hearing people talk about it, whether i would ever decide to try it or not, i strongly believe in the legality of this plant. so many items like this are legal, i understand fear, and its easy to be driven by your own or other peoples. but the truth that i feel is this is a plant, and it should be up to the individual if they want this plant as a tool or supplement in their life. thank you for your time, i hope my opinion helps anybody become aware of what fear can do to any human being, even on a small level. its the last plant we should be making illegal if it aids the majority of people using it,","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12877","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"wesley Baccaro","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I suffer from depression and anxiety.\nKratom has been an effective tool in my battle with these afflictions.\nI have never felt any bad effects, it is gentle as a cup of coffee\nIn fact it goes well with a cup of coffee to help me start my day with a more positive attitude, which is essential in my work as an artist.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21633","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Linda Lindsey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am opposed to Kratom becoming a Schedule I substance as it helps many of my loved ones safely treat their physical pain as well as their mental health conditions.

I have suffered from mild to moderate depression and OCD for 10 years. I tried multiple prescription antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications over the years, and I stopped each time due to lack of efficacy and unacceptable side effects. Those medications made me feel apathetic, and my quality of life was no better while taking them. When stopping SSRI drugs, I had a very strong reaction in several cases; I ended up in he hospital due to suicidal idealations that I had never experienced prior to starting the medication. I decided that living with mild to moderate depression and OCD was preferable to what I experienced on those medications.\n\nI started taking Kratom two years ago in a last-ditch effort to alleviate some of my symptoms and have some semblance of happiness. Not only did it help with my depression, it also didn't cause the same apathy and other negative side effects commonly associated with SSRIs. I finally felt normal for the first time in 10 years. Moreover, when I have taken periodic breaks, I did not experience the same severe discontinuation syndrome that I did with the prescription medications. \n\nI take two grams twice a day. I have been doing so for two years and have never felt compelled to increase the dose.  Kratom has increased my quality of life tenfold. Please don't take it away.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0727","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir or Madam:\n\nI am writing you regarding an issue very close to my heart.  This is in regards to the DEAs Notice of Intent to Schedules of Controlled Substances: Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine Into Schedule I, essentially banning a harmless herb, which has helped many individuals to alleviate their own personal physical pain, including our men and women in service and that have served who cannot find relief for their daily physical pain (or choose not to) through conventional narcotic pain medication, would only increase the prison population greater or lead to these people to choose a path they dont want: that of using prescription painkillers. \n\nIt can also help with withdrawal symptoms from prescription opioid drugs and street narcotics, which we are seeing an epidemic of in our country. It is my opinion that the DEA is exceeding its authority to place a plant used by hundreds of thousands of law abiding citizens on the list of Schedule I drugs, which would turn them into immediate criminals - risking extensive jail time due to mandatory minimums, removing their right to vote, and severely impairing the ability to get a job once they are freed, amongst all the other negative consequences.  As Im sure you are well aware, the US has the highest prison population in the world, with over 50% of the inmates in federal prison being non-violent drug offenders.  It is absolutely absurd for the DEA to add a plant, which has been used as a tea for thousands of years by East Asia to their scheduling list.  According to medical literature, not a single death has been caused by kratom (without the individual being a polydrug cocktail that included kratom). [1]  \n\nThe DEA says that kratom has resulted in a total of 30 deaths in the US, and although that is a tragedy, prescription opioid medications alone have resulted in a whopping 28,000 deaths from heroin and prescription painkillers in 2014.  Right now, there is a huge crisis of deaths from opioid abuse in this country that could be helped greatly by leaving kratom available and in the hands of consumers.  Kratom, being a natural plant, should be regulated by the FDA under the DSHEA as a dietary supplement, as it meets that exact criteria.  If there is concern about its misuse, it should be restricted to adults age 18 or 21 to purchase.  Unfortunately, because of all the yellow journalism and smears in the mainstream media, kratom has been lumped together with drugs that should have and have been properly banned.\n\nRecently, the state of Florida had proposed to ban kratom earlier this year, but after testimony and an examination of common sense medical information, Florida came to the conclusion:\n\na review of information currently available through identified law enforcement and laboratory sources in Florida indicates that Kratom does not constitute a significant risk to the safety or welfare of Florida residents. The Florida Department of Health (DOH) reports no pervasive health issues attributed to the ingestion of Kratom products in Florida. [2]\n\nI myself am a daily kratom user, drinking it in the form of a tea to help alleviate the excruciating pain brought upon by my irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).  Banning this substance would negatively affect my quality of life to intolerable degree, of which I have found no prescription medication or treatment to be as effective as kratom.\n\nI believe God gave us this miracle pain relieving plant, to use for the benefit of all mankind, as he said in Genesis 1:29-30\n\nThen God said, \"Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you; and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the sky and to everything that moves on the earth which has life, I have given every green plant for food\"; and it was so.\n\nI view the fact that this plant was just recently brought to the west from across the great oceans as a sign from God that it is intended to help the people of this nation, to help our opioid epidemic, which is taking the lives of so many of our young people today.\n\nI am not the only one who will be impacted by this insane ban.  Just search the hashtag #IamKratom on Youtube, Twitter or Facebook and listen to the stories of people who have been helped tremendously -- many have had their lives saved -- by this simple plant, a tea, that the DEA wants to take away from us for no just cause.\n\nI appreciate the DEA listening to us, the kratom users, and giving us the opportunity to have a public comment period for kratom. These are my thoughts, facts and opinion on the matter.  I hope you will make the right decision and leave kratom as a dietary supplement.\n\nSincerely,\nJonathan Grose\n\nFoodnote source [1]: bit.ly/2gzGuYE\nFootnote source [2]: bit.ly/2gmzPTQ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20958","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathan Grose","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Good Afternoon, my name is Tracy Profit and I live in Caldwell, Idaho.  I am married to the most loving, hardworking man there is. And you'd never guess that he was ever addicted to drugs.  But he was, he was like millions of people, addicted to pain pills, due to numerous injuries sustained working ranches and rodeoing. He was told that the cure was neck and back surgery, told he had arthritis.  He thought those types of surgeries didn't work and that it would exacerbate the pain. So he took his prescription of 120 Norco's every month and of course had to buy more off the streets to keep his pain levels manageable. It was to say the least the lowest 5 years he'd ever experienced. Then four years ago we heard about Kratom. He did some research and decided to give it a try.  Three years of using a regime of Green Vein Malaysian and he has NOT taken a pain pill since.  No side effects, no mind alterations, no mood swings, no withdrawals like when he was on pain meds.  A complete change in his motivation for the positive. I've always believed in God and the power of prayer, but I would never have guessed that Kratom would be so unbelievably effective in managing his pain without the side effects.  I am asking so hopefully that you will consider doing research on Kratoms properties, instead of banning it all together. Please do not put this as a Schedule 1 drug, it's helping so many more people than it could ever hurt.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17373","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tracy Profit","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"See attached file(s)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17263","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern,\n\nI am a 49 year old full time reading specialist in a Title I school and an actively involved mom, two roles that I cherish.

I have spent years homebound and in severe pain, unable to work and be an active mom. I sought to free myself from addictive pain killers and the stupor they cause, and instead I decided to take a natural approach to management of my condition. \n\nKratom allows me to feel comfortable, yet mentally sharp.

It has been the biggest blessing on my healing journey. \n\nPlease imagine if you or your loved one was in chronic pain, untreatable by current medicine, yet made manageable by a natural herbal supplement.

I choose a natural approach to health and appreciate kratom which has a gentle effect of easing symptoms without a high or stupor that medications can cause.  I love my job teaching children to read which requires me to be alert and physically active. I want to continue consuming kratom as I have done effectively for years without any harmful side effects.  \n\nI am in support of research and study, and understand that regulations such as proper labeling and age restrictions could be explored if the science suggests that it is advisable. However, I am opposed to criminalizing thousands of responsible citizens like myself who consume kratom tea to aid quality of life.\n\nI hope that you will listen to the veterans, teachers, lawyers, police officers, corporate CEOs, professors, scientists who have spoken on behalf of kratom. They are chronic pain patients, elderly, single moms, and accident victims. They are people who are finding relief and renewed life with a simple plant.

I live in Tampa; heroin is prevalent here, i hear ambulances on a daily basis due to overdoses. I have personally witnessed people shoot up and overdose while on my way to the store for christ sake. kratoms specific aspect of being not deadly is very important and should be asknocledged.\n\n3) I personally struggled with drug addiction after an injury and prescription drugs/heroin. Kratom allowed me to quit prescription drugs (with only slight withdraw) and my sobriety from those drugs have allowed me to not only not experience cravings; but has allowed me to stop taking my depression meds (due to mitragynines effect on serotonin) and has helped me go from failing college to being a A student.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that if there is a creator (god;ywh;allah) kratom was put here by that god to help people.  Kratom alone has never killed anyone as the american kratom associations review of the deaths that have been supposedly blamed on kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12514","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Becker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep Kratom available to the public.

When I was 21 years old, I had my wisdom teeth removed.  Upon completion of the procedure, the doctor prescribed me oxycodone.  Before long I found myself addicted.   It wasn't long before I was seeking narcotic medication on the streets.  Shortly after, my life started to deteriorate.  I ended up getting a DUI and a criminal record.  Years went by and my life worsened in many ways.  Narcotic medication was the first thing I thought about in the morning and last thing I thought about at night.  I would go to doctors and try to convince them to give me more meds whether I had insurance are not.  Several times I attempted to quit taking narcotic meds but found myself craving whenever I passed the pharmacy on the street or was in situations that reminded me of the euphoria I felt when I was high.  I went to a methadone clinic and after several months I started weaning myself off.  During this time, I was experiencing horribly uncomfortable days and almost no sleep at night.  It was on one of the sleepless nights that I read about Kratom online.  I decided to try it and almost immediately the withdrawal symptoms subsided.  Since I've found kratom my life has drastically improved.  I sleep at night better than I have in years.  My wife and I started and maintain a successful business.  I'm a contributing member to society and a faithful Christian.   With my addictive personality I can't imagine what life will be like without kratom.  I know several other people personally that have similar stories.  My personality does not enable me to have the self-control to manage pharmaceutical medication.  I recently underwent a dental procedure and at which point the dentist prescribed me Vicodin.  I can gladly say for the first time that I did not feel the need to fill the prescription.  I pray that you will take this story into consideration before making your ruling on kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17650","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Samuel Rea","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To the DEA,\n  I think Kratom is just like a cup of coffee to start your day off with or even in the late afternoon when you got much you still need to get done.

I originally planned to start an IT consulting business, but I constantly felt depressed and tired. These feelings prevented me from doing the work I needed to do in order to get the business off the ground.\n\nI read about kratom online, Some people said that it helped raise their mood and improved their productivity. At the time, I was drinking 8-9 beers per night and doing very little work. This was unsustainable behavior and I knew I had to make changes.\n\nI ordered a little bit of kratom from an online retailer. The effects were subtle, it just blocked out all the negative self talk in my head. I didn't feel sick and had no negative side affects. But the elimination fo the negative self talk and mood elevation helped my productivity immensely. I started going to the gym in the morning followed by a productive work day.\n\nI rarely use kratom anymore because I was able to develop productive work habits that lasted once I stopped taking it. I sometimes take it if I am feeling down and need some inspiration. If it is made illegal, I certainly won't take it anymore, but I think that course of action would eliminate a tool for others that I personally used to improve my life. I hope you take this into consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2387","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Feneley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been taking Kratom for close to two years for my chronic pain and invisible diseases and it has changed my life!

Coffee just didn't do the trick anymore and I was stressed out. I was told to try a teaspoon of Kratom  in my coffee by a good friend at work. It gives me a little boost of energy and helps me focus on my job and relieves a little of the aches and pains without using any over the counter pain medication that is damaging to the liver and kidneys. I was taking at least 4 Tylenol or ibuprofen daily but now maybe once a week? Kratom eases anxiety from daily stress and helps motivate you on a day you don't really want to get out of bed. I really don't understand why it is being targeted? I really don't see how a leaf or anything that grows out of the ground could be made illegal.

Do not place kratom on a schedule 1 drug list. I am a 61 year old female. I have suffered with chronic lower back pain most of my adult life, and for the last 10 years developed what at times can be excruciating pain in one hip.  I haven't had health insurance for years since I was laid off of the last decent paying job I've had in about 10 years.  Bad economy and lack of jobs forced me into working in retail which doesn't pay enough to meet the high payments of even Obama care.  Unfortunately, I only discovered kratom about 8 months ago, but it was a life saver and a game changer.  I currently work at a gas station/convenience store where I stand for 6 to 8 hours a day, without a break or lunch.  I have to empty what can sometimes be quite heavy bags of trash, plus lift and stack heavy flats of beverages in order to keep coolers stocked. Prior to kratom, there were days where I just wanted to sit down and cry due to being in so much pain.  After working my 4 day week, my first day off was almost always wasted because I could barely move while my body tried to recover from the stress of the week. I have never been one to take pain pills.  I don't like the way they make me feel and some of them make me so sick that I'm useless anyway.  Even when I've had surgeries, I would only take the pain pills for the first 1-2 days and then maybe take ibuprofen or nothing at all. Kratom has helped me immensely. No it does not always take away ALL the pain, but it can take the pain from a 9 or 10 down to a 1 or 2 and that is an enormous rescue considering it does not make me sick, it does not cause me to feel like I'm drugged out, I'm still able to function, and I only need a small amount. I actually have a slight increase in energy due to the lack of pain. I could never figure out why I was always so tired, then I realized, I was always exhausted because I was always in pain!  Without the pain, I felt almost normal again.  It was as if I had new life!.  If I have to go back to not having kratom avail again, it will be a dissension into an abyss of chronic pain again with no relief.  I will not be able to continue working as I am at this time with the help of kratom.  I will probably end up on disability and another burden for the government to bear.  This is not what I desire.  I hope to be able to continue to be mobile and look forward to continuing to work (though not at my current job) for another 5 years minimum, until I'm 70 at best.

Kratom is a very safe herbal supplement that millions of Americans use for a variety of reasons to enrich and better their lives. From personal experience and from reading and hearing hundreds of anecdotes from users, it is no more habit forming than coffee and it is much less dangerous than traditional opiates due to the fact that it does not cause respiratory depression. The science thus far shows that the compounds in kratom appear to be biased agonists that only trigger one opioid pathway, called the G protein pathway, and not another pathway associated with respiratory depression. Though it does have the potential to become habitual, much like caffeine, it is self-limiting in that consuming progressively higher amounts does not produce euphoric or narcotic effects.\n\n     I am 30 years old and have been taking kratom regularly as an herbal supplement for over 3 years and have only experienced positive benefits. I drink low doses of kratom tea because I have found it to help relieve my chronic back pain and pain from carpal tunnel syndrome after a long days work as an IT contractor for the federal government. I have noticed too, that kratoms mood boosting effects have reduced my anxiety and helped alleviate depression. Its beautiful to have found a natural herb that can both reduce the pain caused by software programming and aid me in my social interactions and mental well-being. Much in the way coffee helps me to work hard, stay focused, and feel energized, kratom has a similar positive role in my life. By banning this substance, the government would be making me a criminal for responsibly utilizing an herbal supplement that helps me work and function better. I fear banning kratom will rob folks who suffer from debilitating and chronic illnesses of an alternative way to reduce their symptoms and make their lives better. \n\n     We must allow American adults the liberty to make their own decisions about what they put in their body. Frankly, prohibition of a reasonably safe substance goes against the very foundations of this great nation. The DEA and FDA would really need to prove that kratom is responsible for widespread negative effects on health and well-being and we simply dont have any evidence of this. Furthermore, these laws that allow emergency scheduling of substances were put in place in order to stop dangerous and novel synthetic substances from causing harm to society. Kratom is a plant that has been safely used for thousands of years and we certainly arent seeing an epidemic of abuse or widespread deleterious health effects like we have with new synthetic designer drugs. In fact, we are now seeing many reports that kratom is helping people to quit toxic substances like heroine, oxycodone and other synthetic opiates, and even alcohol. \n\n     The CDC estimates that over 14,000 people per year die from opiate painkillers while several hundred die from NSAIDs like acetaminophen. According to the DEA, kratom has been implicated in 15 deaths between 2014 and 2016, though experts familiar with the cases are arguing that nearly all of them involved other substances. Even if we were to overlook the probable polypharmacy cause of death in most of these cases, 8 deaths per year is far safer than what we are experiencing with NSAIDs and prescription painkillers. Unfortunately, we dont have enough data to directly compare the mortality rate, but we can accurately say that kratom is not causing an epidemic of overdoses, acute health problems or substance abuse. Opiate pills and heroine on the other hand have become increasingly damaging to individuals and society. If there is a chance that kratom could be part of the solution to the opiate epidemic in this country, we should certainly put the time and effort into conducting scientific studies before hastily illegalizing it.\n\n     In conclusion, the unprecedented and reckless move to emergency schedule the kratom plant before properly considering it scientifically, while also ignoring the millions of responsible Americans users that find benefits in supplementing the plant, would be wrong both logically and morally. We know for a fact that kratom is providing a large number of people with a variety of benefits with negligible reports of negative effects on health. The plant and its alkaloids should be studied extensively before we make any rash decisions that would prevent regular Americans citizens, veterans, folks that suffer from chronic medical ailments, and heroine/opiate addicts from accessing an herbal remedy that can and does greatly improve their lives. I think it is clear that the benefits of kratom as a supplement vastly outweigh any argument against scheduling it at this point in time. I strongly support keeping kratom legal, unscheduled, and available as a supplement for American adults.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12107","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nat Natarajan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have taken kratom all day everyday for 3 years and worked a good full time job.

After a severe toxic exposure, I developed interstitial cystitis, colitis, fibromyalgia and CFIDS within several years. In fewer than five years, I'd also developed two stage III cancers: bladder and colon. As one might imagine, I was left disabled and in considerable, worsening pain due to pelvic radiation disease, and the pain brought about by the other illnesses.\n\nThe only thing that addressed the level of pain that I experienced was a battery of pharmaceuticals: Morphine, Gabapentin, Hydrocodone (Vicodin), and then the attending medicines so typically prescribed for the various side effects of these drugs -- sleep medications and anti-depressants. Although I always took only what prescribed and often under-medicated, after years of taking these drugs, I had become inefficient, distracted, and unable to successfully carry out my active everyday routine. On three occasions, I was unconscious and vomiting -- had I been alone, I would be yet another of the millions of people dead from accidental Rx overdose. Never having taken more than prescribed, I learned that it only takes one pill atop a weary body to KILL, and that death from narcotics and other pharmaceuticals is shockingly so very simple to achieve.\n\nWanting to free myself from the life-choking clutches of pharmaceuticals, I had extensively looked into and tried natural remedies, none of which worked for me. I felt dejected that I was stuck, stuck being dull, spacey, and in general, a shell of what I normally am, as a result of narcotics and the other medications typically associated with them.\n\nTwo years ago, I discovered Kratom. Thinking it a last effort and not expecting anything positive, I was shocked and delighted to find that KRATOM WORKED! I began to substitute it for my narcotics and other medicines and within two months, I was ecstatic to have achieved getting off ALL prescription pain, sleep, and anti-depressant medicines. I have not had to take them since 12.31.14, and my life has once again been returned to me. This IS life. This IS normal, daily existence. I can speak without losing my train of thought, I can write again, I can think sharply again, I can carry out my work again, and I am once again \"myself,\" thanks solely to Kratom. \n\nThis is not a \"high-making\" substance. It is simply a leaf from a tree related to the coffee plant. In two years that I have been taking it, I have never had to increase my dosage, and at times, my pain is so well controlled that I take less than my average dose. It is an amazing gift to be able to return to LIFE, which had been suffocated beneath the necessary pharmaceuticals I took for so many years. The sheer joy of not having to be rendered a dulled, distracted, unengaged shell of the person I am is indescribable, and I have said so much, ad nauseam, as I have emerged from the cloud of prescription drugs, which, stop their life-sucking horror, also cost me a great deal of money. \n\nIn having become familiar with many groups addressing the use of Kratom, it also became clear to me that *many* people who found themselves in the throes of addiction to street drugs were able to get off them by using Kratom. This is a huge boon to society! \n\nThe thought that this magnificent, life-saving plant might be taken from me is quite literally terrifying. I compare it to a death sentence. Indeed, while on the drugs necessary to quell my pain, I do not have much of a life, and if I have another episode of passing out and vomiting without being accompanied, I stand to *lose* my life. Certainly, many people who have found Kratom help in dealing with chronic pain will suffer and some will die when forced to go back to the dangerous combinations of prescription drugs required for relief. Please, please do not take this amazing, life-saving plant from us  it  unlike anything else out there   has given us our lives.\n\nJoana Dougherty deBelkadi\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16721","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joana Marie Dougherty deBelkadi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There needs to be more clinical research on this drug before banning it.

One way of reducing harm is to substitute a harmful drug (such as opiates) with a less harmful drug (such as mitragynine or 7-hydroxymitragynine). The logic to this is axiomatic - a drug that can clearly cause great harm, including death, such as opiates, is more harmful than a less-dangerous drug such as kratom. While abstinence may be ideal, it is not possible, nor desirable to many substance users. That is why we need more, not fewer options for helping substance users reduce their substance use (and it's attendant harm) while en route to abstinence, whenever possible.

In this case SSRIs can keep the problem at bay until therapy or other drug treatments are found.  \n\nThe other popular option is benzodiazepine medications.  While these work acutely, and produce feelings of peace and pleasure, they are very often abused and over-prescribed.  Most importantly, the withdrawal danger is severe with this class of drugs and can cause death.  The same simply cannot be said for kratom, yet only one has been considered for scheduling.  The faulty logic of this situation is self-evident.  Given the choice between (a) synthetic drug whose withdrawals may kill you, or (b) a plant whose withdrawals involve restless leg and diarrhea, the sensible choice is obvious. Kratom is the more useful treatment.  \n\nA side benefit of opioid usage is it completely removes the urge to consume alcohol, which, again, is another far more lethal substance that destroys lives of its users and non-users every day, which is not being considered for scheduling.  We cannot continue this topsy-turvy outlook on drug usage in the United States.  I find kratom to dramatically improve my quality of life, with the only downside being cost.  Kratom allows me to function at a higher level, put in more hours at work, drink less, work out more, and face situations with a sense of calm instead of anxiety and dread.  \n\nTo schedule this plant is doing a grave disservice to me and untold thousands of responsible adults who are choosing the best option available to them.  Doing so will absolutely cost some people their lives by relapsing into pain pills, heroin, or increase alcohol usage.  For all of these reasons, I urge the DEA to do right by American people and discard kratom scheduling permanently.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9665","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carl Brown","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 42 years okd and own two businesses. I am a father and a husband and I work very hard and always have. I broke my back 20 years ago and have had severe pain ever since. I also have degenerating disks in my knees. Kratom is the only non narcotic herb that I can take that takes away my pain for multiple house at a time with very little use. It is the onething that allows me to work 75 hours a week in order to run both of my businesses and keep up with my kids and hectic family and work life. It is not addictive there are many days I dont need it. However, on those days after a rough couple of hard work days it is excellent at helping me recover and keep functional at the same time. I have a high stress level from all the things i have to coordinate,employees taxes payroll customers clients kids etc. so it is hard to sleep with all that I have on my mind. Kratom helps me sleep soundly so I can be well rested for the next day. I do nio want to resort to pharmaceuticales which are addictive and have become an epedemic in todays society. Causing tens of thousands of overdoses and much crime throughout the country. Kratom has none of those effects. It allows you to keep your normal brain function while easing pain miraculously without the imparment of prescription drugs. Also without the dr. Bills and the costs of prescription drugs which is rediculous in this country. People are fed up accross our great country with the lack of non pharma options for holistic healing and management. Pharma comoanies are the root to many types of drug abuse and the cause of overdosing death and crime!!

I was  medically retired for injuries received on the job. I have had 7 surgeries on my left knee and over a dozen injections to L5S1 in my lower spine. I was on 20mg of oxycodone tree times a day for over two years. I received help from a pain management MD that helped me get off the opiates with Suboxone. Suboxone helped my pain but did not give me the \"high\" normally associated with opiates. After 18 months of use the insurance I have denied covering Suboxone. I found Kratom online and have been using it daily for three years. I still take opiates when I am recovering from surgery, but my days of using them daily has ended because of Kratom. No one, according to the internet, has ever OD'd on Kratom. Kratom causes spontaneous vomiting when taken in excess. Of the 12 to 14 deaths in OD's where Kratom was present in the deceased's body, none of the deaths were attributed to Kratom directly. It would be a very poor decision to allow the DEA to make Kratom a schedule one narcotic. The benefits of Kratom far out way and negatives. I was working in an ambulance when the medical establishment chose to make patients pain level and comfort a priority with all care givers. I was working and helping all of those people that became addicted to opiates because of over prescribing. I am speaking of a time ten to fifteen years ago. And now, all these years later opiates are at the fore front of addiction in the USA. Do not take this plant away from people in pain. There are far better things to do with the monies allocated to the DEA.

I started using Kratom to help stop abusing opiates for painkillers. It gave me energy and took away withdrawal symptons without causing dependency on something else that would also cause a never ending cycle of addiction. It kept me off drugs and probably prevented me from resorting to illegal drugs. It also was helping one of my best friends ween off his heroin addiction and I would make kratom pills for him to take. One week when I was out of town, he texted me asking for some kratom pills but I was out of town, so he resorted to shooting up heroin and he passed away from overdosing that day. That is probably the biggest reason why I feel so strongly about opposing putting Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.

Kratom is an amazing substance.  It has saved me from an opiate addiction and has done wonders in enhancing my life, as I am in constant pain.  Kratom helps relieve my pain and keeps me from turning to far more destructive drugs like opiates.  I don't like that when any herbal substance that benefits mankind arises, the federal government feels that the FIRST thing it should do is ban it.  Not study it, not talk to people about its affects, not tax it, just ban it.  Making this plant a schedule 1 drug is ridiculous. So if i get could with this, I can do more time in prison than if i was caught with a bottle full of vicoden?!! That is ridiculous. I think the real reason that these drugs are pushed to be banned so quickly is because drug companies can't profit from it.  If they can't profit it, they use their lobbying efforts to press the government to ban it.  They will say its unsafe and that people can overdose on it, but i'm here to tell you that's just not true.  It's very difficult to eat enough kratom to make you sick. When you eat to much, which is difficult, you usually vomit.  I'm talking TABLESPOONS of dry powder.  Sure, if you were intoxicated on alcohol and other drugs, and THEN took some kratom, you may find yourself in the hospital, but i'd like to point out that that is true with ANY drug.  I could go out and buy alcohol right now and \"OD\" on it and wake up in the hospital.  It doesn't mean i will.

Has it killed anyone by itself? We can't say since the handful of deaths haven't had autopsies made public to my knowledge. Do people become addicted to it? I don't see how we can say that if we don't let the proper associations do reasearch on it (I won't rule out that possibility, but we cannot state \"yes or no\" until research has been conducted). Is it poisoning the youth? I have never met a youth who even knows of this plant, I also have never seen it sold to a minor in the gas stations which do provide it. It could happen in the current model, but if our government took proper action and regulated it, requiring state ID and licenses for purchase(like they should be doing) then it would be no more of a problem then alcohol and tobacco. Is it as bad as those comparisons? Until there is some unbiased research I don't see how we can say otherwise.\n\nI'm not saying what we have now is perfect but i will say it's better then your proposal. If we moved it from storefronts to online websites only, it would be a whole lot harder for a minor to get their hands on, and a fraction of people would use it. \n\nSchedule one is not an option as i see it.

I'm a 41-year-old woman from Texas. I have a genetic bone disease called osteogenesis imperfecta which led to multiple broken bones over the course of my life, as well as scoliosis that required 2 surgeries with spinal fusions and metal rods, first in my thoracic spine and later in my lumbar spine. The surgery for my lumbar fixation didn't go well and left me in severe chronic pain. That surgery was in 1997. I have been in ever-escalating pain for almost 20 years.\n\nAbout 6 years ago, the rods in my thoracic spine, which had previously been without pain, started causing me pain, which has steadily gotten worse over the years. I was told they couldn't remove the rods because of the bone disease, as it could leave me quite a bit worse than I am now, including possible paralysis. Unless it is an emergent situation, the rods stay where they are and continue to cause me horrible pain.\n\nOver the years, I've tried many things for my pain, prescription pain meds, injections, physical therapy, stretching, meditation, heat, cold, etc. I was still in pain. The prescription opiates made me a zombie, unable to have any kind of life because I was always drugged up.\n\nThen I found out about kratom on a chronic-pain forum. I tried it. It works!

For some reason people will always want to know that. However, now that I have that out of the way, I should also mention I am a husband to the most beautiful and amazing women I have ever met, a middle-class homeowner, a college graduate with a bachelors degree in banking and finance, a member of my local church community, a resourcefully effective employee at PrimeNet where I work in the accounting department, a proud American, but most of all, a loving father of four amazing children I would do anything for. Everything I am today was accomplished after I committed the crime of obtaining a controlled substance (OxyContin). I was a drug addict that went to treatment for 18 months, and served jail time and probation. I did my time and paid for my mistakes and have earned everything positive in my life through good deeds, love, and hard work. When I hurt myself in 2013, all of this was threatened when I was put back on pain killers for a quite serious back injury that occurred on the job I am currently at. This was prior to graduating and moving into the accounting department. I could have stayed on those pills and suffered just like I had when I was younger, because pain killers are so addictive and I know it first hand how horrible they can be. Kratom is nothing like the drugs the pharmaceutical companies produce. It is literally taken off of the plant, dried out, crushed and drunk within a tea or drink. You can take capsule, but there is no secret additive, as it is the natural plant that produces the results. It resolves pain, helps individuals fight the most horrible addiction and withdraws, and allows people to pay taxes while consuming a totally natural product that helps them gain their lives back. Kratom is not the be all end all of a person suffering when they are fighting an addiction, but that's why it's so effective: It forces them to face the reality of their situation, but at a much less extreme level. In addition, it is a wonderful pain killer without any of the ridiculous side effects of powerful opiates found in pharmacies and on the streets. I used Kratom to help me with my pain and get off the pain medications I was receiving for my injury. I now make sure I always have a little kratom around, just like other people prefer to have some ibuprofen or Tylenol. And lets be realistic, if you drink and entire 5 ozs of Kratom you wont even be close to sick, or anything in terms of a negative outcome. Yet, drink down a 5 oz handful of Tylenol or Ibuprofen, which would be potential 30-40 pills or more, and you're dead or close to it. This is what is so strange about the situation. Over the counter pills will kill you 1000 times before Kratom could even harm you once. I agree there are symptoms if you suddenly stop taking it, but coffee will give a consistent drinker nightmarish headaches/migraines if they suddenly stop taking it. In addition to powerful stomach aches and a total loss of energy for days to weeks. Alcohol I'm not even going to get into, because we know that it destroys lives, families, livers, hearts, relationships, and it doesn't take but a single bad night for 1 or all of those to happen. I just want you to know it means a lot for the people of this nation to be able to access this one thing, this substance that has promoted so much good compared to bad. I really believe you made the right decision to reverse your ban, and I hope you give the ban a permanent stay. It is so welcomed, just as Kratom is so welcomed in this society for all the good it has allowed to come about. All the lives it is saving, the money it is saving, and the money it is making. America can benefit greatly from this, as it is a whole new market for us, and if the ban is lifted and the product can be grown right here at home, then there would be no need to purchase it from outside the USA. This would save and make so much money for us. Thanks for your consideration.

In September my Uncle Ronald, a renowned scientist with numerous accomplishments exceeding most others sent me a email concerning Kratom and how he felt I could benefit and maybe regain some small quality of life, yet before I get a chance the government wants to take away the legal use of a herb, a natural option, a government that proclaims to want to curb opiate abuse, herion abuse, to help addicts recover when for now we offer them a replacement pharmaceutical opiate to do so over the course of years & years, why eliminate a natural option??? Well there is one good reason, the pharmaceutical companies don't benefit from Kratom, the same companies that have more lobbyists in Washington D.C. than any other corporations, the same companies donating large campaign donations. If you suffered as I do despite treating with the #4 Dr in the U.S. for late stage Lymes Disease denied the life saving medications needed, would you not wish to try to relieve the excruciating chronic pain daily with a natural option? Give me a chance to maybe life out what life I may have left with a lessened amount of pain, give me the choice to use a natural plant to do so, for pharmaceutical options although ease the pain some what again the D.E.A. makes it impossible to receive adequate dosages of pharmaceutical pain relief due to the actions of street users, combining overdose # for all causes of overdoses in to one #, be it from opiates prescribed, heroin,  along with countless other drugs from street users for the C.D.C.'s guidelines for prescribing opiates, not the # of overdoses that occur from prescribed chronic pain patients, the true #s. If you yourself, your son's or daughters, your Mother or Father suffered daily trapped in their own body of pain, with a government putting up a wall at every turn,be it medications to treat the lymes disease, Drs accepting the insurance, limiting the availability of pain relievers by placing fear in to treating Drs, or now taking away a chance to see if a natural plant could improve my diminishing quality of life, for if it was you or someone you loved would you not wish to give them a chance to fight for a quality of life, no matter how long they may have left dude to lack of proper treatment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7498","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"See attached","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23208","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"m.2119-2120"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I herniated a lumbar disc and through the doctor receive Oxycodone which is destructive to my life in every way.

I am a 28 year old biomedical engineer, with a Masters from the top program in this field, Johns Hopkins University. I have worked 2 years in the pharmaceutical industry with corporations including Johnson & Johnson, and Baxter International. The previous achievements would not be possible without Kratom. What Ill share here draws upon both my technical knowledge on the subject matter as a professional, my regulatory knowledge from product development in industry, and my personal experience from using Kratom.\n\nThe childhood of an engineer is oft filled with ridicule, anxiety, and depression. These attributes even today are not well understood, but can be exaggerated in the mind of one who is full of thought, and introspection. The effects of such a relationship with ones peers during childhood can be permanent, and scarring, for ones adulthood. This experience was my life at school; my life at home was worse.\n\nMy parents came to the United States to find a better life for us. Their upbringing was in a third world country full of war, famine, and strife. This experience provided them none of the emotional and spiritual tools to raise a child in a different world. My parents way of teaching was with fists and spittle, while I could see my friends parents teach with words and nurturing. I cultivated a lack of understanding, a truly negative sense of self-worth. Am I different? Am I less? Why do I get the palm when everyone gets the pat? This dichotomy truly devastates, whereas a homogeny makes one feel normal or as one should. This feeling is vital to a child. \n\nMy life outside of home, and my life at home, cultivated a churning cauldron of anxiety and depression I carried with me to my 18th birthday. I went to college, and quickly leveraged my independence to seek release. This release? Alcohol. I was quick to observe how easily the veil lifts, and how readily I detached from my past. It was exhilarating, and gave me what I never thought possible. That is, until it didnt. Without too many details, I will share that my grades plummeted, my personality deteriorated, and I was even less of a shell than when I started. The SSRIs I eventually turned to did nothing to stop this descent, and I clawed desperately for a way out. Whether through luck or fate, I heard about Kratom. \n\nThe introduction to Kratom was easy and full of disbelief; I reminded myself daily of how my relationship with alcohol started. The thing is, Kratom didnt ever do what alcohol did: throw me into excess. The moderation that comes from Kratom is intrinsic to its ability to mentally heal. With this discovery at the start of my Junior year, I quickly pulled 180 degrees in both academics, and two years later, professionally. I have achieved success through being able to harness my energies towards the productive. Kratom was the catalyst that focused the strengths, and perished the weaknesses, in my highly capable mind. I am today a top contributing member to society, far happier, more successful, and most of all, understanding towards my parents and childhood peers. This all would not be possible without Kratom. \n\nThere are many comments and resources out here already submitted on the merits of Kratom, its safety, efficacy, and scientific/medical potential, so I chose to share my story. I hope it has imparted a better perspective on your readership. The agencies of this great country are meant to do one thing: make the world a better place for its inhabitants. Kratom is something that binds, mends, and bonds. The world has enough division today, please help make it better, keep Kratom legal.\n\nBest,\nAnonymous.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21408","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Willa Phillips and I am a 36 year old wife and mother from Clarksburg, West Virginia.  I am a former teacher.  I now home school my five year old son.\n\n  I would like to share my experience with kratom.  Kratom is helping me to live a happy and productive life despite living with depression, anxiety, chronic migraines and chronic pain due to scoliosis.  It has also help me stop using opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines.   \n \n    In 2007, I was teaching at a local high school, when my occasional headaches, which I had suffered from for years, became so frequent and debilitating that I had to quit teaching.  I started to search for a cause for the headaches, began having panic attacks almost daily, and was eventually diagnosed with chronic migraines, scoliosis, depression, panic disorder, asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder.  For eight years I sought conventional medical treatment.  I saw many specialists and I was prescribed many medications including hydrocodone, benzodiazepines (Xanax, Klonopin), SSRIs and Fiorocet just to name a few.  Life became a blur and my quality of life plummeted.  Nothing fully eased the pain or relieved the misery I was in.  \n      Then ten months ago, I found kratom on the internet and I was able to easily quit both the narcotic pain medications and the benzodiazepines.  I have no need for either.  Kratom has truly given me my life back.  I am terrified of what would become of my family and me if I did not have kratom, \n     Kratom is safe and it helps me every day.  It changed my life.  I implore you - I beg you.

A year and a half ago I was in an extremely serious car crash, when a van driving in the opposite lanes of the highway I was on, was hit by someone trying to pass it. The driver lost control, and came crashing through the highway divider and hit me head on at high speed. I needed three operations on my left arm and right leg, and had a metal plate installed in the arm. Worst of all, I suffered damage to my lower spinal vertebrae, which ever since the accident has left me with pain and with what I can only describe as a sensation of radiation in both my lower legs, which stays with me 24 hours a day, getting progressively worse as the day goes on. It prevents me from sleeping more than two hours without being awakened by the pain, whereupon I need to get up from a horizontal position for another hour or two until it subsides enough for me to be able to fall back asleep again, exhausted, only to be awakened again two hours later to repeat the cycle over and over. My spine and pain doctor prescribed percocet to manage the condition. Percocet works. As you know, drugged sleep is not good, refreshing sleep, and the drug has some unpleasant side effects, but nevertheless it has given me back a semblance of normal life. Six months ago, through endless research into my condition, I came across articles on kratom. I bought some and began to experiment with it. I have been amazed by the results. It's not morphine, and would not relieve the extreme pain of broken bones and severe wounds, all of which I have unfortunately experienced. But it has a very real, and very pronounced analgesic effect on the neuropathic pain that I suffer in my legs as a result of the spinal damage. I have gotten to the point where I can now alternate percocet and kratom, taking each every other day, and have recently been able to go three days on kratom, followed by only one on percocet. I hope, and am trying hard, to make a full transition to kratom alone. My doctors tell me that it could take three years or more for my neuropathic pain to subside, but to be prepared for it to never fully go away. It may be something I just have to manage for the rest of my life. Nerve damage is difficult, very slow to heal, and manifests a wide spectrum of different effects in different people. Kratom has absolutely no side effects on me. The intoxication that it causes is so extremely mild as to be negligible. Sometimes I notice a very mild, subtle feeling of relaxation; other times I feel nothing. In either case its analgesic effect is very real. I only take it at night, and after an hour or so it allows me to fall asleep and stay asleep. That is an absolute blessing for me. I feel no grogginess whatsoever the next day. I have absolutely no feeling of dependence whatsoever on the drug. To be clear, I've also never felt the slightest dependence, or \"craving\", for percocet, an opioid that I'm aware people get into trouble with. My view, based entirely upon my own experience, is that if these drugs are taken the right way, in the right dosages and for the right reason - namely, as medicine, and not for intoxication - that they are benign. I've never been a recreational drug user, and only occasionally drink alcohol socially. All that said, my experience is that kratom is less intoxicating than a half glass of wine with dinner, has remarkable analgesic properties, has no unpleasant side effects, and is less habit forming than a morning cup of coffee. This plant has had a profoundly positive effect on my life, which I can assure you has been quite difficult after my accident. Therefore I ask you to please keep it legal, both for people like me, and for the scientists who will be able to study its properties and possibly be able to use it to synthesize a new type of pain killer without the addictive and often debilitating side effects of all the opiates. Speaking as a father, if I found out that my children were smoking marijuana or drinking alcohol on a daily basis, I would be quite concerned. If they were using kratom on a daily basis to treat some condition, I would be relieved and happy that there was something available to help them. Thank you for reading this rather long comment. I try to be rational and sober in my views, and I'm certainly officially old now. I try to think things out myself, and base my views on my own experience, not those of others. Kratom is real, effective, harmless, and a blessing.

I discovered Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, commonly referred to as Kratom, due to a chronic illness which creates pain, exhaustion and brain fog.  I was bed-ridden for months living on Advil and Tramadol, which left me spacey and nauseous.  I was unable to run my businesses, which adversely effected my business and my employes. Kratom made it possible for me to function in blocks of time, without danger of an overdose or addiction.  Given my success and those of my fellow tax-payers who have also turned to Kratom, I strongly believe Kratom should NOT be classified as a Class 1 drug for a multitude of reasons:\n\n-Opiate addiction kills approximately 40 people a day in the US, alone.  Kratom is one of the ways to mitigate this issue!  It uses the opiate uptake receptor, in effect blocking the addict from getting 'high.'  The current studies in this area would be discontinued. Simultaneously, the DEA is going to restrict opiate production. What are those in pain going to do?\n\n-The DEA references a number of deaths, however, not one single death was due to Kratom, rather they were due to cocktails of other medications, including Kratom. A number of them were due to Fentanyl. \n\n-In my case, I have not needed an opiate pain medication for almost a year, and have instead, been able to increase my work-load while chronically ill, due to the benefits of Kratom.  And to be clear, if I don't need the medication on  any given day, I don't suffer from withdrawals, or other deleterious symptoms if I do not use Kratom. \n\n-I am better able to be a parent and a wife. Pain can make a person unpleasant to be around, (it certainly does with me), and not suffering has certainly helped me continue to be a loving wife and parent. \n\n-And because Big Pharma has now patented the active ingredients, that is somehow better than the existing product?  Ridiculous assumption and one that makes many Americans suspicious of the FDA and DEA, and the belief in a corrupt system. \n\nI hope that my voice and the millions of others who utilize this plant as a relief from pain while alleviating our need for opiate drugs are able to keep our chosen, safe way to deal with pain. It is good, natural medicine.

Kratom helped me significantly in reducing my use of stronger opioid drugs. One of these drugs was prescribed to me: buperenorphine, or subutex, a drug immensely more potent than Kratom. I was able to use Kratom as an effective step down from this heavy medication, and most importantly, when finished using the Kratom, I was able to desist in my use with very minimal side effects. This would not have been the case with my prescribed Subutex. \n\nThe risk potential involved with Kratom is quite lower than many light opioid medications. The risk of respiratory depression is virtually nonexistent, even in non tolerant users. Given Kratom's pain relief efficacy, and the growing number of opioid deaths from prescription and illicit drug use, these points seem quite pertinent.\n\nThank you for providing a forum for public comment.

Since becoming introduced to kratom, I have never been addicted and never used it regularly outside of menstrual issues. It appears to me that kratom has been scrutinized for the benefit that it provides to addicts who may battle addictive personality disorder  this should not be confused with being addictive itself. As a consumer what's important to me is that kratom is natural and safe. Kratom is much safer than synthetic alternatives, and people who support kratom acknowledge one of the reasons the DEA is seeking to schedule it is likely due to it's conflict with a Pharma produced alternatives. Patenting nature is wrong. Making nature illegal to make way for a synthetic is wrong. The human race is certainly no better for any entity seeking to do either of these things, it will be worse. The scheduling and drug war on cannabis is an example of such travesties. Natural kratom supplements should remain accessible for the general public. It provides fantastic herbal support that is capable of boosting energy (like coffee) allowing U.S. citizens to uphold daily routines when otherwise pain may prohibit a person's ability to be productive.

I also suffer from insomnia and often wake up in the morning feeling un-refreshed.  I would often spends several days in a row in bed, unable to function due to my pain and resultant depression, and I felt there was no longer any hope.  \n\nKratom was suggested to me after asking what others do to treat their symptoms of chronic pain naturally.  I started investigating and learning more about this plant, Kratom, that is related to the coffee plant.  In just a matter of a few months, I tried Kratom and it didn't take me long to realize the benefits of this amazing plant.  My life changed that very same day I tried my very first cup of tea I made with the pure ground Kratom leaves.  I have only spent one day in bed (I was suffering from a biliary stone that day) and my depression has eased up, I feel more alive than I have in years, and have more energy to tackle everyday projects, like preparing and cooking a meal for my family.  After using Kratom a few days, I told my husband that it benefitted me in such a positive way, that I felt it would be outlawed - just because it helped me so well.  Then came the devastating news that the DEA was in fact, going to try to schedule it.  I feel that anyone that tries to \"claim\" that \"Kratom is as dangerous as heroin\", has never actually tried it.  If you have tried a cup of Kratom tea, you know very well, it is not the \"dangerous\" substance that the DEA is trying to make everyone believe it is.\n\nThe Kratom plant is related to the coffee plant and they share many of the same benefits, except that Kratom is milder and has a more natural feeling when it comes to the energy boost and uplifting my mood.  It does NOT give me a \"high\" or a \"buzz\", but rather is uplifting, helps me focus, helps ease my body aches, gives me a natural energy, improves my mood, and is very similar to drinking a cup of coffee and is no more dangerous than that cup of Joe.\n\nI am happy to report that Kratom, a natural plant leaf, has given me my life back and I am able to enjoy living again.  I now have a grandson that I am caring for and must attest that it really has changed my life.  To make this plant illegal, would be devastating to me, personally.  I would like to see Kratom remain legal and accessible for everyone to use as a natural supplement.  Please do NOT make the Kratom plant a scheduled substance or out law it.  It really is a harmless plant with some amazing health benefits.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nTamara M.

Not only are these injections not FDA approved for the spine, they are often ineffective. The doctors in my state are reluctant to offer any analgesic that's of an opiate derivative & I have spent the bulk of the last 4.5 years suffering. Sleep is often non-existent or interrupted at best. The NSAIDs have wreaked havoc on my GI tract & as of late my kidney function has been diminished. I learned of kratom while researching non-pharmacological interventions for pain. My experience with it has helped me gain some control over my pain levels & ultimately my life. I've experienced zero side effects & I feel removing it from access would be counterproductive for my life. I've never had a penchant for laying around & not enjoying activity. It feels distressing to seek pain control as it's not forthcoming & one is  treated with prejudicial disregard. For myself, I have no history of substance abuse & find such assumptions demoralizing.

The problem with addiction is that you go through withdrawal & constant cravings. I even went through depressive states & bouts of anxiety. I reference all of those feelings in the past as I found Kratom, which literally saved my life, my home, my daughter, everything! I honestly believe that the focus should go towards more serious issues, like the dramatic problem of prescription drugs and how easy it is to obtain them.

I've suffered with severe bipolar disorder. All my life. I began having issues as an early teenager. I have been prescribed Paxil, Zoloft, anatriptaline, Valium, Depakote, and a few others. Nothing helped me. I had a motorcycle accident that severed my foot from my leg. I was prescribed perscription opiates. They helped for a very short time. A few months into using the prescribed opiates I went into one of the worst bipolar episodes I had ever experienced thus far.  I can only attribute that to the opiates I was taking at the time. I went from the sever depression bipolar into the bipolar/manic type. I tried stopping the opiates. The pain I was going through and the mental agony I experienced was tremendous. So now on top of my bipolar, I was suffering from chronic pain. So I kept taking opiates. I would feel good one month and another month or so I would go into a deep dark depression. I was either way up or way down. Which to me at the time was better than being severely depressed all the time. Either way, I was unable to take care of myself or my family with any kind of consistency. This pattern went on into my 30s. At the age of 32 I was introduced through differing support groups to plants and herbs that others claimed had helped them with similar issues. I tried quite a few and did quite a bit of research. Many did help. Such as holy basil for anxiety/ depression, turmeric for anti inflammatory, Akumma seeds that help with pain, shilijat, for mood, cats claw for pain, and many others. Then I began using Kratom. It didn't work all that well at first. But I was told to keep trying, that different strains worked differently with individuals. I found a combination of green vein, and red vein leaves that began to help me considerably. Once I found the strain and proper amount to take, I noticed and family members noticed an enormous improvement in my wellbeing in general. I've been taking Kratom Four years now. I feel stable and balanced and just plain capable. Im well into a career now as a CNC department supervisor. I've been working the same place for two years. Prior to this job I haven't been stable enough to maintain employment for any longer than 6 to 9 months. My family wife and children all attest to the difference this plant has made in my life. They feel as though they can depend on me, and they can and do now. I feel as though I'm clear minded, goal oriented, motivated, happy more times than not. My level of chronic pain and fatigue has all but disappeared. Many other aspects of my life have improved as well I could go on.   That plant changed my whole families welfare not just mine. I beg you to to keep this plant available to the public. Age restriction I agree with. Schedule of any kind I strongly disagree with. Hundreds of thousands of people benefit from this plant. I've seen testimonies from mothers that can manage their families, fathers that have put down heroin or prescription pain killers and lead productive lives, Teachers that suffer from fibromyalgia return to work, elderly whom suffer from severe arthritis become active and lead healthy lifestyles because of the benefits this plant has provided for them. Research must be allowed to continue. This plant must not be taken from the people. Our country is experiencing an opiate and pharmaceutical epidemic. This plant has brought many out of the grasp of that epidemic.  The pharmaceutical companies already have the alkaloids in the kratom plant researched and patented. They want to synthesis it, make it into something they can sell to the public. Everything they touch turns bad. Let the people choose to take this plant in its natural form. The pharmaceutical industry will make something bad out of it, and raise the price on it so much that it will cause hardships. This plant helps people in its natural form. I know my family and I's lives will be turned upside down and many others will also if this plant becomes inaccessible. Addicts will return to street drugs or pain pills, people will have to quit their jobs, vendors will lose their businesses, vital research that's going on right now concerning this plant will be halted, overdoses from heroin, and prescription drugs will spike tragically at very high rates, children will lose their mothers and fathers. There are dire consequences to taking this plant away. Please do not take away a plant that has the potential to thwart the opioid epidemic. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5066","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin Davis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is something that I would try.

I have been experiencing pain for 3 years now in my back, lower abdomen and hips. The cause is currently unknown but trying to be determined. I took pain killers for a few months but they didn't seem to help and I was worried about becoming addicted. I was in pain for 2 months straight after stopping the pills. I don't like to take pills and again, worried about the possible addiction even if I used them responsibly. This friend gave me a small amount of Kratom to try. After my own research online I loved the fact that it was an herbal remedy. It was man made with other chemicals included. And of course non addictive was great to hear. For a little over 2 years I have taken a single dose about once a day. Sometimes I don't have pain as bad as others so if I can still go about my day then I don't take a dose. I also have really bad social anxiety and Kratom helps with this as well. I don't have the problem of anxiety when out in public or even around family during the holidays. Kratom has saved me and has been helping me being the mother I should be without pain and anxiety controlling my life or my families. I can be pain free while determining the cause for it.

The facts and hard statistics do not support the scheduling of kratom's two alkaloid compounds. Kratom is helping so many people cope with debilitating personal issues such as anxiety, depression and ptsd as well as pain management. I have severe arthritis. Bone deteriorating arthritis. I will be dealing with this on my own if kratom were to become a schedule 1 \"drug\". I have seen far too many people throw their lives away to opiate prescription medication. I can not bring those chemicals into my home. I will not expose my family to those drugs and in that, I will be in terrible pain every moment.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, this plant has been around far longer than this country and without incident. There are no documented cases of overdose to support a scheduled classification. Yes, uneducated people have taken too much and become sick for a couple hours. Those that have died with kratom in their system were all under the influence of something else as well. None of this warrants a drug scheduling. \n\nI understand the fear of losing business in the pharmaceutical industry but lets face it, that's solely greed speaking and that is what this is truly about. Go ahead and regulate and tax if you NEED to control it like EVERYTHING else but don't make us normal people out to be criminals just so the g.o.v can incarcerate more innocent people, further congesting our detention centers. We are 5% of the world's population and we hold over 25% of those incarcerated. Let's stop this momentum now for the better of our country. If this continues we will see a lot more citizens choosing to leave, as our country continues to prove it actually is far from being the best country in the world.\n\nScheduling kratom will only make this country a worse place to live.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary, kratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how kratom works: \nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6 \n\nAbout kratom, a leading researcher notes: \nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v \n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet, the FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom? \nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22885","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jack Bruns","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to take the time to tell you my experience in using Kratom.

Kratom helped with cravings as well as pain and overall emotional well being.

Her doctor is very happy as she was also saddled with addiction concerns \n before kratom.  Kratom is not a pain killer like opioids and cannot replace them - what Kratom does is help manage and support transition off opiods.

While people say you can get high from taking Kratom....well you can, but you have to take an insane amount that in itself will give you a 90% chance of getting a bad headache and sometimes throwing up, it's not worth it.\nThat is my story, but I might add that if Kratom is going to be taken away from us, I will most likely loose my job of 9 years and everything I have worked for in the last 9 years, my house, my land, my truck.....because if I have to go back to those pills it will be all over for me as I WILL NOT go back to those pills for relief.\nSo with that I beg you to keep Kratom a free entity, as it has helped so many people now and could also in the future.\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4617","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymouse Anonymouse","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban Kratom.

I am a 30 year old disabled veteran. I dropped out of college in my sophomore semester, even though I had a 75% scholarship and bright futures scholarship that paid for everything, to enlist and serve my country. I did 4 years honorable service in the United States Marine Corps, was meritoriously promoted to corporal and was Marine of the quarter twice for my unit and once for 3rd Marine division. Due to my service, my back, hips, knees and many other areas of my body have been very damaged. I finished college after my discharge and obtained my bachelor's degree in criminology. Unfortunately, the pain from my service made it almost impossible for me to keep jobs. I constantly was at the VA hospital to get treated for pain in the middle of the work day. Ive done acupuncture, physical therapy, opiate therapy and several others to help me be able to function normally in society. I was made aware of kratom by a fellow veteran that has similar issues. I have used kratom on and off for the last 2 years.  I have lowered my pain medications by two thirds with the assistance of kratom. I am more clear headed, and able to go to work everyday with less issues than using just pain medications.  Kratom has helped me function better, get a better job, be a better husband and many other amazing things by keeping me clear headed and controlling my pain levels. It truly is amazing. Please research this amazing plant before scheduling it without education. I personally know 4 other disabled veterans and dozens of other people that have the same benefits as myself and we collectively have yet to have a negative experience. Please keep this available and have the research done to keep this affordable and available. I believe we have an obligation as Americans to do the right thing.

I am a 29 year old business owner from Colorado, and I completely oppose any attempt to make the herbal supplement known as Kratom illegal. Putting this plant on the list of schedule 1 substances is a ridiculous abuse of the DEA's power. This attempt shows that the government can enact laws without any major scientific revelations to back it up. This plant has been legal in the United States for centuries and never seemed to have caused a problem before. Now that more people are discovering the amazing benefits of this plant, the DEA is trying to say that there are absolutely no benefits of this plant. Furthermore, the DEA seems to have justified creating an emergency law by creating a self-fulfilling logical loop in describing all use of kratom as abuse, and then claiming that the plant has a high likelihood for abuse. This is just silly and is a logical fallacy\n   I personally have used kratom for about five years, and I have not found the plant to be addictive or \"a drug\". I like to take kratom some days when I am skiing or hiking as an alternative to coffee. I do not go skiing or hiking as much as I'd like to, so my use of this plant only ends up being about 10-15 a year. Kratom is an amazing alternative to coffee or caffeine containing drinks because in my experience it acts as a more mild simulate, does not give the \"jitters\" as caffeine, and it also has mild pain relieving properties. It is also much more portable than a cup of coffee. These factors make kratom a great supplement to add to any strenuous outdoor (or indoor) physical activity. When I use kratom, I will take one 500 milligram capsules twice over the course of the day. If you do the math on that, over the past five years i have only consumed between 50 and 75 grams of dried kratom leaves in capsule form. That hardly seems like the habits of someone who is consuming \"a dangerous and addictive drug\" as the DEA wants to label it.\n    In conclusion, I consider myself a great example of how kratom is not addictive or a drug. I personally have not experienced any sign of addiction or abuse in myself or others that I know to have consumed kratom.

The most amazing thing was that the Kratom made it possible for me to quit the drugs I was doing because it put a stop to my seizures and the cravings. The physical dependence was the main reason I would rather continue as a  drug addict than try to quit. I've been employed for 3 years now and have even started a small advertising business online.

I first injured my spine in 2009. Since then, I've had to give up several things in my life like powerlifting and being able to work in the yard without a back brace. At first, I was prescribed hydrocodone, which helped with the pain and allowed me to sleep, but the side effects ruined my life. I was severely constipated with every dose, and it upset my stomach greatly. Combined with cyclobenzaprine for spasms, it made me feel like I was in a fog. Then, I discovered kratom one day. Everything changed. Instead of painkillers, I use red vein kratom. I am able to sleep without pain and I'm not constipated. As a drug development professional, I know MEDRA Adverse Events and their scoring. I have had no adverse events associated with kratom since I started using it for pain a year ago. The risk/benefit ratio I see is a substance that does not require scheduling. I have never been so sure of anything before in my life. Kratom assists me to live a painkiller free life, which is something that most spinal injury patients never receive. In my professional opinion, it does not meet the threshold necessary for emergency scheduling.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5127","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lee Knox","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Savannah Barlow, I'm 23 years young working on my last year of my Business Management BS degree. I inspire to run a business with my husband one day. I'm writing today in hopes our voices will be heard and the DEA will take a step back in regards to adding Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine to the CSA. It would be ludicrous and potentially much more harmful to the citizens of this country to add these alkaloids to the CSA . It seems the DEA was attempting to impose a knee jerk law for ulterior motives. Kratom is merely a natural tree, used as a dietary supplement and could be regulated much like the hundreds of other products, natural and unnatural. The abuse potential for kratom is extremely low, there is by no means a \"high\" to chase. The addiction potential is also low, no different than Coffee, Nicotine, Phenibut, Acetaminophen, etc. It's a shame how backwards this is and how big of a failure the War on Drugs is. Far too many drug addicts, mental illness and pain sufferers have come forward in regards to kratom benefitting them, if that is taken away and patented into pharmaceuticals instead of regulated, I guarantee addicts will suffer and others will resort back to narcotics for pain relief, anxiety relief and relief from depression. America has stood for Kratom like no other, the response was beyond amazing and it's only because the benefit is real and the potential uses for Mitragynine are endless. We're in an opioid epidemic like never before & never again, Kratom has the potential to end that. If the DEA truly has the best interest in the public, this will be heavily reconsidered. I've seen first hand the benefits of Kratom and I pray the right choice is made. Thank you so much for your time.

I've been on this drug for a long time (9 years), and am elated to have finally found a natural substance that not only works for the pain, but works BETTER than the prescribed drug Vicodin.   To be quite honest, I consider Kratom a MIRACLE.  Hundreds of thousands of other mature adults have been using Kratom for years to help with chronic pain. \n\nPlease do not place Kratom in the schedule I class of drugs.  It clearly does not belong there at all.  It should be researched, not banned.   Thank You.  \n\nRespectfully, \nConnie Stine","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8044","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Connie Stine","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been struggling with opiate addiction for 6 years due to back problems that arose.

Up until discovering Kratom, it was incredibly difficult for me to have enough energy throughout the day to complete simple tasks around the house. However, with a low dosage of Kratom I can attend school, complete homework, and tend to chores around my house. \n\nThe drug does not have an opiate effect on me, but instead gives me enough energy to overcome the extreme fatigue I constantly battle with my illnesses. Additionally, it helps to manage some of the symptoms I experience with my diseases such as muscle and joint pain. Without this supplement, I would not be able to attend school or even have the strength to get out of bed every morning.\n\nI ask that this supplement be classified as such, a supplement and allowed to remain legal in the United States. With the legalization of marijuana in many states you can clearly get a picture of a public tired of your worthless and ineffective \"war on drugs.\" Quit pandering to pharmaceutical companies who try to stop the public's use of natural substances to treat a variety of illnesses and allow us to continue use of safe and effective supplements.\n\nAlcohol kills exponentially more people in this country than kratom and marijuana combined. Your lopsided legalization of alcohol over other safer substances has not gone unnoticed by the public. Enough is enough, we see through your ties to industry and will not tolerate our government selectively deciding what should and should not remain legal.

According to the Cornell University Law school, \"...imminent hazard means the existence of a condition that presents a substantial likelihood that death, serious illness, severe personal injury, or a substantial endangerment to health, property, or the environment may occurr...\" I am very confused as to why the DEA assumes Mitragyna Speciosa to be an imminent hazard.\n\nThe DEA states that over the course of two years, ranging from 2014 to 2016, the substance know as Kratom was at fault for 15 deaths. However, the DEA fails to mention that in all 15 deaths, other substances were also found in the bodies of the deceased that are known to be fatal in overdoses on their own.  And according to a 2016 review of the deaths by Warner, M.L., Kaufman, N.C. & Grundmann, O. Int J Legal Med; \"there is no solid evidence that kratom was the sole contributor to an individual's death.\"  \n\nAnd with the DEA also stating there is enough kratom currently in the US to account for 12 million doses, and only 15 non-directly related deaths being attributed to kratom, the threat hardly seems to be an imminent hazard. There is a much higher percentage of alcohol deaths and prescription drugs per dosage than kratom, yet there is no attempt to act because of an \"imminent hazard\" on the public for those substances.\n\nAlso the DEA is ignoring the current medical use that so many kratom users are reporting. Reported uses range from lower blood pressure, relief of pain, increased metabolism, increased sexual energy, immune system booster, anxiety easer, stress reliever, sleep aider, and providing help with addiction to other substances. And while these reported benefits may or may not be true, the DEA is preemptively outlawing a plant that helps many more people than it has supposedly harmed. The DEA would be wise to at least let more clinical studies be preformed before drawing judgement on a plant it knows little about.

It is a mild plant that is much safer than so much of what we are allowed by law to put into our bodies. If the DEA thinks kratom should be illegal, then there's no question that, by that logic, alcohol and tobacco should be illegal as well. Probably caffeine and various supplements as well. It is vastly more difficult to harm yourself through kratom usage than, say, drinking. I've never experienced negative effects from my use of kratom, and it would require a ridiculous amount to cause them. Any reports of kratom-related medical issues were caused either by other substances being taken concurrently, or by incredibly irresponsible misuse (which leads to problems with alcohol and just about anything else, really). I actually doubt that it's even realistically possible to seriously harm oneself through kratom alone. Maybe the DEA should try a few grams of kratom for themselves and they might see how outrageous it would be to schedule this plant at all, let alone in Schedule I. They might understand how much more fed up the public will become if this attempt at destruction of freedom goes forward. At a time like this, we don't need to generate even more resentment toward the government over something that accomplishes nothing. The American people have made it clear that the majority is tired of the old ways of the war on drugs. We don't want or need this most draconian law yet.

The first is Facet Joint Syndrome, which is a condition that affects the L5 joint in my spine. There are days where I am just fine, and other days I can't bend over to tie my shoe. Until I found kratom I was in constant pain, even if the pain was minor, I was in pain all the time. A few advil or tylenol could take the edge off the easy days, but when my back flared up fiercely there was nothing I could do. I would even sneak out of work early just to go home and lay down. I found kratom and it took the worst days and made them manageable. \n\n I also have an injury in my groin. I underwent surgery to actually sever the ilioinguinal  nerve to prevent it from transmitting pain and the surgery failed. It helped, but ultimately when grading on a scale of 'did it alleviate my pain', it failed. Kratom again came in handy to help this injury. \n\nLastly, I suffer from extreme anxiety. Especially in the morning when I have to hop on the clogged highways of Orlando and weave, dodge, and duck the insanity that is some of the nation's most dangerous highways. I was able to find a different strain of kratom that put my mind at ease and enabled me to take a calm, defensive posture when driving and not become susceptible to the anxiety. \n\n I wish I could say all of this to someone, face to face, instead of writing a letter. Letters lose passion, tone of voice, and their call for urgency.

I have chronic back pain and vein damage from a deep vein thrombosis. I was prescribed opiate pain medication, and unfortunately like many other people in my situation I became dependent on them. I had two choices either live with constant pain or be a slave to opiate addiction. Neither of which is a way to live. I chose the pain. After several years of just getting through each day, some worse than others, I heard about kratom from a friend who used it to quit opiates. I was very hesitant at first, because I didn't want to have the same struggles I overcame. After lots of research on the plant I finally tried it. It has greatly improved my quality of life. It has helped me manage my pain with zero side effects like dependence, cloudy mind, etc. I have also seen it help others who were a slave to their addiction and gave them hope. I believe with regulation and education on the plant it could potentially save countless lives in the current opiate epidemic. People may no longer have to lose their loved ones over these horrible drugs currently plaguing our society. I also believe it gives people a choice over the dangerous narcotics that doctors have been prescribing with little to no regard of their side effects. I hope that in this great country we will still be able to choose the kind of treatment we want. I hope you continue to let our scientists study this plant that has helped countless people with their struggles.

At 19 years old I was told that I would be in a wheelchair by the time I was 30 and that my life would be managed with pharmaceutical drugs and physical therapy. Determined to change that outcome I set my life course to become as healthy as I could by eating right, exercising right, and using herbs and vitamins to control my symptoms and for the most part this worked well for me. For about 15 years I managed to hold off what doctors told me I couldn't avoid. But by the time I was 35 the disease had set in and was taking over my body. I began to suffer from debilitating muscle spasms in my neck and back and this would be the first time I ever took prescription pain pill to control the pain associated with MS, degenerative disc disease and spondylosis. Needless to say it didn't take long for the prescription opioid medication to take over my life. Within five years of taking my first pill I was addicted and just like everybody else began a course of abuse and dependence on the opioid pain medication. By the time I was 40, whatever left of my life that wasn't robbed by the disease was now under siege by the pain medicine and my life resembled no kind of living. I was merely existing to wake up, take pain medicine and go back to sleep. It would be another two years before Kratom was introduced to me and I would gain control of my life again. Kratom not only helps to manage the pain associated with MS, degenerative disc disease, and spondylosis but it also helped me break my addiction to the pain medicine that I thought I would be slaved to forever. I would later learn through my experience with kratom how bad my addiction to the opiate pain pills actually was and how the opiate pain pills contributed to the problem and the pain. Now I'm able to manage my symptoms, which range from pain, to issues with balance and, restless leg syndrome and anxiety with two simple teaspoons of Kratom each morning. In discovering Kratom's fantastic benefits it has not only given me my life back but I can afford to live as well. Where I was once unable to work and function in society I now hold a managerial position and work up to 60 hours a week at times because I'm functioning in life. My days are no longer consumed by countless doctors appointments and pharmacy errands. Kratom has returned the quality of my life to me and I shudder to think what will happen to me if Kratom is taken away or made unavailable or becomes ridiculously so expensive I can't buy it. This just can't happen. I also feel it's important to mention that while I was on the opiate pain meds my blood pressure had to be control with blood pressure meds because I could it get it under 165/99. Now my blood pressure is a steady 110/88 without meds to control it and all I take is Kratom. Before Kratom I was on 3 different pain meds, BP meds, anxiety meds, depression meds, nerve meds, and steroids! I've replaced all that with two teaspoons of Kratom each day and I am not only living but I am ALIVE! \n\nKratom is safe based on my 5 years of experience. I have never had any adverse reactions to Kratom and I can't say enough how my life has steadily improved since the day I discovered Kratom. \n\nPlease don't take it away from me!

I have facet joint arthritis, herniated discs, torn discs, scoliosis and hip issues. I have PTSD from childhood sexual abuse as well as being in an abusive marriage I finally got out of.   Years ago I was prescribed pain medication for my physical ailments.  The longer I took it, the less it would work.  I felt tired, worn out, unable to think clearly, and it was expensive.  I no longer felt like myself - but rather a shell of who I used to be.  But without it, I could barely get out of bed, let alone be a contributing member of society.  I was depressed, I didn't see an end in sight to the awful cycle of 'needing' the meds just to attempt to have any quality of life.\n\nI researched many things: medications, herbs, vitamins and the like.  I tried chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy, bee sting therapy.  None of these worked for any long period of time. I had spinal injections, hip surgery, did rounds of steriods.  Still the pain would always come back.  During my research I found kratom and decided to try it.  What did I have to lose, I figured.\n\nMy life changed drastically, for the better, after that day.  Kratom has given me my life back.  This is no exaggeration,  I honestly feel the most \"normal\" i have in YEARS.  After 5+ years of being on heavy prescription narcotics, I have been free of any narcotic pain medicine now for 4-1/2 years.  There are just no words to describe what a relief it is not to be dependent on something that could have killed me.  There is no way to explain how wonderful it is to feel like myself, not someone just going through the motions of life.  There is no way to explain how for me, kratom is hope.  Kratom helps my pain, anxiety, depression.  Kratom helps me to be a better wife, a better mother, a  better person - because i can participate in life now, I don't have to sit and cry out of sheer pain every day.\n\nI am absolutely terrified for there to be a ban on kratom.  I do not want to go back on prescription narcotics, I do not want to be in horrid pain every day.  I do not want to have to take higher and higher doses of medication that could kill me.  There is currently an awful epidemic of heroin/opioid use and overdoses gripping our country.  I cannot understand why in the midst of such a crisis, anyone would want to take away something that could help.  People are dying, and if i was forced to go back on prescription narcotics, I could be one of those people.  \n\nI fully support regulation of kratom while still keeping it legal, but an outright ban on it would be life shattering for me, and so many people like me.  Since getting off prescription drugs, I have made so, so many positive changes in my life.  I started my own company which enables me to work from home, so I can be here for my children everyday.  I am able to engage with my children, care for them, and do everyday tasks that before I just couldn't do.  I am not mentally \"out of it\" like i was on prescription drugs.  I am full of hope, laughter and love for them.\n\nPlease do not take the life I am able to have due to kratom's effect on my physical and mental pain away from me, from my kids or my husband.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEllen Kozak","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21929","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ellen Kozak","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For once it would be nice to see the government trying to actual help without massive profit towards themselves or a complete ban because they do not know how to tax the heck out of it so it's harder to come by for those who need it but have very little money due to said addiction.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19434","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not extend the war on drugs by making criminals of people who have been, safely and with few side effects, using a traditional cure that offers hope to people trying to BREAK FREE of drugs, that is, opoids. \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22584","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Susan Babbitt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My cousin died of opiod addiction.

I have been successfully using this   plant to combat the depression and anxiety I have suffered from for my entire life. The plant has truly been a godsend and has improved my quality of life tremendously. At 43 years old I am currently happier and healthier than I have ever been. I am not and have never been a drug user. I am just an everyday guy devoted to my family and career. I first heard of kratom on a depression web forum. I researched kratom intensively before deciding to see if it could help me. Based on the long history of this plant, my research, and my own experience with it, I know this plant presents no danger to anyone. I feel that kratom is getting negative press because some of the stores that carry synthetic drugs are selling compounds that are labelled kratom. These are marketed as making you high. If these compounds are making people high, I can assure you they contain more than, or something other than, kratom. Pro kratom organizations have been warning people to avoid this packaged kratom for years. Banning kratom will not cure this issue. The manufactures will just change the name to something else that is legal. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people using the unadulterated plant for legitimate health issues will suffer. I especially feel for the people who have been able to escape opioid addiction due to the pain relieving properties of kratom. A ban will likely lead them back to a life of drug addition and the associated risks. This would certainly increase the severity of America's epidemic of opiod addiction.

I'm a single mother of 2  teenage girls. I have been, using kratom for a little over 5 years now. I was introduced to this amazing natural herb that has greatly improved my quality of life. I was diagnosed with bi-polar, fibromyalgia and psoriatic arthritis and had back surgery to repair the disc between my L5 and S1 vertebrae which displaced my sciatic nerve causing immense pain. I spent many years using narcotic pain medications to control my pain however the side effects both physically and emotionally was extremely destructive in my personal experience. As my life spiraled out of control I decided that I needed to take control of my life again. I spent 5 days in a medical detox facility to btw able to stop taking all of the medications I was on. New psych meds and feeling better emotionally didn't stop that chronic pain but I refused to take narcotics anymore which is how I found kratom. It had been a life saver. I'm sober for just over 5 years now and can control my pain without the drowsiness and psychoactive effects that I experienced with narcotics. Kratom has changed my life. There are no cravings, no withdrawals, no constipation, no trouble casting my breath. Just a normal productive life. I have myself back and my family has their mother, daughter, sister etc back all thanks to Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16247","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, my name is Cody Sullivan.

So why go even further to make Kratom illegal? Alone, it has killed no one... And there are much worse things to worry about, such as heroin, and the dangerous things they have laced it with, including elephant tranquilizers....\n    So in conclusion, please reconsider your plan to make it illegal...

I have a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and my passions lay in helping disadvantaged people, particularly children. I have a strong empathetic connection to individuals struggling with mental disorders, as I suffer from Panic Disorder (PTSD related), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Depression. I am opposed to the DEA's intent to put Kratom as a Schedule 1 drug. Kratom is not a drug. Kratom is not addictive! Kratom truly saves lives.\n\nHere's my story:\n\nWhile at the University of Washington, Seattle, I spent a lot of time experimenting with different therapies in alleviating my PTSD symptoms; biofeedback, breathing exercises, visualization, meditation, exercise, talk therapy, etc. I also was prescribed several medications and more medication to relieve the side effects caused from the first medications. I had been prescribed every medication under the sun since I was 16.\n\nWhile in college, the stress of classes and assignments increased my stress to the point that my panic attacks were out of control. Unfortunately, my desperation increased and I choose to self-medicate with alcohol. My alcohol use during panic attacks slowly turned into a full blown dependence. I chose to use it because I wanted to do anything that would avoid the absolute terror I felt during my panic episodes. I often felt like I was suffering as if I was imminent danger, as if a gun was to my head....in reality, I was alone in my dorm room writing a paper. This sheer terror often came with an excruciating pain in my stomach that felt like there where hot coals melting throughout my body. \n\nUnfortunately, I drank to the point where I damaged my pancreas, leading to several bouts of Pancreatitis. I now suffer from chronic pancreatic pain; this pain is amplified when the panic attacks occur.\n\nAfter doing some research online, I ran into a message board for people who suffer from anxiety. Kratom was mentioned several times and I decided to order it online. I remember the first time I used this supplement; the best way to describe what it did is simply to say that it took the edge off. I felt more in control and my breathing exercises and biofeedback practices actually began to work whenever a panic attack came on. Most importantly, Kratom removed the horrible pains I would feel in my core...neither Ibuprofen, Tylenol, or Naproxen did the trick. NEVER did I feel intoxication. I felt like I drank a great cup of coffee that didn't make me jittery!\n\nI was using Kratom in a time where it was not sold and marketed in head shops next to synthetic drugs like Spice or Bath Salts in gaudy packaging. Unfortunately, these companies created a negative image of what Kratom actually is. Concerned members of society began investigating, and rightfully so. No one in the Kratom community would be supportive of Kratom being sold as if it was a synthetic drug or as if it a cure for anything. It is also concerning to the community that Kratom is often adulterated with other unknown synthetic components. I do believe this is rare, but it is something that needs to be dealt with.\n\nKratom supplements my treatment of my Panic Disorder and my chronic pancreatic pain (Endocratic Pancreatic Deficiency). Without Kratom, I am able to survive, but my struggle will be intense and I am not sure how I will be able to continue working and being a productive member of society.\n\nI have seen heroin addicts use Kratom to get off of heroin, or at least supplement with a less dangerous option. This itself has probably saved many lives; from what I have read, Kratom does not create the kind of respiratory depression as heroin does. KRATOM NEEDS TO BE STUDIED FOR THIS REASON ALONE! Kratom, as a schedule 1 drug, will be limited in its ability to be studied. We need everyone taking a look at the alkaloids in this plant and studying it. If I, or anyone else in the Kratom community, used Kratom illicitly we would not be begging for research! I have had 3 friends who have died from an opiate related overdose. Kratom being available in the US as it has been has probably saved many people...either from chronic pain, PTSD, heroin addiction, panic disorder, etc.\n\nKratom saves lives.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLeah Staub","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8395","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Leah Staub","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please let us keep our Kratom.

I just finished my AmeriCorps year of service in which I spent Aug '15- July '16 teaching service learning to youth ages 11-18.  I spent much of that time volunteering with those same youth at various non-profits in the major metropolitan area I live in.  \n\nI am diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and anxiety.  I am on prescribed anti-depressants that I've been taking for several years, but when I forget to take a dose (or can't motivate myself to out of the apathy that comes with my depression), the medicine doesn't stay in my system long enough to work well enough.  I spend a lot of time feeling anxious and hopeless and worried about nothing in particular.  \n\nWhen I first heard about Kratom on social media after the DEA's proposed ban, I had never heard of it.  I did further research and found out that it has been anecdotally proven to help with anxiety and depression.  Since it is still legal in the state I live in, I went to my local head shop and talked to the owner about it.  He was very knowledgeable and agreed that it had helped him with his own anxiety.  I bought a container of about 20 capsules and the next time I missed a dose of my medicine and was feeling anxious, I took about 2 grams worth.  \n\nKratom makes me feel like a normal person!  I feel much more motivated to do things that would normally have felt too daunting.  It doesn't make me dangerously delirious or high. It helps me feel like everyday tasks are do-able and I don't needlessly worry anymore.\n\nThe most amazing thing that has happened to me post-Kratom use is my slowed usage of alcohol.  I have a family history of alcoholism, and though I wouldn't have said I was an alcoholic pre-Kratom, my drinking was definitely starting to get worrisome.  I would only drink at night after work and before bed, but I would always drink to excess.  There was a stretch of about a year where I  never went longer than a week without drinking.  Now, I hardly ever \"feel\" like drinking.  I drink maybe two or three times a month, and never to the point I used to.\n\nI am a much happier and better-functioning human being on Kratom and I hope you consider stories like mine before scheduling it.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0829","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"A T","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To place kratom as a schedule 1 \"drug\" is completely irresponsible without giving the substance due process.

It would be ignorant to ban it when other safe treatment for opioid abuse rehabilitation are scarce or nonexistent.\n\nAnd remember, the most dangerous OTC drug is Tylenol--which can easily cause liver failure fatalities.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6672","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Keith Cox","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA,\n\nI want to thank you and your hardworking agency for opening up a comment period to the public. I have used Kratom off and on for close to 7 years. I have found many health benefits both mentally and physically with Kratom. I am a college student currently in my second year of school in hopes of becoming a journalist or Eng. teacher. I use Kratom for my studies sometimes which acts much like Coffee. I don't use Marijuana or any other substances but Kratom is a natural leaf ground as you know up that I trust due to the positive benefits I've experienced. I can honestly say I've never had a negative side effect from this plant. Kratom has improved my life as a college student and a hard working American citizen. I thought this plant would be considered a substance and or drug. I was very upset when I heard that smoke shops and \"head\" shops were selling it. In my opinion it should be sold at a nutrition center or supplement/grocery store not a head shop. I say this because it seems like kids go to \"head shops\" strictly for legal highs and other illegal activity. So, I understand why you folks are focusing on this plant and the legal perameters moving forward. I just hope the \"head shops\" being desperate to make a dime and selling/labeling this plant as a legal high deeply upsets me. Me and many other hard working people use this for health beneficial purposes not a \"high.\" I wish you folks the best of luck with your hard work for the United States of America and pray you can keep Kratom legally available and from being mislabeled as a drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5890","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Samuel Fosness","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I oppose the scheduling of the chemical components of Kratom.

Nicotine is worse, but legal. Alcohol is probably the most destructive, but legal. I don't understand it and I am very opposed to the idea of making kratom a schedule 1 drug.

That is simply ridiculous!  You cannot get high on kratom. I know! This tree leaf is helping so many people in many different ways all without the possibility of death. You take too much you get blurry vision and really really nauseated. Kratom should be left alone! We were doing just fine with it before you got involved. The biggest argument is that it acts like an opiate. Yes it does! We get all the benefits without risking death! But \"acting like an opiate\"  is as far as it goes. The alkaloids in kratom connect with SOME of the receptors in the brain that opiates do, BUT NOT ALL THAT THEY DO. Kratom helps with pain of all sorts and some people even get the added benefit of their nervousness and shyness being lessened. \nLet me tell you my brief experience with kratom. I have chronic back and neck pain. I get pain pills but it takes more and more to do the same work as one pill used to do in the beginning. So I run out and have to go through opiate withdrawals. That really sucks BAD!  I was working out of town in North Carolina a few years ago and ran out of my prescription pain meds. I was freaking out. I had meetings to attend and work to do. I couldn't afford to deal with the pain and withdrawals. I searched Google for help with my situation and I kept seeing the same herbal item KRATOM. I did my research on kratom for the next hour. It sounded too good to be true!  I did a search in my area for kratom retailers and found one. I went there on my lunch  and bought some capsules of it. I took a few and just waited. Not expecting anything I was COMPLETELY AMAZED!  Not only did kratom ease my pain and suffering, it even got rid of the opiate withdrawal symptoms!!  I went back to the store and bought some more to get me through my week and trip back home. After I got home I started dear ching my locality for kratom sellers. And what I found out literally brought tears to my eyes. Kratom was banned in my state of Indiana a few years earlier! I couldn't believe it!  So in between my trips out of town I had to settle for buying pills from neighbors and friends when I ran out! I really looked forward to my trips to Charlotte, NC for work because I could buy and use kratom! I was no longer a slave to that damn pain pill. The freedom was a glorious feeling although short lived. After a week out of town I had to come back to the state that would not let me choose a herbal solution for my pain!! The lawmakers of Indiana bought into the hype and misinformation about kratom when they banned bath salts and that fake marijuana incense stuff. They just clumped kratom in with those killers!! \nPlease don't ban kratom across the US. I wouldn't wish what I have to deal with and go through not having access to kratom and doing whatever I have to do to get pain pills just to avoid withdrawal. PLEASE LET ME CHOOSE THE HEALTHIER ALL NATURAL SOLUTION FOR MY CHRONIC PAIN. PLEASE MAKE IT LEGAL IN INDIANA AGAIN. PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME KEEP USING THESE PRESCRIPTION PAIN KILLERS. I'M SO AFRAID I'M GOING TO ACCIDENTALLY OD WHILE TRYING TO TREAT MY PAIN. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE HAVE MERCY ON US. Kratom is a better option than Norco & Percocets, etc. I want my life back please.

I carry a heavy tray and wear high heels 40 hours per week. I developed excruciating back pain over the years and have been living with chronic pain since 2009. I was taking massive amounts of prescribed narcotic pain meds for several years.  What my doctor didn't prescribe me I bought on the street.  Not only did I intermittently stop working several times because the pain meds made me crazy and my life fell apart, but every relationship in my life suffered or ended as a result. I lost my house because I spent my mortgage money on pills. My behavior was erratic and my temper was through the roof. I drank regularly and mixed that with my prescribed meds to dull the pain. Driving under those circumstances was normal when I had to work. \n\nI discovered Kratom in 2011 and have been taking it ever since. I completely stopped needing/ taking all narcotic pain medication in 2014 because I learned that I really don't need it if I gauge the proper amounts of Kratom to take and time it properly.  My worst time of day is in the morning, waking up with severe back pain after not having it in my system for 6-8 hours.  I keep It on my nightstand and take it immediately upon waking. After it kicks in, I fall back asleep and wake later feeling really great. \n\nThis stuff is a miracle. No joke. I contemplated suicide every day for several years while on prescribed medication. Sure, pain meds are great until they aren't. When the pain breaks through each time it's like your life is over all over again each time  until you feed yourself another pain pill and make it stop. But it wears off so quickly that you plan your entire life around the pain. I even made an emergency suicide cocktail comprised of a lethal dosage of enough morphine to kill a horse. I held on to this thinking that surely the day would come when I would finally give up and end my tortuous life of pain.  Then one day by accident I stumbled on Kratom at a friends house. He said it would give me energy but didn't mention anything about helping ease my back pain. I waited months and even forgot about it. Then I found it in a drawer and took it to go run some errands and later that night realized I hadn't needed to take any pain pills. It was amazing. That was the first time in several years I was free. It was like my pain disappeared all day and night. So I researched it and started purchasing online. \n\nNow, 6 years later I buy Kratom by the kilogram and buy many, many different strains (15).  I have several capsule filling machines (25-400 capsules). I carry a pill case in my purse and have my Kratom in my kitchen and bedside. I take Kratom regularly and my life is wonderful. I haven't missed a day of work from my back pain in years. I have remodeled my house doing a lot of the work myself. I absolutely believe Kratom saved my life. I no longer contemplate suicide because I have learned that I can thrive with Kratom. I don't have to end my life.  BUT.....Taking Kratom from me would be sending me back to that dark place. I believe my life would be over. I know I couldn't go through that again or put my family through all of it.

A married adult with a more than full time job... you know, the model citizen that America seems to want. I have spent the last 10+ years of my life with a condition which causes sometimes extreme pain, but persistent pain at the least. My doctor had me on Hydrocodone but after years of that I wanted something that wasn't going to control me, or mess me up. So I did some research and found out about Kratom. Since using Kratom my quality of life has improved 10 fold. \n\nBut now, the government is taking a position to extinguish my liberties. My liberties to take what I'd like, my liberties to not be in pain, you want to turn me into a felon tomorrow for doing what is legal today. There is currently no evidence that I know of to even suggest Kratom is a danger to the public. How many cases of death do you even have for people that solely use Kratom? I doubt any, but even if there is any, I'm sure it's less than aspirin, or people who choke to death on hot dogs annually. \n\nSo you are either taking the approach of using heavy handed authoritative rule to strip us of our rights, or you are being paid off by lobbyists for drug companies currently researching some of the active chemicals in Kratom. There is absolutely no good reason, or even the least bit ethical reason for you to schedule Kratom. \n\nI am sincerely asking you to stop this attack on Kratom. It is an attack on me, and my quality of life. Maybe one day I won't have to use Kratom for pain management, but I would hope that anyone else in the United States of America would have the option. The option to make a decision for themselves. The option to not become addicted to deadly FDA approved drugs. Please think about what you're doing and who you're doing it for. This is not crack or meth. This is a naturally occurring leaf that offers people comfort.  \n\nZachary Collins","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19261","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zachary Collins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is not bad there are people that use it the right way to help them please don't make it illegal","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16243","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Bordeaux","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Retired disabled Air Force veteran here with PTSD and shoulder injuries.\nI use low-dose kratom a couple times a week if I need to use my shoulders for work or attend a stressful event.

The NIH is currently funding studies to investigate the potential medicinal use of kratom-related compounds and therefore its constituents should not be placed into a category of \"no currently accepted medical use.\"  Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine are derived from plants of the Rubiaceae family (other members include coffee and gardenias) and have much more complex pharmacology (and lower abuse potential) than classic opiates with its effects on 2, 5-HT2A, , , and  receptors, along with providing anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of prostaglandin E2 production (Prozialek et al, 2012).  The activity at , and  receptors is particularly interesting since these may be alternate pathways to prevent the addiction potential of pure  agonists. As a psychiatric pharmacist, I routinely see patients struggling with addiction to FDA-approved prescription opioids like Vicodin and Oxycontin, so eliminating one potential harm reduction strategy with a much lower abuse potential seems like a very poor decision during our current opiate epidemic.  I am also concerned that scheduling these compounds will hinder ongoing scientific inquiry into the potential pharmacologic benefits of these compounds and other chemical analogs for the treatment of pain and opioid replacement therapy.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19726","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Economically, let's take a look at this decision. \n\nWe want people to work, right?\n we need this to keep the current financial and economical system in place.\nAre you aware of how many chronic conditions are ravaging Americans?\nForget that even.. do you know how MANY AMERICANS are currently on longterm prescription medications and how many apply for disability?

The disabling nature of my illness is profound, the pain is chronic and hits peaks of severity several times per week.  The visual distortions and audio whooshing of the neurological disorder and the pain of varying severity are not controlled with any available painkillers and make it very very difficult for me to complete activities of daily life like housework.  Work is currently out-of-the-question.   I was a licensed career medical professional before my injuries became severe.  I hope to return to work some day if effective treatment can be devised.  \n\nKratom is not a miracle cure for me, but when I have a spike of severe pain it usually takes the edge off enough that can I partially function and/or return to a tolerable condition.  I usually take a teaspoon and a half dissolved into a cup of hot cocoa, and usually I get partial relief within 45 minutes or so.  When a pain spike becomes intolerable, any relief at all is very helpful.  At this dosage, I am somewhat calmed.  At lower dosage, I feel mildly agitated without much pain benefit.  At higher dosage the kratom acts more as a sedative and sometimes makes me too sleepy to function and I just need to nap.   It is not intoxicating in the way that alcohol is intoxicating.  It is more of a sedative that allows me to relax and re-center my mind to cope with the pain signals.  I have taken it one time per day so far, usually two or three days per week, and the dosage does not seem to need adjustment.  Kratom does not seem a logical risk for a 'recreational drug' in any way because larger dosages seem to put me to sleep.  It may be prudent to control the availability or sale of concentrated preparations, but to eliminate the kratom option from chronic pain patients who have so few options is unnecessarily cruel and counterproductive. \n\n  I have been treated by neurologists, pain specialists, osteopaths, rheumatologists, physical therapists, counselors, chiropractors, and practice mindfullness, group therapy, individual therapy, and have tried all the forms of relief offered by all these professionals.  All the therapies are somewhat helpful, several can help to make the situation tolerable;  Kratom is an indispensable tool for attempting to live a normal life.\n\n I urge the research of possible new therapies as may be warranted in standard double blind medical research, but the profit potential seems limited for simple natural remedies and therefore big pharma seems uninterested.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7643","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lisa Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I use kratom to control my ulcerative colitis and have for several years. I have had ulcerative colitis for 18 years and have tried a variety of prescription drugs including immunosuppressants and steroids to treat my disease. A few years ago a friend told me about kratom and the next time my disease flared I tried it. I was astonished at how well it worked. My disease went into remission in about 3 days of moderate kratom use - approximately 10 grams per day, divided into 2 or 3 doses. \n\nI then found that I could gradually taper down from that dose to a far smaller one and use it as a daily maintenance dose. Since doing so I find my disease kept very much at bay. When I do start experiencing a flare I take a higher dose of kratom which then reduces my intestinal motility and in a few days I recover. Then I taper down the dose again to a low maintenance level. \n\nThere are no side effects of this medicinal use of kratom; it is remarkably inexpensive; and it seems far safer than the expensive and somewhat unpredictable cocktail of pharmaceutical medicines I was taking before. I think kratom has enormous medical utility for treating inflammatory bowel disease, and I understand that this was an indigenous use of this plant in Southeast Asia.\n\nIt is thus very important to me personally that kratom be kept legal and unregulated. It simply works better than anything else I have used for treating my disease. With kratom I am able to function normally; don't miss work; and am a more productive citizen. I suspect this is because of its strong anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to reduce motility without causing constipation or toxic megacolon.\n\nSincerely,\nJonathan Taylor, PhD","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7092","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathan Taylor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am the worst drug addict you can imagine.

I am writing to say that I oppose the DEA putting kratom on the schedule 1 list, or an schedule for that matter, because it would severely impact my 38 year old daughter's life for the worse. She began taking the supplement kratom in 2012 while researching online for natural ways to help with her Suboxone withdrawal as she suffered at the end of a medically supervised taper. The kratom has helped with her depression, anxiety, and opiate use. She no longer takes any opiates and has been a very productive member of society. She is the main breadwinner in her home and cares for her 5 children. I am afraid of what will happen if kratom is scheduled. I have never seen her in such a productive and successful time in her life as I have seen in the last 4 years. I know it is because of kratom.

I would like to submit a statement based on how kratom changed my life perminantly and for the better.\n When I first tried kratom I had been a 12 pack a day drinker for 20+ years. I did not intend to quit drinking when two unrelated friends suggested that I try kratom. In fact, drinking wasn't even mentioned by either friend but I was hoping it could help me with my daily hangovers. They had both stated that it had been helping them with their moods for a long time and thought that I should give it a try. Because there was very little information out there 3 years ago I had a rough start. There is no overdosing with kratom because when it is over-consumed the human system ejects what is in the stomach. Once I was able to get the dosing down properly I was finding that I was becoming less and less interested in drinking. I had my routine down for the last 15 years where I would stop in to the liquor store that was right at the corner of my second bus transfer point and I would conveniently bring my daily 12 pack home from there. On the weekends or if I wasn't buzzed enough and wanted more alcohol on weekdays I would call and have it delivered. Where I was once left wanting more after drinking my 12 pack for the night, I was now finding that I still had beer left over from the night before. This was practically unheard of in the drinking pattern I had created over half of my life. Eventually, the same few beers just sat in my fridge until I was able to give then away to guests. Before it had gotten to that point however, I started fighting to keep my drinking lifestyle going. I began buying bottles of hard alcohol because it was quicker to get down with a much more condensed impact. Hard alcohol had never been something that I had a taste for up until then but I had lost my desire to sip beer all night. I could knock back almost an entire bottle myself and wake up still drunk the next day. I had enough common sense to know that wasn't going to work so I went back to the remaining beers that were still in my fridge. When those started getting warm and flat after I'd opened them I gave up on alcohol entirely. I gave it a good go, though. I really enjoyed drinking and listening to music while chatting online with friends. I tried my best to keep my drinking habit by my side.\nIt is now almost 3 years later and I am still going strong. I can drink whenever I want but I have completely lost the desire. The best part for me is that it was completely unintentional. I was a functioning alcoholic who had kept the same job for 15 years (18 years this year) with promotions and financial loyalty rewards etc. I am a server and my job is to take care of any and all customer needs. I was hungover every single day and made a game of it to get through each shift without having anxiety attacks. I called it \"Muppet Time\". Because of this continued success I had no intention of quitting. Kratom removed that desire slowly but surely. This was a lifestyle habit but with the wonderful mental state that kratom gave me I was able to effortlessly fill my time with projects and hobbies that I was unable to perform while intoxicated. The transition was painless. The big difference between using kratom to wean and NA or AA programs is that not only can I drink when I want then leave it behind without relapsing into binge drinking, I simply just do not desire alcohol in any way whatsoever. In my extensive experiences with friends and family members who have gone through NA and AA, they think about drugs and alcohol constantly. It is a life consuming struggle to stay clean and sober. As I have stated several times in this plea, drinking was a lifestyle for me my entire adult life and I was still able to thrive so when I looked back and found that I had completely quit binge drinking-and pretty much any kind of drinking, I was still surprised that I had really lost the desire to drink for good. Many people fail sober programs because abstinence and withdrawal are too much to battle every single minute of every single day with no reprieve. Not only does kratom gently ease the addict out with minimal impact or side effects, it also alleviates depression as well. Because of kratom I am successful in so many ways that would have been impossible if I were still an addict living under the oppressive thumb of alcoholism.\n If the public's best interest is the main concern here kratom will remain available to everyone who uses it for addiction alleviation, chronic pain, and mental health issues-to name just a very few of its incredibly effective uses. Please. Do not force dangerous synthetics on the American people by banning this very effective natural alternative to pharmaceuticals. Kratom Has The Potential To Save Lives.\n\n Thank you for taking the time to read my public submission to keep kratom legal in Minnesota.\n\nLynette Foxen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4532","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lynette Foxen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I suffer from chronic back pain from scoliosis (a curvature of the spine) and kratom has helped relieve my pain without the use of more addictive and harmful forms of painkillers. It's side effects are virtually non-existent compared to opioids.

Studies have already shown kratom's analgesic and anti-anxiety benefits to be true, but more research is still needed and making kratom illegal would make that research hard if not impossible to do. I would not at all be against keeping kratom legal and regulating it like tobacco and alcohol to ensure quality control.

I heard about kratom from a friend and decided to try it in an effort to keep from sliding back into full blown drug use. I tried the kratom, and it offered some small comfort from opioid withdrawal. The kratom didnt feel anything like an opiate, except that it did keep me from feeling the pain i normally would while in withdrawal. I only used opioids a couple of times since trying to get clean all together and mostly was able to just use  kratom when i was feeling sick or would relapse. I used kratom for about 6 weeks daily until i began to just feel normal again without using anything. It can be hard to find help for an addiction, and can be just as hard finding a way to pay for a program without insurance, or to follow arbitrary rules put in place by local human services. Kratom definetly afforded me with just enough of an effect to curb the worst parts of opiate withdrawal and for that i am grateful. I have currently been clean off of all drugs and no longer need to even use the kratom.  I would recommend the use of kratom to any addict, and think that everyone deserves to have a chance at beng clean.  This plant should be studied before making a drastic decision to ban it.

Alcohol is responsible for 88,000 a year and 2.5 million years of potential life lost (CDC, www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm).  Approximately 185 accidently die each year from Tylenol yet it remains on the shelves for public consumption because the FDA stated the agency saw the benefits of keeping acetaminophen widely available as outweighing the relatively rare risk of liver damage or death (U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention Multiple Cause of Death Database).  Many, possibly hundreds, of prescriptions and over-the-counter medications that the FDA and DEA allow for use as relatively safe, have been the cause of more deaths and more overdoses in one year than decades of Kratom use.  Substances that the DEA and FDA know are dangerous such as alcohol and cigarettes continue to be a part of our mainstream repertoire of consumption, yet those remain legal and a staple in our culture. \n\nKratom has saved the lives of thousands of people. My conservative family members are thankful for kratom and what it has done for me.  Thousands of people use kratom to abstain from the very things that are legal and harmful. That being said, kratom users are not all addicts getting clean from drugs that are illegal and legal. Many people use kratom as a healthy alternative to combating the effects of diseases, chronic pain, depression, and the list goes on and on. Their eyes are open to the harmful side effects of any prescription drugs that may be prescribed and they are choosing safer alternative methods such as kratom.  I strongly and diligently urge you to reconsider your position on kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8112","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been a recovering alcoholic/addict of 16 years. Unfortunately, I have had 5 back surgeries also, which means I have had to go on and come off opiates several times in the last 20 years. 8 years ago, the Drs wanted to do ANOTHER back surgery and I refused. They said, \"Let's get you on OxyContin.\". My response was simple...I am an addict. \"Don't worry, we will watch you.\". Within 3 months, I went from 5 mg of Oxy to over 800 mg of Oxy and THE DR. prescribed this because of my \"tolerance\". Within another month or so, I was ready to take a drink and fade back into where I came from, but decided to go into in patient treatment.\n\nFor 3 days, I WAS IN HELL! Coming off opiates is literally hell on earth (body spasms, vomiting, diarrhea, psychosis, etc, etc). The \"treatment\" plan was to put me on Suboxone, which is an opiate that you can't get high on, but works on pain. On day 3, I was curled up in a ball in the commons area and a Dr walked in and said, \"Get that man on Suboxone!\". Within 5 minutes, I had a tab of Suboxone under my tongue and within minutes, I was normal!\n\nFast forward 7 YEARS LATER and still on the drug. Last month, we switched insurances and it was an ACT OF GOD to try and get the Suboxone covered. I had 30 pills left and decided to ween myself off by reducing by 25% every 4 days. Well, I did that, and for 9 DAYS after my last crumble of Suboxone and the inevitable happened, SAME EXACT WITHDRAWALS...hell on earth.\n\n4 days ago, I went to Sprouts to find something to help me with energy as I was literally exhausted. I own 3 businesses and need to be able to work. The man behind the counter, after telling him what was going on, said, \"Have you ever heard of Kratom?\". He explained that people use it for pain and for opiate withdrawal. Luckily, he had some with him and gave me a teaspoon of it. MY LIFE SEEPED BACK INTO ME!\n\nFor the last 4 days, I have been using small doses to treat pain and the withdrawals and it literally works like a charm.\n\nI am a successful business man and have a wonderful family.

Her ailments were from Fibromyalsia, and spinal issues both at her neck, and lower back.  Through the years, she has spent most of her non work hours in bed.  Her doctors have tried many different drug therapies to give her a quality of life.  The side effects where not pleasant.  Her personality changed, she became highly volatile and angry at times.  Other times she was like she was dopped up and slurred her speech when she was awake.  Much of the time she slept.  Approximately 12 years ago, she could not work any longer, and became housebound.  I did all the shopping, yard and house work, prepared simple meals, and made excuses for her not being able to socialize with our friends.  She treated me poorly and disrespectfully.  Talked over me when visitors stopped by.  Became rude to me and was very difficult to live with.  Our children moved out when they became adults, and kept away from her to avoid her highly volatile mood swings.\n\n2 years ago, she discovered Kratom, and began taking it regularly.  She has eliminated all her prescription drugs, has her personality back, interfaces well with friends and society.  Her thinking is clear, pain is virtually gone, and a quality of life has returned to her and our family.  She suffers no side affects to the herb, and is frightened at the prospect that Kratom would be outlawed by scheduling it as a hard narcotic.  I fear that if she loses access to it and must go back on prescription drug therapy, I will not be able to tolerate living with her, and our family unit will be destroyed.\n\nI respectfully submit that banning Kratom would be a serious mistake and would negatively impact our quality of life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5592","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gary Peterson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"inoppose the DEAs proposal to make the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, two constituents of the kratom plant, schedule 1 controlled substances.

Prior to using this supplement I was on a lot of many different medications, most of which were controlled and caused physical dependence.  This included opiate painkillers and despite following the directions and excersizing responsibility I was physically defendant.  As that progressed I was put on higher doses and suffered more side effects.  Eventually it was exacerbating the reasons I was taking them in the first place.  My work and relationships suffered, and most of all I suffered.  I dealt with the addiction alongside an alcohol addiction for many years afterward and my health continued to suffer.  \n\nI finally heard about Kratom in a support group in 2009.  It has helped me immensely, and it shows.  In the years that I have used Kratom I have quit drinking & no longer need prescription medications.  I am able to work and am physically fit, working a highly physical job.  It has helped end the cycle of depression & anxiety.  It has helped me cope with PTSD enough to seek counseling.  I have repaired the relationships in my life and am now a productive member of society and most importantly, though not perfect, I am not in severe pain.  Kratom has allowed ME to change my life for the better and keep it that way.  I have had minor discomfort for a day or so when discontinuuing Kratom but that was nothing compared to the week of hell that was quitting Soda and sugar.  \n\nPlease, I urge you to take a closer look at this plant.  This isn't recreational, and what it offers i have not found elsewhere without the side effects & serious addiction.  I do not know where I would be if I did not have this natural alternative, and it certainly does not belong in the same category as dangerous and/or deadly drugs with no therapeutic or medicinal value.  \n\nKratom has helped my quality of life significantly, and i am so very grateful for the last 6 years of my life as, though not perfect, they have been mostly happy.  I do not believe that is something that makes me deserving of a prison sentence, which is what scheduling Kratom would ultimately do- to not just myself but so many good people..  \nThank you for your consideration","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17748","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Drug Enforcement Agency\n\nIm a twenty-five year old man from Colorado and Im writing to let you know how Kratom has improved my life and allowed me to become a functional member of society. \n\nRecently your agency has announced their intent to schedule Kratom (Mitrygina Speciosa) as a schedule 1 controlled substance. This herbal supplement taken by tens of thousands of people with arthritis, back and knee pain, Major Depression, Restless Leg Syndrome, and a multitude of other ailments has helped improve the lives of individuals all across our nation. This supplement has helped thousands overcome their opiate addiction and its about to be placed in the same category as heroin effectively turning people with physical and mental ailments into felons. The banning of Kratom will prevent further research as to the medicinal benefits, which, to date, have shown that Kratom is, in fact, very helpful to the afore- mentioned physical and psychological conditions. \n\nI first heard of Kratom when I was looking for a natural way to help with Major Depression and Restless Leg Syndrome. I have been to the hospital multiple times in my life and I do not want to turn to even more prescriptions.  I was doing research online and came across a website that contained the testimonials of people that were taking this supplement. To this day I take two medications for my depression and work closely with counselors and doctors every week to manage my conditions. Kratom has allowed me to function on a level that is closer to what people would call normal. I have used it to help treat my condition along with prescriptions. Because of Kratom I dont feel lethargic and chronically fatigued every day. Because of Kratom I can sleep at night because my Restless Leg Syndrome is completely abolished by drinking this tea. Because of Kratom I can work and soon I will be returning to my Jiu-jitsu classes. Because of Kratom I can laugh with my father again. That is if I dont become a felon for taking it. \n\nKratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs that contain deadly side effects. Sometimes prescriptions are unavoidable, but if I can drink some tea and avoid some of the serious side effects of prescriptions I would much rather do that. I already manage the side effects of prescriptions and Kratom has helped to treat those side effects. It contains more than one medicinal use and has greatly improved my livelihood. I fear that this action from your agency will lead to an increase in deaths from prescription opiates and heroin. I fear that this will be another failed attempt at the war on drugs and people will become criminals for trying to cure their health issues without taking a pharmaceutical drug. I know that I will not be able to function the same and be a productive member of society without it. It truly has improved my medical conditions.\n\nIf you have any questions about Kratom, please visit, www.americankratom.org I also strongly encourage you to watch what this veteran has to say about the matter. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VwKcTH2nik\nThank you for your time.

My name is Lisa Halford and I have started using Kratom recently to help with chronic pain from failed back surgery, arthritis, degenerative disc disease, along with spinal conditions too numerous to list. This plant has helped me to NOT have to take so much of the opiate medication that I am prescribed by my Dr. In fact it helps so much that I could actually see myself not needing to take the RX meds at all if Kratom stays legal. The only drawback is that my RX is paid for by my insurance and if I were to switch completely to Kratom I would have to pay for it out of pocket unless insurance would cover it. I am disabled and my sole income is my disability check from social security so unless more research is done and my Dr can prescribe Kratom I will just use it to help me cut back on my opiate consumption. This is truly an amazing plant and we the people deserve for it to be studied further as it can help so many people! \nThank you for considering public opinion,\nLisa A.

Actually, because of my own personal experience with Kratom, and the overwhelming benefits I received from it, I am completely against any scheduling of Kratom, as this would undoubtedly restrict its access to people that could potentially benefit from it just as I did.\n\nI discovered Kratom about 6-7 months ago during a desperate attempt to regain control of my life, after researching its potential ability at assisting people struggling with opiate addiction. Opiate addiction, something I have been battling since the age of 19, which developed very rapidly after a 14-day stay in the hospital, in which the strong pain killer Dilaudid was administered IV every 3 hours for the entire duration (that being my very first experience with Opiates), while also taking home a 30-day supply of Percocet (Oxycodone), and was ultimately diagnosed with Crohn's disease. The speed in which the Opiates took hold and an addiction began was incredible. It began controlling every aspect of my life, and without any Opiates, I had no life, except that of suffering beyond measure, the notorious Opiate withdrawal. After about two years of that, I decided I needed to make a real effort to get clean, because my life was beginning to become completely unmanageable due my addiction. I heard about the drug Suboxone, a relatively new drug at the time, which apparently was having reasonably good success in treating Opiate addiction, so I jumped at the chance to begin Suboxone therapy when the opportunity presented itself. At first, it was amazing, with Suboxone I finally felt like I did before my addiction, but of course, there was an enormous catch.\n\nSuboxone, the brand name of the drug used to treat Opiate addiction and withdrawal is made up of 75-80% Buprenorphine, which itself is a partial Opiate receptor agonist giving it its ability to ease withdrawal symptom and cravings. Of course, this means that I would become physically dependent on it, just as I was with Oxycodone and heroin, but now instead of calling my dealer, I called my doctor. I would literally walk into his house, hand him $250 cash in exchange for my script. No counseling at all, and most of the time he didn't even ask how things have been going addiction wise. So I'm sure you can guess, my life was still completely dictated by drugs, except the only difference this time was I was receiving it legally. After being on Suboxone for 2+ years, I decided being a slave to the drug needed to end. The withdrawal from Suboxone was beyond intense, and not just that, the withdrawal period was much longer lasting than heroin or Oxycodone. This was due to the half-life of Buprenorphine, which is anywhere from 24-42 hours. I ended up in the psych-ward due to not sleeping for over 17 days during my withdrawal from Suboxone, an experience I will never forget. I did however, finally get off Suboxone, but my addiction was far from over. \n\nUnfortunately, the battle to get through the acute withdrawal is the easy part, the hard part is staying clean. Admittedly, I have been failing at this for the past 5-6 years. I would have brief periods of time in which I was clean which never lasted, I always ended up using again, which of course, negatively affected the quality of my life substantially. I first heard of Kratom a couple years ago, after researching legal remedies for Opiate addiction, but I never took it seriously (I wish I would have) which ended up being a mistake on my part. \n\nAs stated in the beginning, it was my desperation that compelled me to give it a try, as I had nothing to lose after nearly losing 10 years of my life to the relentless addiction. When I received my Kratom, I followed an easy recipe online to prepare it as a tea, and the day I drank the most disgusting flavored tea I've ever tasted, was the day I finally recaptured my life. Since then, which as I stated earlier was about 6 or 7 months ago, I have been able to stay off Opiates, which is now the longest stretch of time that I've been clean in the past 10 years. The most amazing part is; I have actually gotten to the point that I don't even use/need Kratom every day. The changes in my life, as I'm sure you can imagine, have been significant and drastic in amazing ways, and I am never looking back. \n\nSo I'm asking you to please fully appreciate, and consider, the real life implications that any Scheduling of Kratom would have on a countless number of people throughout this country.\n\nThank you for your time,\nChris\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7471","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Planicka","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is ChristopherRodelo i work in the solar feild kratom has help me deal with my back pain for a few year plz keep the natural plant kratom legal sincerely Christopher Rodela","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21209","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Rodela","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have not used kratom, but the comments I have seen indicate it is a safe alternative to many other forms of pain relief.

Before I get started, I'd like to thank the DEA for opening up the scheduling process to public comment.\n\nI oppose the DEA putting Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances, or any other illicit drug lists. I have severe chronic lower back pain, and Kratom has helped me manage it for years. My chronic pain causes me moderate anxiety, and Kratom improves my mood. Kratom significantly increases my quality of life as a chronic pain sufferer, and if it is banned, my quality of life would significantly decrease.\n\nI started using Kratom 2 years ago after my doctor told me that I had no remaining options for my chronic back pain. I ordered some online, and ingest it by mixing Kratom powder with water - a Kratom drink. This is the only way in which I consume Kratom.\n\nWithin minutes of ingesting Kratom, I experience mild pain relief as well as mild anxiety relief, and I also experience increased energy about the same strength as a cup of coffee.\n\nI use Kratom to go about my day as a productive member of society. I do not use it recreationally. Kratom has limited recreational potential - it simply lacks the intensity to be so. Like I said, it is about as strong as a cup of coffee, there isn't enough there to get 'high' off of. Contrast this with heroin. Kratom is not an opiate, it is a natural herb with 'opiate-like effects', and the body does not respond to Kratom and traditional morphine-based opiates in the same fashion. If Kratom was anything like heroin, it would have seen instant popularity and received national recognition and prohibition a decade ago. Instead, Kratom has been sold in mostly obscurity for decades, and the majority of people (51%) who use it, use it for managing pain. https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2016/9/18/kratom-users-say-ban-will-lead-to-more-drug-abuse\n\nBanning Kratom is going to make the opiate epidemic in our country explode too. This problem is out of control. 78 people die of opiate overdoses every single day (46 from prescription painkillers). 3 die an hour. Over 6 in 10 drug overdose deaths involve opiates. 50% of them are from prescription opiate drugs (far more than heroin). 2016 statistics: www.asam.org/docs/default-source/advocacy/opioid-addiction-disease-facts-figures.pdf\n\nKratom has no confirmed deaths as a standalone. However, it can be a helpful opiate alternative that can save lives. Current and former addicts rely on Kratom to prevent relapse and will be forced to seek out more dangerous drugs if Kratom is banned.\n\nTake Alabama for example. In May 2016, Alabama banned Kratom without public comment. In June 2016, heroin overdoses statewide DOUBLED over the average of previous months. April 2016: 47 deaths. May 2016: 56 deaths. June 2016: 101 deaths. \n\nFor an examination of Alabama: www.gll-getalife.com/Are%20Rising%20Overdoses%20in%20Birmingham%20a%20Result%20of%20Kratom%20Ban\n\nKratom education and use should be treated as a safe alternative to opioids, NOT prohibited.\n\nAs a chronic pain sufferer, banning Kratom will have a significantly negative impact on my ability to go about my day normally. As a concerned citizen over the opioid epidemic in America, I know that banning Kratom will increase overdoses and only make the opioid epidemic worse. Kratom should be readily available - it is safe and effective.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18939","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nick Landgrebe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think this should not be made illegal.

I have herniated discs in my neck and back from a car accident in 1992.  I also have scoliosis in which the curve pushes on the herniated discs in my back causing almost continuous pain.  In 1998 I was diagnosed with Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis.  I also have a bad knee from a sports injury as a teenager needing yet more surgery.  I have arthritis in my neck and in my large toe so bad it no longer bends.  I will always be on Plaquenil to keep my lupus under control as much as possible as sadly there is no cure for lupus.  For pain I have been on Corticosteroids (steroids like prednisone), anti-inflammatory drugs (Naprosyn or ibuprofen), pain meds (Vicodin, Vicoprofen or Percocet), muscle relaxers (Flexeril) and sleep meds (Lunesta or Ambien and/or trazodone) for many years. While the pain meds helped at first it never completely handled all the issue plus it came with side effects. I refused to take any RA biologics (like Enbrel or Humira) or cancer drugs (methotrexate) which are the only options for arthritic pain. In September of 2010 I was laid off from my job of 10.5 years.  My insurance would be ending at the end of the month and Cobra was not a viable option being on unemployment I could no longer afford to go to the pain doctor. I struggled daily and continued to use only ibuprofen for pain. I was miserable and spent the majority of my time either in bed or on the couch. Most people know people with lupus are in pain but another thing you battle is extreme exhaustion; 24/7/365 non-stop exhaustion.\n\nIn June of 2012 a friend of mine brought over some all natural pain medicine she got from a chiropractor.  This friend was in a horrific car accident and deals with lots of pain daily.  Nothing had really helped her but this did and therefore she wanted me to try it.  She had gelatin capsules filled with Mitragyna Speciosa better known as kratom.  I tried the (capsules) to humor her. I was expecting nothing but I was amazed! My back did not hurt. My neck did not hurt. My toe did not hurt. I also noticed I had more energy. With kratom I was able to do basic chores for more than 10 minutes at a time.  I ordered myself some of the capsules and that was the beginning of my kratom \n\nI started to do more and more research on kratom.  I read lots of great things about people who took it for various reasons; chronic pain, energy, MS, RLS, depression, diarrhea, insomnia, diabetes and opiate withdrawal.  I joined groups and forums to talk to others using this wonderful plant. I learned about the different strains that offer different results.  Some are more stimulating, others more relaxing.  I read anything I could find on kratom be it good or bad.  Throughout reading the information a pattern became obvious.  People who were taking kratom said wonderful things about it. Things like how much it has helped them and changed their quality of life. However, the FDA and mainstream media say something completely different.  I would like to say that they are some inaccuracies but that would be an understatement.  Fallacies would be the correct term. Here are some examples.\n\nKratom gives you heroin like high.\nFALSE. You do not get high from kratom.\n\nKratom is dangerous and you can overdose.\nFALSE. You cannot overdose on kratom. If you take too much kratom you will get nauseous. If you really take too much you will throw it up.\n\nKratom is highly addictive and you will go into withdrawal without it.\nFALSE. Ive used it on and off for over four years and I have never had any withdrawal symptoms. \n\nWhat you WILL notice when you stop taking it is how much it was helping you.  As for side effects, the only one I have ever had is some constipation. To alleviate that you need to drink lots of water and eat fruits and veggies. All things we should be doing anyway.\n\nMost days I have my pain level is low.  I have energy again.  I am able to do chores, go grocery shopping and even some light yard work.  At night I am able to relax and sleep without pain and without drugs. My blood work is the best it's ever been. My rheumatologist (at the Cleveland Clinic) is aware I use kratom & turmeric and is amazed at how well Im doing.  Someone recently asked me to describe my life with kratom.  I said with kratom I feel normal again.  I am able to participate in my life instead of watching it go by.  What an amazing feeling that is.  I was even able to go back to work which I never thought possible.  If I lose kratom my life will again consist of me either in bed or on the couch. THAT is not a life.  I can't believe the DEA wants to force me back onto opiates (and other meds) when this plant works better.

My life deteriorated after several years of being on to many meds to control my pain.  I began searching for other alternatives.  Kratom so far has had no side affects, no addictive properties, and has improved my life.  In Asia people drink it as tea and is legal because of the benefits.  Its a herbal remedy just like most.  Coffee has more side affects than Kratom. 5 hour energy has worse side affects.  There hasn't been enough studies done on this to make an informed decision.  It is not Heroin! it is not Cocaine.  Its safe and effective.  Maybe the pharmaceutical companies are worried they wont sell enough Vicodin and lose money if this becomes more popular.  If the DEA bans this herb over a million people could have their entire life ruined by their symptoms they are unable to treat with pharmaceuticals they get from the doctor.  This is a economical alternative people can afford and treat symptoms of several symptoms they suffer from.  I am against banning Kratom.

Having kratom tea has been a godsend.\n\nI have used the same amount of kratom daily for about 5 years. I do not increase the amount, nor do I have any desire to. This is not a recreational substance to me, I don't even consider it a drug, and I have never been a recreational drug user. Just like coffee, it is something that helps me get through the day. Unlike traditional prescription pain drugs (opiates), kratom is self-regulating in its dosage. I have never felt I needed more than my typical daily kratom tea (about a gram a day or less).  Some days I even forget and don't even think about it!  In the past, on harder days with prescriptions, I have had to take more pain meds to ease pain. I have not had any work related decline in productivity--in fact it has helped me be more productive and focused throughout the day, where before I either was too drowsy or too much in pain to focus on my work. \n\nMoving Kratom from a supplement to a Sched. 1 substance will force some people to start using opiates. Opiates like vicodin/percocet can be lethal.  Pain pills are addictive and dangerous. The danger is known and well documented. My grandma recently passed away partly because of morphine and the respiratory depression that it causes. I wish she had found kratom instead, I feel like she would still be alive if so. Pain pills cause respiratory failure and that truly scares me. Kratom does not have that side effect. \n\n\nPlease do not change the legal status & scheduling of this substance on the federal level. Its legality should not be changed. States should be able to decide this, and it should be a decision put to voters to decide if there is enough opposition to it in their state. I applauded the DEA's push to make \"research chemicals\" illegal so quickly, there were some truly dangerous substances on the streets.  But this is not the same thing.  Please listen to us. Kratom has been used for centuries all over the world, and no documented deaths have occurred due to Kratom alone. This alone should warrant more careful consideration. \n\n\nThank you for your time, and listening to us.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6566","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"O.

I suffer from anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. And i have a family history of pain disorders, bad back, bad knees, and several injuries that cause continuous pain. I found Kratom about 6 years ago and i was impressed by how much it helped Without affecting my ability to be alert. I started my current job remanufacturing ibc's 4 years ago. My son was born 3 an a half years ago. I sometimes used Kratom here and there when i had a cavity or one of the many injuries i get at work. As time went by the busy and often dangerous environment at work caused my anxiety to spiral out if control. My pain often became intolerable due to The hard labor and the fact that i am a very physical worker.I was often unable to do anything after an 8 hour day, If i was able to stay awake. I was missing my sons early childhood and my wife was essentially alone all the time. If i did feel ok physically my anxiety was so bad i couldn't do anything, making it impossible to manage my adhd. My life was coming apart from the inside and there was nothing i could do as the adderall, ativan, and various sleeping medicines and antidepressants i used to take left me useless and still left me struggling and being pulled in 5 different directions. I never felt ok. I could never hold down a job or maintain a relationship. And i never had so much at stake. My depression worsened. I spent My waking moments, mostly nights, in tears and or pacing the house. Every thing compounding on another and making everything else worse. I used to self medicate with drugs but i now have a child and a wife depending on me to keep my job and be involved and Contribute at home. But i often was late to work with no sleep, i couldn't keep up physically or mentally. I couldn't make decisions. My job was in danger, again only making everything worse. I began using supplements to help physically, and nootropics to help mentally. I found more often when i had Kratom the chain reaction broke down. I had energy to be productive at work, and work through the pain. The nootropic effects helped better than any other nootropic i know. My increased functionality helped me worry less lowering My anxiety levels. I added it to My supplemental regiment. All these things helped me to remain active through My day at work and at home. I can come home and help in the house and play with My son, We go on walks and im fully involved in my home life. The psychoactive effects are so mild i usually don't even notice and never powerful enough to interfere with My life. Since i have energy enough to stay awake i don't fall asleep my sleep patterns regulate and i am almost never late to work. I'm one one of their strongest employees and im a force at home. This is all I've ever wanted, To lead a  productive fulfilled life and be a positive family figure. My son can look at me and learn to be a hard working loving and caring man. My wife can lean on me. I sleep regularly, my dreams though still vivid arent always terrifying or devastating. My anxiety, though still there, is manageable all because I'm clear headed. My pain is manageable because i have the motivation and energy to work through it. Its not gone but it can't  stop me. And Kratom is the only one thing that has done this for me. There are people much more worse off then me. To schedule something that helps us  so much higher than such dangerous and addictive drugs as adderall and xanax alongside heroine because of 660 reports of Ill effects and 15 deaths over a five year period, compared to the calls about washer pods and alcohol and even antihistamines and cough syrup or the hundreds of thousands of deaths per year from Benzodiazapines or alcohol or heroine seems inherently hurtful. So many people suffer so terribly. I've seen the devastation harmful drugs cause. It looks the same as my parents pain relief. My family is still being devastated by those medications. Kratom is only part of our answer But it is an integral part. If i can live a better life, a good life and give that to my family Please don't take that away from us. From My family and from all of us and our families in the Kratom community. How can that be beneficial when even energy drinks kill many more people?  And when those 15 deaths had other things involved? The immediate public threat is losing this supplemental plant. Not to Mention the thousands of people who depend on it to stay off drugs. We have a nobel laureate on our side. All the studies show its benefit without activating the bad pathways. There is no risk of respiratory depression or down regulation. I often forget to take it or choose to skip it for the day. If i dont need it i don't need to take it. I have that freedom with Kratom. Its safety is being affirmed, as is its effectiveness. Please don't make me go back to the way it was. Don't make us go back to suffering.

She can't participate in life. Can't sit in the car for very long, so she rarely goes out and when she does, the effort to deal with the pain of moving is not worth leaving her home. This leads to isolation which contributes to the depression. It is a vicious cycle with no relief ever. I don't know how she does it and am frequently afraid that she will end it all, due to the fact that there is no hope. She hates the side effects of pain meds which provide her with minimal relief but are her only option.\nThen along comes her discovery of Kratom, which has changed her life. It helps her pain so she can sleep. She can move, she can leave her home and participate in life. Her mood is elevated and she is upbeat and hopeful for the first time in 15 years. She can play with her 4 year old, whereas before it was too painful for her to sit him in her lap! She is smiling and laughing again. Kratom has also changed my life as well. I have my daughter back! I don't worry all the time and spend countless sleepless nights trying to figure out a way to help her. I have prayed for a miracle for many years. I had no idea it would come in this form, but we will take it. I hope and pray she continues to have access to this life changing miracle. I am afraid to think of what would happen to her if she no longer was able to get it. I also hope that it does not become unaffordable. She is so young and has her whole life ahead of her, but without the Kratom has no quality of life and no hope.No human being should have to live with what feels like and unbearable sentence when there is relief available. I thank God for this discovery and hope and pray that she continues to have access to Kratom. Now that she knows and remembers what it feels like to live again, I know she will not go back to the life - or lack thereof-  before Kratom. Please keep Kratom available and affordable to the countless people like my daughter, whose lives it has saved.

It's  quite literally saved my life. I'm disabled and after years of opiod use had been physically addicted to Various potent opiod pain meds,patches. The pain meds no longer helped pain but I was so addicted I literally couldn't walk without taking them. I wanted off the pain pills since I  was an addict to do so I needed help.  I went onto methadone for 2.5 yrs 1 yr o that was reducing dose tapering off just to function while coming off these dangerous meds. The problem is, I  have true medical need and struggle with pain every single day of my life. I  always will. IF I  start the oxy or fentanyl etc the Dr's want, I know that only helps short term. Then it's like taking water , water you must have. Yet doesn't help kill pain. I find kratom unique in the tolerance doesn't build like typical opiates. A 10mg dose today does what 10mg dose did the first day I tried it. Kratom is the ONLY thing I take that has pain killing effects. I take many meds to relax muscles still etc. I also don't get the rush of euphoria you can get when first starting opiates. The biggest reason for addiction in my opinion. I also find when I  cannot afford to buy kratom I don't get sick with withdrawl like typical opiates. I take 10-15mg 3-4 x daily. I get a slight runny nose and teary eyes but mild, very mild if you've seen actual withdrawl. God speed and let him guide you to the right answer. I'd like to remind those who read this of those who died in Alabama once kratom was banned from opiods. Many addicts trying to do the right thing had no help and went back to heroin etc and died. Kratom can winge you off methadone or heroine and you can then stop kratom with little effect, just takes time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18344","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Warren","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, my name is Anonymous, and I believe kratom should remain legal.\n\nMy personal experience with kratom has not been an addiction nor has it been a problem.

At times the pain can be unbearably intense.  Imagine having someone dump a gallon of gasoline on you and then toss on a match. This is the best description of how this feels that I can come up with.  My symptoms are mostly managed with a combination of pregabalin and nortriptyline.  This works about six days out of the week but about once a week I get a pain flare up where these drugs fail.  These drugs provide satisfactory control of pain for only 10% of the people with this disease.  I suffered horribly for several months until I opted to give kratom a try.  It has been a godsend.  It totally relieves my pain without causing drowsiness, anxiety, or any sense of being high.  I can manage my business and get my work done.  Kratom is inherently safe because long before you could approach the point where you are going to feel significant respiratory depression, it causes nausea and vomiting and is self-limiting in that respect.  This may not be true of extracts and I would agree with a ban on concentrated extracts specifically because this self-limiting mechanism would not be present with extracts.  If you ban kratom it will result in many more deaths as people turn to strong opiates for relief or give up and commit suicide.  Before finding kratom I was considering both of these options.  As for it's addictive qualities, I have never felt either a craving for it nor have I experienced any withdrawal symptoms between periods when I use it (typically 7-14 days).  The deaths on record involving this substance have always involved co-administration with other more powerful drugs, usually opiates.  Often this is because an opioid addict is trying to use kratom to reduce their withdrawal symptoms and then gives up and reverts to using opiates.  Kratom is not to blame for these deaths, on the contrary, many opiate addicts have successfully gotten off their habit by using kratom to dull their withdrawal symptoms.  Banning this substance will both leave people with chronic nerve pain like myself with no legitimate and safe option and it also will take one tool away from opiate addicts trying to kick their habits.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0118","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Dinse","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps me with depression,anxiety and pain on a daily basis.

I firmly believe that Kratom should not be changed to schedule 1 drug status. \n\nI have been using Kratom for about a year and a half now. I began utilizing it when the knots and hypertension in my upper right shoulder (which have been a increasing problem since the age of 8) were preventing me from working. The hypertension is caused mainly by my diagnosed Generalized Anxiety Disorder and my very sensitive sense of stress. The day I began using Kratom was my first day working 8 hours straight without having to leave early because of being in tears from pain and not being able to move my right arm (this has caused me to lose many jobs in the past).  I was a waitress at the time. \n\nKratom has benefited me by easing my pain  and allowing me to live like the young, hardworking woman I am. Along with helping the pain in my back, my GAD has also been showing signs of improvement since, which no medication has done thus far. I decided to quit my waitress job to work at a warehouse (better pay and hours) because of this. This is something I NEVER imagined in the past. Manual, hard-labor, 8-12 hours a day 5-7 days a week.

As best as my research can uncover, there are hundreds of thousands of Kratom users in this country, and I see three primary use cases:\n\n1) To treat chronic pain,\n2) To treat anxiety, and\n3) To assist in the discontinuance of opiate use for those with an addiction or dependency.\n\nIf Kratom is no longer available, the DEA should not expect that these users will no longer treat their issues, but instead will find alternative means.  Unfortunately, these alternatives are far more dangerous.  Users in groups 1 and 3 will return to opioids, while users in group 2 will return to benzodizepines.  As the DEA is keenly aware, opioids are the #1 cause of death among drug users in this country, and benzodiazepines are regarded by many as one of the most addictive substances in the world.  Quite bluntly, if the DEA reduces the availablity of Kratom, it will increase the demand for heroin, oxycodone, and Xanax.\n\nRespectfully, I understand why the DEA may have concerns regarding the potential for abuse of Kratom.  However, despite Kratom being popular, legal, and incredibly inexpensive in this country for many years, reports of Kratom abuse are minimal.  While a world in which no one is in pain or has anxiety that they need to treat would be wonderful, we are not in that world at the moment, and we should allow people to use natural remedies that have proved to be vastly safer than virtually any of the prescription pills -- or illegal narcotics -- that treat the same.  \n\nAs *any* scheduling of Kratom will result in a de facto ban, since the plant is not patentable and therefore no drug manufacturer will invest in the research required to market Kratom as a drug, the prudent course of action is to leave this plant as-is unless and until the DEA has solid evidence that the public heath faces greater risk because of Kratom's legality than it would if Kratom were banned and its users returned to opioids and benzodiazepines.\n\nThank you,\n\nJonathan Corbett\n\n\"Jon Corbett is a civil rights advocate known for filing the first lawsuit against the deployment of TSA nude body scanners, as well as defeating the body scanners live in 'How to Get ANYTHING Through TSA Nude Body Scanners.'

As a front line healthcare worker in this setting I experience, on a nightly basis, the public and personal harm caused by our country's precarious relationship with opioid pain medications. We need help. I am writing this comment to express my grave concern with the recent DEA decision to place kratom and its opioid alkaloids on the schedule I substance list.\n\nI first became aware of kratom through the experience of a friend, who consumes the plant to help treat intractable pain caused by advanced neuropathy. I consider it both a personal and professional duty to help my loved ones understand the benefits and risks of any substance they put into their body, the same as I do for the patients I treat. Kratom is a plant with obvious benefits and risks to the public, and a thorough investigation of its pharmacological qualities is quite warranted.\n\nAfter even a cursory review of existing research and anecdotal evidence, it is clear to me that placing kratom into the schedule I category is premature, highly misguided, and a blatant abuse of DEA authority.\n\nKratom does demonstrate obvious benefits and risks. Clearly, it is effective in pain management in many people. It also demonstrates immense potential as an alternative to pharmaceutical opioids in those patients who suffer from physical dependency to these medications. Based on anecdotal data, kratom also appears to exhibit the potential for anxiolytic and antidepressant treatment as well.\n\nAs with any opioid, the risks of kratom appear to include potential for abuse, mild constipation, and impaired judgment or coordination. There is absolutely zero evidence to support the DEA assertion that kratom contributes to the severe and dangerous side effects of respiratory depression or sudden death. I find it highly irresponsible of the DEA to make such claims.\n\nThe pharmacological qualities of kratom warrant further research. Scheduling this plant would effectively halt these efforts, and stands in antithesis to the DEA's aims at harm-reduction and evidence-based policy.\n\nOur country is losing its battle against the chronic use and abuse of oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and other opioid pain medications. My heart is broken on a nightly basis observing the direct and collateral damage of this war on patients, families, and communities. Kratom is an immensely promising plant that can assist in this struggleplease do not destroy this tool before we have even began to explore its use.\n\nI implore the DEA to allow further examination of this plant in the medical and scientific communities where its management belongs. Any further abuses of the DEA's scheduling authority will only inflict further direct harm on our country. Prohibition is a failed model and a waste of public resources.\n\nThank you for considering this comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15306","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Derek Bremer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 57 years old.  I owned a business for 29 years; I just started a new business to serve the elderly and disabled.   I am a husband, father of four children, and am an ordained minister.   I can still work because Kratom is helping me live a normal life!  Despite having suffered from severe back pain due to bulging disks (and surgery) as the result of a car accident, spinal stenosis, Fibromyalgia and Sjogrens Syndrome, Kratom has helped with each of those ailments so that I can function normally. Before using Kratom, the only relief medicine could supply for me was Oxycodone, and surgery, neither of which solved my problems.  A pain management doctor suggested that we try a spinal cord stimulator to see if it will help.  We had come to the point of just guessing at what might work.\n\nI do not need to guess at what might work; I know what works, Kratom.  The most relief I have had is from Kratom. I do not wish to lose that ability over misconceptions and incorrect information.\n\nSince using kratom, I no longer need Oxycodone for pain.  Sjogren's and fibromyalgia are much more manageable. While I do still take Plaquenil and Lyrica for Sjogren's and fibromyalgia respectively, I can function with no other prescription medication except Lisinopril (for high blood pressure).\n\nKratom does not get me high and never has.  I am not looking for a high.  People I have come to know who use kratom do not want to get high either.  I have never heard anyone say he or she have gotten high from Kratom.  There are no reports that I have found where Kratom alone has led to death.  Can any prescription medication for pain make that claim?\nLets not demonize a safe alternative to narcotics that helps countless people every day.  Kratom is a legitimate product that is doing a tremendous amount of good for many people.  Please do not ban Kratom.\n\nIf Kratom is banned, I will have no option but to go back to pain management doctors, prescription medications including narcotics, and trying to guess at what is going to work for me.  I have long felt that without Kratom I would be unemployed.  I would not be able to put the work into my business that I do now unless I started taking more and more pain medication.  That was the trend that I saw when I was on pain medication.  I constantly had to increase the dosage to manage pain.  I have not experienced that with Kratom.  I am still taking the same dosage at the same intervals that I found worked for me three years ago.\n\nThis comment in reference to Docket No. DEA-442W in your comment and submit.

From a personal viewpoint, it has given my son his life back. For 10 years, he battled anxiety, depression, and eventually addiction. During that time, he was seen by multiple physicians and at two of our most respected institutions. He was placed on multiple medications, underwent ECT, and yet continued to struggle. He is now sober over 1 year after completing a comprehensive rehabilitation program. He is now employed, happy, engaged in life and has hope for the future. I believe Kratom has been an integral part of his recovery and transformation. It doesn't make him high, loopy, forgetful, or anything but normal.  This offers a solution to many individuals with refractory anxiety/depression, chronic pain, and addiction. Prescription alternatives are arguably less safe than Kratom and for many people, also less effective. Maintaining its availability offers a reasonable and affordable alternative to these individuals. It is important to note that comprehensive mental health, addiction, and recovery services may be diffiicult to access including those with insurance.  Many providers operate on a cash basis and require upfront payments. Oversight and regulation are appropriate. Making this illegal will be counterproductive if not dangerous. Compassion and common sense should allow for a middle ground and transitional framework. I am available to discuss this issue at any time.

There is NO evidence of a ban in the United States ever working. Let's take a look at alcohol prohibition... or perhaps marijuana... both are and were MAJOR failures.  Banning anything only makes it more valuable so bad people can obtain the underground market and inflict harm upon working class people. Why not just regulate the damn plant? There's zero evidence of kratom harming people on a major level. If targeting harmful things was the purpose of the DEA you'd ban opioids and painkillers way before you ban a plan that serves the same purpose without the death rate of prescribed opiotes.

I know there's been talk of making it illegal. I think this has the potential to ruin countless thousands of lives unnecessarily. I have tried kraton before, not to get high but to see if it would help with my depression. The experience was nothe like being high but my mood was lifted. I found myself smiling more at things while it was in my system. I made lemon tea out of it and drank it. The effect of being happy faded withing a couple of hours and left me feeling calm and at ease without any anxiety. Despite being a pleasant experience I havent had the urge nor taken Kratom again. If this plant is going to be put on the schedule 1 lst next to heroin I would expect it to be as addictive and damaging as heroin. This as far as we know is not true. What we do know at this point is that it helps people manage their pain and has no noticeable side effects. It also helps people break their addiction to opiods and other drugs, so how then can it be justified in being made a schedule 1. My point is there is not enough research to classify it as a schedule 1 or be made illegal. Please consider these points before people are needlessly incarcerated and families destroyed.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14966","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bryce Gibson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After numerous back operations, leading to an addiction to pain pills and heroin, I was at my end.

I have many psychological issues that have had my whole life, I've been severely depressed with horrible anxiety and have attempted suicide multiple times, I've even gone to the streets to buy illegal drugs to help with my problems, but most of these drugs where addictive and dangerous and sometimes made my situation worse. I can see why you've banned many drugs that are on the streets they ruin lives and kill people. my psychiatrist has always been honest with me but the medications I have received have never been effective or were to addictive or had to many negative side effects such as anhedonia (the loss of all pleasures) I've been prescribed  SSRI's Anti-Psychotics, benzodiazepines, psychostimulants, tricylic antidepressants, you name it I've been prescribed it. But then kratom came into my life, I learned of this plant from a sibling of mine, I had a cup of warm White Borneo kratom, and the strangest thing happened, my negative brain fog cleared in my head, I could smile and laugh, I even got enough motivation to get out and look for a job, I was eating again and my self harming stopped, I even had money in my pocket because kratom is so cheap. I've even used kratom to get off Oxycodone! I beg of you to please consider not banning this miracle plant, I don't know where I would end up if it came to a ban, I don't drink alcohol anymore because it has killed to many of the people I love.

However, banning kratom in the United States is not necessary and would end up being counterproductive for public safety.\n\nI am a third year medical student, father of one, and ex college-football player with chronic neck and shoulder pain.  Before switching to kratom, I relied on prescriptions for tramadol, hydrocodone and ibuprofen to manage my pain, and the side-effects eventually became worse than the pain.  These were constipation, mental confusion, drowsiness and driving impairment.  Further, I experienced horrible withdrawal whenever I stopped taking these drugs.  \n\nAfter switching to kratom, I never had any of these problems again.  The pain relief is more mild than the pharmaceuticals, but the drastic reduction in side-effects made it well worth the trade-off.  \n\nDuring the thousands of years of kratom use in Asia, nobody has ever died from or gotten sick from its use.  It is illegal in Thailand only because the government there did not want it to interfere with the country's opium trade.  Similar legislation here would protect the vastly-more-dangerous narcotic prescription sales, but it would also cost the public money and lives if current kratom users were forced to switch back to narcotics.  Kratom causes no illness and cannot cause fatal overdose, nor does it have much potential for abuse and addiction due to its mildness.  It is a safe and effective herb, so please do not make it illegal in the USA.\n\nI sincerely thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nBernard Lischer\nSt. Joseph, MI","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4436","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bernard Lischer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a Board Certified pain specialist with 30 years experience. \n\nBy far the majority of pain sufferers in the US who use pain medications in order to allow adequate daily function, do so responsibly. Sooner or later, most will exhaust all reasonable other treatments (surgery, therapy, exercise, OTC meds and other pain substitutes.) Without a real pain medicine to take the incessant edge off pain, most think twice about getting up from a chair to do their daily routine. Leading to obesity, deconditioning and worsening of discomfort. \n\nThe elderly (>50 yrs), which are becoming a majority of the population,  do not have the problem of \"tolerance\" to opiates (unless they have a pre-existing drug issue) and can stay on a modest dose to remain functional virtually forever. Able to live more productive, better lives and won't tend to seek more aggressive and expensive treatments.\n\nYet, DEA and other regulatory agencies has created such onerous conditions on medical practitioner's ability to prescribe pain medications, with no reimbursement for the extra work required, that their response is to make this effective treatment unavailable. \n\nKratom regulation is another example of withdrawing a potentially useful treatment for pain. In countries where it has been widely and easily available for centuries does not seem to have an issue with its prevalent use. Wide-spread public testing of Kratom's efficacy and safety has already been been done in these countries. To criminalize this and legalize marijuana is nonsense.

I have used it for a little over a year now. It greatly enhances my lifestyle. Kratom makes it easier for me to tolerate the onslaught of information I am usually exposed to when I go to large public places like the grocery store. I have a few disabilities.\nI am a former addict in recovery. In the early 2000s, i became addicted to opioid pain pills after having oral surgery. They helped me relax and communicate with people better, which with my disabilities is a huge thing. However as an addict I kept needing more and eventually stole from my job and was caught. I lost my nursing license and job and my family fell apart. Anyway, I was able to get clean. My point in telling you this is that I see huge potential in this being something addicts could use instead of heroin, morphine, or whatever opioid they are addicted to that is ruining their lives. If it were as widely available as the illegal drugs, that would be ideal. The thing with kratom is: as it is, it will make you vomit before you could take enough to overdose. I don't mess with the extracts and wouldn't recommend them. Also don't take them with any other drugs. There is something in the kratom that nullifies other opiates too.\nThank you for taking the time to read mine and everyone else's comments. We greatly appreciate that you have provided an outlet. There are a lot of us that use kratom for pain, for anxiety, depression, insomnia, and many other reasons. There are also those in other countries that have used kratom for centuries.

This would be a step backwards in progress. I have taken it on and off for probably over two years. I intend to give you a very honest assessment for why I disagree with this course of action. First off I'm a graphic designer and I sit at a desk all day which can lead to back pain quite often. I heard about kratom from a friend who said it was a good substitute for prescription pain killers. I gave it a try and had great results! The pain reduction was amazing and I didn't have to go to a doctor to get a prescription. It didn't give me nausea like hydrocodone did. It gave me a mild sense of euphoria, an elevated mood, and a reduction in pain. I have seen people become slightly dependent on it but I've personally witnessed waaaaaay worse addiction/dependency from drugs like hydrocodone and oxicontin. The thing about kratom it has similar effects of these LEGAL  prescription drugs but milder and without the liver damage and less addictive. People who quit prescription pain killers have very bad side effects. When I took kratom for a month straight and quit cold turkey the only side effect I perceived was restless leg syndrome for about 6 hours. That was it! I think it is irresponsible for the government to simply outlaw a medicinal plant that is more effective than LEGAL prescription drugs we have. Kratom in my opinion has very benign side effects when compared to hydrocodone and a much smaller dependency/addiction rate. It simply does not make sense. The government should protect its citizens and it seems this legal action would do the oppsosite. Alchol is the worlds most addictive drug and has taken more lives than any other. It also happens to be legal because the government recognizes that he majority of the population can use it responsibly.

I choose to live my life without the use of narcotic pain medications, as they can be addictive and damaging as I have seen first hand in my personal and professional life.  I choose instead to take care of my body the best I can by exercising regularly and trying my best to make healthy and beneficial choices whenever I can. I have tried many herbal, vitamin,  and natural tools in my pursuit of wellness , including kratom. To say kratom was helpful doesn't seem like enough.  To say this supplement improved my quality of life, would still be selling it short. But both are abundantly true.  Thank you for not making a decision lightly that has such high ramifications for the wellness of so many.  Your willingness to hear those who wish to speak out on this matter is a wonderful step  towards a brighter future, and I believe has strengthened the bond and the trust you share with the people.

After breaking my back in three places 12 years ago, I first entered the world of prescription narcotics.  My doctors prescribed me Vicodin and Percocet, and for a few years, I was able to somewhat mitigate my back pain by taking a pill or two 3-6 times a day.  All the while, my body kept on needing more and more medication in order for me to receive the same level of pain relief; this is a standard case of opioid tolerance.  After a few years, my tolerance soon skyrocketed out of control.  I began running out of my legal prescriptions early, ended up becoming noncompliant with my pain management contracts, and was left out in the cold by my doctors.  I turned to heroin to relieve my pain, and I lost everything.  My family, my career, my money-- all gone in an instant. \n\nI figured that there had to be a better way.  I went to an intensive rehab program, where I was put on Suboxone to mitigate my withdrawal symptoms.  After I stabilized on my dose of Suboxone and completed my rehab program, I began to get my life back together.  I ultimately got myself back on track, on the suboxone, while still in an immense amount of back pain.  A couple years went by, and I found myself unable to get off of the Suboxone.  I was as dependent on it as I was the heroin and prescription opioids.  \n\nKratom was a true lifesaver for me when I found it three years ago.  Not only did it allow me to get off of Suboxone without the horrible withdrawal symptoms, it ACTUALLY ALLEVIATED MY PAIN and allowed me to resume a somewhat normal level of activity!  It is an amazing plant, with a HUGE potential for medicinal uses.  Please don't ban this plant-- please dedicate federal funds to researching the potential medical/medicinal uses for this plant.  The terrible opioid epidemic in this country could be greatly mitigated by the proper use of this plant, and federal research is needed for this to happen.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11469","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Tetzlaff","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Research all possibilities before making it illegal.

Kratom has been safely used in the Southeast Asia and Thailand regions for thousands of years, and it has been safely used by every human i've ever witnessed interact with it. Kratom has the potential of treating anxiety disorders, GI disorders, IBS, Crohn's, PTSD, Depression, CFS, and many other plaguing disorders or the central nervous system and digestive tract. There are NO substantial dangers to Mitragynines or their associated alkaloids, short of minor constipation or nausea if consuming far too much in an irresponsible fashion. Kratom has zero overdose potential, and lacks the affinity for respiratory depression exhibited by other pharmaceutical class opiates, thus eliminating the risk of death by respiratory depression. I believe the illegalization of Kratom and it's coinciding alkaloids would put this country into a position of a far worse opiate addiction epidemic. As most recovered pill addicts refuse to ever touch pills again, this would also cause a sharp uptick in heroin or alternative illicit drug use, addiction and correlating violent crime, an expensive and troublesome issue for both state and federal officials.

I do not take Kratom regularly like my wife does, but just as needed, as opposed to going on antidepressants.  I have never had any issues with withdrawls when I stop taking it, even after a couple of weeks.\n\nI am a tax paying, law abiding citizen and I have no intention of becoming a drug user, so if the ban goes into place, my wife and I will stop using Kratom.  But it is absurd to consider this supplement in any way dangerous.  The worst effect we have experienced with it is some mild constipation.  Banning Kratom will affect our lives significantly, Please do not remove this \"gift from the Gods\", from the free market.  I am deeply concerned that the ban will force my wife to turn to legal pharmaceuticals, which will reduce her ability to function dramatically and may lead to addiction.  Do not fix, what is not broken.\n\nKratom does NOT cause addiction.  I have started and stopped using this supplement  after a week or two of use and have suffered absolutely NO side effects from stopping using Kratom.\n\nPlease, understand that I am a law abiding citizen, and not a drug user. I do not even use alcohol! I simply wish to have open and free access to this supplement, a supplement that has changed my families lives for the better.  \n\nI suspect that Kratom may just work too well, and perhaps that is the issue.  I am all for Pharmaceutical companies to research and provide a better form of this, as it does not cause addiction, and its effectiveness is remarkable.   A concentrated pill form of this would be far more convenient.  Yet it seems to be almost perfect just in its natural form, but if it can be improved, I am all for it.  \n\nIn my opinion, you simply cannot overdose on Kratom.  You just get sick and throw it up if you take too much (which I did once by accident).  we take about half of the recommended dosage, (1 level teaspoon) and it is perfect.  You cannot abuse Kratom. It does not cause a \"high\". It produces a calm.  It has never caused either of us any impairment whatsoever.  Its like taking melatonin. Please dont plan on banning that naturally occurring supplement either.    \n\n   James T Johnston","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6449","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jame Johnston","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I just want to say that if kratom is banned, many people will go right back to heroin use.

I hate SSRIs and how they make me and my brain feel. Kratom has no side effects for me, I take very little and it had allowed me to get off of SSRIs.

I now have to use SSRIs again, which I absolutely hate, because this natural, inexpensive wonder plant may no longer be available to me. It is obvious that one of two things is happening. Either the DEA sees the writing on the wall regarding marijuana and are trying to maintain their own relevancy by banning another common substance, or else the DEA is working with the pharmaceutical industry to monetize this wonder plant and turn it into another $100/ pill rip off like Epi Pens, diabetes medicine etc. Everyone knows how dishonest this ban is.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2129","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyle Littlefield","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I  have had cancer and was in 2 major car accidents resulting in a broken back and neck i have been threw the mill with pain and pain management issues i am currently going threw a fight with my insurance to pay for facet injections that are not covered by my insurance at this point i have no options left ,I was on major pain meds for years, I read some things on line pertaining to Kratom and thought it was all BS but I tried it anyway, now I am off all pain meds and Im able to work full time at my business doing drywall and painting , I thought i would have to give up my business after 35 years  but this plant has given me a new life, If it is taken off line or not legalized I will no longer be a functional working businessman and will have to be unemployed and go back on opiate pain meds also ,please don't do this to me i have been threw enough in my life and i have found a new freedom and a great outlook on life due to Kratom , it has changed my life only for the good  \nBill Quay","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1987","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Quay","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W,\n\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nI strongly and respectfully oppose classifying kratom as a schedule 1 controlled substance.

It is no more addicting than caffeine or nicotine, both of which are legal even though they cause many health problems. I have taken Kratom daily for almost 3 yrs to relieve GAD(general anxiety disorder), depression, PTSD and chronic pain from arthritis & Lymes Disease. I have had No ill effects from taking Kratom, none. I was able to stop taking opiates & xanax once I started taking Kratom. I had unpleasant side effects while taking the prescription medications but have No Side Effects while taking Kratom.  I am alert throughout the day & able to function while taking Kratom. If Kratom is scheduled I fear I will not be able to function at all due to chronic anxiety, PTSD & pain.  I am currently disabled due to my conditions, and will not take prescription medications ever again as they caused many problems for me. Not too mention they are horribly addicting, withdrawal from them was no picnic but withdrawal symptoms were greatly reduced taking Kratom. Considering the current opioid epidemic it seems senseless to outlaw a natural herb that is helping SO many people to avoid opiates! Kratom has made a huge, positive difference in my life.

The day I decided to kick my opiates addiction I was scared to death of the of the unbelievable painful withdrawal that I knew was not far behind stopping pills.  I decided to search the internet for something to help aid me through this hell If they're even was something and I found Kratom and once I did I scoured the internet for as much information on this PLANT ! Next I scoured the internet to find a reputable source to purchase it in its raw leaf powered form. By the time It arrived 2 days later I was waist deep into my withdrawal symptoms. I took a teaspoon an within 30 minutes I began to feel human not high in any way. I was and I am still amazed by it. I continued to use Kratom daily for about 3 months as aid not to relapse to pills and then decided I no longer needed it by this point I was taking 3 teaspoons a day. Being an opiate addict I figured I may need to not just stop but taper off the Kratom so every 4 days I would take one less teaspoon till I was down from 3 to 1 teaspoon which I took  for another 4 days and then I jumped off. To my surprise I had zero withdrawal.\n\n I do find it interesting Kratom was banned in Thailand because it was cutting into their opium trade and now it's under fire in America when were up to our necks in perscription drug abuse. Who has the most to loose here big pharmaceutical or the people who use this plantmedicine in place of synthetic drugs ? It's my understanding that Kratom has the ability to dance around the opiate receptors in the brain where as OxyContin and other synthetic drugs screw themselves  into the brains opiate receptors. \n\n  I now will still take Kratom  occasionally when in pain rather than using a synthetic drug. Living in California which has had medical marijuana for 20 years and just legalized marijuana for recreation use I feel good that we as a society are finally turning the corner on the ridiculous stigma attached to that plant medicine. I beg and plead that you don't place the same ridiculous stigma onto another miracle plant medicine and lock up Kratom as a schedule 1 drug. Categorizing it along side Heroine and lsd is criminal. The fact that marijuana is still a schedule 1 is sickening with at the befits coming to light with cbd. I truly believe these plants were put here for a reason. Your decision to place Kratom into a schedule one status would be criminal.

As a highly successful real estate investor, which hokds  both undegraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Colorado I'm  happy to report that me and many of my friends and coleagues responsibly use Kratom on a weekly basis. Not a single one of use has ever experienced any of the negative effects that are sometimes attributed to Kratom.  I honestly believe this attempt is a completely misguided attemp to ban Kratom is based on misinformation and fear of misunderstanding, probably due to the lack of understanding about the effects and perceived dangers of this safe natural plant. \n\nFirst I would like to address the question of whether kratom is safe or if it is the highly dangerous plant that deserves schedule 1 designation in the same category of methanohetamine, cocaine, and other obviously danger drugs. In order to make this determination and hold a conversation on this issue let's consider the facts about Kratom safety. \n\n1) The US government has noted a group of 15 or so Kratom related deaths in our country in the last 5 or 10 years. Well, with closer examination not a single one of those incidents was attributed to Kratom and Only Kratom. These people virtually all had a coctail of legal and illegal substances in thier system which more likely to be the cause of over dose. Just because Kratom was in existence in those cases does not in any way determine it was the Kratom that caused thier overdose. In fact, people from Southeast Asia have safely been using Kratom for thousands of years without a single report of Kratom death or overdose. \n\n2) The health benefits of Kratom are vast. Kratom is a light mood amenhancercthat create a feeling of energy, well being, reduction of anxity and decrease in depression and chronic pain. These affects are mind and last no longer than 4 or 5 hours. It encourages productivity and energy as well.  Compared to other mind altering chemicals the intoxication effects are millions of times less intense than alcohol and marijuana.\n\n3) in conclusion Kratom is a very safe \"coffe like\" substance that is extremely safe and should be made available to responsible adults, \n\nOn behalf of the medical patients in the country who are no longer willing to endure the crippling side effects of prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines and prescription pain killers, please bo not take this safe alternative from our access. Try it yourself if you don't believe me. \n\nSincerely,\n\nObservatory Properties LLC\n2810 Clermont Street\nDenver, CO, 80201\nJake Silcott, B.S., M.B.A\n720-431-0164\nJakesilcott@hotmail.com","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10589","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jake Silcott","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"KRATOM HAS HELPED SO MANY PEOPLE I KNOW AND MYSELF!

Kratom has also helped my brother in the same way it has helped me . I think that there is nothing wrong with kratom.

My son tried multiple prescription medications that only made him feel worse.  The ONE substance that has helped him has been Kratom.  Some of you must know the vicarious pain associated with watching a loved one suffer from depression.  Imagine, then, the threat of restricting access to this one helpful remedy.  Kratom does not induce a high, retard cognition, intoxicate or seem to have any addictive response in him.  All it does do, in fact, is give some relief, where no other relief is possible.  \n\n    I feel strongly that such a ban, if imposed, will have the effect of negative contagion for the DEA, and ultimately will not prevent people from using Kratom, but will only tax your limited enforcement resources and criminalize innocent civilians who are only seeking relief from situations our society has otherwise failed to solve.  What public policy is served here?\n\n    There is a stark difference between the kinds of drugs that might offer temporary \"relief\" to the user while simultaneously creating worse problems, such as heroin, and the uniquely effective and non-debilitating relief found in Kratom.  This distinction should be honored. Many lives are at stake.  This, it seems, is a unique situation wherein scheduling will create the very harm it is intended to prevent, by forcing suffering Americans to turn to much worse substances if they cannot have access to a rather miraculously harmless and helpful one: Kratom.\n\nThank you for your time, and willingness to receive public comments on this matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0937","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a very helpful plant and would be devastating to make it illegal.  First, it is not some horrible drug that destroy's lives like placing it on the Schedule 1 narcotic list would indicate.  It is a safe plant closest related to the coffee plant which I enjoy also.  Both my wife and I have been able to use Kratom with great results.  She was diagnosed with Lymphoma a few years back and went through several treatments that only managed to make her very ill and to start losing her hair.  When we discovered Kratom and decided to try it as a nature cure and yes we all know the last thing pharmaceutical company's and for some reason the DEA want to hear they do exist the results were outstanding.  Her Lymphoma went benign and have not come back.  I have been able to use Kratom to curb cravings for alcohol which I used to enjoy but no longer fits into everyday life as a father and responsible professional.  A great effect of Kratom is the energy boost ti gives you.  To make this illegal would only hurt the good people who use it and the small businesses that sell it which should be in the best interest of our government not to prevent us from our choices and leave us only with liver damaging drugs from our hurting health care system.  I ask you to do whats right for us a citizens of this country and keep Kratom legal and not turn us into criminals over your ridiculous agenda.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15841","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Blair Ellenberger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"kratom should be legal.

I'm almost 68 years old.  I learned about kratom about four years ago after a lifetime of seeking energy and clarity of mind and a positive mood that didnt involve sugar or large doses of caffeine. Katom supports my energy and a healthy positive mood. It contains no caffeine and also has helped defeat the sugar and alcohol cravings, which were a poor source of energy and alertness, anyway.\n\n\nKratom may also be helping with my 40 year history of chronic back pain by keeping my muscles relaxed and supple. I give most of the credit for that to the high-quality nutritional supplements that I began taking about the same time I learned about kratom.\n\n\nI am semi-retired now and in very good health. After a long career of doing a variety of work to pay my bills while pursuing my deeper personal interests of health and athletics, I have settled down to write &\n\n\nWhy is the DEA trying to ban an herb that is mostly being consumed to help people permanently withdraw from narcotic addiction and habituation? All at a great cost savings to ourselves and our insurance programs!\n\n\nWouldnt it be a better investment of DEA funding to prevent heroin, fentanyl, and other synthetic drugs from entering the country on the basis of # of lives saved?\n\n\nWhy does the FDA and DEA both say that kratom causes respiratory depression? Several researchers have found no evidence of that in new experimentation or in reviews of the medical literature.\n\n\nSee this recent study: https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/americankratomassociation/pages/21/attachments/original/1467415534/Journal_Of_The_American_Chemical_Society_6-6-16_Report.pdf?1467415534\n\n\nPlease also see this review, which mentions the lack of respiratory depression produced by kratom: \nThe pharmacology and toxicology of kratom: from traditional\nherb to drug of abuse, 2015, Marcus L. Warner, Nellie C. Kaufman, Oliver Grundman\n\n\nSee also this patent by Drs. McCurdy and Boyer, who have done the most research into kratom of any American researchers, where they say in [0098], section (i) Kratom use has never been associated with respiratory depression. https://www.google.com/patents/US20100209542 \n\n\nWhat proof do you have that kratom causes hallucinations? No-one in the kratom community of tens of thousands of responsible consumers of kratom have ever mentioned having hallucinations.\n\n\nWhy do the DEA and the FDA always assume that the public is full of idiots who abuse herbs? Has it ever occurred to you that the majority might be taking kratom in moderate, even tiny doses because they have learned thats what works best and avoids the side effects that only appear at very large doses? \n\n\nI am not aware of anyone in the U.S. kratom community who has experienced hyperpigmentation of the face. Can you show me some proof of this in the U.S., where there is no other likely cause? I have met kratom consumers who have been taking the herb for ten years and they look and act happy and normal.\n\n\nHow did the DEA get the idea that kratom was a threat? Your agency seems to have a very negative perspective of the many middle-class people, with a surprising number of nurses and even a few doctors, who consume kratom to support their health and well-being.\n\n\nIf youre comparing studies done from the Ramathibodi Poison Control Center in Thailand and are expecting to find that level of multidrug abuse throughout the U.S. kratommunity, you will be disappointed. That was a very sloppy study, with no blood testing done on intake to determine what these wigged out patients had been taking besides kratom. No consideration of their diet or whether they had been eating or hydrating at all (which could cause hallucinations and delusions, by themselves). Very sloppy reporting of the facts.\n\n\nIn conclusion, it would be unfair and unwise to ban or otherwise schedule an herb that is being used successfully by millions of Americans to support & promote their health and wellbeing in order to protect the small minority who will always seek out and abuse virtually any available substance. In fact, the very language the DEA uses to describe kratom, portraying it as a drug of abuse causing hallucinations, delusions, and classic symptoms of opioids, only serves to invite abuse by this minority of chronic drug abusers.\n\n\nKratom is helping many people, including myself, to enjoy a better quality of life -- without impairment -- and producing few significant problems, even among those who intentionally misuse it out of ignorance or a desire to pursue the legal high that the DEA and the media have led them to believe it offers. Why not leave kratom alone and pursue the truly dangerous substances your agency was created to defend us against?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12443","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paul H Kemp","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If the DEA wants to kill more people it should put Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I. \n\nThat is the official mission of the DEA, correct? \n\nKill more people by banning things people want to do? \n\nFunnel hundreds of billions of dollars annually into the hands of criminals? \n\nRun up the taxpayer bill for harebrained schemes that have never in the history of the DEA reduced drug use? \n\nMake sure the Taliban continues to get 40% of its operating funds from the opium trade?

I'm 37 and work in the accounting office at Walmart. I have worked there for 15 years. I'm married, have a daughter, and two sweet kitties. \n\nMy journey with Kratom started in July. I did a ton of reading up on it, because I am very careful about stuff I put in my body. It took me two weeks to decide to give it a try. My friend suggested it,  because she has taken it for a long time. I have degenerative disk disease and was diagnosed in 2010. It has caused me to have two torn discs in my spine. The gel that cushions my vertebrae leak out and messes worth my nerves. The pain goes all the way to my feet. My legs burn and feel like they are asleep. I feel like I have a Charlie horse in my butt cheek, if I move too fast. I work 40 a week and by the time I get done fighting the pain all day, I am worthless. I lay on the couch all night. That's all I do on my days off too. I used to be so active before this. I ran 50 miles a week, fished every weekend,  and loved to hike. Now,  I weigh 230 pounds, because I can't be active at all. It kills me mentally. Thank God I have a wonderful husband. I'm on all sorts of prescriptions, but all it does is takes the edge off the pain. \n\nThen I tried kratom. I honestly didn't believe it would do anything. I couldn't get that lucky that something natural would work. Well, I did. It takes the majority of my pain away workout making me out of it. I was so happy that I was getting my life back. All it took was a couple of teaspoons a day. Then,  less than a month later news of the DEA ban came. I couldn't believe this was happening. I finally got my life back and it was being taking away from me again. I got a slight taste of what life could be like. I was so upset. I still am. Please don't take this way from people who really need it. Chronic pain is such a horrible thing. To find something that helps and doesn't affect your brain is amazing. I should have a choice in taking something natural without the fear of it being taken away. Please, please reconsider. Look at all the good stuff that it's given to those of us that had no hopes. I don't want to go back on all those pills again.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4959","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jessica Neal","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For kratom to be made illegal is as preposterous as making coffee illegal.

Banning kratom would be the real threat to public health.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9040","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"DEA,\n\n  My Name is Matthew J and I would like to start with a little history about myself. May 24th 2004, 3 days before high school graduation, my life changed in a big way. I was in a car accident involving fire. Being burned over 68% of my body, put in a medical induced coma for one month, and spent about 5 months in the hospital has been hard. I have had countless surgeries that have caused me to have severe nerve pain. A few years later I was hit by a drunk driver acquiring a prosthetic hip and a few pins in my ankle. The ankle over time started dying because of the placement of the pins, restricting blood flow causing arthritis. Multiple doctor visits later they suggested pain management. I have now been going to pain management over 2 years now and my tolerance has sky rocketed. I believe the first hospital stay caused me to have such a high tolerance. Initially I was given two hands full of Intravenous pain killers twice a day including, Midazolam, Morphine, Fentanyl, and Dilaudid for the excruciating dressing changes they had perform on me. Eventually they had to wean me off of all of that using methadone. Now back to present time. Having the ankle pain plus nerve pain I was prescribed a two-day fentanyl patch and 6, 15 mg Oxycodones a day. I became highly addicted to prescription pain medication and what they were prescribing me was not helping. I have known people who have started out with pain meds and led them to using heroin. I feel like I am possibly in route for the same mistakes. For the last year I have been running out of pain medication early causing me to go through horrible withdrawals. I am only 30 years old and dont want to be a slave to this pain management system anymore but at the same time I truly need something to help with the pain. \nA friend of mine introduced me to Mitragyna speciose about 8 months ago, I have been using it ever since. I used it to curb the opioid withdrawal at first and now am using it in place of the opioid medication. This new form of medication I only need to take 3 times a day opposed to the pain meds every 2- 4 hour. Kratom has not only helped me with my every day wellbeing, but it has also helped with the pain I endure on a 24 hr basis. I definitely feel like kratom has helped me become more of a productive person and has allowed me to overcome my personal struggles with pain and unfortunately the addiction that comes with the pain management.\nIf Kratom was banned tomorrow I feel like I would be taking a step back in my efforts to fight the pain struggles and live a normal life. I guarantee my overall quality of life will suffer including, taking care of my children, maintaining  With pain management I was constantly missing work because I would run out of medication early, I was at a higher risk of overdosing, going through bad anxiety on a constant, and had the feeling of being a slave to the prescriptions has made me look into Kratom. In my opinion Kratom has saved me from a dark path I do not want to take. Not only would the ban on Kratom cause me to search out for other alternatives I would be in a lot of horrible pain in the process. I would not be able to work or even sleep for that matter. I feel like I would have no other options but to go back to self-medicating again with alcohol and whatever else I can find to cure the agonizing pain I deal with on a daily basis.  I do not want to get back on Opioids because of the risk of overdosing and going through the pain of constant withdrawals.\nKratom has Not caused me serious side effects. I also personally feel like kratom is a lot safer than prescription medication. I have been taking it daily for over half a year now. I have never felt like I have taken too much, unlike the opioid medicine. I do not feel like I am addicted to Kratom but I do feel like I need it for the reasons I have stated above. From the multiple studies and articles I have read about Kratom it is suggests this plant is safer at such a higher level than opioids. Its fatal respiratory slowdowns that have turned opioid abuse into a massive epidemic is significantly lower in Kratom.  My digestive system is back on tract opposed to when I was using opioids, my appetite has increased as well as my overall physical health. My pain has almost felt like it has decreased with the use of Kratom opposed to the use of Opioids.  Even though a scientist may obtain a license to study Kratom if it is banned, that doesnt mean we the people will have the same authority. Also from what I understand, it is hard to obtain that license. That means if our scientists are on the verge of ground breaking discoveries and cant obtain the license they will have to scrap the entire study. \nI am writing this letter in hopes of stopping the Kratom ban. I can honestly say I am fearful of what my life will become without Mitragyna Speciosa. I ask you to reconsider the decisions of banning this plant. \n\nMatthew J.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17715","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"With pharmaceutical addiction running rampant in the great country, and so much government funding behind it.

Since incorporating the all natural leaf form of kratom into my diet I have ceased use of a number of harmful medications    \nto control my chronic back condition.  I suffer from severe spinal stenosis and the residue of a traumatic back injury from an accident. My quality of life has improved dramatically, as has my family's around me due to the positive effects of kratom in my life. I have experienced zero negative side effects from kratom tea and would be devastated by any scheduling of a naturally occurring substance that has proven so beneficial to my family and I. \n\nOur country was founded on a principle of a government for the people and by the people. The overwhelmingly positive impact kratom use has on thousands of individual's and their families should not be impeded upon by the business interests of pharmacuetical companies and misguided efforts of a failed drug war. Turning functioning adults into criminals for making their lives and society at large a better place would be a travesty of the highest order. This plant has already established a safe protocol in the preceding thousand years globally and  the last twenty years in the United States since it's introduction to her. \n\nThrought the pages of thousands of testimonials accompanying my comment there are ample scientific citations by accredited researchers and medical professionals who have testified to the benefits of kratom and the need for continuing study. To dismiss these facts would be negligent  of the public's best interest and would contribute to an overwhelming amount of public suffering. \n\nNo doubt many people would lose their lives due the removal of this beneficial option in their lives. Kratom assists in the void where conventional treatments have failed to resolve the public's need for relief from addiction, depression, anxiety and unbearable pain.  Please hear with clarity the call of the people's will to have a natural option to ease their suffering.

Kratom is a very mild and safe substance that has a centuries long history of use. As a 35 year old American adult I should have the freedom to choose natural products like Kratom.

I am a stay at home mom and we have 5 beautiful daughters.  Approximately 11.5 years ago, I began suffering from severe lower back pain.  After 7 years of misdiagnosis, it was finally determined I was suffering from severe  SI joint dysfunction.  My right side was all but fused and my left side, hyper mobile, never staying in tact. This simply occurred because after the birth of our last child, my joints didn't go back into proper place.  For 3 years I went to physical therapy and endured more than 22 procedures to try and mask the pain and was prescribed everything from Percocet, to Morphine, to Methadone, all to function at some level and perform daily tasks to care for my family and our home.  Procedures were never successful, at times, developing severe neuritis, unable to tolerate any touch, even running water from a shower left me whaling in agony.  Upon moving from Florida to Texas, I made attempt after attempt to find care to manage the pain and live with a reasonable quality of life.  I was refused treatment, refused care, and treated like an absolute criminal, all because of a stigma associated with narcotics, It was humiliating and embarrassing.  With quite a bit of due diligence, I finally sought out and found a physician that was interested in healing the joints and not masking or hiding the pain.  After 8 very uncomfortable treatments, I was able to tolerate a more comfortable life and participate in regular activities without dread or embarrassment.  While researching treatment options, I came across several articles about Kratom and the success, not only alieving the misery that accompanies no longer taking prescribed narcotics, but allowed controlled and healthy relief from the pain I continued to contend with.  I have now been taking Kratom for more than a year, and have not had any adverse effects.  I function without being in a fog, with manageable comfort and am able to participate in most activities with my family.  I have never felt unsafe or concerned and am absolutely thankful for this plant and all of the benefits Kratom offers me; pain relief, mood stability, and restful, regular sleep) .  I can not predict my outcome had I not discovered Kratom, but I can assure you my quality of life and the lives of our family have improved tremendously compared to the 4 years of synthetic medication with adverse effects and procedure after procedure which offered no relief or end in sight.\n\nRene' Schutt","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21420","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rene' Schutt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom will cause a much larger opiate epidemic then our country akready has.

It was then that I sought help and was put on suboxone. That started a long period of more than fifteen years, where I tried to kick my opiod problems, \"prescribed solution.\" While I was fairly stable, I could not stop the bupinorfine for years. The withdrawl was so terrible that I began to believe it could not be done. Fiinally after many failed attempts I endured the 60 day withdrawl.  After a year it had become painfully clear that the years spent using my prescibed opiate treatment may have left me forever physically and mentally damaged. I had to make a decision,  either go back on an opiod or find a healthier solution. See, after a year clean I had no motivation. Getting out of bed in the morning was a choir. Being a successful employee or worker was literally not physically possible.  So as a last stitch effort I turned to the legal, natural, and I dare say, the only option I had left to lead a successful and fulfilling life. That final option was kratom.

Many people use kratom to improve their life in one way or another, and I truly hope these people will be able to continue to use it and benefit from it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13625","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was crippled and on 9 different medications, I couldn't work and stated losing all hope.

I am commenting only on my own personal experience in management of my chronic pain. I have been prescribed opiates but resist taking them due to the myriad potentially deadly risks associated with their use. A month ago, I stumbled upon kratom as a safe and much less risky alternative. Since using this plant, my pain level is more manageable, therefore allowing a much better quality of life. In my research, I have still not uncovered any instances of serious side effects nor have I experienced any with the exception of minor indigestion. We now have a crisis of opiate addiction in our country, whether prescribed or purchased illegally, these drugs are responsible for thousands of deaths per year and the numbers are steadily rising. I have yet to find an instance where the use of Kratom alone has been fatal. In my experience, I find that those who use this plant, including myself, wish to avoid the risks of opiate use, utilizing natural alternatives in their choices with regard to their health and are successfulI at doing so using kratom. Therefore, I STRONGLY feel any action to schedule the substances in kratom would contribute to this country's current crisis of opiate addiction and opiate related death. In conclusion, I humbly ask the DEA to refrain from scheduling the substances in kratom, so that I might retain my freedom of choice to use this plant in management of my personal health and wellness.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2150","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning Kratom will accomplish nothing in the war on drugs, save for hurt the people who use it for medicinal reasons.

I have been consuming the kratom tea off-and-on since I was 19 years old. I have obsessive-compulsive-disorder and I have found the tea to be an incredibly useful, natural supplement. I have found that consuming Kratom helps me with productivity and mood. I have noticed an improvement in my overall quality of life because of this supplement. The best part is, I have not found the product to be addicting whatsoever. I have been using it off-and-on for numerous years and I have never developed any kind of a dependency to it. This allows me to only use the product when I find it necessary. Kratom is not a cure for any disease - by any means. I would never consider it a substitute for medical treatment. If my OCD were to become serious again, I would seek medical attention. However, as it's been mild for the past ten years, I've been able to lead a full and quality life with healthy eating, exercise, and the occasional kratom tea as needed. Kratom should not be a schedule I drug, or regulated by any means. It is very mild Just as consumers have the right to purchase St. John's Wort or Melatonin, I firmly believe that we should be able to purchase kratom. There simply isn't the research to support any dangers of this herb. I am proud to say that I have obtained my master's degree in 2016, and I have an excellent job in my field. I give back to my community, and I care for the future of our country.

I just want to first say that I was touched by all the people who have told their kratom story. I never knew it helped saved so many lives. My kratom story started about 10 years ago. Like many I was compelled to try kratom for pain reliever properties. My job is very  pyshically demanding . My whole body was in pain after a few years due to old sport injuries. I also read that people in asia  used kratom to deal with thier labor intensive jobs. So i tried it. After that day i can say that kratom has changed my life for the better. It is not a recreational high. Its more like an energy boost. I am able to work hard every single say for 12hrs a day for the last 10 years. I am more productive. I can honestly say I have  never missed a day of work. I am a hard working person and member of society. I dont lie,cheat,steal or hurt anybody with my kratom use. Many people say i am the most dependable person they know. I have also not showed any signs of adverse side effects with my use. I go to the doctor every few years for a checkup and everything is fine. I rarely get sick. Im not as stressed out anymore. More calm and patient. I treat people respectfully. Ive asked many people if they have heard of kratom and most have not so I dont see how kratom is an imminent threat. I believe people should have the option of a safer alternative to opiate pain medication. If the Dea goes through with this ban i feel like so many lives will be affected negatively.

I am taking this opportunity to ask the DEA NOT to classify Kratom and its alkaloids as a narcotic scheduled drug.  It is a dietary supplement,an herb with beneficial health properties.\n I started using kratom last year for occasional arthritis pain,and was pleasantly surprised at how effective it was , while not causing stomach upset, like NSAID's; and also no heavily sedating properties like narcotics. When starting kratom I had a bleeding ulcer, due to use of NSAID's. Now i have gained 10 lbs and my ulcer has healed. For years I have done the \"ulcer dance\" with NSAIDS, my pain gets to such an extent I need something, and rather than ask for narcotics i usually just take Aleve.\n I also have experienced no problems with addiction with kratom. When i don't need it, I don't take it and have had no \"cravings\", or urge to .

I truly believe that by scheduling kratom you will be taking away a product that undeniably betters peoples lives.  If this ban goes through I see nothing but a negative outcome as our customers will have to resort back to using pain pills which are extremely addictive and dangerous or worse heroin users who have been able to get clean by use of kratom resorting back to buying these lethal substances on the street.

At the time, I was struggling with an addiction to prescription pain pills, oxycodone in particular, but I would take anything I could get that was an opiate.

I was self-medicating, and buying them off the street, sometimes even putting myself in dangerous situations. \n\nI knew what I was doing was wrong, and I was on a path that could easily lead me to being in jail or on heroin. My tolerance was building and my addiction was getting worse. \n\nI tried to stop several times, but the withdrawal was unbearable, both physically and mentally. \n\nIn researching ways to get off opiates, I learned about kratom. I purchased some and found that it really helped take away much of the discomfort of withdrawal. This plant was a miracle plant to me!   It truly helped me get clean. In many ways, it's fair to say that Kratom saved my life. Who knows how bad I would have gotten? \n\nI found no side effects with kratom, aside from it not tasting very good. It made me life better. And, I did not become addicted to it.  \n\nI also found that kratom worked as a mild pain reliever and helped with some anxiety issues I have.  Without being addicted, I am able to take it from time to time, and it improves my quality of life. \n\nI am better father and husband, as well as a better employee at my job. And It's because of this plant. \n\nShould kratom become illegal, I truly believe it will result in making the heroin and opiate epidemic much worse. \n\nPlease keep kratom legal and readily available. \n\nSincerely,\n\nSteve Katz","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18856","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steve Katz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've been successfully using Kratom to live with the everyday pains of my arthritis for the last four years..

Kratom is plant  found in nature and used for many different reasons by a plethora of cultures. The benefits of Kratom are abundant. The beneficial properties are anxiety relief, pain relief, mood stabilizer, sleep aid, and mood stimulant. \n\n I work in south Florida as a Plumber, The days are hot, the job gets very stressful, and my body hurts when i'm home. I am only 26 and have already had a hernia and had to undergo surgery. Kratom is a great alternative to drinking a beer at the end of the day to relax and wind down after a hard days work.  I am a former heroin addict and alcoholic, so I understand what addiction is, how it acts, and what does to your body. I remember when I was actively using how sick I became physically, Kratom has none of the characteristics of an addictive substance. In the years I have been taking it, not once did I feel as though I lost control (as I did with drugs and alcohol) not once did I ever have withdrawal symptoms nor do I have to have it everyday without exception, the way I did with drugs and alcohol. It is not the same thing as other schedule 1 drugs and it is absurd to classify as the same. It is the only alternative I have to drugs and alcohol, which I can no longer take. \n\nAs an addict, I have abused prescription medications, so for my anxiety and work related pain, prescriptions are out of the question. Kratom has helped me maintain a healthy lifestyle and helped me be a productive member of society, which I was not when I was drinking and using drugs. Kratom is quite literally the only thing I can safely take in order to manage my pain and anxiety. If i were to get a prescription for anti anxiety  medication or a narcotic of any kind, the possibility of addiction is far too great, and the benefits do not outweigh the risks. With Kratom, the benefits certainly outweigh the risks.\n\n I sincerely hope that my government does not take away the only option for people like me who struggle with addiction. I do not want to believe that in America, for people with a past like mine, the only option for treating anxiety and pain are pharmaceutical drugs. If I were to go that route, that would only exacerbate my problems and lead me down a path I do not want to travel. I have tried the \"Big Pharma\" route, it did not work and only made me worse. It is not a solution for people like me. Kratom is. I wish to believe that I live in a country that values the welfare of its citizen more than the bottom line of big business. It seems as though that is the only way our society wants to see anyone get any releif and citizens should have more options to mange their situations than \"popping a pill.\" . The public outcry regarding the ban of Kratom, and the adamant pleas to keep it legal speaks for itself.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCody Ulrich","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17526","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cosy Ulrich","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Amber, I am 27 and I own and operate a pet care facility.

As someone who has worked in law enforcement for almost two decades, I can tell you that I have never encountered any problems with anyone using this plant.  In fact, most of us have never even heard of it until recently, and that is only because of the DEA action.  All of us have been scratching our heads about this.  You would think if it was as dangerous as you claim, we'd see it all the time-- like we do with heroin and fentanyl and oxy.  Those are what are really dangerous, not some plant that seems to actually help people stay off of the really bad stuff.  I'd suggest that you focus your attention and resources where they belong-- on fighting against heroin and fentanyl.  Honestly you should ban fentanyl if anything-- that is leading to more deaths than I guess you realize.  Why bother turning it into a crime to ingest this stuff when those of us who are sworn to uphold the law haven't seen a single problem with it yet?  Focus your attention on what really matters here-- stopping heroin and fentanyl from getting smuggled into the country and killing more Americans.  I'd also encourage you to think about the fact that you'd be creating another black market for the cartels, which are seeing a big cut into their profits from the legalization of marijuana in a number of states (including the one I work in).  As I'm sure you're aware, they are starting to branch into manufacturing and smuggling pills into the country now, and they're looking for more opportunities for profit from what I understand. Why give them yet another product they can smuggle into our country and kill our citizens over?  If it were really harmful, I'd agree with you.  But 15 deaths that are questionably related to this plant are frankly a drop in the bucket compared to the real killers, like heroin and even alcohol and cigarettes.  I suspect that many more people die from products that are legal, like tylenol, so why even waste your resources on this?  And why should the rest of us in law enforcement waste our resources on it as well?  It just doesn't make sense.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6692","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please research this in depth.

Personally, I am no longer dependent on prescription benzodiazepines which were having a negative impact on my health and well-being after long-term use. Kratom helps to relieve my crippling anxiety and helps to prevent panic attacks in which the benzodiazepines were prescribed for. \n\nKratom is known for being a life-saver for those dependent on both non-prescription and prescription opioids.  With today's opioid epidemic, taking away the greatest known harm-reduction tool for opiods just doesn't make much sense to me.  Kratom has only a few minor side-effects, if any, when used properly, and is very safe shown by numerous anecdotal reports over the many centuries it has been in use.\n\nI am not for banning this substance but for the regulation of Kratom, similar to the way alcohol is regulated currently.  I feel it should be the people's choice as to what they put in their bodies and we should have an alternative to the sometimes dangerous prescription drugs that are prescribed to us by doctors.\n\nI also feel you should honor the FOIA request being presented to you and am having a hard time understanding why you won't release the information to the public if your sources are valid.  We have the right to see the information leading to your decision to ban this substance.  \n\nI sincerely hope you do the right thing.

I am 41 years old. About 16 months ago, I got a prescription for an opioid based pain medication due to pain from work, past injuries, and just plain advancing age. The medication works wonderfully, and does exactly what it's supposed to do, making it possible for me to work as hard as I do.  A few months ago my doctor told me that I may not be able to keep receiving this medication without jumping through a multitude of hoops and convincing a pain specialist that I need it. So in case I lost my prescription, I began researching natural alternatives to opioid medication, and I found Kratom. It is an incredible plant. Although not half as effective as the medication for pain, it DOES help pain, and is an amazing anti -inflammatory. It is amazing how well it works for me and millions of others. I was very relieved to find that if I am found unworthy of keeping my prescribed pain medication that I had an alternative. And now, after just two months, I find out that the FDA/DEA plan to ban Kratom and make it an illegal Schedule 1 drug. I don't know if the drug companies are paying the right people to ban real alternatives to their products, or what, but you are making life miserable for people in real pain. First you make it harder to get relief from your doctor, then you ban any alternatives to prescription drugs. Left without any options, you wonder why people turn to illegal drugs. This plant is natural and harmless if used correctly. Anyone can abuse anything if they want to bad enough. But Kratom is about to be classified more dangerous than Cocaine? Ridiculous.  Also, another use for this plant: Withdrawal. Anyone whose ever ran out of their opiate based medication, or not filled it on time and had to wait a weekend for a refill, will tell you that the 72 hours after you run out are very uncomfortable. This plant is not an opiate, but it binds to the same receptors in the brain. Taking Kratom absolutely negates the symptoms of withdrawal, and that is a miracle in itself. This plant is safe and works wonders. If Marijuana is slowly being made legal in the US, it is just not understandable that Kratom could be made illegal. Please consider taking steps to prevent this from happening. As I said above. I have never used an illegal drug and I never will. Which means if I can no longer buy Kratom, and cannot convince the right Doctor that I need my prescribed pain meds in his opinion, I'll be left in pain with only meager alternatives for relief. PLEASE stop micro- managing everything that actually works. Please do not make this Kratom ban possible. Thank you for your time and consideration. \n\nMelvin Cloud","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18400","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Melvin Cloud","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern.\n I am writing this to be heard during your public comment period regarding the possible placement of Kratom on the list of scheduled drugs.\n Please do not place Kratom on the list of scheduled drugs.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the regulatory future of kratom.\n\nI'm an unexceptional and average person: middle-class, decent education, parent of small children, suffering no chronic pain or ongoing health challenges. I have not misused prescription opioids or street opiates, but I do occasionally enjoy legal recreational drugs such as caffeine, alcohol, and cannabis. I do not consider myself someone who would likely consume kratom on a regular basis.\n\nSince my time in high school, I have witnessed dear friends become hooked on prescription painkillers. A car accident, a surgery, chronic endometriosis, a kidney infection, a mastectomy... They have been prescribed with strong painkillers, developed a dependency, and gotten hooked. Vicodin, percocet, hydrocodone, oxycontin. Familiar names. The stuff begins to lose its effectiveness, the body compensates by developing a tolerance, and they have to up the dosage. They go back to the doctor's office, pleading, trying to justify their pain to get another refill. They get grilled and side-eyed by the pharmacist when they fill their prescription. They are self-conscious. Street drugs are discreet and much more easy to obtain. No justification required, no accusatory glances, no limit. Where do they go from there? That road is not pretty. It's no exaggeration to say that it destroys lives.\n\nNow you have kratom, a natural herbal remedy. It's a nasty bitter-tasting leaf that is straight-up dried and powdered. It's not patented by a pharmaceutical company. It's not modified in a lab. It's (yet) unregulated by the government. You can easily walk into a shop and buy a bag. There's no gate, there's no shame, and it's (comparatively) cheap. It has painkilling effects, some mild euphoria, little-to-no risk of overdose, and has been used _responsibly_ by thousands of individuals to mitigate their pain and overcome dependency to much more dangerous opioids. It binds to the same receptors in the brain as the opioids, so there are few feelings of withdrawal or craving. Don't you see how this is a win, how this is could be a key to solving the current crisis?? \n\nI have watched this herb transform the lives of my friends, helped them manage their pain, kick their habit, and normalize their lives. I have talked with smoke shop staff who have witnessed similar and even more transformational stories from their distinct vantage. By our collective understanding, kratom is about as benign and beneficial as coffee -- with an additional superpower to kick dependency to opioids. That's a winning combination. They should be passing this out to patients in rehab clinics. Doctors should be able to suggest it as an alternative for managing chronic pain. It should be on the shelves of the drug store and on the menu at the smoothie shop along with the bee pollen, kava root, and protein powder.\n\nKratom is the unexpected SOLUTION to the opioid crisis. It is the deus ex machina of the story. There would be few superlatives strong enough to describe how stupid the DEA would be were they to decide to classify kratom as a Schedule I drug without a proper investigation.\n\nStudy it. Investigate its effects, side-effects, benefits, and drawbacks. Get opinions from independent neuropharmacologists and pain management specialists. You can see from the thousands of comments that many of us -- consumers and non-consumers alike -- are confident in the redeeming medical and societal value of this drug. We hope your investigation leads you to a similar conclusion.\n\nThank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22823","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marta Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been an addict for 15 years. I have been clean for just over 1 year and I can credit that to the benefits of Kratom. It has gotten me through some tough times when I had cravings and felt like I would relapse. It has called my mind while not leaving me with any type of high. It's eased my cravings, and relieved my anxiety. Essentially saving my life, bc the last time I used I overdosed and nearly lost my life. So I see it as a life saving herb. The benefits do not stop there. I have had injuries old and new that would lead me to take prescription opioids. I can honestly say that the pain killing aspect of of Kratom is more effective than pharmaceutical options with much less side effects. I have a lot of experience with addiction and have tried many alternatives to getting clean, suboxone for example. I only ended up addicted to them and struggled just as I had from the drugs themselves with lots of side effects at a high financial cost. I can't say enough of about the capabilities of Kratom and its many benefits. For me it's something that has helped give me and my family my life back. I see it as a harmless herb with much holistic value and I pray that you would see that for recovering addicts this is an option that has not been available before. One that no synthetic or pharmaceutical option can compete with.

I am writing to request that you make every effort within your power to keep kratom legal and available within the United States.\n\nAfter using a variety of prescription stimulants to overcome my focus challenges, I was introduced to kratom as an alternative treatment. I immediately noticed that the energy and focus that came from kratom felt more natural and therapeutic than the prescription amphetamines typically used to treat attention disorders. I have incorporated the use of kratom into my routine by taking a few small, stimulating doses throughout the week to improve my focus and performance at work, and I have been able to abandon the use of prescription amphetamines entirely. For me, kratom has been a safer, healthier alternative that has allowed me to escape from a confining amphetamine addiction, and I hope to be able to continue to use it in this manner to stay off of medications indefinitely.\n\nThe ban of this substance does not come at a net benefit to the public, and I hope that your help will make an impact in postponing or reversing the legislation that will eliminate access to this plant. I plead that you hear my message below and consider pushing to retain the legality of kratom in support of the people in this country in need of this herb.\n\nThus far, not a single death has been conclusively attributed solely to kratom, and its benefits greatly outweigh its costs. As the only widely accepted herb that allows people to break free from crippling heroin and opiate addictions, kratom has saved far more lives than it has worsened if any. Opiate and amphetamine addictions continue to be a significant threat to public safety, and have become far more lethal in recent times due to the dealers on the black market cutting drugs with dangerous research chemicals. Placing kratom on Schedule I will undoubtedly make a negative impact on the heroin/opiate addiction epidemic, ultimately endangering thousands of lives. This is a matter of life and death to certain people, an infringement of liberty to many others, and a negative step in scientific progress, so please use your voice to support this cause.\n\nKratom has stimulating effects similar to coffee and analgesic properties similar to prescription painkillers, with a fraction of the negative side effects (temporary nausea at most). Anybody who has tried kratom would understand that it has great potential for health benefits upon further research, and in the meantime provides a safe, effective way for people to break addictions or deal with chronic pain. It does not impair people's cognitive abilities, motor skills, or judgment. It is simply incorrect to claim that it has no medical use, and it has not been given the chance for such a conclusion to be made. There is no benefit to the ban of this substance, because it is not a threat to public health, nor is it widely-abused for its very mild psychoactive properties. \n\nPlease help this cause by being part of the movement that protects the plant, as well as the people who rely on it and the future of medical progress that it will inevitably provide. I hope you hear this message among the many others that are fighting for this cause and take action on behalf of all of us.\n\nThank you very much for reading this message. I wish you a great week!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3091","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a self employed, middle-aged woman and a user of kratom.

I think the DEA might be jumping the gun on this one because not much is known about the drug Kratom. But what is known is that is can be helpful as i have seen many petitions, and people on social medias talking about how Kratom has helped them. If this is the case, i beleive its important that we engage both positives and negatives. Marijuana is a wrongly placed schedule 1 drug and it has caused no deaths. Tobacco and Alcohol are legal and have been associated with more than a fair share of deaths. With all that being said we have seen Kratom help people with ptsd, pain, and opiate addictions. I definetly believe the FDA needs to study this plant a bunch more so that we can really truly identify both the positives and the negatives. Until then though it would seem preposterous to just place it into a schedule 1 category, which it is put in that position off the bad, it will become very tough to take it out even if the evidence for it being more beneficial than negative. I'd also like to add that the Joe Rogan Experiance Podcast episode with Chris Bell would be a very informative piece of subject to look into. As well as speaking to many of the people who take Kratom for whatever reason and get their perspective. If it does in fact seem to help many people in medical ways like many have said it does, then keeping it from schedule one would mean more people could study it and perhaps help more people in the future.

I had some serious complications after surgery that required I take medication for pain. After a year I had a corrective procedure that finally fixed my hip, days after this surgery I was no longer in the pain I had been in for over a year so I no longer needed any pain medication. I was shocked to find that after a day or so without pain medication I started feeling bad like I had the flu and after a bit of research i realized I was in physical withdrawal. I read about kratom and began to drink the tea  the next day. I drank the Kraton tea for a couple of weeks but I was 100% medication free with no discomfort whatsoever from the moment I I got the herb.  I fear without this herb I would have been  very uncomfortable, or worse, forced to tapper off of a pain medication I no longer needed for pain. I think it would be a real shame to take this useful herb away from folks who are struggling with addiction and trying to get off drugs. I continue to turn to kratom for any periodic discomfort I may have. I have found it to be useful for cramps, upset tummies and sore muscles and would hate not having this in my cupboard the next time it was needed.  \nI hope the DEA will not choose to schedule kratom. I simply cannot imagine why the agency would want to take this supplement away from the millions of consumers who enjoy the benefits of this herb.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19687","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am not a user but I do not believe that prohibition laws work.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13769","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Nauman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I practiced in the healthcare field for over 20 years until my chronic pain returned as result\nOf thoracic outlet compression syndrome.  This is progressive  pain from compression of my brachial plexus.\nI underwent a horrendous surgery in 2002, which relieved the majority of the pain. The surgery saved my career and sanity.  Symptoms have returned, I am not a surgical candidate.  My life consists of managing the pain and preventing further compression. Narcotics prescribed controls the pain for 5 minutes, when the drug\nPeaks then I am on my own. Adjunct medicine are also prescribed.  I was taking 22 pills a day.  I won't name them as it's besides the point .  I know what my life would look like had I not found Kratom.

Then one can add depression to my lists of diagnosis, side effect of narcotics. Your thinking well Kratom is narcotic in action yet Kratom works as an antidepressant, anti anxiety, and muscle relaxer.  Kratom allows me to live my life longer than 30 minutes at a time. I don't crave Kratom which is very important to me. Narcotics  don't work well for chronic pain, they are more suitable for acute pain but there is an algorithm for prescribing narcotics.  I take Kratom 2 times a day and have yet to feel any narcotic like haziness, it doesn't effect my cognition.  I know you have read those internet discussions on effects of Kratom from those trying to get High.   There are discussions on getting high from taking antidepressants, yet they  aren't controlled.  The point is people will try anything.  I don't have to sit through those ridiculous pain clinics that all chronic pain patients HAVE to go to.  They are the new pill mills.  Kratom gave me my life back. Should Kratom be a scheduled drug, I would be forced to return to a life centered around the monotony of pain and the pills prescribed, and subsequently lose control of my life.\nMy understanding,from research, is no one has overdosed from Kratom,alone.

Some people use it for ailments such as reducing pain, fighting off the withdrawals from opiates or alcoholism, reducing stress, relaxation, to aid in the fight against insomnia, and a host of other ailments. Kratom can alleviate the agonizing symptoms of these ailments without having to go to a doctor, which for some people, would cost money which they cannot afford the help of modern medicine. There are very few remedies out there that one can buy and use that has not been restricted by laws and regulations by our government. Therefore, the self help avenues one can find in herbal remedies is down to about the last three. One is kratom and the others are kava and marijuana. Marijuana is already being used with great success in a host of ailments with very few side effects and much less dangerous than some of the prescriptions that one can get from a doctor. Such is the case with kratom and kava as well. So, please do not restrict kratom to the point of making it unavailable to the people who use it with good intent and for good reasons. There will always be abusers that use it in gross excess and without good reason or good cause. That will never change, but making it illegal will just make matters worst in a world with so many regulations that one cannot find any self help. Hence, they are forced to seek a doctor of medicine or even other illegal resources where one does not know what you are getting. Of which and once again all cost money. Kratom is already not cheap, but regulating it will make it cost a lot more. Alas, such is the case with marijuana which can cost $300+ for an ounce. One single ounce!\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nSincere Regards,\nK","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2098","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Cannan Stevens.

Before this meeting we had mutual connections and friends but there was something different about this lady she is completely changed my view my stance and understanding of herb and Medicine. She's dedicated her life for the past year to the understanding and practical application of holistic medicine. My life consisted of drinking soda two red bulls every morning, and a horrible diet. This lady hasn't affected my life and everyone's life that I've come in contact with to be healthier to think smarter about what you're investing in the things that you're taking into your body.

Since kicking hard drugs and picking up kratom i have been able to get my life back on track in a big way.  It helps keep my addiction at bay without all the terrible health side effects of methadone. When i take kratom it doesnt get me \"high\" it gives me a sense of well being and a freedom from hard drugs. I also feel motivated to improve myself and my surroundings. Scheduling kratom would be the worst possible thing you could do for the opiate epidemic . Many people will revert back to the street for whatever they can get their hands on. In many ways scheduling will play right into the hands of not only big pharma that just want to hold market share and dont care how their customers end up but also drug kingpins like el chapo guzman who will sell all the addicts a different opiate if you take away the natural and healthy alternative - kratom\n\nPeople have been taking this substance for thousands of years and all of the sudden the DEA needs to get involved? With marijuana prohibition starting to end the DEA will need a new boogie man to chase. These people dont care about how many lives theyve ruined. ..throwing millions in jail for non violent offenses....they just care about keeping their jobs\n\nIf you look at the data a large number of people started their opiate addiction with a doctors prescription.Me included. i was misled by the person i was supposed to trust the most,my doctor. A ban will sow even more distrust and hatred for the government. \nDo you think people choose to be alcoholics ? \nWhat if their was a substance that didnt make them drunk, didnt make them want to drink and gave them their life back oh and also its just an all natural plant thats been trial tested over thousands of year by humans from a different part of the earth(Borneo, Malaysia, Thailand). \n\nBanning kratom will be taking away the most healthy tool we have in combating opiate addiction. I promise youll hear over and over how it gave people their lives back. Im certainly one of those people. You be hanging all these people out to dry. They literally have no alternative. Do you really wanna help people or do you wanna help special interests?\nKratom does not kill people. The fact that the DEA honed in on it seemed pretty suspicious in the first place. They created the problem so they can push through scheduling for a substance thats pretty harmless. Meanwhile theres liqueur stores on every corner and drunk drivers are killing people everyday. Cigerettes are proven to kill people yet they are also sold in every corner store. And along comes this ground leaf that gives those with addiction some healthy relief and somehow the reasoning is to take that away. Is it just me or does the world just not make sense anymore :(\n\nI hope that who ever reads this can see the issue with clarity . When you dont have motivated reasoning like the DEA has than this whole prospect of scheduling another plant makes less and less sense.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8386","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"justin kelly","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please consider those of us looking for non-narcotic relief for chronic pain.  \n\nThank You\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19767","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Billy Giovinetti","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I am a disabled vet with PTSD.

Ok if that is the argument then what about alcohol? Why is it still legal? Because we as adults should have the right to purchse/consume said items and hold no one else liable for their misconduct. \n\nPersonally I have not experienced this on kratom. I have not had to raise my dose infact I have been able to lower it and not need it for days on end. Personal responsibility is a big thing. Being a legal age is why we put age restrictions on certain items. Kratom should be left alone as it is and instead age restrict it. It already is age restricted if purchasing online. Most online sites have a big sign before you enter that states if you are under the age of 18 then you are not allowed to purchase. We could do this in store settings as well.\n\nThe American people have the right to ingest what they seem fit without the government holding their hands. The FDA should allow kratom as a dietary supplement then we COULD put directions/warnings on said packages. Change how this is then most of these issues would go away. We don't regulate coffee. Kratom doesn't need regulations either. The Indo Farmers have to follow particular methods of sanitation. Let's design some kind of means of following manufacturing to ensure the safety of the public. If there was a guideline then most of these issues that have been brought up would be dealt with. Stop trying to big brother us and get the process started to make kratom a dietary supplement just like kava and saint John's Wort. \n\nWe have already lost too many lives to heroin and pills-this leaf could stop all this baloney in it's tracks but people are afraid of the unknown.

I am very concerned that without this legal product, people that I care about will have to resort to dangerous drugs, either legal or illegal, in order to manage pain.  Kratom offers an opiate-like effect without the \"high\", side-effects, and long term damage of actual opiates (both synthetic and naturally derived).\n\nI believe there are minor side effects (such as constipation) that can occur with the use of Kratom, which will adequately prohibit casual abuse of this substance.  I believe that there is little chance that this substance would be used recreationally on a large scale.  I think that casual/recreational use of this product can be discouraged without DEA control.  If it is within the scope of governmental over-sight to ensure that children do not ingest this product, and that cautions are made known to adults, then I can support such over-sight.\n\nI also believe that this substance can be used as an aid to opiate addiction recovery in professional/clinical environments.\n\nAs a nation, I believe we need to focus our resources on limiting the abuse of dangerous drugs that are becoming pervasive in our communities, such as fentanyl, meth, heroin and \"designer drugs\".\n\nI also believe that drug abuse should be dealt with more as a health problem and less as a crime problem.\n\nrespectfully submitted,\nDaniel J Bosworth","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4648","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"n/a","postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Bosworth","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a dotcom CEO who was prescribed 10mg/3x daily methadone for spine and joint issues, for 5 years.  This dosage was never increased, and I saw a doctor every month to renew.  I have never taken recreational drugs, nor am I a drinker.\n\nAfter a surgery earlier this year improved my spine issue, my doctor and I made the decision last month that I was ready to migrate off daily opiates.  I heard about kratom from a nurse friend and started reducing my opiate intake while taking 3mg6mg of red kratom before bed, to calm the terrible restless leg syndrome that accompanies withdrawal.\n\nOne month later, I am comfortably down to 5mg/1x daily methadone.  The kratom is not psychoactive to any significant degree that I can appreciate, and it is a godsend for enabling sleep and eliminating RLS.  I have every confidence that, in another month, I will be off methadone entirely.\n\nPlease, please do not ban or place kratom in Schedule 1 or 2.  This is an unbelievably useful and efficacious tool for overcoming withdrawal, with no deleterious side effects that I have discerned.  If it were removed from the market, I suspect you would see a significant uptick in harm expansion.\n\nFinally, based on the research I have seen thus far on the few kratom-associated deaths, which seem to feature coincident alcohol and/or drug use, I would be highly skeptical of an FDA decision to schedule kratom at level 1.  That would suggest a degree of danger that is just not present given the massive denominator of users under the few claimed fatalities.

Leaves are hand picked, crushed into a fine powder, and then, if consumed, create an analgesic effect that prevents or significantly reduces the need for serious painkillers that belong in the opiate family (hydrocodone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, morphine, fentanyl). The Food and Drug Administration works closely with the Canadian Health Center. In Canada, they have legalized Kratom. \n\nThe main active alkaloid is 7-hydroxymitragynine, and the Drug Enforcement Agency is attempting to make it a Schedule 1 Controlled Substance. Not only is this extremely ignorant, as this plant is related to the coffee plant, has no confirmed deaths from the alkaloids alone, has many researchers looking into its potential medical benefits, and creates a large economic growth potential within the US and between other countries whom grow and export it. Scheduling it as a Controlled Substance will halt the vast majority of all scientific research and create many people to revert back to using opiate painkillers their doctors prescribe them. In 2014 alone, the death toll from Prescription Opiates was approximately 25,000 individuals. 25,000 individuals lost their lives because the drugs either fell into the wrong hands due to being sold by individuals prescribed it (likely because healthcare is disgustingly expensive in the United States, which is another story) or individuals were over-prescribed, combined their narcotic analgesics with benzos or alcoholics or another CNS depressant.\n\nNarcan, referred to as an opiate antidote, is now legal to purchase over the counter. This means that the Government has finally realized and accepted opiates are an epidemic in the United States. This brings us to the question as to why the DEA would want to Schedule a leaf with a few active alkaloids that reduce pain, yet cause no respiratory depression and has no confirmed deaths with kratom alkaloids alone. \n\nKratom is used daily by individuals across the country, for lethargy, pain, depression, insomnia, and a slur of other personal issues. With the expense of health care, lack of GOOD healthcare (10 minutes with a doctor and you have a piece of paper with some chemical written on it), and the danger of many pharmaceuticals, a lot of individuals prefer to use a natural leaf to treat minor symptoms. It does not replace real medical advice by any stretch of the imagination, but if it saves 1 life from an opiate overdose, and at the same time improves the lives of many, many individuals across this beautiful country of ours, causes economic growth and increases trade between countries, why would the DEA want to schedule this leaf?\n\nKeep Kratom legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18880","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nMy name is Emily, and I'm a 34 year old digital media executive (Chief Digital Officer) from Seattle, Washington. I was first introduced to kratom two years ago by one of my employees, who had been using the herb to help offset his back pain and sore muscles. I'd recently undergone a spinal surgery myself, and decided to try kratom to see if it would help with my general soreness. I was pleased to discover that not only was it quite helpful with alleviating my pain, but it also provided me with an additional energy boost that was very similar to an excellent cup (or two) of coffee. It's wonderful!\n\nSince I discovered kratom, I've found that it's been extremely beneficial for both my personal and professional life. As a person with chronic back problems who works a job that requires 8+ hours a day of sitting, its pain-reducing qualities are a life saver. I also find that kratom helps keep my energy and focus sharp, which is incredibly useful in my high-stress profession.\n\nAs an executive who certainly would NOT consider using illegal drugs, I admit that I was baffled (and a little insulted) when I read that the DEA was considering scheduling the herb as a controlled substance.  I've been using kratom daily for years, and have never experienced any side-effects from the herb -- no dependencies or negative effects. \n\nI'd be extremely disappointed if I'm no longer able to enjoy kratom, and ask that you reconsider your position on the matter of scheduling it as a controlled substance. From my personal experience and the experience of many other individuals I know, kratom is a highly beneficial plant that positively affects lives. Treating it otherwise would be a huge misstep, and would negatively impact the thousands of Americans currently enjoying its benefits.\n\nThank you for your consideration,\n\nEmily","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16595","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Emily Diehl","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA, \nI oppose scheduling mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, constituents of the Kratom plant (or in binomial nomenclature Mitragyna speciosa), as Schedule I drugs. It does not belong there. It is a very mild stimulant and mild sedative but a very helpful plant, with many uses. We need to conduct clinical trials and studies before making any kind of decision. After years of study, who knows what wonderful things we could find? It could be even more important than what the community believes it to be. However, we will never find out if it becomes a Schedule I drug. We should base all our decisions on hard scientific evidence before making rash decisions. The leaves have been used in South-East Asia for 100's of years. It is used as a mild stimulant, mild sedative, pain killer, and helps ease opiate withdrawal. Many people report that Kratom helps them with arthritis, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and fibromyalgia.\n\nI am Steven Isaac Carroll, I am currently a hard working Sophomore at Weber State University majoring in Botany and Minoring in Chemistry. Throughout my college career I have been taking Kratom regularly and I average between a 3.5-4.0 GPA every semester which demonstrates that Kratom is not affecting my memory, thinking or judgement.  I am 22 years of age. I have used Kratom for 4 years now, starting when I was 18 after I had a surgery to remove an osteocyte that was pinching my nerve cord in my elbow which was causing chronic pain and discomfort. It is an injury I received when playing Lacrosse in High School. The removal of that piece of bone just made the pain and discomfort worse as now the nerve cord in my arm easily slides over where that bone used to be and causes pain, on top of it being constantly strained. Because of this I don't have full movement with my left hand fingers, especially my small finger and a lot of the time my finger feels numb. This constantly causes pain and discomfort and I had an important choice to make after the surgery; take prescription opiates every day with adverse health effects but feel no pain OR find a healthier alternative that will help enough to alleviate at least some degree of the chronic pain and discomfort that I have without the negative health effects. I chose the latter and I am SO happy I did. Kratom has changed my life and the lives of many others for the better. Many veterans, the people who we should treat with the utmost respect use Kratom for various reasons and need it. Kratom does not ruin lives, it saves them. Without Kratom I would have to live with that chronic pain and discomfort daily or I would have to use prescription painkillers, which I do not have any desire to do. \n\nKratom is safe, you cannot OD on it, although there are reports of people dying with Kratom in their system along with other drugs, ultimately Kratom was not the cause of death, to say as much is like saying those people had caffeine in their system so the caffeine must be the cause of death. It is safer than alcohol and tobacco, which are both legal. The worst that can happen with Kratom is to throw up if you take too much, just as you would if you ate too much food for dinner. There are very few negative side effects, I only experience one on occasion and that is nausea. Other than that one negative side effect, everything else is positive. \n\nWays that I benefit from Kratom are the following: pain relief, anti-oxidant, anxiolytic, anti-depressant, weak sedative properties which helps me sleep, and more. While I realize that prescription opiates have their place in medicine, Kratom offers a much milder, safer option for people who do not wish to gamble with the risks that are often inherent in using prescription opiates. According to the CDC 1,000 people are treated for prescription opiate overdoses and abuse every day. Opiates do ruin lives, let there be a healthy alternative, keep Kratom legal. Kratom is known to be useful for recovering opiate addicts to get off of opiates, and stay off of opiates. While I have never been addicted to opiates and am careful of what I put in my body, I personally know recovering addicts that have used Kratom to help them with their addiction, let me tell you, it helps. We are in an opiate epidemic, a serious drug abuse issue in the United States, we need to do something about that. Kratom can help.\n\nIn conclusion, we need to study and regulate the use of the plant, not outright ban it. Banning it will hurt millions of Kratom users including honest hardworking Americans just like me and veterans of our armed forces. Please do not progress the war on drugs, it has been going on long enough and has caused a lot of damage.  Prohibition does not work, we witnessed that in the 1920's with alcohol. Thank you for lifting the ban and allowing a comment period. You have no idea how important that was for you to do. I appreciate the work you guys do, and I hope that someone reads this and it helps them change their mind.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21278","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steven Carroll","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My wife of 35 years has been struggling with depression, fibromyalgia and arthritis.

If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars. Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement. Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down. Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids. Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13562","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Macaire Grambauer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has greatly enhanced my life by lifting my mood when I am going through a hard time without the need for pharmaceutical drugs which are often addictive and have side effects.

It has also replaced opiate pain medications on a few occasions where I had severe pain from recurring throat infections.  I was becoming dependent on the opiates and found kratom to be as effective but not addictive.

I have had no mental, emotional, or physical consequences due to Kratom and therefore do not think this wonderful herb is any kind of threat to public saftey. I was in a way saved by this wonderful plant and fear that without it the quality of my life would take a downhill roll. Though I would hope that this alone may sway the reader towards a pro kratom stance, my quality of life is not my major concern, but instead that of my childrens.I have always been uncomfortable in social situations where there are large crowds and become so extremely anxious I have to force myself through every second feeling awkward and withdrawn. This on its own though less than ideal would not be as bad if I did not have the large family of 5 that I work everyday (4*10 hr days a week + every spear moment of my time I dedicate to my children) to support. Three of these children are school aged and this means sports and open houses. In these setting there is inevitably an abundance of people and social situations I have to go through. Kratom has made these not just bearable, but enjoyable. I get to be a parent who sits in the front row untouched by my anxiety instead of paralyzed by it in the back row. Yes I know I could probably go get some kind of prescription drug, and after several months of this and that maybe a new solution, but I would never be comfortable taking pills again after highschool seeing so many friends that are now in rehabs or prisons for there prescription drug abuse. I have sat through wrestling tournaments, cheer competitions, and football games with the help of this plant.

My son who was your classic football/baseball player with lots of potential. He worked part-time at a local restaurant and began to buy pills from people at work. Once this was found out we were able to get him out of that environment to a more healthy part time job. Well my son began to take Kratom because the Indian/Pakistani ran Marathon gas stations and head shops said it was good for him and \"Natural\". We were oblivious to the Kratom addiction for a good year. The only thing we saw was he was always broke and needed money for gas. Over this year our son began to have extreme mood swings. Kratom turned my son into a Zombie in one year. His addiction to this caused him to burn threw his savings account of about 8,000 dollars as well as his paychecks. My son was making 17.00 an hour and was lucky to have .50 cents to his name by the next paycheck. (He lived at home and his only bill was the gas it took to drive to work)\n\nMy son began to exhibit mood disorders such as chronic insomnia with manic tendencies when he was on kratom and when he was off kratom he would go into severe angry depressive stupors with lots of nausea. He began to lie about everything and resorted to sealing my wife's jewelry and my garage power tools to pay for his addiction. Just before my son went into rehab he would have to go to the store to buy a foil packet of Matrix/Kratom just to get through his shift at work. He also began to complain constantly that he was in pain yet nothing was wrong with him. It was just the withdraw symptoms of the Kratom. Work would regularly drug test my son but because Kratom is a synthetic he would always show clean. (It wasn't until later that we found out you had to test specifically for Kratom. And to make matters worse Kratom was and is still legal. \n\nThe reason that the head shops and gas stations don't want to ban this is because they are making a huge profit. A single serving of the Matrix brand of Kratom which is a foil packet with 4-5 pills in it is purchased off the internet for $3.00-$4.00 a packet and sold for $20.00 - $25.00 retail. This 400%-500% profit is the sole reason that the head shops and gas stations call is a natural healthy way to fight pain. Its nothing but greed. Don't be mistaken Kratom is just as addictive as Heroin but just doesn't have the same analgesic strength as Heroin. \n\nIn short Kratom has no business on the retail market. It is just as addictive as heroin and will result in kratom \"Zombies\" if it continues to be allowed in stores. The businesses that want to keep it legal for retail could care less about who buy's it. They are in it for the 400% - 500% profit that they are making by selling it. Kratom causes the same withdraw symptoms as Heroin. I have been a police officer for 10yrs now and the symptoms my son exhibited being on kratom are the same as any heroin addict I run across on the street. It will not help you get off of Heroin it will only delay your recovery by keeping you dependent.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0781","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Johnson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI have been using kratom for over year now.

I have found it to be safe, inexpensive, and to be virtually without adversse side effects. \n\nI am a 47 year old man who has chronic arthritis in my left knee due to a failed ACL implant surgery. Due to this surgery I have a broken fibula bone that never healed (non-union). Also I have a torn rotator cuff in my right shoulder. I have used prescription pain medicines before, but because of the expensive cost of these meds, and the side effects, including dependency, I have had to stop using these medications. \n\nI discovered Kratom a year ago and was so happy to have found something natural, safe, and inexpensive that I could use to relieve my chronic pain. \n\nBefore using Kratom, I had researched Kratom extensively, inquiring for scientific reports on Kratom as well as personal testimonies from Kratom users as well as from those who are critical of Kratom. I decided to try Kratom for pain relief based on my research. \nSince then, I have been so very pleased with the results I get from using Kratom. I have had no adverse issues whatsoever from regularly using Kratom. In fact, not only has kratom helped with my chronic pain, but it has also been a wonderful sleep aid (I also have mild insomnia). \n\nI am a mature, responsible law abiding citizen, who is employed full time, and the proud father of two sons who are adult now. I have no interest in using illicit drugs, nor do I abuse alcohol or any other substances. I simply find Kratom to be a useful aid in my struggle to manage my physical pain, and it works for me. To have Kratom taken away from me would be terrible and counter productive as far as my pain management is concerned. \nFor the government to ban Kratom is totally unjustified! Kratom is safe and can in no way be compared to the \"legal\" drugs out there that are far and away more dangerous than Kratom! \n\nPlease do not take Kratom away from those of us who are being helped by it! The science is clear enough that it is safe, non-addicting, and non-lethal! Especially in comparison to other pain medicines, tobacco, alcohol et al. The benefits of Kratom out weigh any slight side effects that are sometimes associated with using it.
