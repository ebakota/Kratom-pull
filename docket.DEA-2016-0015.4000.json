After consuming just one 'tea' (containing approximately 3 grams of Kratom), my pain was so reduced I was able to walk several blocks without stopping, and I remember every single second of it...something that didn't always happen with the pain meds I was prescribed, as they often numbed my mental faculties as well as the physical pain.\n\nAs I only started consuming kratom recently, I was extremely disappointed to learn of the DEA's intent to make this plant a Schedule 1 item, on the 'no medical value' list with things like Heroin or Cocaine. \nI'm happy to know that the FDA & other government agencies are in the middle of several joint studies of this natural plant with big-name universities in regards to it's use in replacing opiates as a pain reliever, thereby reducing the incredible opiate epidemic taking over the country.\n\n\n\nRegards,\nJim D.

I was also on muscle relaxers for my back although those were pretty mild.  I randomly saw a post once on social media for a friend of mine who had injured herself somehow and someone recommended kratom, thus starting my research.  Everything I read was positive so after researching trusted vendors I made a purchase.  That was the best decision I've ever made, because getting on kratom and finding the right dosage for myself enabled me to completely get off all narcotics and the muscle relaxers I was on, with hardly any withdrawal.   \n\nI've been on kratom for approximately 1 year now and the reason it's the best decision I have made is because it has given me my life back.  I was an addict when I was on hydrocodone and tramadol.  It got so bad that the amount I was prescribed wasn't enough so I sought it out illegally as well.  I was taking enormous amounts each day, taking out credit cards so I could get the cash back option, cashing in my 401K so I could have money to buy my drugs.  I put my family, my new child in peril by taking away our monetary safety net.  I couldn't see that I was an addict until I ran out of money and was forced to look at myself closely in the mirror.  Thankfully that's the same time that I found kratom.  \n\nI experience(d) no rush, no 'high' when taking kratom.  The only thing it does for me is it takes away my pain, helps with anxiety I have, and gives me a bit of energy if I'm especially tired, or at night I can take a different strain and it helps calm me down and allows me to sleep all night.  \n\nTaking kratom has not only allowed me to take control of my life again by getting off prescription pills, but it has significantly increased my quality of life.  I don't know what I would do if it were banned.  The idea of it being banned is absurd anyway as there is no basis for doing so.  The United States government needs to back off with their 'controls' and stop trying to dictate to the American people what is good for them.  We're not children.  We are adults who are trying to better our lives for ourselves, our children & families, and society.  Keeping kratom legal is in our best interest.  Thank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5667","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I know multiple people that Kratom has helped quit and control cravings for dangerous opiates including oxycodone and heroin.

We have an increasing prescription and narcotic opiate abuse epidemic in this country, as you know.

I have been under VA care for many years. I was recently accepted into the Veteran's Choice Program. I thank congress for enabling me from having to drive 150 or 250 miles roundtrip to see a doctor. I now travel 60 to see my infectious disease specialist. I suffer from acute neuropathic pain in my lower extremities. I was prescribed opioids for years such as Percocet and Vicodin. It worked on the pain okay but tolerance to these medicines became greater and greater to the point my whole life revolved around my next dose. I finally had had enough stopped all opioids. I was sick for 6 months from withdrawal from that horrible medicine. Pulling my hair out trying to find some way to treat my pain I came across Kratom. It is a wonder drug. It is actually more effective than the opioids in treating my pain. Just as importantly I have experienced no side effects including that loopy type feeling I would get taking opioids. I have noticed no tolerance issues or withdrawal symptoms. Why the DEA would choose to put this substance on a list that would make it illegal is beyond  my comprehension and sensibilities. Actually, I find it a bit outrageous. There are thousands if not millions of people in our country that suffer from acute and chronic pain that need to manage it effectively and safely. Opioids are not the answer. Kratom is, especially for those of us that would like to function normally every day. I appreciate your time and consideration in this matter.

Have seen people who could barely get out of bed for years and then with the help of kratom are now living very normal lives.\nI personally have been suffering from a auto imunne disorder for 6 years. I have been using kratom to give myself energy and to help with inflammation from my condition. Before kratom i slept all day and my children didnt want to spend any time with me. Now they come and spend every week end with me and we go hiking and swimming and camping...all the things i live for.\nIm truly grateful for the benefits i receive from this plant and beg of you to not schedule kratom and to allow further research by the fda and keep it available to those who need it. I think that kratom has gotten a bad name because of extracts and adulterated versions of it be made by companies trying to sell legal highs. I think that the kratom industry needs to be regulated by the fda and that only pure unadultarated leaf be allowed to be sold. I dont feel any addiction from kratom. I take it for a few weeks strait and then usually take a few days off to help it remain effective. When i dont take it im not in withdrawals, i just feel the same pain and chronic fatigue that i was experiencing before Kratom...i think if the fda was forced to make fair regulations for kratom to be sold as a supplement and sold with accurate discaimers then it would dratically reduce public health risk. I also know many people who used to kratom to quit painkillers and even heroin and if a plant can do that. I think it should be available to those who need it. Opiates like heroin and oxycontin are killing people in our country at an alarming rate and i think america needs every tool available.

I heard it was all natural, had anti-anxiety and pain relieving properties, and most important - I heard it had saved hundreds of thousands of lives by helping people to overcome opiate and benzodiazepine (sp?) addictions and get their lives back! I have three children who I love more than anything and they deserved to have their mother back; I deserved to have MYSELF back. So I did some research, and I went to the store and purchased some.

I started using Kratom a number of years ago as a safe alternative to prescription pain killers after an injury to my back. I was taking a drug called Vicodin and quickly became addicted to it; suffered a number of undesirable side effects and had a great deal of difficulty with withdraws once I realized I was physically addicted.\n\nAfter reading an article on the benefits of Kratom, I tried it. I have since incorporated it into my daily routine and dose just enough each day to relieve chronic pain. Kratom is currently legal in the state where I reside. Other positive effects of Kratom, as I experience them, are more energy, greater ability to focus throughout the day and added nutrients. There have been times I have had to stop taking Kratom - I would describe the \"withdraw symptoms\" akin to caffeine withdraw.\n\nI honestly have no idea whatsoever why an agency who has much bigger fish to fry is interested in scheduling Kratom. I have read that the premise for this initiative is based on public safety. Should that be the premise, I think that there is much more evidence to schedule alcohol; a substance known to kill thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of people a year. Or perhaps the DEA's efforts and resources may be better allocated in monitoring doctors and pharmaceutical companies who routinely over prescribe dangerous drugs like Vicodin. \n\nSince learning of the DEA's intent to schedule Kratom, I have grown more suspicious and wary of government over-reach in my life. I question the integrity and motives of government agencies, like the DEA, because it seems that the freedoms I once enjoyed in this Democratic society are slowly eroding. I wonder what \"public safety\" initiative is next...taking away the freedom to choose for myself; by a government who is much busier policing those who don't need it than those who do.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3209","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The issue at hand is safety.

Unfortunately, although my herniation was fixed, my back started to deteriorate, and I also now have Lupus, and various other health problems that affect all of my joints.  For eight years, my doctors were able to prescribe the pain meds I needed to keep the worst of my pain at bay.  Starting in 2014, my highly educated pain management doctors (doctorates in anesthesiology & pharmacy, as well as multiple board certifications) became terrified because of threats from the DEA, so my doses were cut by 2/3 because someone who doesn't know me, my medical history, and probably isn't even a doctor decided what my doses/meds could and could not be.  Starting four months ago, the DEA threatened my doctors again, and I have had my meds cut again, more each month for the past four months despite my pain not being alleviated in the first place. \n\nLuckily for me, I discovered kratom ten months ago, so I have found a safe alternative to help me.  Ironically, after I found something cheap, safe, and legal to help with my pain, after my doctors stopped being allowed to properly manage their patients' pain, the DEA tried to ban it.  When our country is gripped by a huge heroin/overdose problem, partially because pain patients have been cut off from help by people who aren't their doctors, they suggested banning one of the few things that can help - a leaf that has never caused any deaths, and is actually safer than drinking too much water.  Please help people who are in pain and allow kratom to remain unscheduled.  It's safer than ANY pharmaceutical in existence. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7295","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-26T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"N R","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Stop the war on all drugs, abuse is a health care problem, not criminal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2642","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephen Nickels","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Warren Vanhook.

I am writing to oppose the scheduling or any restriction of the herb known as kratom.\n\nI have been using kratom for the past five years for chronic pain and depression. By doing so, I have been able to eliminate taking over the counter or prescription pain medications and antidepressants and the side effects with said medications. There were many days I could not function due to pain and/or depression and in that sense kratom has given my life back. I feel the most important aspect of kratom is it has eliminated all desire to consume alcohol and I have not done so in the past five years since adding kratom to my daily supplements.\n\nI use one teaspoon of kratom, once to twice per day when needed. I only use plain whole leaf variety not extracts. I have found it to be the most effective as a pain reliever and without any side effects such as dizziness or drowsiness. In fact the amount I take there is a noticeable increase in energy and allows me to function whether at work or taking care of children at home. I have never had any negative or adverse reactions with kratom use. As well, if I discontinue kratom use I am able to do so without adverse reactions, unlike prescription pain relievers and antidepressants where decreasing dosages was needed to avoid withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn summary, I am opposed to any scheduling, restriction or ban of kratom.In my personal experience I have found kratom to be a safe and effective herbal supplement.

They work, they raise kids, they endure & function in spite of what they deal with. \n\nI know the DEA doesn't give a shit about Kratom, It is not a public health threat. A customer of mine called the DEA's Miami Bureau & asked how we was supposed to dispose of his Kratom stock on September 30th when the ban was to take place. Should he burn it, take it to the dump or surrender it to the DEA in Miami. The DEA Agents response was \" What's Kratom?\" My guess is FDA called in a favor to DEA to ban a plant that was negatively effecting the bottom line of FDA's Big Pharma private benefactors.  I am confident history will confirm this theory as fact. \n\nRegardless, please remember when you are gone all you will be remembered by is what stands you took. Did you stand up for those in need or did you walk away?\n I will do what ever I can to get the those in need access to Kratom if it make their lives more manageable. I don't want blood on my hands,\n\nPlease look at the scientific studies on Kratom from unbiased sources, \nPlease look up  the increase in opiod overdose deaths in  Indiana( deemed a synthetic drug &  banned in 2012) & Tennessee ( banned 2013) \n  I hate funerals , especially when a old person is not in the box. Imagine what a child would give to have their Daddy back or a Father their son. Please keep unfettered access to Kratom to the American public.\nThank you for your time,\nBDR","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15392","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Del Rey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing this comment to express my opposition to the DEA's proposed decision to place alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, two constituents of the kratom plant on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.\n\n\tOn January of 2013, I sustained a spinal injury that left me partially incapacitated and unable to return to my job as a social worker. Fortunately, I was able to receive temporary medical treatment through my employer's workers' compensation insurance. I visited a pain management doctor, underwent MRIs, and was given pain medication to manage my condition; however, the medication did not work effectively. They did very little for the pain and only left me feeling tired and disoriented. I also noticed that they were extremely addictive. Aside from taking medication, the doctor recommended I receive cortisol/steroidal injections to treat my pain, but the relief was short lived, and I was unable to return to my normal way of life. A few months later I was informed that my workers' compensation would not be covering any more of my medical treatments or expenses because they blamed my injury on a pre-existing condition. I was devastated. I tried to appeal, but to no avail. I had no work, no medical insurance and no options. There were days that my pain was so unbearable that I could not get out of bed. But even on my \"good days,\" I could not function normally. I began to search for alternatives, and this is when I first heard of kratom. My family convinced me to try it. I researched everything I could before deciding to finally try it. Because of my religious faith and views, the most important thing for me was that it not make me feel intoxicated. Ironically, the drugs the doctor prescribed were constantly making me feel just that, even though he assured me that they would not. The first time I tried kratom, it was very helpful and provided much needed physical relief on my spinal condition. I was able to sleep better and felt refreshed upon waking. The greatest part was that I did not feel physically or mentally sluggish anymore. I felt like I could function normally again, which I thought was amazing! I have been using kratom now for a little over a year and it has been most effective in helping me manage my condition.  I am able to work almost full time again (about 5-6 hours a day), which is a blessing, and I feel like my life is getting back on track. It would be very difficult for me if I did not have this option to help myself, and there are thousands of people who have similar stories like mine who would be negatively impacted if kratom becomes illegal. Thank you for your time and attention.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nDavid J Trevio","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15601","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Trevino","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If the DEA is truly interested in the welfare of the American populous, do not make Kratom schedule one.

I am 35 years old and a father, husband, homeowner, and tax-paying citizen. I work for a tech company creating training materials and assisting new accounts with migrating their services. I am also a composer of music for film, video games, advertising, and other media. I have a Bachelors degree from Berklee College of Music where I graduated Summa Cum Laude.\n\nI am a recovering opioid addict, and when I take kratom, I do not feel any urges to use opioids whatsoever. It is also a tremendous relief for my social anxiety, which I have suffered from for over 20 years, and for mild-to-moderate sciatic pain. While opioids certainly made me feel high and gave me stronger pain relief, they just didn't help me feel good about myself in the way kratom does. Opioids feel intoxicating; I don't feel like myself on them. Also, I have to keep increasing my dose on opioids and am always thinking about ways to get more, despite the disastrous consequences I am putting myself and my family at risk for.\n\nWith kratom, I don't want to get high anymore. Kratom makes me feel better about myself without feeling high. According to a recent survey of over 6,000 kratom users, only 2% believe you can get high from kratom (www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2016/9/18/kratom-users-say-ban-will-lead-to-more-drug-abuse). Kratom allows me to do the things I need to do  be a father, be a husband, get my work done, be more social, and I don't feel like I need more of it. I can be okay with taking just enough to feel its subtle effects and live my life without obsessing over it. There is a mild physical dependency that develops after using it daily for a few weeks, but I believe the physical dependency is comparable to a large coffee habit. By taking kratom, I feel as though I am retraining my brain to be less of an addict. It is a wonderful plant, and it has prevented me from relapsing and destroying my life.\n\nIn the DEAs notice of its intent to schedule kratom, it was stated that there have been 15 kratom-related deaths in the past two years, but as NPR has reported, fourteen of the 15 people also had other drugs or illegal substances in their systems (www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/09/12/493295493/kratom-advocates-speak-out-against-proposed-government-ban). There is not one recorded death in the US where the cause was only kratom. With this in mind, I do not believe kratom qualifies as an imminent hazard to public safety, as the DEA described.\n\nAnother statistic that was mentioned was that 660 calls were made to poison control centers regarding kratom over the past five years. Taken out of context, this may sound like a lot, but in reality this is a small amount of calls, especially when compared to opioid painkillers or even over-the-counter painkillers such as Tylenol. Vitamins receive more calls to US poison control centers per year than kratom, and they are generally considered extremely safe (https://aapcc.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/annual_reports/2014_AAPCC_NPDS_Annual_Report.pdf).\n\nI appreciate that the DEA recognized that kratom is not suitable for emergency placement onto Schedule I and has withdrawn their intent to do so. However, I believe placing kratom into any schedule of the Controlled Substances Act would be a huge mistake and could be detrimental to many citizens and business in this country. If scheduled, many Americans who are using kratom safely and responsibly will lose access to it immediately. Some will return to harder drugs and may overdose and die.\n\nIf the DEA still intends to schedule kratom, the onus will be on them to demonstrate the danger of kratom to the public to warrant scheduling. Given the relative safety of kratom, as evidenced by the data and medical studies currently available, and numerous accounts of people who are currently using it, I believe it is clear that scheduling kratom is not the appropriate course of action. Also, as a controlled substance, research into kratom would become difficult for doctors and scientists to pursue, and we may never know the true potential of this plant to help America's opioid addicts and chronic pain sufferers.\n\nOne thing the DEA and kratom community agree on is that further research is needed on this plant and its alkaloids. The vast majority of kratom users are in favor of regulation by the FDA as a dietary supplement. We don't want to see it in gas stations and smoke shops, advertised as a legal high. We don't want it sold to minors. We want better testing and standards for alkaloid content, dosage, and labeling. But given the plants current widespread use by responsible adults and safety record, placing it onto any schedule of the Controlled Substances Act is not warranted. Kratom should remain legal without a prescription and be further researched and regulated by the FDA.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4743","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Poit","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom  is a much safer alternative to heroin and prescription drugs .

Kratom should remain legal and NOT be added to the list of schedule 1 substances.  Kratom is an herbal supplement that many responsible people have used to alleviate a myriad of maladies.\n\nI first discovered Kratom about six years ago.  I was in the grips of a nasty addiction to  alcohol, benzodiazepines, and prescription opioids, and was going broke trying to support my habit and keep withdrawl symptoms at bay.  I read many online anecdotal reports of Kratom helping people taper themselves off  the types of drugs.  After some trial and error, I was able to successfully ween myself off prescription opioids using Kratom.  I believe that had I not discovered Kratom, I may have moved on to a much cheaper and much more dangerous drug.  \n\nKratom has eliminated my cravings for alcohol, and has alleviated the anxiety for which the benzodiazepines were originally prescribed.  Thanks to Kratom, my quality of life has dramatically improved since I was able to stop drinking, and get off all prescription drugs.   \n\nOur country in in the midst of an opiate epidemic, and people should have as many options as possible to help themselves get well.  Limited beds in rehab facilities and expensive maintenance drugs are a roadblock to many people.  Easy access to Kratom should remain an option for those that seek it out.  More research needs to be done on the medicinal benefits of this amazing plant, and that will be almost impossible if it is scheduled.  I implore you to listen to the overwhelming anecdotal evidence that this plant helps many more people than it harms.

About ten years ago I was scheduled for surgery and cancelled it days before because of the circus-like antics leading up to the surgery, the vast number of doctors and testing I was put through so that the surgeon would be covered in case I died on the table. It was a very unpleasant and frightening experience and took away any residual confidence I had in the medical profession, which did not seem to have my best interests at heart.\nMy GP prescribed a low dose of Percocet (10mg/day) which was totally adequate to allow me to live a normal, productive life without surgery. Some days I would need nothing and took nothing. About six years ago, upon stopping in to pick up a prescription, I was handed a jar to urinate in and told it was to make sure I was really taking my drug and not selling it and to make sure I wasn't using illegal drugs. It is a very insulting and demeaning situation to be put in. I found a new doctor who treated me for five years before leaving the practice and I was \"handed off\" to the new partner. On my first visit, before even meeting the new doctor, the nurse stuck a test strip in my mouth to \"make sure I was really taking my medicine\" and handed me a two page \"contract\" detailing drug testing (at my expense, by the way) and told by the doctor, \"this is for MY protection, not yours\". \nAbout this time I came across Kratom and decided to try it out. It really worked great, was uplifting rather than depressing and doesn't make you sleepy. The pain - killing effect was even superior to Percocet and can be bought CHEAPLY and delivered right to your home, with no interference from interested outsiders who want a share of the spoils, no insurance companies, no doctors, no AMA, no drug companies. Since that time, I put away my unused Percocet and use the Kratom when I need relief, which is not even daily! \nIt would be a great miscarriage of justice to limit this herb so that drug companies can develope a pharmaceutical from it and then force you into this corrupt medical system of control. There would be no money in it if people could still buy the natural form and that seems like the impetus for this government agency to ban it.\nBy all means, do research on this promising natural substance, use that to inform people rather than coerce them and let those who prefer a refined pharmaceutical get it through their physician and pharmacy and leave the rest of us to use the natural gifts of the world as we see fit and as people have used it for hundreds if not thousands of years. \n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21153","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Asher Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nPlease do not ban Kratom.\n\nThese are the reasons why you should not.\n\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nThank you for your consideration,\n\nMeredith Priestley\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14019","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Meredith Priestley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me deal with other addictions.

In 2007 I ruptured my achilies tendon playing tennis.  After many months of pain and rehab I found myself addicted to prescription painkillers.  At the time I had just started a family and was very optimistic about the future.  Needless to say the addiction changed all that.  I lost my job my spouse and almost my kids.  Long story short I discovered kratom on the internet.  It was an overnight lifesaver.  It curbed my addiction, anxiety and pain almost instantly.  Five years later I'm still using kratom.  I've had my new job for just a little over seven years and will be continuing my education to improve my family's wellbeing.  Kratom has been a godsend.  \nJust a little background information about myself.  I'm a white male forty six years old with a BS in business administration from an accredited University.  I've never been worried that kratom would hurt me.  If you happen to take too much all you get is a little dizzy and an upset stomach.  I had a physical a few months ago and my blood work and blood pressure were the best they've been in years.  I would recommend kratom to anyone with addiction issues as well as social anxiety and general fatigue.  Kratom has without a doubt improved the overall quality of my life.  The reason for remaining anonymous is obvious.  I don't want the DEA kicking mine and my kids door in if you decide to make kratom illegal.  Especially since I haven't even gotten as much as a speeding ticket in 25 years.\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12001","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been a lifesaver and really significantly decreases \nThe pain in my shoulders and joints.

Like my husband, I have been plagued by depression for my adult life.  Kratom has cured this for me.  I can enjoy moments now.  Not because it makes me feel good but because it makes me feel normal. It eliminates my mental illness.  I can't understand why it is being banned.  It is akin to coffee in as far as the stimulating effect.\n\nI heard about kratom on a depression forum and for the past few years I've taken it regularly.  Almost daily.  With no addiction or withdrawal!  I hear these words thrown around on occasion but, at least in my case, this hasn't been my experience and I got kratom from the same place everyone else does.\n\nI appreciate that we can talk this out as reasonable people would before countless people are given the label 'criminal'.  Most people who take supplements like kratom believe there should be some regulation.  We don't want children effected and we need to prevent toxins or impure products from getting into the kratom.  We need the DEA and FDA help for that.  But a ban would only consign so many suffering people to a terrible existence of illnesses, pain or risky perscriptions.\n\nThank you for considering my comment.\n\nBest Regards,\nRL","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2949","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My father takes kratom for his knee and ankle arthritis.

Ritalin gave me the jitters, intense anxiety, heart palpitations, and frequent urination to the point where I legitimately believed I'd have renal failure. With Kratom, I do not experience any of this. At worse, cotton mouth. I'm able to focus and concentrate much better as well as a slight energy boost akin to that of coffee which compliments very well. I also don't get the terrible amphetamine comedowns where I crash and my entire body feels weak and disgusting.\n\nKratom saved my body from being poisoned by amphetamines on a frequent basis (I use it for every school day). With Kratom, I find myself needing much less stimulants in my body. This is the perfect alternative to my prescription medications, and it should be my right as an American citizen of this beautiful country to choose what to put into my body as medicine. Kratom has more than stimulant medicinal purposes, but for my usage I'm strictly talking about white veins and under three grams of dosing.\n\nPeople like me would be forced to go with their more expensive, a lot more addictive, and damaging medications should Kratom be illegal. I do not want to go back to Concerta, Ritalin, Adderall, or any of those. I want to continue utilizing Kratom in my medicine regime, as it fits perfectly and at a frequency that's comfortable for me. Twice a week maximum for about a few months and I've noticed no physical issues as I would with prescribed amphetamines.\n\nThank you for listening to my story.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0247","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mister Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has kept me off opiates please consider the weight of your decision .

I am a physical therapist and have worked in healthcare for my entire adult career.  This background has helped me to research my own condition and be able to read scientific journals and other medical texts that pertain to my condition. \n\nSince adolescence I have had Periodic Limb Movement Disorder, which is a cousin of Restless Legs Syndrome- essentially I have frequent involuntary movements at night that interfere with my ability to get restful sleep.  These movements were first detected by a formal sleep study when I was 17 years old.  At that time the treatment offered was klonopin which I tried; however, it resulted in greater fatigue during the day; therefore, I stopped it.  Over the next 18 or so  years I managed my fatigue coffee and intermittently used  Ambien- which only helped a little. \n\nIn my late 30's I consulted with another sleep doctor at Harvard and had another sleep study which again showed frequent involuntary movements.  I was given Mirapex and Provigil to help manage the fatigue.  This cocktail proved to be extremely effective and eventually I didn't even need the Provigil as the Mirapex was so effective in controlling my movements. \nUnfortunately,  after about 4 or 5 years the Mirapex stopped working so well.  I believe that I was beginning to have what is called \"Augmentation\" from the Mirapex, which is a known side effect of the dopamine agonists.  My sleep and movements worsened and I went back to see the sleep specialist who then tried a variety of other pharmaceuticals,  (Horizant, Gabapentin, Restoril), Dilautid, and Morhpine).  I found that most of these pharmaceuticals didn't control the movements very well and the side effects were very difficult to manage-  a hangover in the morning, fatigue, depression, irritability, and overall compromised executive function.  The opiates initially worked well but after a couple of weeks they didn't work well.  Both my doctor and I were hesitant to increase the dose given the issues with tolerance and dependence.\n\nAt this point I was getting desperate I was having difficulty working and the fatigue made it difficult to live a normal life.  I started researching online and stumbled a well-known forum for Restless Legs and that is where I first learned about Kratom.  I did extensive research- searching Medline and other online resources and read as much as I possible could about it, including the available scientific journal articles. I decided to try it.  \n\nWhen I started Kratom, I had just weaned myself off of Mirapex because I was \"augmenting\" to the Mirapax- in other words it was making my condition worse.  Getting off of Mirapex was extremely difficult- there is even a diagnosis called \"Dopamine Agonist Withdrawal Syndome.\"  Thankfully I was between jobs because for a few weeks I was only sleeping a couple of hours per night and my movements were drastically increased (my wife had to sleep in another bed).  When I started the Kratom I was able to sleep almost through the night.   Eventually I was able to determine that I needed just a little more at about 3am and that combined with a dose before bed allowed me to sleep through the night.  \n\nKratom has been a gamechanger for me- it controls my movements better than any of the pharmaceuticals.   I only use it at night and have not had issues with tolerance and haven't had to change my dose.  Online I had read that one can get addicted if it is used daily.  On more than one occasion I have stopped it cold turkey and had no symptoms of dependence.  \n\nFor me the only side effect is a little drowsiness in the morning.  As a health care professional who serves  my community and as an American, I would please urge the DEA to reconsider it stance on Kratom.   While there certainly people out there who abuse this substance-  there are also people who abuse all kinds of other substances.  I am not sure what will happen to me if I don't have access to this substance.  I should not have to suffer because of a very small number of people who abuse this.  Thank you for your consideration. \n\nThank you for your consideration,\n\nAnonymous","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15817","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have two dear friends who had been struggling for years with their opiate addictions.

I have yet to experience any negative side effects.   I am also experiencing early perimenopause.  Kratom helps with the pain associated with twice monthly periods.  I am more productive and have not missed work due to a migraine since taking this medication.   Please reconsider scheduling This Is A Dangerous Drug.  It has given me my life back.

I moved away from this plaque in my life early, so remained addiction free for most of my life.\n About 19 years ago I broke my back (L1 compression fracture) skydiving. I was prescribed Vicodin and Percocet for months for the pain, and found myself fully addicted. I took whatever I could get my hands of for years, ordering them easily over the Internet. My life was spiraling out of control.\n About 3 years into the addiction I found myself at a crossroads. I needed to stop this behavior or I was going to die like so many of my friends. I read through various online forums about kratom. I ordered some, and within 2 months I was, and still am, opiate free. Kratom reversed the withdrawal symptoms and miraculously made it so I no longer wanted or needed opiates.\nI now live a healthy and substantial life.\n I have personally helped people with Kratom for their opiate addiction through the years. Kratom is no less than a miracle cure for opiate addiction to me. \n Making Kratom a schedule 1 drug is beyond insane.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10410","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Barry Shepherd","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Folks at the DEA,\nI would like you to imagine for a moment that you have a son, age 5, who begins to have more and more mysterious migraine headaches, extreme exhaustion and lethargy, and general pain.\n\n Imagine it gets worse year by year and no doctor has the slightest idea what to do.  \n\nImagine you come in and see your 7 year old holding a knife to his own temple because he feels so terrible all the time. \nDiagnosed with fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue, at age 9 he goes on opioid pain killers full time.\n\nImagine it gets worse than that, year by year until he can no longer attend school after 7th grade and has to educate himself.  \n\nThe doctors have NOTHING except dope . \n\nHe can barely manage taking one class per term at a junior college because the pain killers exhaust and depress him, rob him of any energy to move forward. He has to withdraw even from that.  Even that much takes all his energy.\n\nThen he finds Kratom.  It does not always take away all the pain but it gives a lift and dulls pain to where he can function, write again, study, develop his skills as a video editor.  It is not a cure, but it allows him to live, if not normally, at least with some enjoyment of his life which he did not have before. \n\nAnd now you want to make it illegal because....???? No real reason.  I can only imagine the quid pro quo going on between this agency and pharmaceutical companies who want to have it all.  Yet another substitute that will cost thousands and thousands and work poorly if at all, like their cannabis copies.\n\nKratom helped my son do away with his dependence on opioid pain killers.  If you take that away,  he will have no choice but to go back to them, and he hates the very idea. With  the crackdown in prescriptions, more and more people will go to heroin on the street.   The combination of crackdown on pills and absence of Kratom will push heroin use and overdoses through the roof, whereas Kratom allows for an almost seamless transition off of drugs with  no withdrawal to speak of and no cravings.  And you  will make this illegal to satisfy whom?  That poor poster-mother who lost her son to a multiple illnesses and severe depression and numerous substances of which Kratom was only one? What kind of science is that?  I can show you thousands of cases exactly the opposite.  \n\nAnd perhaps that is the problem.  It is too good, and the right palms are not being  greased.  If so, all I can say, is I hope these stark choices arrive in your family some day and you have to confront them for yourselves with the people you love.  Will it take that for you to see and do what is right here? I pray that you are wiser than that.\n\nThank you,\nAmielle Zemach","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21574","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amielle Zemach","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi I'm John I'm 52 years old I've been using Kratom for aches and pains I've had most my life it's made my life a lot easier and without Kratom I don't know where I'd be probably with some doctor giving me pain pills which I do not want","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0993","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Bryant","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I urge you to consider: do we really need more people in prison over victimless crimes?

I'm nearly at a loss as to where to begin, particularly due to the lack of any veritable evidence that suggests Kratom poses imminent harm to the public. To the contrary, there appears to be veritable evidence that suggests imminent benefit to the public.\n\nI find it troubling that a law enforcement body has been granted legislative powers with minimal oversight. The old hillbilly heart of mine would call that having the fox watch the hen house. I mean no disrespect with that analogy, but it's a precarious position and a very slippery slope. The fact of the matter is that there are countless deadly substances that the DEA is already tasked with pursuing, and asking an entity without the scientific or medical background to make determinations about the threats or benefits of a substance, in addition to the enforcement of existing laws, is a bit much. I understand the history and the governmental actions that delineated those powers, but that does not make it right or efficient. It simply means they have yet to be placed under the microscope. Perhaps, there is no need for a review of the process, but I am quite certain that an attempt to ban a seemingly harmless leaf will make a review inevitable.\n\nI've had multiple friends die at the hands of addiction. It's not a badge of honor I wear. It's a constant reminder that I'm not always doing enough to help those whom I love the most. If there is the potential that Kratom could have saved one of those friends, then it warrants greater study. Placing it on Schedule 1 would make that study nearly impossible. \n\nWhenever someone, whether I care about that person that much or not, is prescribed an opiate painkiller by a practicing doctor, I plead with that person not to take it. That's how it starts all too often. We know, beyond any doubt, that prescription opiates are both addictive and deadly. I know, beyond any doubt, that Kratom is not deadly and no more addictive than coffee. If it has the potential to be an alternative to a pharmaceutical narcotic with deadly qualities, does it not merit a chance? \n\nI don't know when things reached the point where we currently reside. I'm talking about the point where I am told what natural substances I can and cannot put in my body. I understand the attempt to protect the public from manufactured narcotics. I don't always agree with the methodology, but I understand the intent. I will never understand the intent behind denying an individual the personal freedom of choosing to ingest a leaf, or bean or stick (if that's a person's thing). Forgive me for being crass for a moment, but it's not illegal for me to wipe my butt with poison ivy. That act would cause considerable damage, create medical cost and certainly impact my ability to work for a few days. Should we place poison ivy on Schedule 1?\n\nI live in Florida, and the Congress of Florida recently shot down a bill that would have banned Kratom. The lone argument the proponents of the bill had was that Kratom could POTENTIALLY make a heroin user relapse and start using heroin again. If that's logic, then I should have failed my logic class in college. If a person wants to use heroin, that decision will be made regardless of if he/she ingests Kratom, potatoes, dried rosemary or anything else. Should we stop giving diabetics insulin because it may encourage them to start consuming sugar again? That statement is sadly more logical. \n\nI use Kratom for anxiety. I am not addicted, and I do not use it every day. I do not consume alcohol or any other \"drugs.\" I have a prescription for a fairly potent anxiety medication, because my anxiety is rather severe. But, that medication carries with it grave harmful possibilities. I would much prefer to take something natural when the need arises. Something that has been in use for centuries with zero documented direct causal deaths. \n\nThere is information available, but it is apparent that it was never consulted. Please respect our freedoms, and please trust that the American people do know what is best for them at the end of the day.\n\nArticles:\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kratom-drug-ban-may-cripple-promising-painkiller-research/\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/16/what-its-like-to-be-high-on-kratom-according-to-the-people-who-use-it/?utm_term=.4f5461a8dad9\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22721","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zachary Covert","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to request that you don't put Kratom on the scheduled drug list.

It has helped so many people, including me, live healthy, happy, productive lives. I will briefly share my story and how Kratom has helped me: I went through a pretty traumatic relationship from age 17-20 and I started using drugs and alcohol to help me cope with the trauma. It got to where I had to be high or drunk just to get through the day. I took prescription painkillers and benzos, snorted cocaine and meth, took ecstasy, and drank almost every day. I made several attempts to get clean but I failed every time until I found Kratom. About a year ago a friend suggested that I try Kratom to get off of the drugs. She knew someone else who was using it to stay off of heroin and it was working wonders. I went to my local head shop the following day and bought some. Within 3 weeks of trying Kratom for the first time I was completely off of everything (including the alcohol). Not only does it keep me sober but it also keeps me clear headed  and focused. Kratom does not get the user \"high\" as it appears many may think. People who use Kratom are responsible functional adults who simply want a higher quality of life. Kratom helps people get off of illegal drugs but also pharmaceutical poison that is very dangerous, which brings me to my next point...There is nothing dangerous about Kratom. The DEA's reason for banning it cites roughly 600 calls to the poison control center and 14-15 Kratom related deaths in the last 6 years. None of those deaths were from Kratom alone. Every case had other toxic substances involved. There has never been an overdose from Kratom alone. And thousands and thousands of people died from prescription pills yet those are still given out like candy. This ban is not coming out of concern for the public. This ban is coming because Kratom is cutting into the profits of the pharmaceutical companies and alcohol companies. They do not want the public to have access to safe alternatives to their products. Agencies like the DEA and the FDA are supposed to work for us not big pharma. A Kratom ban in the midst of this opiate epidemic is the least safe course of action that could be taken. It will cause thousands of people to relapse into their old habits. The people who use Kratom as an alternative pain killer because they don't want to be on pharmaceutical poison will be doomed to a life of pain or be forced to go back on more dangerous medicines. This ban is not in the best interests of the public. I, along with thousands of others, am begging the DEA to stop this. Kratom is safer than any drug prescribed by a doctor and safer than any amount of alcohol. Banning Kratom would be an absolute disaster for the country. I appreciate your time and consideration and I look forward to Kratom staying legal and accessible to all Americans.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12867","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Meghan Leber","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 70 years old, still working and living a full life and have been hindered by arthritis pain in lower back and hips and stenosis discomfort across my back.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in economics from Penn State University. I was also dependent on heroin for 8 years. I got off heroin by switching to methadone for 4 years. The problem was, I couldn't stop using methadone. My life was stabilized and I was much happier, but going to the methadone clinic was far from ideal. It was a hassle, and it was degrading to have to pee in a cup every month in front of someone. And even though it cost less than heroin, it was still expensive at almost $500 a month. I also could not use insurance for the methadone clinic. I really wanted to stop using methadone, but the withdrawal was terrible. I heard that kratom made it possible to withdraw from opioids with much less suffering. I tried it, and it worked. It really is the physical suffering caused by withdrawal that kept me, and countless others, dependent on opioids. This drug helped me to finally free myself from opiods. I did not experience much withdrawal at all from kratom. It was very easy to taper down and stop using it. This is a substance which should be available to anyone who needs it. So many people are prevented from fully contributing to society because of opioid dependence or chronic pain. Kratom can help many of them. Please do not take this life saving drug away from Americans who need it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19704","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christine Ramsey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whomever it may concern,\n\nKratom is a valuable plant that absolutely should not be banned, especially under a schedule 1 classification. As you know, there have been thousands of firsthand accounts that can attest to the positive benefits of kratom. Not only that, but there are no known negative side effects that are truly harmful; I'll start there. At worst, there is irritability from not consuming it after regularly consuming it; not a big deal considering the same thing happens when one drinks coffee/other caffeinated beverages. Constipation is another potential negative side effect, though not serious, and can actually be beneficial to some: I have a good friend with Crohn's disease, and they use kratom to stay \"regular\". They have cut their bathroom visits in half since using kratom. Kratom is also an effective replacement for painkillers. Prescription painkillers cause a devastating amount of carnage for those addicted. Kratom could be used in lieu of these potentially dangerous drugs. Not only that, but if one is already addicted to a prescription opiate or heroin, kratom is known to help people end their dangerous addiction. Things like methadone and subaxone can be just as addicting as the drugs they are supposed to help keep the user off of. Also they are expensive. Kratom is cheap. There have been no long term studies showing that kratom is harmful, and immediately banning it would ensure their would be no studies. Finally, banning kratom wouldn't prevent people from finding it if they wanted it. The ban would create an additional revenue source for criminals on the black market. Do the right thing, and make sure kratom stays off the banned substances list!\n\nThank you for you're consideration on this matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20671","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Rachel, I'm a 41-year old woman from California working as a paralegal in Family Law.\n\nI'd like to voice my opposition to the Intent to Schedule the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, which would make Kratom (Mitragynaspeciosa), a schedule 1 controlled substance with no medicinal value. This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\nI discovered kratom 6 months ago while struggling with an alcohol addiction. Before I began using kratom I found I could quit drinking for a few weeks but the draw was always there and I struggled immensely with remaining sober. I am not a degenerate drunk. I am not a violent or aggressive drunk. I was a high-functioning drinker who has always had full time job, lived in a nice place, maintained a healthy social life, paid my bills and taxes, etc. The point being, the only one who really knew that I was an addict and slowly killing myself was me. A friend who had also been struggling with alcoholism introduced me to kratom as it was something that had worked for him. After years of trying and failing to remain sober kratom was the only thing I had found that helped. It didn't make me feel high or impede my daily life in any way. It did take away the cravings and ease the withdrawal symptoms. And I wasn't relying on a pharmaceutical, I had found a natural way to get healthy. \n\nAfter a few weeks I realized that not only was I not craving alcohol anymore but the anxiety disorder that had led to the heavy drinking in the first place was starting to dissipate. I had fewer panic attacks, felt less stressed, more confident, and overall happier in so many ways. The drinking was a problem I had battled for a few years, but the anxiety was something I was diagnosed with almost 20 years ago. And over that period of time I tried numerous anti depressants, individual therapy with multiple therapists, several types of group therapy and finally self medicating. And, again, kratom has been the only thing to help alleviate my symptoms. \n\nKratom means a happy life to me. It means a life free of irrational fear, free of dependency on unnatural pharmaceuticals, and freedom from addiction. Kratom means I can feel confident that I can get through the day without a panic attack or crushing anxiety. It means controlling my addiction instead of my addiction controlling me. \n\nKratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. I fear this action will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic, and at the very least will lead to so many people going back to the additions they have struggled to free themselves from. I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without kratom.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRachel Aloy","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4467","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rachel Aloy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"When I got endocarditis and pulmonary emboli, I decided I needed to quit shooting opiates.  Pills, fentanyl, the occasional dope.  I had only been an addict for about two years, but I had already messed \nup my life big time.  I spent like 4 or 5 months total in the hospital and nursing home.  There they treated me with tons of morphine and dilaudid, which I needed to breathe.  It was probably the most IV opiates I have ever had.  Eventually my illnesses got better and I was released to the world, with a nice referral to the methadone clinic.  \n\nbecause I am prescribed clonazepam, I got kicked out of the methadone clinic twice, immediately returning to heroin both times, because I was more addicted than I had ever been.  I tried constantly, but the suboxone urinalysis were impossible for me to get into, because their policy is you have to be clean from heroin to get into the suboxen program, I tried, but if I could make it through the first week of heroin withdrawals then I wouldn't need opioid replacements.  So I struggled with those options and heroin for two more years.    \n\nI quit using heroin two years ago when my fiancee died.  I was clean for two months when I started craving and was positive I would relapse... Methadone clinics are full of junkies that just want to supplement their addiction in my experience, there was a huge risk for sudden discontinuation, which certainly would have led me back to heroin or killed me with my heart problems. (*1) suboxone gives me panic attacks (*2), and Narcotics Anonymous and therapy just makes me depressed and want to use again (because I have OCD, Major Recurrent Depression, Panic Disorder and general Anxiety, and more).  Even therapy was useless because the OCD interferes with it.  \n\nSo, two months after my fiancee died, Following advice from my psychiatrist, John Seymour Howland, Md., I have been, for two years, taking opoid replacement therapy.  Instead of traditional methadone/suboxen drugs, which, as I mentioned, have intolerable side effects and social implications detrimental to my recovery, I have been taking kratom ever since.  I drink it with water about three times a day.  It doesn't make me high, there is no euphoria from this herbal remedy.  It works similar to suboxone by not activating all 5 of the opoid receptors in our brain.  (*3).  \n\nI have had no ill effects, and full relief from my opiate cravings, without the debilitating high or withdrawl effects.  To be honest, there are withdrawl effects, but they are barely noticeable. Maybe slightly watery eyes for a few days.  I buy kratom from USA vendors only.  I think it is a critical dietary supplement for our country, and if it needs to be taxed because it comes from overseas, so be it, but it does not need to be scheduled.  I like the state laws that were recently passed, limiting kratom purchase to 18+ aged individuals.  Kratom should come with literature including its ancient origins and instructions like to not mix with certain drugs or alcohol, since the only times people have died involving kratom were mainly due to complications from something else.  Kratom is safe when used properly, and if I had a child with chronic pain I would want him or her to eat kratom herb instead of take dangerous pharmaceutals.  My elderly mother said that she would eat kratom instead of take drugs from doctors if she was in pain.  Remember, this drug saved me from heroin relapse.  Relapse killed my fiance.  Do the right thing and let the states keep their momentum in regulating this herbal supplement.\n\nSincerely,\nRichard J Howard\n\n*source needed\n(1) www.news-journalonline.com/news/20130420/methadone-treatment-raises-questions-about-profit-motive-patient-care\n(2)suboxonetalkzone.com/are-you-anxious-are-you-sure/\n(3)https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18259963","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21775","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Howard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helped me taper away from opiates and get my life back on track.

So far, I haven't read any secret documents stating the muscle & money given to these government organizations (DEA,FDA) that are behind the ban on God given plants that aren't addictive or harmful.  But as long as these drug companies  keep making addicting drugs like Fentanyl Patches, Oxycotin, etc. that's highly addictive and is killing so many from overdoses, natural pain relievers such as Kratom & Marijuana, will continue to be demonized and many will be incarcerated for non-violent crimes in conjunction will the sale of these plants.  It's a complete disgrace being at the mercy of these government organizations that have way too much power and no knowledge but keep dismissing the property value these \"herbs\" given to us by God to help those in pain.

I have taken it for months with no ill side effects and I don't expect to encounter any. I had a hip surgery a year ago after dealing with a bad hip AND depression for years, I just wish I had known about Kratom sooner as those were some very trying times.\n\nYou hear things about addiction, but I take a day off here and there and I don't feel any cravings for it, which isn't to say there is no reasoning behind those comments but rather that it's likely they were using kratom to get themselves off of a very addictive substance such as heroin and by stopping kratom they may have done themselves a disservice. Also everyone's different, some get ridiculously addicted to sugar or coffee, but like those two I don't think Kratom has severe addiction anything remotely resembling what you can see from narcotic painkillers, some anti-anxiety/depression meds, and reasonably illegal hard drugs such as heroin, meth, and cocaine. \n\nI'm sure other's have given better reasons than myself but I just wanted to say I am strongly against this ban that does not benefit the public in any way.

I would never consider using an illegal drug. In June of 2016 I developed a severe, debilitating case of piriformis sciatica which made it impossible to sit or lie down for more than an hour without a pain level causing me to black out. The pain was unbelievable, and the medical profession had nothing to offer except opiates. I refuse to take opiates because of the possibility of addiction; I had taken hydrocodone once in the past and decided that the possibility of addiction overrode its pain relieving qualities, and I lived with the pain. During this most recent bout, which lasted several months, a friend suggested I try kratom. It made a significant difference in my comfort level, and I detected no addictive quality. I took it only occasionally, and eventually I figured out how to mechanically fix the sciatica, so I am no longer in pain. I didn't need to \"quit taking kratom\" because I wasn't \"taking kratom\" in the first place on a regular basis because it is not addictive. My dose? 1/4 teaspoon in coffee or tea. If I took 1/2 teaspoon, it did not work as well, so there was no way I was going to have to keep raising the dose to keep it effective.\n\nLater, that same friend told me that kratom worked wonders on days when she was horridly depressed over circumstances in her life. I decided to try it for that, and lo and behold, what a wonderful mood enhancer it is! I probably have taken it a total of three times for that situation. So Id say I've taken it a total of fewer than 15 times in the last five months, all of them with distinct beneficial effects. Clearly not addictive, and clearly highly beneficial.\n\nI like the fact that kratom is merely a powdered plant and not a concentrated pharmaceutical loaded with fillers, additives, and colors, which I do not willingly ingest. Please keep kratom legal as is, because it is so beneficial for those of us who need it. Any substance can be abused by those so inclined, even caffeine and essential oils; I do not do well with, for example, coffee, which causes me enough negative effects that I just dont drink coffee.

Then I would continue my day in pain with another heating pad on the couch while I get my daughter and I ready. I would then take one my heating pads to work to attempt to manage the pain. I would be in constant pain all day on the brink of a breakdown at any moment from just wanting a pain free day. Some days I would play a game with myself of all the things I would do or sacrifice for just one day pain free. The doctors say I must have had some kind of a blunt force trama to a lower back muscle when I was younger and over the years it got worse and worse. My treatment options are more physical therapy at 50 dollars a session even with my county job insurance. I have done it before for 2 weeks with zero improvement at 300 dollars. I'm told my only option is to continue again but the doctor said it could take months and will more than likely come right back after I stop. I simply cannot come close to affording that. Kratom gave me my life back. Kratom gave me the ability to play with my daughter. Kratom gave me peace from the psychological effects of being in pain at all times. Kratom gave me a good night's sleep. Kratom gave me everything I had lost back. The science is clear that this substance is not dangerous to the public. You must do the logical thing here and allow people like me to have a life free of pain. The plant is far to mild to bring this kind of attention. Would you prefer I get put on actual pain pills and become severely addicted? Or not get any relief at all? How should I explain to my 3 year old I can't play with her on the floor anymore because people in positions of power that made a law stating I can't use a plant? You won't be taking some dangerous drug off the street you will be forcing people to seek out dangerous drugs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12545","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jack Grotkowsko","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Millions of people in the US live with physical pain.  Most of us go through a broad range of treatment to help alleviate the pain and pain pills like Vicodin give the most relief.  However, there are many different side effects from pain killers and tolerance quickly builds up making these pills extremely addicting.  It's so bad, the DEA and the federal government have a massive campaign against opioid abuse.  Withdrawal effects start pretty quickly and after a while, you take pain meds just so you don't feel horrible from the withdrawals.\n\nA couple of years ago I stumbled upon Kratom and tried it out.  Wow, that was one of the best decisions in my life.  Kratom relieves the pain while allowing me to function like a normal person.  It doesn't give you a high like vicodin and other painkillers but takes away your pain.  Kratom is all natural and as you know, has been used for hundreds of years in Asia.  I've met a lot of people since then who have found Kratom and we all come up with the same conclusion.  Not only does Kratom help with our pain, anxiety, addiction to opioids and other health issues, it allows us to remain productive parents and workers.  I don't know anyone who has been adversely affected by using Kratom and have found it's a safe and more effective alternative to pain killers.\n\nI agree that a lot of drugs are dangerous.  I agree that Kratom should be regulated to make sure it's all natural and not some type of extract.  I agree that anyone who uses Kratom should be 21 years of age or older.  I 100% do NOT agree that Kratom should be banned and if it is, the opioid epidemic will be worst than you could ever imagine.  Please don't take away our ability as adults to use an all natural substance that we know is safe and takes away our pain.\n\nRespectfully, \n\nBrad Ballard","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3695","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brad Ballard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I discovered the plant mitragyna speciosa, also known as kratom when i first tried it as prescribed by my herbalist. since then i have been using it to address back pain issues due to my overweight problems.

I have never used Kratom, nor any Scheduled Substance (except in cases of surgery or severe injury). Today (11/21/16) is the first day I learned of Kratom, from a comment on Amazon.com, with regards to someone asking if Kava Kava had a similar effect. I was disappointed to discover the current status of Kratom because it is a traditional medicinal plant that is being scrutinized legally condemned before being scientifically evaluated.\n\nI have a genetic condition, known as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (Hypermobility-Type3). As is not uncommon for those with EDS, I also have a form of autonomic nervous system dysfunction AND spontaneous spinal fluid leaks: all three conditions are known for complex and difficult to treat pain. There is a lack of standards of care for those diagnosed with either of these three conditions, and it is known that most who are affected may never be properly diagnosed. Even when we received the elusive diagnosis(es), it is difficult for medical professionals to understand and treat us, and many of us simply have to resign ourselves to being severely self-limited/disabled. Those affected, like myself, are in a medically neglected group, but our experiences are unfortunately common among those with other difficult/prolong-to-diagnosis and medically treat conditions like M.S., CFS, M.E., fibromyaligia,  lupus, etc. Disproportionately, the above medical diagnoses tend to affect women, and women are known to have their medical complaints of pain dismissed. \n\nI would be interested in trying Kratom to see if it provides an adjunct to OTCs, or could be used alone. I'd like to know if it will prolong my ability to work a full-time day, and/or improve my quality of life. I believe myself to be an intelligent consumer but I recognize that not everyone is. Kratom is relatively unknown in the US, its no surprise that word of its painkilling effects have an immediate interest in those who are opioid addicts affected by current regulations. Just because those who have addictions found out about Kratom earlier than those of us that would use the herbal remedy sparingly, is no reasons to declare it a Schedule 1 drug. There are many products that are abused by addicts but because they have a legitimate need and treated responsibly by the larger public, they are not banned. For example: Imodium.  \n\nRather than committed the resources to enforcement of a ban, it may be useful to educate people about the known risks to cut down on poison control calls. There is a lot of speculation about the side-effects of Kratom, such as psychosis, but these are reported incidents and its possible that people with mental illnesses are also addicts, which are co-using or just so happened to be using Kratom. The current situation sounds an awful lot like the history of wormwood. \n\nKratom may be a valuable herbal supplement that helps reduce opioid use and dependence upon those that are without an addiction; thereby separating pain patients from high seekers; reducing the amount of legal opioid that could be illegally stolen/used and help doctors to be relieved of the complex task of pain management from those with mild-moderate chronic pain.With the DEAs blessing, I'm sure that companies will begin to invest into research and better quality control of Kratom, thereby helping to reduce any risks.\n\nIf I had to summarize: Please do not prohibited (in doing so, punish) American citizens from a reasonable herbal alternative to pain management because there exists those with complex drug addictions that will attempt any type of possible method to obtain a high. Glue, paint thinner, and cough syrup are all legal even though we know there are people that will abuse there bodies and can die from their misuse as a high. These are not Schedule substances,  Please act rationally.

I suffer from depression, anxiety, and Bipolar I disorder. I take about 2 grams of Kratom a day, and it is the most effective anxiolytic I have ever used, which includes the psychiatric medications of buspar, clonazapam, and hydroxizine. It provides me with an ability to focus and be clear-headed, and has significantly diminished the symptoms of my depression and Bipolar as well. \n\nI buy Kratom from a highly reputable, high quality online vendor, in capsule form of the powdered leaf. I have never had any ill effects, aside from some minor nausea that can occur if I don't take it with food (similar to a multivitamin pill). I use primarily the Vietnamese and Maeng Da strains of the leaf, which, in my experience, are the strains most helpful for my mental illnesses. I do not consider it a drug, or a medication, but a nutritional supplement that aids in good mental health -- very similar to L-tryptophan, GABA, and Valerian Root, but more effective than any of these.\n\nBefore Kratom there were several days in a week where I couldn't will myself to get out of bed, and was terrified to leave my house. Thanks to Kratom I am now a far more motivated, less-anxious person with almost no depression. I am now back in school earning a Master's Degree, and found the strength and energy to move out from an abusive living situation and become more independent. It's not a panacea, I still take Lamictal, Remeron, and Vistaril, and have bouts of agoraphobia; but my symptoms are almost nothing compared to what they were before I found Kratom.\n\nI do not \"get high\" from Kratom. I get a boost of energy, very similar to two cups of coffee, which does feel good but it is its properties in relieving my anxiety and depression that are why I take it. There is no \"crash\" or withdrawals if I don't take Kratom, but my anxiety and depression return. I can not speak for all people, but for me, Kratom is an extremely mild herb to my body with powerful, positive effects to my brain and mind.\n\nScheduling this supplement would have a very, very negative effect on my life. While I know many use other strains of Kratom to relieve chronic pain and stop opiate addictions, my mental illnesses are very real and have been crippling to my life. It's because of Kratom that I am able to overcome them finally, after over 10 years of trying various psychiatric medications.\n\nPlease do not schedule this tea leaf that has helped me become a functioning adult and positive contributing member of society.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Spaeth","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3188","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Spaeth","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a nurse and being in the medical field since 2009, I have single handledly seen countless cases of opioids addiction.

I strongly believe Kratom is not harmful and I lead a very productive life with Kratom. It has not brought me down, but does make me feel better on a daily basis. I have been using it for more than 3 years and no one would know because it doesn't produce strong effects that show through to everyone around you. This is a mild supplement and should be able to be used by people regardless of what they claim it helps them with. There is no harm.\n\nKratom does not belong on a Schedule list and should remain a supplement as is. I would like to see the DEA stop crusading against all substances and work towards helping people who are on serious drugs. Trying to take away another non-harmful substance will only turn more productive citizens into criminals which is something I thought we were starting to get away from in the USA. \n\nI hope you will take our concerns to heart and not force people into a corner over something that is not harming anyone. \n\nThank you very much.\n\nSincerely, \n\nGiovanni D.

I have watched her take pain pills and what they did to her. It was very disturbing to see that eventually they didn't work , making her body need more and more to the point it wasn't helping her pain , it was just to help her not feel sick from withdrawls. She saw what it was doing I saw what it was doing , and after a sit down discussion , she decided to stop going to pain management, and she started taking Kratom , she read online that it might be able to help her from withdrawals. So we purchased some , thinking this isn't going to work but let give it a try. Well it worked , she came off the Meds , and she noticed it also helped with her pain. She said it doesn't completely take the pain away but it helps so that she can continue working , and at least feel good enough to do things like go on walks . Decorate the house for the holidays. It a,so helps her anxiety to which she sees a therapist for . It doesn't take it away completely , but it helps  her so much. So please don't take this plant away, it helps keep her a functioning memeber of scociety, and a functioning memeber of our family . It has never ever made me think anything except a move in the right direction to feeling better. As opposed to her falling asleep sitting up and looking out of it and drugged like when she went to pain management , those pills are what everyone is fighting agains . We are fighting for the freedom to pick a plant that can grow in my yard. I don't think anyone should be able to tell people that they cannot use a plant they find in nature. Because if that was the case , a lot more plants are way more dangerous. I hope you make the right decision, a lot of lives can and will be lost if it is taken from us.

I had some stomach issues I told my primary care physician about back in 2007 and he told me it was just heartburn and prescribed me heartburn medicine and I took it every single day, twice a day, for years. I didn't think anything else was wrong because I trusted my doctor.  On Halloween 2013, I went out with some friends and three or four alcoholic beverages for the first time in two years and felt really drunk and a \"friend\" offered me an MDMA pill which I've never ever tried before because I was so afraid of \"street\" drugs.  The MDMA and the alcohol ended up perforating my untreated stomach ulcer and all the stuff that was in my stomach ended up leaking out inside my body and even though I didn't feel any pain, I couldn't even take a sip of water without throwing it up so I knew something was wrong and went to the Emergency Room.  As soon as I got there, my heart stopped, but the great doctors and nurses at NCH Hospital Emergency Room in Naples, FL were able to revive me after about  ten minutes after it happened.  I spent over a month in the hospital recovering and my memory was really screwed up so the social worker filled out an application to put me on social security disabilty and I went to live with my parents.  I couldn't remember any new memories and I couldn't remember anything from my past.  I was so depressed that I attempted to commit suicide.  My younger brother saw how bad I was and gave me a 600mg capsule of all natural and organic Kratom strain that had more mood enhancing properties and less pain releiving properties.  I took kratom and twenty minutes later I  was acting like my normal self and started to remember everything!  It was a miracle powder for me!  It brought me back from Hell!!  I started working within two months of taking kratom and dropped my disability case application!!!  Today, I am working as a salesperson for an environmental company and I feel amazing because of this all natural miracle plant!  I never take any prescription medicine and I eat healthy and kratom lets me have a normal life!  I do take five days off of it every month and I don't have any withdrawal symptoms like a person might have with prescription medicine and I am still able to work without it during that time, but, I am in sales, and kratom keeps my memory sharp and works as an ADHD medicine!  I know I would not be able to live without it!  I am never going to take prescription medicine ever again because of all the negative side effects, withdrawal symptoms, and dependency...\n\nPlease keep Kratom legal!

I joined the Army in 1982 and served my 3 years active duty ( no combat ) and was Honorable discharged.\nI started working in warehousing and landed a job with a major retailer. most of it was hand picking the heavy furniture that you put together. In August of 2001 at work I herniated my L5-L4 disc, after 5 years I finally won my workers comp case and had surgery later that year. Unfortunately because of the time between the injury and surgery ( I was still working, sometimes light duty sometimes full duty) I had a lot of damage done to my nerves, other discs, muscles and tendons. Currently I have disc fusions from L2-L5 with two more untreated herniations at L2-L1 and L1-T12.\n\nI started on opiates just before my first surgery, the side effects gave me many problems including after 2 opiates I was unable to drive because my reactions slowed down, I did not want break the law or be to be a hazard to anyone and felt I would be. Two years ago I had to cut my usage down to 2 opiates and 3 muscle relaxers because of the rules change caused by abuse of opiates by those with little or no health problems, My Doctors are afraid to give me More, This resulted in my inability to stretch and do home exercise as it is too painful and also a weight gain which makes my pain worse. Earlier this year my sister suggested I try the plant \"Kratom\" which contains Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine . Not only has it helped me be more active it has no side effects that I can feel or see. Due to the cost I am unable to buy much so I take my opiates and muscle relaxers as their covered by my insurance. When I can afford to take Kratom I suffer no withdrawal symptoms from stopping the opiates and muscle relaxers, It handles my pain better then the opiates and the Kratom is on par or maybe a little better in regards to muscles spasms in my back and legs but no nap is needed during the day as with the Muscle relaxers.\n it would be a huge disservice to those of us that use Kratom especially people with severe chronic pain and no chance to recover as verified by EEGs, MRIs and CTs.\n\nI urge you to Keep Kratom on the market as it is now! It has helped many people without all the side effects of opiates and even allowed individuals to get back to a productive life plus some people have severe side effects from opiates so they are left without any choice.\nThank you,\nJohnny Varney\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23117","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Johnny Varney","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Regarding Kratom and the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine;\n\nI have suffered from drug addiction since the age of 13. I am currently clean and have been so for just over six years. I was hooked on Oxycodone and other opiods for many years. I got clean through a suboxone clinic in Somersworth NH. But then I was laid off from work and lost my health insurance. I was still taking 16mg of buprenorphine at the ttime, and after 3 days of withdrawals I was introduced to Kratom by a friend. It eased my withdrawals to a manageable level. I am completely convinced that had I not found Kratom, I would have eventually used again to relieve the withdrawal symptoms. After only 2 months I quit using Kratom with no ill effects. DO NOT OUTLAW KRATOM.

I've been using it for a while now for bad constant back pain issues I've had for years now. Went into doctors and they recommended  Advil or high recommended dosages of Ibuprofen and it just  doesn't help. Never has for my back pain. I got introduced to Kratom and I love it. I can take it in the morning before I go to work (I'm a PCA) and it let's me go about my day without complaining or hurting. If anyone knows bad back pain problems it's such a hassle to deal with constant pain when you're trying to help sick or people with disabilities clean their houses, drive them to errands or help them with personal care it's hard to keep a smile on when I'm in pain. I've been using this and it has helped tremendously and would never wish or want someone's medicine that's HELPS them to be taken away. My boyfriend uses it for back pain as well and something to helps us get up and have a productive day too. This listed as an illegal drug is bizarre and definitely unsuitable compared to the other drugs listed in this category. when people are using this to HELP them in good way and it is a natural it should stay legal. From the government eyes, it seems that this is \"addictive\".. But from my boyfriends and my experience when we don't have Kratom we aren't going to go out of our way to get it or really need it to have a productive day,  we like it though because we don't have to sit all day in pain and it helps us a lot throughout the day.  We really wish that Kratom stays LEGAL because of our story and other people stories who it beneficially helps and have been using it for a while with no cons to this lovely Kratom leaf.

I have been told to try Kratom before, but since it was a bit expensive, I just ignored... but now that the pain and anxiety is taking over my life, and sometimes my only comfort is knowing we all die someday.. I am going to give this a shot. Lord... if it helps and lets me live a normal life again and then is banned.. I'm just gonna cry. I have no idea why anyone would want to ban herbs... They are part of the earth, they deserve to be used accordingly. I have never heard of anyone abusing the herb or selling for profit or anything so it doesn't make sense to me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3368","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kimberly Battle","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to say that KRATOM saved my family and possibly my life. I was heavily addicted to prescription opiates, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, and Oxymorphone. I would take 100's of mg and a day, and got to the point where I was spending the families bill money on pills so I could continue working and no have to go through detox. My wife had threatened to leave me several times, but every time I tried to quit the detox was too much on my body. The reason I got addicted in the first place was because I was shot through the stomach with a .3030 rifle at close range. It broke 5 ribs, blew up my colon and intestines, took out my gall bladder, ran through my liver. Everyday I live in pain and sickness, the scar tissue effects me everyday. Its hard for me to gain weight, its hard for me to get out of bed. I am only 27, and was shot back in June of 2006. I suffer from bad depression becasue of how my issues resulting from the gunshot. Most people would have been killed, but i was fortunate enough to live, and at the same time unfortunate enough to live. I never saw an end in site that didn't involve losing everything do to pills. Until i read about Kratom online. It took a while for me to want to try it becasue i didn't see how anything but opiates could help my situation. But after trying it, I was truly amazed. I was able to detox from opiates in a matter of 7 days and never had to miss work. I have now been clean from pills for over 6 months. I take about 6-10 grams of kratom about 4 times a week. I have never experienced withdrawal from it, nor any negative symptoms other than that it tastes terrible and can sometimes be nauseating to drink. But I just mix it in water so I am sure there is better ways to drink it. Kratom is the answer to the opioid epidemic our country is facing. People dont have to keep dying or suffering in pain. If more people knew about Kratom, Im honestly positive this country would be better off for it. If the DEA bans it, than we are cutting off our noses to spite our face. I request that you not only keep it legal, but help to  regulate and standardize and educate. Kratom saved my life and helped me keep my family.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18676","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bailey Bloodworth","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Someone close to me has fibromyalgia and she wouldn't be able to get along without this plant please don't make it schedule 1.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18290","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Arthur Amuso","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am taking this time to address the DEA about how kratom has helped me live an alcohol free life. I strongly implore that the DEA does not put kratom on the list of controlled substances. I am a 26 year old accountant at Mcdonnold Operating. I graduated from Texas Tech University with a business accounting degree. Through out my whole life I have suffered from severe anxiety. I would deal with this anxiety by drinking alcohol daily.  I had become what people would refer to as a functional alcoholic. Eventually all the drinking started to have an effect on my health and I developed some kind of tremors in my hands. From what I have learned from my research, my continuous drinking was starting to damage my central nervous system. I found I had to drink everyday to just feel normal. I was on vicious alcohol cycle that I remained on for most of my young adult life (20-25). It was not until about a year ago I found kratom through a friend who was trying to get me to stop drinking. Kratom did not cure my drinking nor was it a treatment, it was a natural herb that aided me accomplish my goal. I was able to get the help I needed through taking kratom which eased my anxiety. Since I started taking kratom, I was able to completely stop drinking. My health significantly improved, I felt and looked better all the way around. I now plan to pursue to get my MBA and who knows what else I can accomplish now that I stopped drinking. Kratom a natural supplement gave me the extra support I needed to stop drinking. Banning kratom will be taking a step backwards in the fight against drugs. I implore you to let me have the right to take this natural supplement kratom. \nSincerely, \nDeven Lara","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15765","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Deven lara","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a chronic pain patient and was on morphine 3 times a day for several years.

I suffer, along with millions of my fellow citizens, from debilitating chronic pain that over-the-counter medications have been unable to treat. I have responsibly used Kratom to effectively treat my chronic pain for over 3 years and have suffered absolutely zero negative side effects. Even when I have run out of my Kratom medicine, I did not have to deal with the crippling affects of withdrawal typically associated with long term opioid use. Kratom has enabled me to go to work and support my family every day pain free. I am a father to a preteen daughter and discovering and using Kratom myself gave me my life back and enabled me to enjoy many healthy, physical activities with her instead of suffering through debilitating pain and the depression that comes with it. I fear losing access to this gift from God will result in a significant, catastrophic reduction in life satisfaction and personal mobility. I am not alone in my plea. I know many law-abiding individuals who have found great pain relief from Kratom and will also suffer greatly if their Kratom medicine is banned or outlawed. I beg of you to use compassion, common-sense, and scientific fact when you consider how to regulate this miracle plant. And please consider, prohibition is not regulation. It is the removal of regulation.

Not only that but I think I will be able to get some personal acquaintances who have fallen into addictions off the streets and back into the workplace by introducing them to the knowledge I have gained by using Kratom. What the potential side effects could be should be studied as I am not advocating uninformed use because we know with certain drugs that could create an atmosphere for drug abuse. Drugs shouldn't be used by everyone but kratom works as a painkiller without the addictive side effects of opiates. In my experience, it can do wonders against alcohol abuse and opiate abuse: 2 of the leading causes of annual American deaths. Let's fight addictions and clean up the streets. There are people hurting and the changing of Kratom to a Schedule 1 drug would make no progress in the intention of banning the sales of non-medicinal drugs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11524","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"So I don't use kratom, I haven't tried kratom.

I am a 37 year old male. When i was 17 years old i was in a car accident, i was at a dead stop trying to turn into a parking lot when i was hit from behind by someone doing 45mph, who never tried to stop, she said her brakes stopped working. there wasn't much damage to my car, just a slight dent in the bumper, her whole front end was all smashed in, because there wasn't any major damage to my car, i offered to check her brakes for her and i let her go.I was trying to go to work. My father has owned a used tire shop since 1980. It was a dirty job which required long 12 hour days of non stop manual labor. I remember waking up the next morning and i was in so much pain i couldn't get out of bed. I went to the doctors and told him what happened, he ordered no tests no nothing he just looked me over and wrote me out a prescription for hydrocodone. This went on for 10+ years. I became extremely addicted to the pills and my doctor just kept giving me more pills and never offered any kind of solution other then more pills, before long i lost my job, my family wanted nothing to do with, all my friends didn't want to talk to me anymore and i ended up homeless and broken living on the streets. My life became a living hell! I never did drugs, i never partied if i knew that listening to my doctor and taking the medication he was giving me would have gotten me to this point i would of never taken the stuff, but before i realized it was a problem it was too late. Thank god my mom never gave up on me, she tracked me down and offered to send me to rehab and i went, this was 4 years ago. Since then i have become a active member of society. I own 2 home based businesses, i own a car and i just bought a nice condo not far from the beach. I haven't taken any kind of narcotic pain killers, drugs or even alcohol since, but heres the problem i am still in serious pain at times. About 2 years ago i started taking kratom for pain and it has helped me so much. I can now manage my pain and still function with out getting the \"high\" the pain killers cause, i started going to gym 4 times a week and i can function now. Kratom is not a drug, it doesn't get you high but it does help with the pain without any of the nasty side effects or withdrawals associated with pain killers. Kratom has helped me become a functioning productive member of society. If you make kratom you will be forcing so many people who find relief from this non addictive plant right back to more addictive prescription pain killers. I for one will never take that garbage again, i lost 15 years of my life because of that trash and I'm scared because if you make this plant illegal there will be nothing i can do, no other safe non addictive thing i can take to give me relief. I am a drug addict and i don't want to have to rely on anything and have to take anything on a regular basis. That is why kratom is so great because i can take it for a week or two and then just stop taking it with no side effects or withdrawals. If you take kratom away from me the only thing i will have left to give me any kind of relief will be pain killers and I'm scared to death of those things, they destroyed my life once already. Please if you make kratom illegal you will only be creating more drug addicts because we won't have anything safer and non addictive to take and so many people i talk to are just like me, they tried pain killers from their doctors and they ended up becoming drug addicts, kratom can prevent that.

He is a father, husband and sole bread-winner of the family. This is in response to the DEA's intention to make Kratom a Schedule I substance. It includes a great amount of information on what Kratom is and the what will happen if the DEA goes through with the emergency scheduling.\n\nThanks,\n\nDerek\n\nDear DEA,\n \nPlease remove Mitragynine & 7-hydroxymitragynine which is in Kratom from becoming a Schedule I substance.\n \nI am 29 and suffer from a herniated disc, chronic neck pain, TMJ, arthritis in my neck. I support a family of four on a single income as a Help Desk Tech. I have been to many doctors with little success for treatment. I have found that Kratom improves my quality of life after a hard days work. It isnt comparable to any drugs, marijuana, alcohol or other stimulants.  Kratom helps to improve my quality of life that I suffer with chronic pain. Please dont make this herb illegal. Cervical injections, botox injections, chiropractic care, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, yoga exercises have not helped with my pain.\n \nKratom is a well-known, well-researched herbal substance drawn from the leaves of trees within the coffee family. The number of cases of documented harm from kratom use is remarkably low, both as an absolute matter and when considered against the extensive history of use of kratom, both inside and outside the United States\n \nMitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are two of the primary alkaloids of this plant. These two compounds are not synthetic and should not be lumped together with  \"bath salts\" or \"spice\".\n \nKratom has been used as a medicine by many people for thousands of years. It is a potent remedy for physical pain, anxiety and depression, and could be used to aid with opiate withdrawal by those who would like to quit using illicit drugs such as heroin. Kratom is NOT a hallucinogen and should not be classified as such. Adding mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as a Schedule I substance is rash and unjustified prohibition, resulting in a foreseeable increase in street drug-related crime, as well as a punishment to those who are currently using it responsibly to treat various ailments.\n\nThe reason that there are no deaths solely attributed to Kratom is because Kratom does not affect your respiratory capacity. It does not slow down your central nervous system. It's potential to do harm is virtually impossible.\n\nKratom has very limited recreational capacity.  The White House petition has over 100,000 signatures for the \"Please do not make Kratom a Schedule I Substance.\" \n\nThe federal government has invested significant resources to develop alternative pain management strategies. This includes a study funded by the National Institutes of Health in partnership with the University of Massachusetts and the University of Mississippi to investigate the use of Kratom as a remedy for opioid withdrawal. This study led the researchers to apply for a patent identifying the Kratom extract, mitragyinine, as a useful treatment for other addictive drugs besides opiate derivatives. The DEAs decision to place Kratom as a Schedule I substance will put a halt on federally funded research and innovation surrounding the treatment of individuals suffering from opioid and other addictionsa significant public health threat. Remember the DDear Colleague Letters of Senator Hatch and Congressman Mark Pocan.\n \nWe hope you realize the threat this scheduling causes the people seeking legitimate use of this special plant to improve our quality of life.

I have spent many years on and off prescribed opioid painkillers, taking them as indicated under the care of a physician. I am also a person who likes to work very hard and go about my daily life without having to battle pain or, alternatively, the somewhat \"loopy\" side effects that opioids can cause. With kratom, I don't have to deal with either of these things. A small amount relieves pain in an almost magical way, and I don't ever feel \"under the influence\" like I tend to when I take other types of medication, such as vicodin or percocet. Since discovering that kratom had such a positive outcome for me, I've been able to function at what I consider to be a higher degree of productivity -- I'm not having to take time off work due to pain, nor do I have to waste hours in a day \"getting my head straight\" after taking some sort of opioid painkiller. Simply put, kratom has become an alternative tool that I can rely upon on the days that my joints are in so much pain that it hurts to get out of bed, and it would be absolutely devastating to me if it were to become illegal or otherwise unavailable. I'm a wife and a mother and a hard working person who just happens to have been dealt a really crappy hand with the chronic illness that I have. I don't want it to rule my life and impact my ability to be great at any of my roles, and with the help of occasional kratom use, I am able to do everything that I want to do, pain free and without experiencing any of the negative effects that opioid painkillers cause.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6235","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello thank you for allowing and taking time for our testimonials about Kratom.

This pills start a vicious cycle that can end with death and Keaton has allowed me to stop taking them completely. Keaton to me is nothing like these strong opiates that are prescribed, there is no buzz no craving and no side affects that I have noticed over 3 years of use. If Kratom is made illegal then there will be no alternative for millions of people except to turn back to the nasty opiate pills or even heroin. I work a full time job I'm a great employee and family member. Kratom has allowed me to get my life back and has literally saved my life from a life of addiction and pain. To me Kratom  is nothing like the hard opiates or heroin that it is being portrayed to be, it is more like coffee with added pain killing benefits. I have used many opiates over my life and to compare the two is like apples to oranges. I hope the people who make these decisions can see and understand how Kratom has helped millions, it is not a hard core drug and many positive benefits with very few if any negative effects. If Keaton is taken away from us will will be forced to use the very negative alternatives which in the long run will destroy our lives.

I researched kratom some time ago and started taking it for pain relief.  No one suggested I take it internally, but I saw it has been used for centuries to help people enhance their lifestyle rather than suffer.  I have lower back pain that may be associated with stenosis that showed up on a past MRI when I was going to a chiropractor for help.\nI found that taking a little in the morning and a little in the evening helped me tremendously.  I never go to medical doctors anyway, because I have been healthy my entire life with this small exception lately.\nPlease, do not change kratom to be inaccessible, as this would be totally unwarranted.  I have seen there is nothing addictive to it, and I only have used it occasionally anyway.  The comments some have made of getting high as a recreational use is absurd!  No one gets high with kratom.  Someone is lying if they are suggesting such.  This is a tree leaf.  If you ban this, what is next? Garlic?  tea? mint?  \nYes, I am being ridiculous as much as banning kratom would be.  Please leave us alone and let us be.  Kratom has never caused a death anywhere I have ever heard of from anyone I know in the medical community.  Most have never even heard of it but want to use it when they hear of what it does rather than take opiates.  When are we going to understand that the pharmaceutical industry wants this just for their control and profit.  I trade stocks all of the time and have traded many pharmaceutical companies, so I am familiar with their thinking.  If you dad or mom found relief in something as safe as kratom, would you ban it?  Please use common sense here.  Thanks for consideration of my feelings and experience with kratom.  If it is banned, I will have to endure the pain, as there is no way I will take opiates.  Don't ban it, and allow researchers to continue studying it like they have garlic or any other harmless herb.  If you ban it, people will have to seriously question people's agendas at the DEA.

I had no real choice but to use prescribed narcotic pain relievers for extended periods of time between major surgeries. As they tried to put me back together I found I found the pain medicine to be difficult to maintain. So I searched for alternative treatments for my types of pain. I found and tried several. They didn't work. As I continued to try to heal I continued to hate the meds that calmed the constant pain.\n   Every once in a while I would look for alternative pain treatment and stop pain meds for a few months at a time. I really did not like being dependent on anything and having my mind bent by such powerful drugs. I was on 180 mg of Oxycontin at times. Needless to say I was quite high. Now keep in mind that I don't drink or smoke pot or anything. It was hell.\nI finally found kratom and tried enough for it to actually work. It was amazing. Pain relief without the intoxication. It really was a miracle. It actually works better for pain than prescribed narcotic pain meds. For me at least.\nSince finding kratom my life has changed for the better. My two small children's lives have gotten better. I can work some now. \n   If you take kratom away my family will suffer for no reason. I have more surgery coming up and planned to used only kratom as pain relief. I do not want narcotics. There are a lot of people in my situation that will suffer as well by being forced to use addictive, debilitating medicine.

I started using Kratom in 2012 to help with withdrawals from alcohol and prescription opioids.  I found that it positively affected my mood and physical cravings.  I continue to use Kratom from time to time, when I feel I may relapse or when melancholia sets in. It's valuable to me to know that there is something completely natural and non-toxic that can actually help my curb my symptoms when I need it, but I rarely use it anymore. It's a backup measure that I keep put away until the occasional time I need it. Sometimes I will use it for several days in a row and then not again for weeks, other times I use it once and then don't feel a need to use it for months. It really is a safe, non-toxic way to lift your mood, deal with withdrawal, and curb chronic pain. There is no reason Kratom should be scheduled as a dangerous substance. It has been proven not to cause respiratory depression, has been used by indigenous peoples for thousands of years, and improves the lives of everyday Americans without posing the serious risks that many prescription painkillers posses.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18426","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom was able to give me life my life back after opiate painkillers took it away.

I discovered Kratom almost a year ago.  Today my life is pretty great.  In the past few years I managed to return to school and finish my Bachelor's degree in business management.  I graduated with honors and was inducted into the Beta Gamma Sigma Honor Society.  I am on the board of directors for my school's Alumni Association.  I have a great job in management at a company that ranks within the top 50 of the Fortune 500.  I'm a single dad who has been able to rebuild a relationship with my son.\n\nThis hasn't always been the case.  10 years ago my life was ravaged by heroin, an addiction that started with prescription opiates.  I lost nearly everything and everyone close to me.  Finally, after years of addiction, I found relief through Methadone.  It allowed me to return to my normal life, but I still felt like I was taking a heavy drug and eventually I chose to leave it behind.  What no one told me was that the withdrawals from Methadone were just as bad, if not worse than heroin.\n\nThis is when I discovered Kratom.  After reading all the praise this herbal supplement had received online I decided to try it out.  It seemed too good to be true, but it wasn't.  Not only did it help me get through the Methadone withdrawals with little discomfort, but it also helped with cravings.  Methadone made me feel like a zombie.  I feel normal taking Kratom.  While taking Kratom I have no desire to drink or use drugs of any kind.  It makes battling addiction a lot more tolerable and a lot more manageable.  It helps me live a normal life.\n\nIf this plant would become scheduled it would greatly affect my life and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people just like me.  So I beg of you, please give Kratom a chance.  Do I think it should be regulated, sure.  There should be labeling and quality requirements and possibly even an 18 and up age restriction.  In my mind, this seems like the most appropriate course of action.  If you really feel this is a threat to society, then ban it, but please have some concrete and credible evidence to back up your claims.   Somehow we allow Tobacco, which is clearly a public health risk, to fall into these guidelines.  I think it's only fair that we allow the same for Kratom, which in my personal experience is no more harmful than a cup of coffee.  I appreciate your time and trust you will make the right decision.

I would try anything that had painkiller values. While searching the web I came across kratom and saw all the reviews so I had to try it. This change everything.

I've taken many different medications and learned a variety of therapies in my life in hopes of ameliorating my depression. While daily yoga and running, healthy eating and lots of sleep are now all part of my current lifestyle, there are deeper components of my issue that have yet to be smoothed out of my behavioral and emotional responses. \n\nIn a small dose, kratom helps to clear my mind of negative thoughts just enough for me to gain control of it. It does not make me feel high, or euphoric, or any drug-like effect described in the media. It is much like caffeine in its effects, but weaker, and thankfully does not give me any anxiety like coffee would. I do not take it in recreation, using it mostly to get through rough work days, and in times when I'm feeling particularly down. I've cut back on alcohol for that reason.\n\nWithout it, the world wouldn't end for me because it's not that kind of substance. However, I'd be back in a hole, in my baseline brain - my normal chronically-depressed self - without any hand to help me out of it. Kratom is the hand that helps me out when I need it, unlike other daily anti-depression drugs I've tried. I'd love if it could be regulated and acknowledged as a true medicine, and not a recreational drug, but classifying it as Schedule 1 is not suitable for its mild, safe effects.\n\nThank you for your time!\n30-year-old Creative Professional \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3747","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom  has helped me very much to give up a deadly alcohol addiction.

We both felt it was important to find a safe, non-addictive alternative to the opiate medications (Oxycontin and Fentanyl) that were being prescribed for her at the time. After much research, she found a promising natural herb called Kratom which she then obtained from a reputable vendor and upon trying it found it to be highly effective at relieving her pain. While she waited for surgery and through her post-surgical recovery I saw that she continued to successfully manage her pain using Kratom. She had none of the adverse reactions associated with opioid medications and it did not appear to interfere with her ability to think clearly. It never became necessary for her to increase her dosage over time due to the tolerance or dependence that often develops with opioids. Once she had recovered and no longer needed pain management she discontinued using Kratom with no withdrawal symptoms and no lingering effects. \n\nI, along with many others, have seen that Kratom  is a safe, effective, non-addictive alternative for pain management with none of the unpleasant or dangerous side effects associated with opioid medications and no loss of mental clarity. Claims that Kratom has no meaningful medical benefits have been made without taking the time to analyze the existing research, conduct further research or study the anecdotal evidence testifying to the positive effects of Kratom. Given the current opioid crisis, it is worth taking the time to investigate the potential benefits Kratom has to offer, particularly as a safe alternative to dangerous and highly addictive opioid medications. However, placing the active components of Kratom, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, into a Schedule I would effectively halt further scientific investigation due to the stringent federal licensing required and the inability of researchers to obtain enough Kratom to study once it is banned. It' creates a catch-22; banning Kratom for having no accepted medical use makes it unlikely a medical use will be found due to the inability to research it further once the ban is in place. Please do not let this happen. Let my voice, my wife's voice and the voice of many other Americans who have benefited from Kratom be heard.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6332","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Bonnell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"DEA.

Until you proposed banning the drug, I had never heard of the stuff. I admit that at age 69 I am not at the forefront of youth culture, but it does seem to me that if the drug was causing a significant problem it would at least be in the news occasionally. I would prefer not to have my tax dollars spent on a solution in search of a problem.\n\nI see little evidence that prohibition would accomplish anything useful.  Edward M. Brecher and the staff of Consumer's Union summed it up  in the 1972 book \"Licit and Illicit Drugs.\" They said. \"Prohibition doesn't work. It should work, but it doesn't.\"  I don't believe there is any indication that prohibition actually keeps people from using drugs. It certainly didn't keep anybody who wanted a drink from getting one in the 1920s. Al Capone and the other bootleggers were happy to help out. \n\nAll prohibition does is change the supplier, from somebody legal that you can keep an eye on, to an illegal drug dealer over whom you have no control. It also breeds contempt for the law, corruption, and violence. In sum, I believe the negative effects of a prohibition on society far outweigh any slight benefit it might have.\n\nDrug use can indeed be a problem, but it is a medical and social problem, not a law enforcement problem. Our law enforcement personnel are generally excellent, but it is unfair to ask them to be medical doctors and social workers. They aren't trained for it and the unique tool they have to work with (the ability to arrest people) is no way to deal with a person who has a drug problem. \n\nBesides doing little or nothing to actually help a person with a drug problem, arresting them costs money! Trials cost money. Putting them in prison costs even more money.  Why spend all that money on enforcing a prohibition that doesn't work when decent drug treatment and counseling -- things that actually work -- cost a fraction as much?\n\nI hope you drop your plans for this proposed rule.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2534","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephen Of Maine","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not support the scheduling of kratom.

While Kratom cannot elminate my severe headaches, it has given me a quality of life and sense of well being that I would not otherwise have.  The thought of living without Kratom absolutely terrifies me.\n\nPlease, I beg, do not take away the only relief I have for the head that is my challenge on more levels than I can herein express.  I cannot imagine the fog I would live in and the depression it would cause, should Kratom be taken away from me.\n\nOther than my family, Kratom is the only lifeline I have.  If you take away Kratom, you will take away quality of life for me and countless others.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13532","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mary Godwin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've had back surgery and been hooked on oxycodone for several years until I heard on the news about kratom.\n\nsince then I have been using it for about two years.

Before jumping ahead of any research I feel it is in the best interest of the public, to the millions of people who benefit from kratom, to give this plant a fair chance and not go making criminals out if otherwise law abiding citizens in this country. Please reconsider your stance on this life changing plant. With the opiate deaths in this country, I believe kratom could be of benefit in saving millions of lives. Also, I've watched m mother who suffers from fibromyalgia stay on the couch or in her bed all my life. I'm 24 years old now. She's been prescribed every drug on and off label for fibro with no relief. This took time away we should have had together as a family, though she wasn't the blame. The condition is. However,  after she found kratom, about 3 years ago, she has become a lady engaged in life. She cleans her house now.  She can spend the day shopping with me!  She is partaking in our family like never before! Please do not take this plant from her and millions like her who use it to be present with their families. We need our family members,   Please stick to the original idea of what the DEA was meant to do. Protect the people if the USA.

I offer my testimonial in candor and from the bottom of my heart. \n\nI keenly oppose the proposal to schedule  Kratom: a tried and true means of helping people live happy and meaningful lives.\n\nMy background: I am a sales/retail store manager, and work in the natural health and wellness industry.  My career is dependent on my knowledge of supplements, as well as running a business and my ability to successfully develop my employees.\n\nI started out working as a vet tech for many years. Around the same time that I became disenchanted with the field, I fell ill. A slew of specialists, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, etc could not figure out what was wrong with me.  This was in the age of loose prescribing standards in FL, and the result was a hefty diet of narcotics.\nMoving up north, I was promptly cut off from pain killers without so much as a taper. In my youth and desperation, I turned to heroin for pain management and to alleviate undeniable withdrawal.\nDuring this period of time, I self educated and began trying natural remedies. This is how i came across Kratom. It worked with my body better than any pharmaceutical or illicit drug could. It allowed seamless cessation of heroin, and the shame associated with it.   It has been 3 years since, and I haven't and will not ever look back.\n\nAlmost instantaneously, I began advancing in my career and interpersonal affairs. To this day, numerous friends/family have commented on my progress. I have become a key player in my company, and without hesitation I insist that in my history of chronic pain and depression, Kratom has vastly improved my quality of life. It allows me to be a productive member of society. Furthermore, Kratom has served as a tool to support my foundation, allowing for me to excel in life.  I work 50-60 hours a week, have a family and home, pay my taxes, and have never been arrested.  Please be aware that those impacted by this ban are model citizens.\n\nNot once has it offered a 'buzz', it simply takes the pain away. Every morning upon waking I immediately crave coffee. This must be coupled with a cigarette. Without both I am grumpy and cynical. My first dose of kratom comes much later in day, and if delayed I do not mind. Point being that perfectly legal poison is ten times more addictive than my Kratom habit. Kratom is also ten times more benevolent.  Does it cause dependence?  Sure, but nothing substantial that i have experienced in discontinuation.  It is not black and white, and Kratom is the lesser of many evils.\n\nIn a perfect world it would not be necessary, but this world is far from.  American citizens are plagued by maladies ranging in diagnosis.  The options available and prescribed are often coupled with side effects that can make the initial disease pale in severity.  Kratom does not cure any more than prescribed treatments, but it works in offsetting symptoms, providing an incredibly SAFE and effective management of illness(the words safe and effective rarely go hand in hand, as you know).\n\nThis past summer, my friend who introduced me to heroin passed away by OD. This was the third person in my life to meet this fate. It breaks my heart to imagine the lives who can use this plant to conquer their addictions, simply not having access to such. Countless others will benefit from using Kratom as a dietary supplement. I know my story, while my own, is not novel and that I am not alone.  \nI would think the overwhelming support for this entheogen would be more helpful than perfect, tactful wording.\n\nRegulation can be as simple as what my multivitamin says on the label: not intended to treat or cure any illness or disease, not FDA regulated.\n\nPlease don't take away Kratom. Centuries of traditional use clearly depict it's utility, the good outweighing any bad.  Scheduling the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine would be a devastating blow to the American people, life is already too hard.\n\n\nWith respect, outlawing Kratom will be a travesty to every American who uses Kratom, or knows a Kratom user.\nI implore your organization to regard all testimonials and medical studies in reaching an educated decision.\nThank you for your consideration and allowing the community to comment.  \n\nSincerely,\nDanielle M Cifelli","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17822","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Danielle Cifelli","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sirs,\n\nMy name is Shawn Crawley. I am 37 years old. I am a factory maintenance worker at a 6 story chemical plant. I have been in maintenace for the last 10 years so i have back and knee pain. I heard about kratom from a friend at work a few months ago and i am very impressed with it. \n\nI would like to address my concerns about the DEA's attempts to add kratom to the schedule 1 controlled substance list. I believe that schedule 1 controlled substances are highly addictive. If that is the case, by definition alone kratom should not be on the list. Kratom is non-addictive which is why I choose to use it instead of opiod pain relievers. My town and the surrounding communities are being destroyed by heroin.  The doctors are prescribing hydrocodone like it is aspirin. Their is a direct link between hydrocodone and herion addiction. Kratom has all of the pain relieving qualities as hydrocodone and none of the side effects. Again it is NOT ADDICITIVE. Please at least give myself and others the chance to make our own decicions on whether to use kratom as it is a natural pain reliever. In my opinion opiods should be harder to get than they are and kratom should be the substitute.\n\nIn conclusion please do not put kratom on the schedule 1 controlled substance list. \n\nSincerely,\n\nShawn Crawley","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11792","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"shawn crawley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To the deputy administrator of the drug enforcement agency of the United States, hello my name is Brett Davis of Rockwall Texas I am urging you to keep kratom  as an unscheduled substance in the United States. \n\nOver the past 23 years,  I have seen 15 neurologists , four pain management specialist, five dentist  and four  doctors of osteopathy  trying to find relief from my atypical facial pain/ atypical trigeminal neuralgia, hemi crania  continua.

Coffee is much too intense for me and makes me jittery and dehydrated and just generally unsettled, not to mention the crash. When my boss showed me Kratom I was amazed.

At the time I submitted that, I hadn't yet tried kratom. I have done a lot of reading and my own research into this plant. I want to let you know that I was skeptical about Kratom for a long time, and I wish I wouldn't have waited so long to try it. I have a bulging disc that causes sciatica and I haven't found something to relieve the pain. Anti-inflammatory medications do not touch it, and I do not want to have to take opiate pain killers or tramadol every day. I take muscle relaxers for the spasming, but I don't even like to take those daily. I have been in physical therapy for 6 months, this has helped, but is not curative. I do not like to take pills and most muscle relaxers make me too drowsy to perform at work. So I just end up being painful. I'm tired of the pain, so I tried kratom. I was so in disbelief that it would help, but it worked. I was pain free all day, and I couldn't even remember the last time I felt like that! Once you have lived with chronic pain, you don't know what normal feels like anymore. I would love to see some research into kratom, I really do think that it has great medicinal value. Please reconsider the scheduling of this plant. It surely does not warrant a scheduling by the DEA! I did not feel intoxicated at all and my pain was relieved! There is a great medicinall value to kratom. Please take into consideration my story along with the others you have received. I plan to spread the word about Kratom and it's benefits to those I know that suffer from chronic pain from joint disease, multiple surgeries, and sciatica. I see a lot of potential with Kratom and I hope it remains available to use in its natural form. \n\nBest Regards,\nAmanda Bright\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7260","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amanda Bright","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep Kratom legal. It is NOT a drug of abuse, or addictive in powdered leaf form. If there is any concern, then you should simply keep it ages 18 and up, and consider limiting the sale of potent extracts. \n\nThis is not something people use to get high. It is an important herbal medicine. People with chronic pain use this so they won't get addicted to opiates, assuming they even have access to those in the first place. People also use Kratom to safely withdraw from opiate addiction, much better than methadone which simply replaces one drug addiction with another. Most people with chronic pain have little or no access to pharmaceutical solutions, because doctors give us nothing but ineffective NSAIDS with a million reasons to deny us anything that actually works against severe pain. People with depression and anxiety that either doesn't respond to prescriptions, or the people cannot afford prescriptions, can and do effectively treat it with Kratom. Chronic pain and depression and can be crippling and prevent people from being able to work for a living. With Kratom we can go to work, take care of ourselves, and be productive citizens, all without addiction, side effects, or any harm to ourselves or others.\n\nPeople cannot overdose on Kratom. If you take too much you will simply vomit it back up. I know about the stories of the whole entire 15 people who supposedly died of it. Far more people have died from energy shots, and those aren't being considered for a ban. People die from alcohol every day and that's legal... but 15 questionable situations with Kratom, and it's a reason to consider banning it? I think not. Those people may have taken Kratom but they were also on other drugs that were actually responsible for their deaths. The fact that they also took Kratom is not causative. \n\nThousands of people need access to this simple leaf to treat pain just as people take vitamins or aspirin every day without needing government interference. Kratom is safe and effective. Please leave it alone.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1344","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Miranda Guy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My Name is Carole I will 64 yrs. old next month.

I also spent 5 years working in a drug rehabilitation center.  \nI shared my work experience to show how active I was.  while taking pain medication my whole life changed, I no longer wanted to be at social activities.  I was unable to work and became depressed.  I had to keep increasing the amount of pain medication for it to work at all.  I had become addicted to pain medication after using them over the course of 7 years.  I was hopeless.  when I started taking kratom my world turned around I first of all got off of the pain medications. I started helping at the Salvation Army Corps where my husband is a minister.  I am able to feel like a productive citizen.\n\nI have paid taxes all of my life worked hard.  Now that I am in my senior years I would like to enjoy and still be able to contribute to society.

I am opposed to placing Kratom on the schedule one list of dangerous drugs. I have been taking Kratom now for almost 4 years. I found out about It while researching methods to alleviate my back and joint pain. I was diagnosed with severe arthritis in my lower spine and joints 15 years ago. Over the years I have tried numerous types of physicall therapy, medical devices, medication, and  eventually I had the need for surgery.  I was forced to take pain medication to help me function on a daily basis as a wife, mother, and teacher. However, the medication  comes with very dangerous and undesirable side effects. I finally decided that my life was not worth living feeling as I did. I became depressed and lost due to the mental effects of the pain medication.  I could not function and was miserable.  And then, searching for something to help me get on the medication I found the miracle herb called Kratom.   It has changed my life. After I weaned myself off of the medication very painfully, I began taking Kratom to help me reach that goal. Not only did it help the withdrawal symptoms but it helped treat my daily pain thereafter. I have been taking one teaspoon 3 times a day for the last 4 years and have never had to increase my dose or had any ill effects what so ever from this herb. Unlike the medication doctors prescribed me, I could function with a clear head and less pain. I have been off meds completely and thrive as a mother, wife, and teacher. I am simultaneously getting my masters in ABA therapy to further my career and become an autism specialist.

I am incredibly thankful that you have allowed the public to comment on this issue. My life was changed by Kratom. I was seriously addicted to opiates of the prescription and non-prescription type for multiple years. This addiction caused my to dropout of school twice due to poor grades. I tried using a Suboxone maintenance program, but that also failed. It fixed the physical cravings, but it could not help the psychological cravings. Kratom addresses both. \n\nI have been using Kratom daily for around 2 years, along with a year or so of psychological therapy visits. In that time period I have returned to my university, I have held a 4.00 for the entire time I have been back, and I have not once thought about using an opiate. \n\nI consider myself incredibly lucky. I live in Ohio, the epicenter of the fentanyl laced heroin breakout. If I had not discovered Kratom two years ago, there is no doubt in my mind that I would be on a slab in the morgue. \n\nLet me tell you a story, about how I see a Kratom ban going. A few years back you and the FDA issued strict prescription guidelines to physicians, so naturally the street supply of prescription opiates dried up. The demand never changed, so in swoops the underground produced opiates that have flooded our streets. They realize that selling real heroin is expensive, so they cut it with one of the most deadly drugs (per microgram) on the earth. Hundreds die. The DEA swoops in again, and says that they want to remove a plant that in comparison to the former is relatively safe. Let's say you implement that ban. You have just forced hundreds of thousands of people into a position they did not want to be in. Some of them will be fine, and they will manage, but others will not. Others will not be able to fight the psychological cravings. They will turn to heroin eventually. Hundreds more will die, and it will be directly caused by your actions. Kratom can help America end this epidemic. I implore you to see reason, and to not add Kratom to the list of schedule one drugs. I don't want to see anyone else die, and I hope you do not either. \n\nIn conclusion I would like to say that it is in the public's best interest that Kratom remain legal. It is the best tool we have to end the heroin epidemic. This is a plant that not only can help addicts break the cycle, but it can also help chronic pain patients get off the opiates, and remove themselves from the stranglehold that their pain holds them in. Kratom saved my life. Full stop. I would most likely not be here today had I not discovered it. Please contact me for any follow up, and although my story is anecdotal, I would graciously accept any invitation to speak with anyone who wants to hear how kratom has saved my life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0978","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Miles McGrew","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI would like to state that kratom has been a major help in living my day to day life.

Where do you suppose these people in legitimate pain will go ? A VET does not hesitate to prescribe pain medication to a dog when indications of pain are there but yet you want to dictate how the American Society should treat pain patients all based on Heroin addicts . Its disgusting and you could not be further out of touch of what is going on.

Recently I wrote in my book called The Existential Stone which is the sequel to my book called The Sin-Eater of Itheum, a chapter called Kratoma.

There were other drugs, and, occasionally Redemption; sometimes rare artifacts, origins unknown, canvas art, sculptures, musical instruments and all the stolen or illegal items that had found buyers on distant planets.  How or why the drugs had come to be classified as Level One, that is to say, supremely dangerous, is a matter of political conjecture.  But the fact was that it allowed for fabulous profit for those willing to take the risk of discovery.\n\n   The herb of Galactic choice was called Kratoma.  Made from a rare tree grown only on the planet Earth, the drug helped ease emotional pain as well as physical.  It simply worked, allowing peoples of all species to once more become functional within their societies and upon their planets.  It cut down on suicides, allowed beings of every species to once more experience laughter and joy, and brought the incredible benefit of HOPE.\n\n  Kratoma now accounted for 62% of the business of the White Mask.

Side benefits seemed to be that I also lost interest in drinking alcohol and it seemed to improve my ability to concentrate on complicated tasks at work.\n\nI think allow the Kratom market to remain as it is will only help the DEA fight the opiod crisis from the other angles.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5177","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W\n\nI am a 31 year old Husband and Father who provides well for my family working as a Mechanical Engineer.

I am not even a user of kratom, but I very much support keeping kratom legal for the people that NEED it.\n\nSpecifically, many Americans who have found relief from various ailments through Kratom. \n\nPeople would much rather take a 100% natural substance that is minimally harmful (if harmful at all) than take a multitude of prescriptions. Prescriptions can be very expensive for some people. Prescriptions often cause physical dependence. Some prescriptions have very harmful side effects, which cause a chain reaction in which more prescriptions are needed to counter more and more side effects from the pharmaceuticals.\n\nBanning kratom is not just irresponsible--it is stupid.\n\nPlease listen to the evidence -- even if it is anecdotal evidence. Keep it legal while it IS studied at the very least. I am not ready to deal with the fallout from all the harm a kratom ban will cause. I don't want to see my veteran friends have to return to taking pain medicine, anxiety medicine, sleep medicine, etc.... when they get all of that relief from a couple of kratom drinks a day.\n\nFurthermore, I have read the DEA's proposal on the ban. If this is supposed to be \"evidence\" that could support a ban, then why hasn't laundry detergent been places on the controlled substance list? An astronomically more calls are made to poison control about that than about kratom. \n\nWhy in the heck is alcohol still legal? We hear about those numbers all the time....yet it is available on every corner. Just think about that. 88,000 deaths due to alcohol from 2006-2010. Can we go ahead and ban that too?\n\nTo the very vast majority of Americans, this ban doesn't just seem unjustified. It seems ludicrous. It seems silly. Those whom are informed about kratom view this ban as silly, and quite frankly, it makes our Drug Enforcement Agency seem like a bunch of idiots to the entire world. Focus your efforts on fighting drugs that are harmful. Those that kill. Those that people kill over. \n\nKratom is natural. Kratom is safe. It poses no danger to anyone except for those people that are allergic(if that's possible).","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6534","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"C Sutton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Beat depression with krytom","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22602","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mike Derryberry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I will first say say that i've been using kratom EVERY DAY for the last 26 months after using narcotic pain meds and other prescription  drugs to regulate my pain.

About 10 years ago I was diagnosed with spinal stenosis. The pain in my neck and should was unbearable. Of course my doctor prescribed opioids in an effort to control the pain. While he was well meaning, he also set me on the path of opioid addiction. For more than 10 years I was taking 150 painkillers a month and was hopelessly addicted. That addiction almost ruined my life. One day I decided I had had enough and was going to quit cold turkey. I was afraid that I'd never be able to break free of the pills and get my life back. I went online and discovered something called Kratom. I had never heard of Kratom before but I read many stories of how this natural and amazing plant had helped so many control their withdrawal symptoms after quitting prescribed painkillers. I decided to give it a try and much to my amazement, it not only made quitting opioids bearable, it also worked wonders on my neck and shoulder pain. The pain was nearly gone and quitting the pills become...well...easy. I finally have my life back thanks to Kratom. I am working and have once again become a productive member of society. My pain is under control and I no longer take anything stronger than aspirin. Kratom is a godsend to me and the millions and millions of people in this country who face similar circumstances. I beg of you, please do not ban this amazing and natural product. I may not have survived without it.\n\nRegards,\n\nMark Crosby","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18494","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Crosby","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is a natural plant with no bad effects reported in all the years its been used.

She has chronic migraines, depression and anxiety, asthma, and scoliosis.  Most of these problems are a result of her being born with congenital agenesis of the left lung, which means she was born with only one functioning lung.\n\tUp until 2007 she had a measure of good health and was able to graduate from college and begin working as a high school teacher.  At that time, the migraine headaches became so debilitating and constant that she was no longer able to work.  She began seeking medical treatment.  She was prescribed a lot of different medicines which would provide only temporary relief at best, but also came with many negative side effects.  She became very withdrawn and slept most of the d\nay.  This went on for many years having serious effects on our quality of life and put a strain on our marriage.  We felt very hopeless that things would ever improve.\n\tThen in January of 2016 she read an article about kratom and how it helped many to cope with symptoms similar to hers.  We decided to try it even though we were skeptical because we had tried so many different things and nothing seemed to help.\n\tImmediately after using the kratom, she began to feel normal again.  The migraines improved from every day to only once or twice a month.  She was able to quit taking pain and anti-anxiety medicine which she had been on for years.  We really feel like kratom was an answer to our prayers.  I now have my wife back and our life is finally beginning to normalize again.\n\tIm afraid of what might happen if she were no longer able to obtain kratom freely as needed.  It has no negative effects that I have noticed.

It's so sad to me that something that has the power to help so many people is on the verge of becoming illegal. Opiate use is an epidemic destroying our country. This has the potential to save us from this horrible epidemic. Please do more research on Kratom before making it illegal. I agree that maybe it being regulated wouldn't hurt, but completely cutting off access to it will make people turn back to opiate use, which is so much worse than a natural alternative.\nIn addition to helping people who are addicted to opiates, it helps people that have anxiety. As someone who has struggled with anxiety all my life, I would absolutely prefer a natural substance with few harmful affects over Xanax or any other anti anxiety drug. \nPLEASE do more research on this drug before scheduling it.

Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\n    2.) If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars before ANY potential medicinal/theraputic research can occur.\n    3.) Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever, mood regulator, and even an opioid replacement in some cases.\n    4.) Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n    5.) Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n    6.) Kratom can be effective in combating the symptoms of opioid withdrawal and the dangers of opioid use (especially dangerous/deadly \"street opioids\"), but does not function as an opioid \"mimicker\".    \n\n     We should strive to make informed decisions regarding public policy - especially when health and safety are concerned.

In 2004 I injured my ankle severely and have since had 13 operations in an attempt to correct what is unfortunately a permanent condition involving degenerative joint disorder, arthritis, and debilitating pain. I was sent into pain management programs and given incredibly high doses of oxycodone and oxycontin for pain relief, as it was determined that my symptoms are of a permanent nature. I eventually developed a dependency on my pain medication, not only for pain, but as an addictive substance. I did significant research on the side effects, short term and long term, of the medications I was consuming. I was in shock as I learned how horrible and long lasting the effects could and would be, so I decided to quit taking medication all together. While suffering through the worst kind of withdrawal, I stumbled across Kratom as a supplement to aid in pain and relaxation. I decided to try, as I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. My experience has been nothing but positive. I have wonderful pain relief and I don't suffer from panic attacks like I did while taking narcotics. I sleep well and am able to keep up with daily life as a result of using kratom as a supplement. I only ask this question. How is an herbal and completely natural substance with a very useful purpose being called into question as a dangerous substance when patients have access to hundreds of narcotic pills that can cause birth effects, prevent pregnancy, cause horrible withdrawal symptoms and permanent kidney and liver damage and no questions are asked simply because a doctor's signature is on the prescription pad?

My name is Dale Profit, Im soon to be 50 years old and I currently reside in Caldwell, Idaho.  Yes, thats right the great state of Idaho.  Born and raised.  So I imagine you have the same image as most people.  Farms and ranches, mountains & streams, hunters and hikers.  Well, that pretty much sums up my life.  The rugged outdoors. I raised livestock, rode pens, buckarood and even tried my hand at saddle bronc riding in rodeos. Due to that up-bringing and lifestyle I have sustained numerous bone fractures & injuries.  So I guess I lived the simple life.  Only after numerous injures, some more severe than others.  Some requiring surgery, others casts, splints and such, but all of them required dealing with levels of pain on a daily basis.  \nSadly most every time I was prescribed pain medication.   I, like so many others, became addicted, it was quite frankly a double edged sword.  I needed the pills to function in my everyday life.  I was getting a prescription of a 120 Norcos a month, and to be honest, it was NOT enough.  I became addicted and sick.  I was sent to a pain management clinic, but was told its arthritis exercise and a life time of medication.  I developed high blood pressure, headaches, all requiring more medication.  If I didnt have the pain meds then Id have withdrawal symptoms.  A vicious cycle for sure.\nBut, three years ago, I discovered Kratom.  Finally a product that relieved my back pain to a tolerable level.  It wasnt mind altering and based on my own personal research, had little to no side effects.  Who would have thought after 30 years of pain?  I even talked to my physician about Kratom, who said he thought anything natural that would help, along with alleviate any long term side effects that the pain meds caused, he was all for it. \nChronic pain is tough enough, but addiction?  Its much worse.  When you take away the pain pills and leave me with withdrawals and then still suffering from the chronic pain, how am I supposed to deal with that?  Thats why its so important that you understand how much Kratom has helped me.  Its not a quick fix its a daily regimen.  I would equate it to someone whos on a vitamin regimen.  My wife was diagnosed with a B-12 deficiency, so if she doesnt take her B-12 shes very ill.  That is my plight with Kratom.  Without it, I am in constant and intolerable pain.  But with it, I am truly a functioning member of society, who has managed pain levels without unnecessary side effects.\nPlease do not place Kratom as a Schedule 1 drug.  It saves far more lives than it damages.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1224","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dale Profit","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I feel it would be very irresponsible and a disservice to the public to classify Kratom a schedule A drug without fully examining its possible benefits.

I was new to the world of prescription pain medication, and at the time, did not realize the addictive properties of the pills I was being prescribed. \n\nOver the course of the next two years, there was no attempt by the doctor to taper my dosage or lessen the number of pills that I was prescribed each month. I eventually took it upon myself to request that my prescribed opioid amount be lowered every month. The withdrawals were painful, but after 4 months of self-prescribed \"tapering\", I was off the medication completely. \n\nAfter several weeks, the pain returned, yet I still maintained a commitment to be drug free and chose to deal with the pain rather than be dependent on any medication.\n\nA few months later I heard about a plant called \"Kratom\", and its effects regarding pain management. My friend had been using it as a treatment for his anxiety disorder, and recommended that I try it to alleviate my pain. \n\nI have never really been put much faith in herbal or natural remedies, as I could never really tell if they were working according to their claims, but after taking my first dosage (1 teaspoon), I found that my pain, while not fully dissipated, had substantially subsided. I maintained a regimen of two teaspoons per day for five months. \n\nEventually, I stopped taking kratom as well due to a desire to be unfettered from the burden of taking supplements. Unlike the opioids, when I stopped taking Kratom...there were no withdrawal symptoms. There was not a single physical or mental reaction to the cessation of ingesting this plant.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the DEA's possible ban on Kratom which would classify it as a Schedule 1 drug, millions of Americans may not have the freedom to oversee their pain management as they see fit. The DEA's claim that Kratom is \"an imminent hazard to the public safety\", is nonsense.\n\nPublic opinion leans towards the belief that this action by the DEA is merely an attempt to suppress a business that is in competition with the interests of the pharmaceutical companies under the guise of \"protecting the public\". The DEA seems to be operating merely as guardians of the big-pharma monopoly.  \n\nThe agency also claims there have been \"numerous deaths associated with kratom,\". Such a case does not appear to exist, and most users report that consuming too much kratom will only lead to nausea and vomiting.\n\nOf the 30 total documented deaths associated with kratom around the world, many tests found that subjects had been abusing other drugs or suffering from other pre-existing health conditions. To put that into context, around 25,000 people died from prescription overdoses in the United States in 2014.\n\nIt is preposterous that at a time when this country is seeing the largest opiate epidemic crisis in our history, the DEA is poised to put an inexpensive, all natural alternative in the same category as Heroin and LSD, effectively banning it from all consumption or research.\n\nThe drug war has proven to be a failed policy, yet the government still adheres to the notion that eradication of drugs and addiction is a realistic possibility.\n\nThe CDC reported that poison control centers received over 660 calls between 2010 and 2015 regarding kratom intoxication. These numbers pale in comparison to the death from prescription opioid abuse.\n\nOverdose deaths involving prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999. From 1999 to 2014, more than 165,000 people have died in the U.S. from overdoses related to prescription opioids. In 2014, more than 14,000 people died from overdoses involving prescription opioids.\n\nI feel that the DEA is banning a substance that has potential clinical utility for recovering addicts and people living with pain. Something that has a proven record of accomplishment should be regulated and not banned.\n\nDuring a time when attitudes towards naturally occurring products are becoming more and more acceptable, as in the case of marijuana, it seems that the DEA's threat is a major step backwards. It is an affront to the premise that people are smart enough to make their own choices and decisions for themselves regarding their health.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that without access to Kratom, thousands of people suffering from pain, anxiety disorders and alcohol withdrawals will be forced to seek out these pain pills once more, ultimately creating a black market for these substances. Drug usage alone should not be a moral issue- it is merely a choice some people make, but by making Kratom illegal, the DEA will in fact be creating crime where none had previously existed.\n\nPeople have every right to make their own health decisions as they see fit, and I believe that any naturally occurring herb, plant or leaf, should be a person's right to consume if he or she chooses to do so. \n\nThank you for your time.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15248","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA, i am 64, disabled, on RSDI  with a bullet lodged in my spine at T11. i was a victim of a robbery, \nin 1969, I am a God Fearing man, I am unable to use drugs of any kind ...

In hundreds of years of use it has proven far less harmful than aspirin or caffeine or even salt, which continue to be legal.  Really, this natural herb should be promoted so more people could benefit from it's wonderful properties.\n\nThank you.\n\nAbby Frantz","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20645","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Abby Frantz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a harmless herb that helps people have a better quality of life.

There should be no prohibition. \nWhile the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? \nBecause there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. \nPlus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, \nrespiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying \nto study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. \nMeanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. \nIs the DEA running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA, I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22391","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Kaup","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I respectfully request the DEA to cancel any order of banning Kratom.  In 1997 I fell from the back of a truck while unloading equipment for my place if business.  I fractured my L7 vertebrae, and also had permanent nerve damage. I was told that I would have pain the rest if my life and would have to consider pain killers and or pain management.  At the time of my injury, I also had twin girls of 1years old.  Up until that moment, I rarely took an aspirin, let alone any controlled substance.  My doctor started me out with Darvocet...what turned out to be a prescription for a short time turned into 6 years.  First to help the pain, then after time, turned into addiction. After the Darvocet, my doctor the gave me Tramadol. It too wore off after time, and also became  addictive.  The pain continued, as the addiction did, and the doctor then put me on Oxycotin. That put me into the worst addiction of my life. At 36 I was a functioning addict, going to work, taking my children to school...living a lie, and still dealing with chronic back pain.  Then my doctor stopped the Oxycotin cold turkey, and put me back on Tramadol for 4 more months, then stopping it as well.  Withdrawal set in and in my entire life I had never felt pain or sickness as bad as that.  While still going through withdrawal, a friend told me that I could just order Tramadol over the internet...it was that easy.  So I did, for 2 more years, until I hit rock bottom, with both my health and finances. I knew I withdrawal was around the corner, but I had no other choice. I made it through the other side, and was finally clean, but the back pain was still there and at times unbearable to where I could not move without a tremendous amount of discomfort.  At that point I was clean for 8 months and taking Aleve by the hand fulls, and now my sleeping was becoming an issue.  It was then that my neighbor down our block, who was 74 years old told me about Kratom.  She used hers like a tea, and made a cup every morning for her knee pain and blood pressure, and also drank a cup before bed to help her sleep.  She convinced me to try it, as there were NO side effects or addictive properties to it.  The next day I tried it, and the results were amazing.  My back pain was almost unnoticeable...I seriously cried.  It also lasted almost 8 hours, until I noticed any discomfort, therefore helping me through my work day. At night I took  2 tablespoons before bed and slept for the first time in A VERY VERY LONG TIME.  I have also went a week on vacation without Kratom and had NO withdrawal effects.  My blood pressure has dropped a good bit, to where it's also manageable with my diet.  My point is, I've read a lot about Kratom, it's been used by many for many years, for anxiety, pain, sleep, etc..and never has there been a human overdosing, or dying on it.  It's a natural plant with so many healthily benefits and helping properties.  Why would you want to take that away from us....only to get hooked on, or by pills illegally.  I beg of you to do the home work, listen to us the people that it's helped get their lives back.  By banning Kratom, it's almost certain you're ruining the lives of people, who have seen the horror of addiction, came out of it and live honest productive lives.  Alcohol, cigarettes, are 100 times more addictive, unhealthy, and have killed hundreds.  Why not ban them?  Please do the right thing, and NOT ban KRATOM.  Thank you for listening.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9484","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"NM Olinger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been off the high dose pain medicine my doctor has pushed on me for over a year now and only have done so by the use of Kratom.

I have many friends who take kratom for horrible chronic pain and without it they will feel suicidal, as OTC meds don't do enough to help.\nThis is one of the most benign plants on planet Earth and it does SO much good for SO many people - it really is one of the most harmless plants in our world.\n\nThank you for reading my comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18480","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shel Bradshaw","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"please do not ban kratom and de-schedule marijuana","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22309","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"william benton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not take this wonderful PLANT away from the people of this free country.

After 3 years on it I had had enough and found out about kratom. It took away all my withdrawal symptoms with ZERO side effects. I am not off all drugs and no longer need kratom. If it wasn't for this HARMLESS plant I would still be just another zombie addicted to opiates like so many others in this country. So please a urge you! Do not sceduel this plant!!!!!

I first found out about Kratom about 6 years ago after a back injury got me very close to being addicted to a prescription painkiller. After doing some research I stumbled on kratom and gave it a try. When I took kratom it took away the urge of wanting prescription pain killers and it really had no side effects compared to prescription pain killers. After a few months of taking kratom I decided to stop using it and really didn't have any urge to keep using it. There was barley a noticeable withdrawal effect, I just felt a little off for a couple of days. It was similar to going without caffeine. I recently started using kratom again as a pre workout supplement which I think it works great for. I strongly disagree that this all natural plant should be illegal. I am someone who uses it because I like it,  but there are a lot of people who will relapse back onto dangerous opiate drugs without kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16900","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am fairly new to kratom after my pain clinic was abruptly shut down.

I was prescribed painkillers for almost a decade to help with the pain but unfortunately I became addicted to the medication that was suppose to be helping me live a normal life.  It was not until I found Kratom that I was able to get off of the painkillers and have my life back.  Prescribed painkillers took away my ability to function, think, love, care, and be a rational person.  I had tried to get off the painkillers many times over the last decade but with no luck and I had honestly lost hope that I would ever be released of their grip on my life.  When I found Kratom, all of that changed, I have not had any painkillers since I found Kratom which has been almost a year and without Kratom I would still be under the painkiller spell.  Please do not let the DEA ban an herb that has been used for over one thousand years and is a natural plant that can literally save peoples lives, relieve them of pain, or release from the evil grip of prescription medication.  Kratom was never an issue until recently and I believe that Kratom has soared in popularity because of the massive pain pill addiction problem in this country and as people have found out that they can get their life back with Kratom, Kratom usage has dramatically increased.  Now with the pain pills being regulated more stringently, you are seeing people faced with a choice to either find a way to get off of them or many people as you are probably well aware of are turning to heroine.  PLEASE DO NOT TAKE AWAY OUR RIGHTS TO USE A PLANT THAT GOD PUT ON THIS EARTH THAT CAN HEAL US OF SO MANY AILMENTS.  If Kratom is banned, I assure you that pain pill use, overdoses, and crime will rise as well as the use of heroine as we have already seen in Arkansas.  I can not state the exact facts but I know that after Kratom was banned in Arkansas, overdoses do to pain pills and heroine increased dramatically.  If this message is actually read and nothing else is taken into consideration, please look into the link between big pharmaceutical companies and the DEA.  It is no secret that big pharmaceutical companies are trying to use the natural alkaloids found in Kratom to produce them synthetically and patent them so that they can profit enormously.  Kratom in the correct form is a plant that is finely chopped and turned into a powder, basically dirt.  Please do not take away my chance to live a normal life with my wife and 3 children.  I am so grateful for your time and consideration to this subject which means so much to so many people.

I do not and have never used kratom on a daily basis. I only use kratom when necessary. I am grateful to have found an all natural herbal tea that helps me. I do not believe that the DEA or FDA should either schedule or ban kratom making it unavailable to the people that need it.

I've had countless surgeries due to arthrities etc, and are currently doing RFA injections for lower back and neck, both of which are in bad shape. I'm on and off pharma pain killers, but with the current \"war\" on opioids, people that really need them have a hard time getting them. While all of these pharmaceutical drugs do work and provide relief to some degree, they all come with a host of negative side effects, including dependency/addiction, ref. the much publicized opioid epidemic crisis. I am also at the mercy of my insurance company as to what and how much medication they deem necessary, on occasion overriding my doctors' best medical judgment.\n\nA couple of years ago I discovered Kratom by means of and Internet search for alternative remedies. It is a natural (unadulterated) plant - NOT a drug - and has essentially changed my life. I am no longer beholden to doctors and faceless insurance companies. Kratom works wonders for pain relief and also acts as a mood stabilizer helping me greatly taking the edge of my at times testy temperament due to my pain, and all this without any negative side effects. No drowsiness, no \"cotton head\" and no addiction or bad withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIf my government agencies take the extreme action of criminalizing a natural, harmless herb, I would have to revert to dependency on the Rx medications, with the aforementioned slew of negative side effects.\n\nConsidering the prescription-drug epidemic currently plaguing the nation, with countless overdose deaths daily, I am flummoxed as to why the DEA would even consider banning Kratom, an innocuous plant that besides its beneficial effects for my (and millions others) condition, also has shown great potential in weening addicts off of deadly opioids, including heroin. The negative effects of banning Kratom, on a personal level as well as society at large, cannot be overstated. I implore in the strongest terms possible the DEA to reconsider its stance in this regard.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0499","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marianne Bo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,  I am a 60 year old wife, mother, grandmother & I am able to continue to work full time, at the same place I've worked for the last 29 years because of the benefits I receive from kratom.

I enjoy a successful career in biomedical research, I'm an eagle scout, hold an advanced degree in molecular biology, and have pursued computer technology certifications on the side 'just for fun' recently.  I also take kratom regularly to help with my depression and anxiety.  In my teen and college years I used illicit substances or overconsumed alcohol in an effort to obtain relief from depression related symptoms.  10 years ago, I successfully quit all alcohol and illicit drug use, began exercising regularly and maintaining a reasonably healthy diet - all of which have improved my mindset, motivation and overall outlook on life.  Nevertheless, prior to discovering kratom I was still struggling frequently with strong feeling of depression and anxiety despite significant efforts to be healthy and productive.  After beginning to take a few grams of kratom each day and maintaining the other elements of an overall healthy lifestyle such as diet and exercise, I now feel much more positive, motivated and at peace.  Kratom has been a huge benefit in my life and helped me to reach my full potential in both my personal and professional endeavors.\nThe proposed action by the DEA to schedule and ban kratom will cause significant and immediate harm to many thousands of individuals such as myself who benefit from taking kratom as a supplement.  A ban will significantly slow or stop ongoing research that can help us better understand how kratom should be safely and effectively used.   It's time for US drug policy to move into the 21st century and acknowledge that prohibition of any and all psychoactive substances including plants and herbs is not always in the best interest of public health and can often result in unintended consequence that harm the public (black markets, black market related violence, sale of contaminated materials).  Please do not ban kratom at this time but instead allow research and public opinion to drive policy on how kratom and other herbal supplements are regulated.  \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1089","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"andrew box","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The plant Kratom has greatly changed my quality of life.

Over an 8 year period I made many attempts to stop using opioids and other street and prescription drugs with out success. During my addiction I spent long periods of time unemployed and was not a productive member of society. I committed crimes, such as theft, in order to fuel this addiction. I even was homeless for a period of time. This all was a result of my drug addiction. I visited a number of doctors who diagnosed me as depressed, And was given a number of different medications. None of which I had success with . After my second stint in the county jail, and my 3rd rehabI had a strong desire to never use drugs again but I relapsed. At this time I wanted nothing more in the world then to stop taking drugs, but I just kept going back to them, It was at this time that I found Kratom. I haven't looked back. This plant has improved my life in countless ways. I continue to see a doctor for depression and he is aware I supplement with kratom, He agrees it has been beneficial for me. Two years have passed and I have not taken an opioid, street drugs or drank alcohol. Kratom is only one of several factors which allowed me to improve my life. But Kratom was what gave me the strength to let go of the drugs and gain the tools I needed to become a productive member of society. Since finding kratom and giving up these drugs, I have completed my Bachelor's degree which I had given up on years ago due to my opioid addiction. I have not had a single week without employment. I no longer need Kratom to stay off drugs. But I pray this plant dose not become illegal because I know it can help many others. With an ever increasing opioid epidemic, making this plant illegal will be like throwing fuel on the fire. Thousands of people will not have access to its benifits and will have only harsh opioids to turn to. I also believe kratom should remain a product anyone over the age of 18 can purchase. If it were available only through prescription, those without health insurance would not have access to it because of financial restrictions.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5663","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Hoffman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thanks to kratom I can be the old me pain free play with my 4 year son run with him while we play any sport he wants to play.I can think clearly again because  my anxiety pain and depression is gone.

Kratom has helped me with my social anxiety and to become a more confident, productive, clear-minded individual. Before Kratom, Id always been against taking drugs to help my anxiety since perscription medication drugs are very harmful to our bodies and can become addicting. Sometimes have a gram or two of Kratom in my tea or coffee before starting my day. At night, if I had a stressful day, I'll take a little more to help me sleep. I could go weeks without Kratom and I'll still feel great. Kratom is just a helpful plant that has made me more motivated and happy without a doubt!

A little back ground on me I have many health problems, including Sacroiliac joint disorder, recurring ovarian cysts and extensive damage from a rear end collision. I am in constant treatment whether it be physical therapy, medication, steroid injections etc. Life was already rough for me with my preexisting health conditions, but I managed the best I could. Then in 2014 a lady rear ended me at 60 mph while I was waiting to make a left hand turn. I have herniated disc in my neck and permanent muscle damage as a result. So on top of having non stop sciatica and severe lower back pain and also having the pain from ovarian cysts rupturing, I know suffer from constant pain in my neck from the herniated disc and muscle damage, which cause tensions headaches and a pain so deep and excruciating I would not wish it on my worst enemy. I couldn't work, nothing helped. I was foggy from all the pain medication I was taking, and I still was in pain and couldn't function. I Wasnt the best mother I could be for my son, either. Then I found kratom. And the quality of life it gave back to me was something I never expected to have again. I am able to work full time to support my son, and can give him all the love and attention he needs. He is autistic, so I have to be fully present at all times. I am also a single mother with no support, so not working is not am option for me. If kratom becomes illegal I have no idea what I will do. I won't be able to work again and my son will suffer. Please don't take away something that is a safe and more effective treatment for pain then narcotic medications. The opiate epidemic is real and I fear it will explode if you take kratom from us. Please listen to our stories, and think about how many lives will be affected. I am not a criminal. I am simply the mother of a special needs child, who needs you to look to the person, without judgment and with understanding.

I am an Operations Manager for a 3rd tier manufacturing company in the state of Alabama. Before the state of Alabama made kratom use illegal, I used this natural substance on a daily basis. As someone who suffers from mild anxiety, Kratom served as a safe way for me to relax without drinking alcohol or turning to prescription drugs which cause recessed breathing and impair ones ability to drive. Yes, kratom is an addictive substance like that of caffeine and nicotine, but No, it is not something that is extremely hard to stop using. I was using it on a daily basis for almost two years and I was able to easily quit once it became illegal in my state. This natural substance is something that could be used as an alternative to prescription chemicals and opiates and also as an alternative to heroin users so that they can easily quit and live normal lives. Kratom alkaloids bind to the brains opiate receptors like prescription opiates and heroin but does not involve the risk of overdose. Kratom does not slow your heart beat or cause recessed breathing which has killed millions of heroin and prescription pain medicine users when they overdose. This substance is an alternative to those suffering from the opiate epidemic in our country who could die of overdose. Please do not make kratom illegal. This natural substance needs to be studied so that it can heal our country of the opiate epidemic.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17428","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Rubio","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban this substance.

I'm writing about my belief that Kratom does not belong on the Schedule 1 controlled substance list, and that banning the plant would cause harm and suffering to me and to millions of people. I've lived a pretty straight-laced life and would not be commenting here if my personal research and experience had led me to believe that Kratom is addictive like opioids or illegal drugs, is dangerous to people using it, or is similar to a street drug used recreationally and and with a high incidence of death. I take Kratom to improve my life by helping me deal with physical pain, depression and the lack of motivation caused by these problems. I dont want to get high, and Kratom does not cause that effect.  Actually taking too high a dose makes people nauseous and vomit. Opioids pain medicine prescribed by my doctors made me feel nauseous, dizzy and gave me migraines after taking it. Learning about the potential for abuse of and addiction to opioids led me to look for alternatives. Many people have turned away from opioids and street drugs to Kratom to help feel healthier, and banning it would force people to turn back to dangerous legal medications and illicit drugs. \n\nMany people have already cited scientific sources and referenced letters of support for Kratom remaining legal from Congress, doctors, therapists, other professional people and military vets with PTSD and pain. I wanted to add my story and support for keeping Kratom legal. It is a plant, a natural supplement. I don't believe it is safer nor more dangerous than taking other OTC herbal supplements, vitamins or unregulated food supplements that people use every day.  None or them are regulated or overseen by FDA. I understand that additional scientific research would be beneficial and methods to ensure its purity and safety would be welcome, but to classify it as a Schedule 1 controlled substance like heroin, LSD or HDMA would be injurious to many Americans and a big mistake. \n\nI started using Kratom only this year after feeling like my life was being ruined by chronic pain and depression. I have limited mobility from back and knee pain that has kept me from doing activities that normal people do, like working, shopping, walking the dog, doing house chores. The conventional medical system has helped me somewhat, but I needed to find more reliable alternatives that could actually help me meet some goals in life. Kratom is the most effective means I've found to safely help me feel physically better and feel motivated to do positive activities in my life. I have worked with pain doctors in the military health system and civilian sector, have had procedures and operations on my back and knees, done extensive physical therapy, and used Percocet to lower pain. I receive treatment for depression with psychiatrist prescribed medicines and by seeing a mental health counselor. Doctors have provided me with the best treatments that they can. The treatments have not provided the relief Ive needed, but Kratom has allowed me to live a decent life. If I lose the legal right to use Kratom, a safe natural supplement, my life will change for the worse.

At the end of last school year, I separated my shoulder and found myself in extreme pain that required months of physical therapy before I could even think about returning to work over the summer, which is the only time that I have available during the year to work as an engineering student.  After leaving the emergency room, I was given prescription opiates that while helping the pain, really made me feel lethargic and unhappy.  Around this time, I was introduced to kratom, and my pain management completely changed.  I no longer moped around the house all day, but I had a comfortable amount of energy and no pain at all.  I had completely stopped taking the opiates I was prescribed and continued with kratom for the rest of my physical therapy.  After leaving PT, I was cleared to go back to work, and I had to make up for lost money that I was unable to work for during the majority of the summer.  As a young adult, the only worthwhile jobs available to entry level people involve manual labor.  I began working a 4am(sometimes 2am) shift at a grocery store, and after I realized that I was still not making enough money, I had to pick up a second job working for a cabinet company.  My shoulder took a lot of beating over the course of the summer, but thanks to kratom I diddn't have to worry about not being able to carry out my jobs. \n\nPain management isn't the only thing that kratom helped with either.  Working from 2am to 5pm will wear anybody down.  More often than not as a young adult, I would also be out socializing until later at night as well, leading to regularly only getting 2-3 hours of sleep.  Even on the worst mornings, taking kratom with my morning coffee would wake me up and I would be ready to take on the day. After leaving my first shift at the store, I would sometimes find myself mentally fading, but with some more kratom and coffee, I would be ready to take on whatever needed to be done at my 2nd job.\n\nKratom is an inexpensive plant that helps people quit harder opiates, relieves pain, gives energy, and most importantly it does not intoxicate the user.  Never in my time taking kratom have I felt that I was unable to operate machinery or accomplish tasks to my best ability.  \n\nThank you for taking my comments into consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20362","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"PLEASE DONT BAN KRATOM!!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19012","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"kristin hussey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Adam Taylor \nAge 25\nOccupation: Procurement Professional \n\nI have been a long time athlete, and developed a litany of injuries.

I started using kratom with my mom who is 58 years old, when her doctor recommended it for her Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, and cronic fatigue syndrome. My mom has been sick my whole life in and out of doctors. She has been put on tons of prescription medications over the years as well tons of alternatives from health food stores such as GNC. When the doctor told her about this wonderful herb, she had me help her research it. We have both been using this daily for almost a year. She gave it to me when I had a terrible headache. It cured the pain. I also have been using it since as a alternative to coffee. I take this every morning in capsule form. Kratom has cured my headaches, which I used to get daily.I do not abuse this herb neither does my mom, we use this responsibility as a medicine. I'm begging you please do not ban this miracle herb, not just for my sake, but I don't want to lose my Mom again. For the first time in 28 years she is able to truly be a mother and not be stuck in bed sick all day.

I am a free, consenting responsible young adult who intends to contribute to society and better myself alongside my fellow man and woman. Kratom does give me a few hours out of the week where I feel a brief relaxation, and an occasional needed mood lift. This proposed ban represents the death of an archaic system where we as a people have decided to prohibit substances. The uproar of kratom takers is unprecedented, this is the last straw. Prohibition leads to addiction and crime. Regulation allows for responsible contributing adults to make informed decisions and benefit their community.

With that said I would have to say, calling it an epidemic, or saying it's like \"legal heroin\", is very inaccurate, and uneducated. Even at high doses, it does not provide a very pleasurable experience. I remember years ago when I first discovered the plant, I over did it a few times, and got very nauseous. Not very enjoyable. I feel the overdosing on Kratom alone, and I stress alone, would be near impossible. I'm no scientist, but just the fact that you have to consume so much plant matter speaks for itself. The body isn't used to that much fiber. High fiber foods are 2-3 grams per serving. If we're talking about high doses of Kratom, 12-18 grams just wouldn't seem appealing to most. We know people have a problem with moderation. I'll just mention, take a look at the statistic of alcoholism, or alcohol consumption, in America. It's horrifying. I heard on the radio, that Heroin related deaths, have now out numbered, traffic related(alcohol related or not) deaths, and homicide. Now that is something we call an epidemic. Now, this is a Wisconsin statistic, one of the 5 states that banned Kratom. Is this a coincidence? Kratom has been proven to be a huge help in the recovery of heroin addicts. How can we overlook something that is helping the remedy of our current Heroin problem. There is always going to be a handful of those who give something a bad name, by acting irresponsibly. Lets not take all the great benefits it offer to most, because of people acting irresponsibly. Again, I will mention alcohol. This is a known poison. This is a known killer. We can slap a disclaimer on it that says, \"Drink Responsibly\" and all is well. I saying right now, all is not well. I've lost too much from alcohol. A disclaimer won't bring back my best friend. He wasn't responsible enough, or able to practice enough self-control. His death will forever effect my life, and his other friends, and family. This is just one incident. Lets think about everyone who has passed, from alcohol related incidences. Some not even the one acting irresponsibly. The precious disclaimer did nothing to save all those lives. Yet I walk past numerous places that are legally selling it, and giving people a venue to consume it. I think potential misuse of the Kratom plant, should be far from the top of our list of priorities. I agree that we as a nation, should do more research on the plant. Professional research on it's benefits, as well as any potential hazards. I think this will take a long time. So let's focus on more pressing issues, like the ones I've mentioned above. I think taking away someone's morning tea, which helps them get through a day of chronic pain, is counteractive. I know it takes money out of \"Big Pharmacy's\" pocket. Which is less revenue that the government can tax. I sure hope that's not a factor. Taking away the tea, and replacing it with oxycodone, or hydrocodone, is no answer. That is just asking for more addiction, more overdoses, more recovery. In wrapping up, I must say that the BEA's approach to market Kratom more responsibly, through honesty, is a great and appropriate movement. Its a huge industry. A taxable industry. So all vendors selling it as \"incense\" or for \"research only\", can just sell it for what it is to most...medicine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23200","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom saved my life in 2012 from opiate addiction.

From what I understand, there are many people in my area alone that have used Kratom to get themselves off of pharma drugs which they had become addicted to. In my opinion, prohibiting Kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose, and who wants that?\n\nPersonally, I think that Kratom is a GOOD thing.  Furthermore, people have used it to reduce pain. I myself have RA and though I'm not at the stage to need anything for that pain \"at the moment\"  it won't be long before I'll need to manage it. In that case I would prefer to use this natural plant. \n\nAnother point is that ONCE AGAIN... making the plant illegal is only going to make criminals out of good people, just like what has  happened with cannabis. I am against using prisons for profits!!  We are ALL aware of this \"game\" now.  The War on Drugs has had a catastrophic impact on the trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Believe me I know, as I am an Officer's widow. We need to \"restore\" that trust, and allowing for research and regulation of drugs like kratom will be a significant step. \n\nI appreciate your taking the time to read this. \nYours Truly, Joan Wiersma  ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17308","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joan Wiersma","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For me Kratom has been very beneficial.

I strongly oppose the DEA  placing kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. I was first introduced to kratom by a United States Air Force Veteran.  He and I had been working together with a supplement plan to help him for the previous seven years.  We had some success, but he still lacked a full quality of life he should have been experiencing at his young age. I began to research the chemicals naturally present in the plant and agreed to monitor his progress.  His pain management with significant enough, I decided to also give it a try.  I have Elhers-Danlos and RA.  After working 6 hours, I would return home and was done for the night.  My husband was left to care for the home and the children, as I many nights couldn't walk.  I lived on high doses of turmeric, fish oil, and  over the counter aleve/ tylenol/ or ibuprofen,  as I refused to take the Rx pain relievers that had been offered to me by my physician.  I have four children and work full time, I couldn't sleep walk through my days.  I took my first 1/2 teaspoon of kratom in late June of 2016. Over the next two weeks, I took it every day, twice a day.  I felt more energy right away.  My husband noticed I was no longer sitting down as soon as I got home, I was participating more at home, even after a long day. I didn't notice the full benefits consciously until I ran out pf the little sample I had received to try.  A few days into not taking it, the pain in my hips after work reawakened.  I hadn't realized it was even gone, it was so subtle and aside from more energy, I honestly said to my friend that I couldn't even tell I was taking anything, no fogginess or weird feelings. Currently, I am able to drink the tea on occasion, as needed and find the same pain relief with a very small half teaspoon of dried leaf as when I first started trying it with a scheduled dosing plan.  It's been 5 months and I have recommended it to my father who was taking 40mg of morphine plus dilaudid every day for chronic pain (he is no longer taking either)  and many other friends and family members.  We are so grateful to have a natural plant with minimal side effect risks to return our quality of life! Please reconsider your stance and allow us the freedom to choose our own healing methods.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15517","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jacquelyn Edwards Rowe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To  whom it may concern;\n \n   My name is Beth Helton and this is my personal experience with Kratom and how it has affected my life.\n I personally am not a kratom user however my life has been greatly impacted by the effects of Kratom. \nMy fianc is a user of Kratom. Back 5 years ago he was suffering from chronic pain in his hip which was making everyday activities and being a floor installer  a lot harder on him. He went to a doctor who took X-rays and diagnosed him with perthes a degenerative cartlidge disease. The X-ray revealed that his hip bone was in the shape of an ice pick and he no longer had any cartridge left son it was straight bone on bone grinding. It was causing tons of pain and was effecting his sciatic nerve and would leave him in tears after a long day of work and being a father to two little girls his life revolves around being up and moving, piggy back rides, and dancing with daddy. But he was in so much pain he couldn't do those things. His doctor who he was seeing at that time referred him to s specialists who decided his best relie for pain was painkillers. Instant relief he said. He was put on tramadol and after 2 weeks he had gone through a whole prescription which should of lasted a month. He went to his doctor and said they weren't strong enough and he had to take doubt to feel relief. His doctor then prescribed him something stronger loratabs. He asked his specialist what can they do long term to help maybe a hip replacement is something to look into and the specialist said, \" no you are to young.\" He advised him to get with a primary doctor who would help manage his pain pills and surgery will be something to consider later down the road for now this will be a bandaid. What a nightmare that would become. We found a primary doctor who was happy to help feed him more pills. Never asking why or giving advise on new pain management treatments or any  physical therapy options. The next 3 years of our family's life had become a living nightmare. The man, the father, the son, the husband to be was gone. Our family was torn to pieces and hurting bad. During those 3 years I as a mother had to fight to protect my children from this lunatic and mad man he had become. My children where hurting and scared of their daddy most days. He was distant, cold, and heartless.  He no longer had time to spend with his children his time was occupied being in a comatose state after a long day of work and he had begun eating 12 to 14 pills a day of loratabs. He would spend his time in search of anything to feel again. He began trying new drugs just looking for that high again and drinking extremely heavy (a whole handle of tequila in a night). He was mixing his pills with other drugs and is was a roller coaster ride of highs and lows. From one day to the next it was a guessing game of how the day would go. He over dosed a few times. He would pass out in mid sentence, he would ramble on and make no since of what he was saying. He would become withdrawn and sketchy. And into the last year he began being abusive mentally, emotionally, and physically. We tried on several occasions to get him help and sober. We tried getting him off the pills but the withdrawals were unbearable for him. He had lost weigh and become very sickly looking. He was killing himself and there was no getting through to him.  After 3 years and many attempts I finally gave him the only option left he gets clean and off the pills no matter how hard the pain would be and find a docto to do the surgery or a new treatment that was safer or I would leave him and take the kids and never come back. He swor he'd get sober and didn't wanna lose his family. We began looking into new treatments. After many attempts he finally found what saved his life. KRATOM!  The last 2 years he has been completely clean and hasn't turned back. Kratom gave him his life back. He no longer drinks alcohol like he did before or has urges to get high on drugs. He has become a better man then before. He works hard to give his family everything they need and is happy and content. He no longer has to deal with pain the way he did before. Kratom has helped manage his longer term issues with his hip and as well got his through the with drawls after getting off the pain killers 2 years ago. He swears by Kratom and has even been able to reach out to others who have suffered drug problems, pain killer addictions and alcoholism and have changed their life's for the good since taking Kratom. I may not be a Kratom user myself but I've seen the benefits of Kratom as an outsider. My children and I have gotten back the man we love and are proud of the man he has become. Kratom saved his and our life's.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21812","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Beth Helton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using kratom for close to a decade. I started using it years ago to help with sleep and mood. It has helped me tremendously in social situations as well. I used to be somewhat anxious around lots of people and new people especially. Kratom has helped me to interact better with others even when I don't take it now. I have never experienced any negative side-effects from it. I have never experienced any withdraw from it either and can stop taking it at any time for days, weeks or months without any issues or withdrawal symptoms whatsoever. Kratom has been a miracle for me!\n\nI have a friend that was addicted to strong painkillers for years. He overdosed on several occasions. I thought that I was going to lose him. He had tried to detox and stop taking painkillers but was unable due to the horrible withdraw symptoms, physical and mental addiction. He reluctantly decided to try kratom to help him taper off of painkillers. That was almost five years ago, and he has been drug free this entire time! He told me that he has his life back! He is an active functioning member of society again and a hard worker! He was able to stop taking painkillers altogether and told me he barely had any withdraw while stopping the painkillers and using kratom. He told me he doesn't even use kratom on a regular basis now and had no withdrawal symptoms when stopping the kratom!\n\nI know many others whose lives have been positively changed by kratom. Some have suffered from chronic pain and kratom has reduced or eliminated their pain while allowing them to function, unlike strong prescription pain-killers that almost always cause dependence and bad unwanted side-effects.\n\nThere is a drug epidemic going on right now here in the USA. Hard drugs like heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine are killing many of our citizens and loved ones! Kratom is so much of a safer, more mild substitute that doesn't cause death. Granted people have died while using kratom, but in every case it has been used with other dangerous combinations of medicines or drugs. Nothing is safe if taken in large enough quantities! Even water can kill a person if too much is consumed! Kratom however, is as safe of an alternative as any supplement on the market today, and so much safer than prescription pain-killers and illicit drugs.\n\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE listen to \"WE THE PEOPLE\"! Don't take this miracle plant away from so many law-abiding citizens! We are doctors, lawyers, businessmen/women, pharmacists, police, firefighters etc. Please allow adults to have the ability to choose to take this plant/supplement that has so many benefits with so few side-effects! I can honestly say that I have never had any negative side-effects from kratom, and no one I know that takes it has either. Granted I don't consume mass quantities of it and take it responsibly, but again anything can be harmful if taken in huge doses. That can be said for every OTC medication available. Statistically kratom pales in comparison to other medications and drugs even from the cited calls to poison control.\n\nI believe wholeheartedly that if you, the DEA, decide to move forward with the kratom ban making it a schedule 1 drug, it will cause thousands if not millions to seek alternative methods of dealing with their pain, addiction or other ailments. It will exacerbate this heroin epidemic and so many more lives will be lost! \n\nPLEASE LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND LEAVE THIS MIRACLE PLANT UNREGULATED AND UNCONTROLLED!!! \nTHANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND ALLOWING THE PUBLIC TO COMMENT!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0994","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Although I don't use Kratom, this herb has been life changing for a lot of my friends.

I am an Eagle Scout and have worked for a children's entertainment company for the last 8 years and recently had worked at a crematory as a  transporter before a job change to fit my schedule as I get back into school.  I am strongly against the DEA placing the primary alkaloids of the plant \"Kratom\" as a Schedule I drug.  This action is not only unnecessary, but will stop all supplies to patients with legitimate medical conditions and halt all medical research on the herb and it's properties.\n   I started using Kratom after a car accident in 2011 where I was hit by a woman driving and talking on her phone while I was leaving a job interview.  I struggled for years and an now unable to take most jobs due to medical limitations set my doctor to protect my back.  I have been put on many antidepressants and narcotic/non-narcotic pain medications but had to stop due to genetic stomach issues causing ulcers through my GI tract.  I eventually started using Kratom and eventually was able to stand for longer periods of time, pick up my nieces and nephews to actually play with them, sleep more than 2 hours at a time, and generally enjoy my life again.  I have not only felt better, but all of my family and friends have commented on how I'm \"on the path to success\"  and \"looking so much happier\", plus the recent stomach scope (endoscopy) has shown no ulcers at all.

I do not suffer from PTSD or addiction problems. From what I understand, however, is that there is plenty of anecdotal evidence showing that Kratom is helping those suffering from PTSD or addiction. If the evidence right now is only anecdotal, then that means the next step should be for the scientific community to research both its pros and cons. If you make this a Schedule I substance, you make that infinitely more difficult. Which means that you might prolong unnecessary suffering of your fellow countrymen.\n\nIn the land of the free, we incarcerate one out of every 110 adults. That is the highest incarceration rate of any first-world country in the world.

This is one of the greatest of our time.\n\nThe majority of our country is Christian. If you are a theist, then you must believe that our Creator put plants and animals on this planet to help us.

Im married to a veteran of the US Air Force, I have 2 children who are my life.  \n\nI dont drink alcohol, I dont use drugs, I dont smoke cigarettes. I vote in every election, I pay my taxes, I go to church on Sundays & volunteer in the church nursery and at my kids' school. But until last year I had been on opiate painkillers for 13 years. I was in a car accident that left me with permanent disc damage in my cervical spine and I was in constant pain. I was told I could take the pills or have surgery, but that they didnt recommend surgery because it has a high risk of paralysis and isnt always effective.\n\nSo I took the pills. They did help with the pain. They also slowed my capacities, made me lethargic, foggy, withdrawn and ill-tempered. I took them as little as possible but they were right. My pain did get worse as time went on. I went through two pregnancies, had two little babies who needed to be held and rocked and carried, two little children who I needed to bend over and kneel down and crawl around with. Things got much worse. I was able to maintain my daily dosage of Percocet, but I couldnt go without it. Worse, even if I did have a low pain day, I couldnt just skip a pill anymore. Do you know what your brain does when you have been giving it opiates and then stop? It sends even louder pain messages to your body trying to get you to take the Percocet. So even on a day when Id be in less pain than normal, I had to take the pills on time just to prevent the pain from ramping up and becoming unbearable. \n\nThen I tried kratom. I was scared at first, I thought it was either some hippy dippy, useless natural remedy that would do nothing or that it was really this street drug that was going to make me high. As Ive said, I am an extremely sober, conservative person, and my children mean the whole world to me. I would never take something that would seriously hinder my ability to take care of them properly. Finally, I had read enough about it that I felt it was worth a shot. I waited until my kids had gone to bed, just in case it did make me weird or loopy, so itd have worn off before they woke up.\n\nDo you know what happened? 45 minutes later, I felt NORMAL. I didnt feel high or euphoric or drugged or confused or jittery or anything chemical at all. I felt like a normal, pain free human being. It was literally like being let out of prison after 13 years. Kratom gave me back to my family. It allowed me to run and laugh and play with my children again, instead of being tired or short tempered because I felt bad from the pain or the painkillers. It gave me my life back and I couldnt believe how easy it was to stop taking Percocet almost overnight.\n\nThere are thousands of people like me in the United States. The reason the DEA has been so surprised and overwhelmed by the response from us is in and of itself, proof of how benign kratom is. We are all out here, living our lives quietly and not making any trouble. That's why they didn't know we existed. We're not hurting others, we're not hurting ourselves. We're not overdosing, not dying, not getting sick, not missing work, not breaking laws, not pushing kratom on kids, not jumping off bridges, not doing anything but living pain-free, healthy, productive lives. If it was as dangerous and evil as they are claiming, theyd have known we were out here because the rehabs and ERs and morgues would be overflowing with us. Instead those places are full of people using painkillers. \n\nWhen there's 10 times as many people calling poison control about laundry detergent pods as they are about kratom (and usually kratom mixed with something else) you have to wonder how much of a threat to national safety it can be. Theyre citing 15 deaths worldwide, but they have already admitted that in every one of those deaths the person had other substances in their system. From 1999 to 2014, more than 165,000 people have died in the U.S. from overdoses related to prescription opioids. Its currently the 4th leading cause of death in the US.\n\nI have told you how my children are my life. Do you really think I want to risk the doors being kicked open during dinner and having them watch their mommy dragged away in handcuffs because Im an illegal drug user? But thats the choice they're giving me. Go back on the pills that make me feel horrible, damage my liver and will eventually put the KILL in painkiller. Break the law and risk destroying my family. Or do nothing and be too incapacitated by pain to take care of them. What would you have me to do? What kind of choice is that? Please stop this ban and save me from having to make that kind of decision.\n\n\n\nThank you for your time","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1032","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lily McGinley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not make another natural source such as Kratom illegal without proper research!\nWe need more natural alternatives to take care of our families.

Having been diagnosed with both depression and ADHD, I have been prescribed addictive drugs such as Amphetamines, and SSRI's which are often problematic. In addition to this I had a propensity for drinking more alcohol than I should. \n\nKratom has helped me immensely with all of the aforementioned issues. In addition to taking away my desire to drink, I was able to taper off and successfully discontinue my other (often addictive) prescription drugs. The excellent thing about Kratom is that its benefits are felt without intoxicating or inevriating me in the slightest. Mentally I remain alert, but in a much more refreshing manner than when on presciption medications - there is no crash or imbalanced feeling later on after dosing. \n\nI have also witnessed several close friends and family members use Kratom to  kick their addiction to Heroin and other deadly opiates. In a family with a history of drug and alcohol abuse, Kratom has been a life changer/saver. As with my own experience, my friends and family are able to use Kratom without intoxication, nor risk of death or serious side-effects. It remains clear that a ban on Kratom would be a major step in the wrong direction in regards to drug policy and the opiate epidemic. The evidence has been clear on the drug war and it's consequences. Banning Kratom increases the likelihood of seeking out more dangerous alternatives, there is simply manner in which a ban could have a positive impact on society, especially given the current scientific and overwhelming anecdotal evidence. Kratom has not only been safe in my life, but has saved the lives of many former/recovering addicts.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21740","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Valentine","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom  it  may  concern, \na few years ago, I hurt my back trying to move a stuck motorcycle.

I am a 64 year old lady so I certainly do not abuse any thing.  I have for years suffered from chronic neck and back pain with bulging disks and sciatica as well as compromised knee joints.  I have suffered from Chronic Fatigue and insomnia as well.  I worked hard all my life which caused a lot of this.  I have refused harmful chemical drugs unless the pain was unbearable.  \n\nI researched Kratom after my sister (who is handicapped) shared with me about how it made her life bearable!  She is able to move around PAIN FREE!  I talked to other folks about their experience and it was all good.  Then I tried White Vein Kratom and it was like someone gave me my life back!  On days I can live with the pain, I do not take anything. When I wake up in pain  I add 1 teaspoon of Kratom to a cup of decaf in the morning.  I have energy for most of the day to help my husband keep our home where as before I could not!  I feel rosy in spirit; I have felt no altercation of thought process or physical ability.  I actually feel like volunteering to teach classes again!  Living pain free is a HUGE BLESSING.  I never want to go back to the way it was.  \n\nFinally, anyone can abuse anything, but that does not mean that 'the thing' is the problem, it is the person!  People abuse food, aspirin, alcohol, coffee, etc.  There are studies that show the HUGE damage these abuses can cause.  I do not find evidence that there are any studies with accurate AND PURE data to justify placing this substance on Schedule 1 with LSD and etc.\n\nThank you for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2478","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This drug has been shown to aid many people.

Kratom played a huge role in my recovery.  When getting off of heroin and other strong opiates, the addict experiences horrible withdrawal for 3-4 days.  Kratom takes the edge off of the withdrawal experience, just a little; however, it is very helpful during the later occurring post-acute withdrawal, which is when I was at my weakest.  Maybe I could've done it without kratom, but it definitely would've been much harder.  \n\nI also suffer from an anxiety disorder.

I have consumed kratom a handful of times myself. I found out about kratom from a tea shop that served kratom as a relaxation aide, along with kava root, chamomile, and other common herbs and spices that are rather well known and DEA/FDA approved for food. Kava and chamomile are both touted by retailers as relaxation aides as well. I have a clinical anxiety disorder and find kava root to be helpful. With my limited experience of kratom, it seemed to be helpful in the same regard. Not once did I feel a compulsion to continue significant use. In the 10+ years since I first tried it I've only done so maybe 5 times. On the other hand, I am a recovering alcoholic; haven't drank since March 16th, 2015. I clearly have the genetic disposition for addiction, but have no desire, intent, or compulsion to consume kratom any more than I do coffee, green tea, or kava. It's obviously not an availability issue, as a simple Internet search to buy it from numerous vendors is a mouse click away.\n\nThis notion is echoed by existing scientific literature. Studies have shown kratom has a low risk of dependency or addiction. Furthermore, their observations clearly show potential for use as an aide in opioid addiction treatment. Given that opioid abuse is seeing a resurgence in recent years, and has been an ever-present problem for humanity, there's a dire need for further inquiry into the potential for kratom's clinical use. I have had conversations with multiple people that have suffered an opioid addiction, tried kratom, and found it a useful tool in their recovery. They're not stealing from their families to find their next high anymore, and are ostensibly living healthy and successful lives now as hard-working, tax-paying fellow citizens. I personally have nothing to add to this particular objection, as I have never abused opiates, but their stories of being able to kick a well-known, painfully strong addiction with help from a simple non-addictive herb, is astounding.\n\nDespite all this, I am not necessarily an advocate of the substance for any particular purpose. My main objection, as stated above, is that we're considering as a nation to place a felony ban on a substance that apparently\n\na.) has a LOW potential for abuse.\nb.) HAS currently (albeit preliminarily) accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\nc.) There is an ABUNDANCE of accepted safety for use.\n\nKratom has records of use since at least the 19th century, yet to date not a single person has died as a direct result of kratom consumption. Studies have shown it doesn't cause respiratory depression, the leading cause of death in opiate overdoses. The kratom plant nor it's constituents are not classified as an opiate, as they are not a part of the opium family of plants. Rather, kratom is a member of the coffee family. Let's also keep in mind that hundreds of thousands of people die every year of heart disease, often precipitated by the federally-approved yet medically-confirmed lethally high diet of fats, sugars, and tobacco.\n\nIt is estimated that fatal doses of caffeine for humans are between 3 and 20 grams taken orally, depending on body weight and tolerance. An average cup of coffee contains 1/15 or less than an estimated lethal dose. Yet America drinks this substance daily, with no fear of this threat. If the concern is for public health, we're looking in the wrong place. The DEA's current proposal is to criminalize kratom with the same severity as heroin. This comparison is patently false given the current literature. Despite this, and sound evidence for a potentially highly effective method of drug abuse recovery, the DEA is proposing that we regulate and add more legal mechanisms to waste our tax payer dollars, and our nation's finest law enforcement's time, trying to enforce this to keep our society safe from a substance that's very likely as safe for human consumption as the traditional coffee plant.\n\nIF the DEA must schedule kratom, let's be reasonable and place it in schedule V so that clinical testing for potential as an addiction remedy may continue. However, it's not currently shown to have dependency or abuse risks, so my opinion is to leave this concern for the FDA to review its existing approval as a food additive or dietary supplement. Further research is necessary, but please do not lock kratom into a scheduled status where history proves it will never return from. I'd rather not see my tax dollars wasted worrying about a non-toxic species of coffee. I think there are far more pressing issues both of these agencies need to attend to, such as protecting us from the very real, very dangerous and predatory drug cartels, both black market and corporate.

WHEN IS THIS GOING TO STOP??!!!!!\n Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15357","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"DEBORAH SMITH","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 37 year old man that has been suffering with Sickle Cell his whole life.

I am supporting that Kratom should not be banned, especially since you have no idea of all the great benefits of this \"Natural Plant\"  and what it can do for someone.  This natural plant is not to be condemned or to be with held from the general public.  When I first heard that Kratom was going to be classified I thought it was a joke.  I have tried Kratom for severe pain and found the benefits to be rewarding.  I am a productive citizen that gets up early everyday and goes to work and I pay more than my fair share of taxes.  Without Kratom I would be struggling to be productive and provide for my family.  This natural plant should never even be at this point where I am having to write a letter of support to keep it from being banned.  If you believe in \"God\" every thing that he created has a purpose.  I truly believe the purpose of this natural plant was to heal and help and to not be condemned or to be mandated. Kratom is as dangerous as natural spring water to me.  If you have never experienced a fresh drink of natural spring water you don't know what you are missing.  It's natural it's gods resources just like Kratom.  It isn't synthetic or something to condemn, it should be enbranced not disgraced.  We truly have a problem in the good ol USA.  This problem is a lack of commen sense and misinformation.  Again I shake my head in disbelief that I have to even write this but feel it's very important to speak my voice and support Kratom.

I became someone who couldnt be counted on and was unable to fulfill my duties, down to being a mother, when i ran out if meds early or when my pain spiked and the pills didnt do enough for me. I went through this for over 15 years. I had heard of kratom but never believed it coukd maych the powerful medication i was prescribed. Out of complete desperation ai tried kratom. It seemed like a gift from god. Minimal affects to my mood and ability to finction and i was immediatly able to attend a function at my daughters school, which was such a rare thing for me. 4 years later and i own 2 businesses, my pain and limited movement are to the point i only find myself in acute pain one to two days a month and i then treat with ibuprofen and rest. My mind is sharp. I will tell you the only aggrivating side affect is some hair loss. That is a small price to pay compared to how my life used to be.\n\nI fear this comment, along with others will alert the phamrmacutical industry to the therapy and money to be made fro using kratom in their medications.

I'm writing today to voice my opposition to the Kratom plant, or its constituent compounds, being made a Schedule I controlled substance.  Kratom has been a Godsend to me since I discovered it three years ago through online research.  Before that, I struggled to cope with debilitating lower back pain from a teenage injury.  I found that with a small amount of Kratom, made into a tea, one morning dose would allow me to function and perform the physical labor required for my job all day.  I hate using opiates for my pain because they are addictive and have numerous unpleasant side effects.  Kratom cuts through the pain without these side effects, and on the many occasions when I have ceased using it, I have not suffered any form of withdrawal or cravings for it, only the same back pain which slowly recurs. \n        I am all for more scientific research into the main active compounds in Kratom, but to summarily dismiss Kratom as an unsafe drug with no medical benefits is absurd and irresponsible at best.  This action will create an entirely new criminal group out of those already suffering, as well as stifle any productive research into this plant's safety and efficacy.  l For my own sake, and for the sake of countless others dealing with even worse pain, I would urge the DEA to reconsider their plan to schedule Kratom.

I work full-time at a non-profit. I am a recovering alcoholic, and I have been taking kratom as part of my regimen of health supplements for the past 2 years. It was introduced to me by another recovering alcoholic whose life it had changed for the better. Kratom has been tremendously helpful for me as I ween myself off alcohol. Alcohol was destroying my life. Kratom has been a god-send. I do not crave it when I do not take it. It provides a slight pick-me-up similar to coffee, and there are no negative effects from taking it, only positives. \n\nI also struggle daily with depression and anxiety. Often my depression and anxiety are so intense as to be debilitating, interfering with my ability to go about my daily business, go to work, attend social functions, etc. I used to use alcohol to cope with these issues, and the alcohol would just make everything worse. With kratom, I can cope with my depression and anxiety with no adverse side effects. Kratom helps me to be a productive member of society. Without it, my depression and anxiety will once again become unmanageable. \n\nPlease have compassion for us folks who struggle every day, just to live our lives. We are doing the best we can. Kratom helps us tremendously and doesn't destroy our lives in the process, like alcohol or legitimately illegal substances such as pain pills or heroin. Kratom is not at all like these substances and should not be made illegal. Kratom is simply a tea, related to the coffee tree. \n\nAgain, when I do not take kratom, I have no withdrawal or craving. I simply begin to feel my chronic anxiety and depression again. Please, have compassion. Keep kratom legal for adults. Making this tea illegal will do nothing except make peoples' lives harder: people who already have enough on their plate just getting through each day in a positive and productive manner. \n\nThis is my final plea: have compassion for people dealing with depression, anxiety, alcoholism, and drug addiction. Keep kratom legal for adults. Please do not take away one of the best tools we have in our arsenal for living a normal life, with no drawbacks or negatives. \n\nThis tea is pure positivity; it helps me live my life well. Please keep it legal.

Be that as it may, that's the direction simple users like myself are headed.\n\nI use not to get high, get a buzz or enhance other substances. I use because the herb helps with my chronic pain that can't be reasoned with with MRI's and x-rays. Previously, I have taken over the counter and prescription pain med but became worried about the adverse side effects on my health.  I decided that I'd rather deal with pain than deal with all the negatives of RX drugs. I quit taking them and replaced them at first with natural anti-inflammatory agents with some positive results. In my search for a more natural, less harsh treatment I discovered  Kraytom. After much research, I decided to give it a try. Maybe this isn't what the DEA wants to hear, but along with Tumric and other anti-inflammatory herbal agents, I feel better than when I was only taking Codine products. In more ways than just pain management - no fog or drug induced haze just to feel relief. My sleep patterns have improved and I suspect it isn't the Kraytom, rather it's the absence of Codine. Kraytom DOES help my life as a whole. I can function and not be suffering, I can not just be alive, I can live.\n\nOverall, my quality of life has been turned right side up by this herb. It would be such a crime to force people back into a life of prescription substance use, or make them risk their entire life by being an outlaw.\n\n In the end, if it's decided that this herb is to be a controlled substance, I would find myself struggling to function in life dealing with pain, I would refuse to put myself back on the dangerous pills from the Dr or risk my family's future by being an outlaw. \n\nThe DEA has the chance to actually help people with the decision.

A long time ago my husband was injured on the job and he was not able to do the work he loved doing afterwards. That accident caused by someone under the influence of a real drug cost him his mobility. He was given pain killers to help ease the pain of a shattered heel and long term damage to the rest of his body. He was tired of being forced to take these pills or suffer the effects of not taking them after becoming dependent on them. We came across kratom while looking for an answer to ease withdraw symptoms and unlike what the government would have you to believe, this plant has no euphoric effects. While it does provide comfort in not withdrawing from the pain killers it does not give you the effect that a drug would. It does have properties that keep you happy about the same as coffee does. It is in the same family. \n\nThis is my statement about kratom and how it is not and should not be considered a drug, especially in the same class as heroine.

My current condition is not one that is extremely hopeful. I was an athlete for many years, and a sports injury has developed into a chronic condition. My feet, specifically, my heels are in a constant dull pain that worsens over the course of the day. I have been to physical therapy and many different doctors. Over the course of 5 years, a fourth of my life, I have undergone many different treatment strategies from painkillers to steroid injections into my heel: creating my most painful memories. \n\nMy story is not dissimilar from many who comment on the scheduling of Kratom. Kratom was recommended to me by a coworker and a friend, who is also a veteran of two tours in Iraq. He claimed that it helped him greatly with his injury taken in the line of duty. Naturally, I was curious, and upon learning of the herbs legality, I tried it. I can say that nothing has been more effective in raising the quality of my life. I cried the first time I took Kratom. I cried because I couldn't feel the dull ache that has characterized most of my adult life. Nothing has been able to do that for me but opioids like Kratom.\n\nI treat my symptoms by an intense regimen of stretching, bracing, and kratom. I think it is safe to say that my optimism for my life has raised by a factor of ten. I have the motivation to live, to continue on in my journey of life. To become a functioning and productive member of society. To achieve this, all I have to do is spend an hour of my day stretching, and consume 3 grams of a plant every other day. Words can not explain my appreciation for everything that this plant has done for me. \n\nBeing a bi daily user for three months now, I have noticed none of the negative side effects that characterize opioid use.  I have had no constipation, no aching, no withdrawls, and no nausea. I do not grow sleepy, complacent or depressed on days I do not take Kratom.\n\nBy threatening to categorize this healing herb as schedule one: in the same category as heroin and LSD, I believe the DEA is not helping the American people, and rather hurting and marginalizing communities. Kratom is a drug that already benefits many people around the globe as well as the United States. Kratom is a drug, an herb, that helps people. My need is great, but it pales in comparison to our Veterans and Servicemen who have been injured in the line of duty. \n\nI strongly urge, the government to act within the boundaries of constitution and listen to the voice of people. If nothing else we are a country by and for the people, I urge whoever it may concern, to listen to the voice of the people. We are all real people, please listen to our stories, our heartache, and our struggles, and find it in your heart to help us. \n\nThank you for your consideration, please contact me by phone or email, I would be happy to give any additional information required,\nMalcolm C.

He told me that another fiend of his takes Kratom quite frequently and has quite a good opinion of it. Not long after, I listened to a podcast called the Joe Rogan Experience for which Chris Bell was a guest. Chris Bell has made several documents on a variety of supplements and pills, but his newest project is on Kratom. It surprised me when Joe mentioned that Chris had become addicted to pain pills after suffering an injury while filming his documentary on these pain pills. Later in the podcast Chris had mentioned that he had battled and overcome pain pill addiction by taking Kratom, and that it also helped to relieve pain. He also revealed that he is not the only one that has seen great benefits from taking Kratom. It seems backwards that we allow substances that have the potential to harm people and are quite easily addictive, but are considering to add a drug that helps to not only relieve pain, but also to help with addiction problems, to the schedule 1 category. Kratom clearly has medicinal benefits. It lifts mood, helps with addiction and relieves pain. Kratom is also naturally occurring. It is a plant that requires absolutely no modification to consumed. Now I do understand that there is very limited knowledge to what Kratom actually does and how it does its so called job, but this is only a reason to research the drug further. Research can still occur with drugs that are classified as schedule one, but as soon as this classification happens, the public connotes the drug in a very negative way and it can be much harder for it to be legal again. Ultimately, there needs to be more research conducted into what Kratom actually is.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13014","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shad Boswell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I grew up in a household of emotional, verbal and prescription drug abuse. As a kid I was drugged by my parents to make me sleep and locked in my room. Growing up I made the best of it, became more successful than my family but all along the way I continually abused prescription medications. I stole them from family members, found doctors to prescribe them and made up problems with my health to get them. I did whatever it took.\n\nI've always suffered back, neck, shoulder, joint pain, and headaches caused by the aforementioned. I justified my drug abuse by trying to feel better and live. Prescription medications seemed to offer this. I've been to many doctors, they relate it anxiety rather than an actual physical problem.\n\nWhile taking \"legal\" medications produced by the pharmaceutical industry I experienced untold numbers of withdrawal periods, constant constipation, fear of being ridiculed, relapse, dependence and my family not being able to look to me as the provider I should be. The psychological effects, mental breakdowns and mental breaks caused by these legal drugs and me withdrawing from them was horrendous. \n\nPrescription medications offered nothing but further dependence. Narc-anon and other agencies use medicines to \"ease you out of dependence\" but at the same cost of becoming addicted to these alleged helper drugs. I have seen them destroy friends and families more so than I've heard or seen Kratom do. With that I strongly encourage you to reconsider the scheduling of Kratom and it's contents and chemical compounds therein. \n\nKratom stopped me from stealing pills from my family, regain control of my life and get the respect from my family for seeking a way other than prescription drug abuse. While using Kratom I've stopped, started, taken breaks all without any relapse or need to take it other than to help my pain. I do not abuse it, I have not experienced any withdrawal symptoms from it.\n\nBy scheduling the substances found in Kratom you're cutting off a life-line, a life preserver for those that have abused far harder drugs than I have. Heroin addicts, those stuck to Fetanyl have a way to kick the habit through Kratom. Your dooming addicts everywhere that have found comfort and help in Kratom and have ditched their drug of choice to revert back to their old ways and potentially overdose on their old drug of which are far more dangerous.\n\nIn final, coming from a person who has seen it all and hopes for a continued better home life and the ability to see my daughter get married some day, I truly beg you to not schedule Kratom. It is literally my last hope.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4594","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 69 year old mother and grandmother.

I discovered Kratom earlier this year when looking for herbal remedies to help in my wife's battle with chronic Lyme disease, and the myriad if physical and mental issues that accompany it.   She constantly struggled with chronic fatigue,  joint pain,  muscle spasms,  depression, anxiety, and insomnia.   We have spent thousands of dollars visiting doctors,  specialists,  and more doctors.   She's tried multiple prescription medications,  but she was unable to find anything that was effective,  and if she was lucky enough to find something that did offer some help,  the side effects were worse than the problem for which  the medication was prescribed.   We stumbled upon Kratom while researching herbal treatments online.   We decided to try some,  and the results were amazing.   Kratom has made every symptom bearable or almost non-existent.  She is actually living a normal life now.  She isn't pumping her body full of chemicals from prescription drugs,  she is able to exercise,  and she has even started working,  which is something that she hasn't been able to do for a very long time.   The change in her has been amazing.   Her social anxieties are gone,  and she is actually able to speak with strangers and not be afraid to leave the house.   These are things that many people take for granted,  but for her, these are things that have never been possible,  until now.   I am so thankful that we have found a natural treatment  that gives her the type of life she deserves and is entitled to.

There are so many wonderful benefits to Kratom,  many more than other legal substances,  like alcohol and tobacco.  It's even much safer than many prescription medicines.   Please think about these things when you make your decision, because your decision will either keep people's hopes for a normal life alive,  or you will rob them of the one thing that they have found that provides them with a sense of normalcy that many of us take for granted.

I have no new knowledge to provide that I'm sure hasn't already been displayed to you in a variety of factual ways, but I will share my story:\n\nI, like many others, suffer from mental illness that hinders, not only my quality of life, but my ability to work and perform the basic tasks expected of me as a US citizen . I am currently 27 years old, and severe anxiety/depression has been an unfortunate weight that I have had to carry around for longer than I care to remember. It's not easy to encapsulate in words the type of pain that occurs as a symptom from having this condition. It's not easy to point out to a doctor a physical location where it hurts. I guarantee you, though, that the pain is there and it is very real.\n\nLike any animal would do when it is hurt, I sought out quick relief. I tried antidepressants, intermittent therapy sessions, and \"barreling through\" the emotions. But when these things did not do the trick, and I found that the societal and financial pressures held no sympathy for my condition, I moved on to the chemicals that I knew would help me function; I sold a part of myself in order to be what I thought I needed to be. Well, we know where that road leads. But right as the price of taking all those opioid and benzodiazepine drugs started to become too taxing, I found Mitragyna Speciosa - Kratom.\n\nWith Kratom, I discovered that not only did I have a helping hand in getting off of these dangerously addictive substances I had foolishly given myself to, but this plant could also loosen the influence that anxiety/depression had on my day-to-day experiences. I am aware that treating the symptom is not the same as treating the problem, but from what I encountered, Kratom can provide the same benefits as taking the most effective antidepressant, but with less than, or on par with, side effects. I certainly did not feel it to be as obviously detrimental (or deadly) as the relatives that it is so eagerly compared to - or the memory suppressing anti-anxiety pharmaceuticals that are so, notoriously, easy to obtain.\n\nI believe that this plant has a lot to offer. It is not a benign help, but indeed a worthwhile help to many people, including myself.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA Concerned Citizen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20078","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"With My Best Wishes,\n\nI am happy to provide my support to the values supported by the American Kratom Association.

I suffer severe back pain due to injury i sustained in my early 20's.  Over the years I have been treated by many doctors specializing in back injury's and pain management.  I have received epidural injections every 3 months for many years, all in an effort to minimize the pain.  After becoming addicted to opioids that were legally prescribed to me by the doctors that were treating me, someone suggested that I tried Kratom to overcome opioid addiction and minimize my back pain.  I immediately stopped using opioids after taking Kratom and also found that I could manage the pain I was suffering.  Let me be clear, I do not use Kratom to get \"high\" or as a recreational drug.  It has saved my life and I am able to function at a very high level.  I am an educated male, 56 years old, family of wife and 2 beautiful daughters that all depend on me to be the breadwinner in our family.  I own a chain of 30 hair salons with over 250 employees that all depend on me.  I am very active, exercise daily and enjoy playing golf.  I am able to do all of this because Im not crippled by debilitating back pain and Kratom has allowed me to break the evil cycle of opioid use which is the only medical prescribed treatment for my symptoms.  I will not use opioids again.  I am not a criminal and shouldn't be treated as one if Kratom is deemed a banned substance by the DEA.  I am happy to discuss my use of Kratom with anyone but please, do not make Kratom an illegal substance.

I have been doing some research on kratom and have tried it personally as an attempt to boost my focus and happiness. Though I agree there is some potential for abuse in this drug after my experience, It seems to be extremely small compared to the benefits it offers, especially in withdrawal assistance with opiate addicts. This drug is FAR less abusable than  even schedule III drugs such as xanax, or Schedule II drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines. It has many other therapeutic uses that I personally can see, such as for treating anxiety or depressive disorders. The reasoning I see behind Scheduling drugs like kratom in the first category should be this: if it has no therapeutic benefits and is an extremely abusable drug. Kratom is neither, this has been proved through hundreds of studies and thousands of personal experiences. Therefore, maybe it should be placed Scheduled in the second bracket. The criteria for those drugs, however, are drugs that definitely have benefits but still have high potentials for abuse, such as cocaine and oxycodone, both of which have killed thousands of Americans via overdose. Kratom is not nearly as dangerous enough to be a schedule II drug; no one has ever died as a direct result of kratom nor has anyone overdosed from kratom to my knowledge. It is therefore my belief that kratom should be either become a controlled substance as a Schedule III or Schedule IV or Schedule V drug, or not controlled at all since it has a very minute potential for abuse especially in comparison to non controlled drugs such as alcohol, nicotine,  caffeine, dextromethorphan.

This plant has literally saved my life.\n\nFor about 10 years I have been suffering from chronic back and neck pain,  it was probably due to my type of work : desk bound,  coding day in and day out and it really took its toll on me.  Each day I am not exaggerating when I say; I wanted to die.  The pain was so great.\n\nI was eventually prescribed Tramadol  but that had little to no effect and eventually I was left with the chronic pain and an addiction to that Opiate.  My mind was in a fog so my work suffered.  My life was a hazy mess.\n\nA few months ago,  quite by accident I stumbled upon Kratom and tried it.  The relief is little short of a miracle.  For the first time in so many years I was pain free.  Whilst taking the Kratom I was also able to ween myself off of the Tramadol so not only is the pain gone but I am no longer addicted.  I feel like I can live again and have a future.\n\nI do not take Kratom on a regular / scheduled basis.  If I have any pain in my back and neck I will take a small amount,  literally a half teaspoon and I can get about my day.  It might be a week before I need to take any more.  It is not addictive in any way.\n\nPlease consider my story.  I know this plant can help so many people.  I understand the need to classify, regulate and monitor harmful, addictive drugs but Kratom is not in that category.  I would give Kratom to everyone I know and love for pain relief.\n\n\nPlease don't ban it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8801","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daren Salter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"An aunt of mine uses kratom tea to ease her arthritis pain because all of the painkillers she has been prescribed make her nauseous, constipated, and irritable.

I have several clients with chronic pain and migraine issues as well as co-occurring mental health problems of depression and anxiety.   Approximately nine months ago, a client who suffers from weekly migraine headaches and generalized anxiety disorder told me about the herb Kratom.   She started using the herb on a daily basis, in addition to continuing her prescribed medications.   Within two weeks she reported a significant decrease in her anxiety as well as no migraine headaches during this time.   She continued to take Kratom on a daily basis and reported continued reduction of anxiety and only occasional migraine headaches.    \nOn the internet, I investigated the herb Kratom, the history, benefits and concerns.   The American Kratom Association website was very helpful in this search.   \nFollowing this search, and seeing the results of the herb Kratom with this client, I began using Kratom.   I have a medical history of a sleep disorder.   This sleep disorder results in my becoming very tired throughout my day, difficulties with attention, staying focused, awake, and function during the day without taking naps.   This has been a lifetime disorder and significantly impacted my academic performance, my work performance as well as social activities.   I am currently prescribed Concerta for the medical treatment of this disorder.   The Concerta helps, but I continue to have difficulties with focus and attention, and drowsiness.  In addition to the medication, I have been taking other stimulants (caffeine and energy drinks) to supplement the effects of the Concerta to provide adequate stimulus for functioning throughout my daily activities.   In using the herb Kratom, I was able to stop using the Concerta and the other stimulants.   I was able to significantly improve my abilities to stay awake, maintain attention and focus and did not need to take naps during my day.   This also improved my overall sleep patterns, reduced depression and improved my physical health.  \nIn addition to the above client, I have told three other clients with chronic pain issues and comorbid anxiety and depression.   All three clients have looked up the information about Kratom and have chosen to use Kratom to assist in their management of pain.   All three had reported decreased pain levels on a daily basis.   They also reported improved mood, social interactions and self-esteem.\nWith the announcement by the DEA of making Kratom a Schedule 1 controlled substance, I stopped taking Kratom and returned to the prior medication and stimulant supplements.  In stopping Kratom, I experienced no withdrawal symptoms.   I again began consuming caffeine and energy drinks, which I believe to be detrimental to my long term health, but choose this course of treatment to maintain my current lifestyle and responsibilities.  Additionally, I advised all of my clients that were using Kratom of the possible Schedule 1 controlled substance determination.   They all stopped using Kratom and returned to their prior medical treatments.   All of the clients reported to have experienced no withdrawal symptoms, and a return to increased pain levels, depression and anxiety.\n\nI have chosen to submit this statement anonymously due to the potential risk of my professional license.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15971","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I went from taking up to 4 Norcos a day to just switching over 2 Kratom powder with no withdrawal effects at all.

More laws to fund the \"drug war\" that is already a lost cause with corrupt and immoral intentions, and that target the poor?

I am very thankful that I found this natural supplement as I have not experienced it to be addictive or mind altering IN ANY WAY. It helps me relieve my anxiety and headaches. I use kratom as a natural supplement.  In my opinion and from personal experience, it is no different than having a cup of coffee or taking a natural supplement from a GNC store. The only difference is that is is more effective than coffee or other supplements, and doesn't make me feel as bad after taking it.

I originally discovered kratom as an alternative to opioid pain medication following a complex shoulder surgery. While trying to cope with post surgical complications, prescription pain medications were slowly taking over my day to day functioning in a very negative way. After researching kratom and its benefits, I decided to give it a try more than 4 years ago. The impact was immediate and I felt like I got my life back. Not only was I no longer inhibited by the negative physical and mental effects of precscription pain meds but I didn't experience hardly any of the pain and discomfort that I was left with from the surgery. I can't imagine going back to any semblance of that life style if kratom were to be banned. I'm a responsible law abiding member of society with a family and I need to be at my best everyday in order to the person I need to be for all those whom lives are impacted by my decisions. I feel that the DEA must not really understand the true value of this plant that has been so impactful to so many people. I've never had any negative side affects from using kratom. I don't drink, smoke or do drugs and I believe from my own years of experience that kratom is completely harmless and poses no hazard to its users. I truly hope the research and feedback from all the kratom users all over the world can do something to ensure that kratom is left alone and not scheduled as any type of drug. The very idea that this wonderful plant could be grouped with such deadly drugs as heroin and cocaine is a tragic mistake, in my opinion. I hope this input can be of some help.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8791","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Hall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, my name is Corey, I am a 36 year old male with a BA in Marine Biology and currently work in demolition.  I am opposed to the DEA's plan to put Mitragyna speciosa in the Schedule 1 class for many reasons.  It simply has too much medicinal value to be placed in the same category as heroin or cocaine, I am living proof. I started using kratom in 2010 when my severe OCD and Depression had my life in shambles.  I have taken multiple medicines for my OCD and Depression , all with no effect.  I started researching ethnobotanicals and came across kratom.  I researched it and it had properties similiar to pain medicines that had shown benefit to my OCD through four surgeries I've had.  There is proven research that some pain medications, especially Tramadol, have off-label use for treatment resistant Depression and OCD.  I also liked the fact that kratom had little addiction potential.  I immediately felt much needed relief, and although today I still have to take some baseline meds for my OCD and Depression, Kratom has changed my life to where I can function like an adult, work a full time job, and live a normal life.  I now have my symproms under control and Thank God for this wonderful botanical.  This plant needs to be studied in humans and has so much potential to help people like me, help heroin addicts and those. withdrawing from stimulants, and keep chronic pain sufferers off of powerful addictive painkillers.

I took myself off opioid pain medication, that I took for 12 years (same dose, same frequency, same Dr., same pharmacy) when the new opioid regulations took effect in Oct. 2014.

My understanding is that the original concern emanated from the CDC after a review of data suggesting that kratom had been involved in a small number of poison control reports, small relative to the large number of poison control reports received each year in the U.S.  Inexplicably, those reports led to a recommendation to place  mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine into Schedule 1, a schedule reserved for substances with no potential for medical benefit and great potential for abuse.  There is a complete absence of data to suggest that kratom has a great potential for abuse and a huge volume of experience from people who have used kratom for management of chronic pain to suggest that with research, there is indeed great potential for medical benefit.  Placing kratom into Schedule 1 would immediately stop any possibility of research into its potential for medical benefit.  At a time when the entire country is suffering from the effects of opiate addiction and overdose, much of it linked to misuse of prescription medications for pain, it seems foolhardy in the extreme to close the door on substances that might have the potential to offer relief for chronic pain without the downsides of addiction, withdrawal, and overdose seen with prescription and non-prescription opioids.  Rather than slamming the door on its potential benefits for millions of people suffering from chronic pain in the U.S., a more fruitful strategy would be to regulate and fund and promote research.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20207","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am concerned about the prescription opiate addiction epidemic sweeping my country.

I was devastated after learning this because I was only 19 years old, I had lost 30 pounds, I practically looked like a skeleton, I was suffering from anxiety and depression...and I had no idea where my life was going after I discovered this. Before I was aware of my condition, I was suffering horrible night sweats with diarrhea, anxiety, headaches, severe weight loss, etc. I was so scared that there was something serious going on with me. It was then that I made the decision to leave Kansas city, where I was attending the University, and left to return home where I discovered my diagnosis. I felt hopeless. I couldn't eat anything, no medicine was helping me at all, and I thought I was slowly going to wane for the rest of my years and die... until I discovered kratom being sold by a local friend. I decided to give it a shot, and I will tell you that kratom has worked the greatest miracles on my life. This plant has given me my hope back, my weight back, my appetite back, my energy back, and everything I need to feel like a normal, healthy person. Before I found kratom, my fatigue that I felt from my crohn's was absolutely horrific. I could barely get through the whole day without sleeping half of it and this made it almost impossible to get a job. Kratom restored my energy and my ability to get a job and function like a normal person. Now, a year later in 2016, I have heard that they are wanting to ban this miracle plant. This would be a terrible decision as this plant has done miracles in the lives of people like me, and taking that away is taking away hope for some of us.

I blacked out and the last thing I remember is my mother tell me to hold on. \n\nFast forward six months. First symptoms started to appear. Pain that I cannot even explain, problem after problem, symptom after symptom. 25 emergency room visits, 57 doctor visits. Nobody could figure out what was wrong with me. 3 years I suffered with pain. It hurt me mentally, physically and emotionally. I suffered, my family suffered, my career suffered. \n\nFinally one doctors visit they decided to test me for something called fibromyalgia. It was positive. \n\nThe only FDA approved medication for Fibro was an anti-depressant (undoubtably that is the answer to everything). The one thing you DON'T do is put someone who is not depressed on an anti-depressant. \n\nI cannot even begin to explain what that medication did to me mentally.

NO pain, no hurting, no fog, nothing. I felt like me. Energized, happy and I did not feel high. I felt like me!!!!!\n\nThat was four years ago.

My husband was involved in a bad ski accident three years ago and became addicted to pain medication. He read that Kratom was an effective way to transition off Vicodin. However, the last two years have been very difficult for him and our families. \n\nHe became addicted to very strong Kratom extracts available at many of the local head shops here in Florida. His habit skyrocketed to over $3,000 a year. He is completing a second round of in-patient rehab and will be transitioning into sober living. \n\nIt's so difficult to imagine how an herbal supplement could take hold of someone and make them so sick. This has proven to be a strain on our healthcare system which has paid for two lengthy stays in rehab and now VIVITROL shots out of desperation. \n\nWe were so hopeful when we heard the news that Kraom was to become illegal.

I suffer from serious neck and shoulder pain from two car accidents, and kratom allows me to treat my pain without having to turn to dangerous and addictive pharmaceutical drugs. During the three weeks that I was on Percoset in 2003 with two fractured ribs from one of the aforementioned automobile accidents, I turned into a zombie and was content to lie on the couch watching television all day. Thank God I snapped out of it, but just that 3 week experience was enough to show me how powerfully addictive that pharmaceutical drugs are for humans of all backgrounds. I tried kratom on the advice of a friend in 2015, and it was improved my quality of life tremendously. With kratom, I can manage my pain while also having the energy to function and perform at a high level, without any debilitating side effects. I use kratom 5 times each week, with a 3 gram serving each morning from Monday through Friday. I cannot say enough positive things about kratom and how harmless it seems to me compared to so many other perfectly legal substances. I truly believe that kratom is much safer than caffeine and it should remain legal for all Americans to use.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21261","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Derek Williams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern,\n\nMy name is Andrew Perkey.  I am 29 years old, and I work as a restaurant manager in Burlington, North Carolina.  I also work part-time and seasonally as a musician, and as a graphic design assistant in the textile industry.  I am writing to describe my experience with Mitragyna speciosa, also known as kratom, as a dietary supplement.  My intent is to explain my opposition to the proposed placement of it's component alkaloids, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, on the list of Schedule 1 controlled substances.\n\nTo begin, I feel I must share the fact that I have suffered from a variety of health problems throughout my life, which have crippled my ability to function in many ways.  Due to athsma, respiratory allergies, and severe chronic fatigue, I have always been unable to perform physically at the same level as my peers.  I also struggle with clinical depression and anxiety which, compounded with fatigue, caused me to drop out of college despite high academic performance.  I experience mild to moderate joint pain as well, which escalated once I left school and began performing more physical labor.  Eventually, the pain became severe enough for me to seek medical attention, at the age of 25.  Shortly before losing coverage under my mother's health insurance, my rheumatologist was able to detect high levels of specific antibodies for Sjogren's Syndrome in my blood.  After losing the insurance, I was unable to pursue any further investigation into my auto-immune condition, and unable to afford any treatment.  It was around this time that I was introduced to kratom.\n\nWhile I was in college, I was diagnosed with ADD, and from 2008 to 2013 I was prescribed amphetamine salts, which combated my fatigue until I was no longer able to afford them.  My physical exertion while using the amphetamines led to the escalation of my joint pain, which was eventually identified as a secondary form of rheumatoid arthritis.  Once I stopped taking them, the combination of pain and fatigue severely limited my ability to work.  A friend at work was using kratom, and gave me some to try, as I was obviously struggling.  Kratom helped me maintain my stamina and energy for long periods of time, and helped control my pain.  I began purchasing it myself, and I have used it regularly for the past three years.\n\nSince I began using kratom, I have been able to work full time, and my job performance improved drastically.  This led to promotions, and enabled me to move out of my parents' house.  It also lifts my mood, improves my motivation, and allows me to better handle physically and mentally stressful situations.  In comparison to drugs which I have been prescribed to in the past, such as amphetamines and antidepressants, it has virtually no side effects or withdrawal symptoms.  Instead of pushing myself to the point of further damaging my immune system, with kratom my overall pain has decreased over time.  In three years, I have had no desire to use more than I need to perform my daily tasks.  To me, it is the furthest thing from a recreational substance, it is a supplement that can help a person with serious health problems live a functional and productive life.\n\nMy report is very anecdotal, and I do not have space to go into detail about reports and statistics.  But, if kratom is made illegal, I will have no choice but to lose my job and my independence, or return to taking prescription medications which have seriously damaged my mind and body in the past.  I have seen media presentations of kratom, describing it as a drug or an opiate replacement.  But for me it is a supplement which has enabled me to stop using drugs, and has greatly improved my overall health.  For this, I implore the DEA to keep kratom legal, and I appreciate this opportunity to share my perspective.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18312","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Perkey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've been researching Kratom and have come to the EASY conclusion that this plant should be made completely legal to consume and distribute.\n\nThe amount of health issues that this plant remedies WITHOUT HARMFUL EFFECTS is amazing.\nBy you making this plant illegal would only cause people to resort to actual harmful drugs....such as the prescriptions that doctors push on their patients...such as opiates.\n\nDO YOUR RESEARCH.\n\nKraton is both SAFE and THERAPEUTIC.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11394","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Denney","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nPlease rethink your scheduling of kratom as you would schedule with drugs like heroin. My personal experience with kratom began several years ago after battling opiate painkiller addiction after multiple major surgeries and multiple anxiety and depression symptoms related to it. I researched a natural way to ease anxiety and the withdrawal symptoms I found information about kratom and purchased some. I used 2 1/4 teaspoons and within 20 minutes i had felt like a normal human being again. For me it erased the withdrawal symptoms and my anxiety and depression lifted. This allowed me to begin a exercise regime. I have never once taken kratom to \"get high\". Upon seeing my success with it my wife who suffers from very crippling rheumatoid arthritis tried it one night she was in severe pain. That night without the use of harsh over the counter analgesics that cause more harm then good when you use them to frequently to ease pain, she slept and had eased her pain considerably. I am in agreement we need to have regulation such as appropriate age and proper labeling, perhaps more scrutiny of vendors who overstate and or understate kratoms effects at higher doses.  However, kratom, from my personal experience has produced none of the euphoria or lethargy I have experienced on medications like oxycontin, lortab, xanax and klonopin. If you \"ban hammer\" something natural like this that millions have found relief with you are opening a Pandoras box of addiction when instead we could expand research and maybe begin to win this war on drugs that youre agency was created to do. Please be the tip of the spear and help us win the battle not by banning safe natural alternatives to opiates and anxiety medications and illicit street drugs but encouraging research and education into them.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8808","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Venniro","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have a family member that uses Kratom to help deal with severe pain caused by medical issues.

The DEA has implemented regulations that deprive people of medications that enable them to simply function at the most basic levels. This has led to increased incidents of disability which leads many people to no longer be able to contribute to society, participate in basic life functions, and for some, ultimately suicide. \nI am a 41 year old woman who has been impacted adversely by these regulations. I have 3 co-occuring conditions that each cause chronic pain. I have surgically damaged nerves in my ribs which causes Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy, which is known as the most painful condition known to man. Because the damage is to my ribs it affects every single thing I do. Sitting, standing, laying, moving. Your ribs support your body. I also have Multiple Sclerosis and Fibromyalgia. Each of these diseases causes muscle and nerve pain to various parts of my body. My existence is miserable. Most days I'm unable to attend to even my own basic care. Showering is daunting because of the pain it inflicts from standing and even the pressure of the water against my skin. It's difficult to prepare meals. Standing for more than 5 minutes, using my arms to stir or cook increases the rib pain exponentially. The pain and also the MS symptoms cause my limbs to go weak and I drop things or fall often. Riding in the car is no joy. The bumps and movement are beyond uncomfortable. Shopping is almost impossible most days. Even sitting on the sofa can exacerbate the pain. I live no real life and cannot contribute to my own life completely, contributing to society is out of the question. \nFor many years I utulized various opiate based medications as well as narcotics, muscle relaxers, anti depressants, and anti seizure medications. They helped to varying degrees and for various amounts of time. Some didn't help at all. But none gave me a reasonable quality of life. And as years went by, I required higher levels of these dangerous medications to achieve the same results. A little over a year ago, I decided I needed to give my body a break after 13 years on these medications. I always used them exactly as prescribed, but had gained such a tolerance that they no longer seemed to be working. I was out of options and needed pain relief, but also needed to give my body a break. I researched natural alternatives and discovered a plant called Kratom. \nWith the blessing and help of my doctors, I tapered off Suboxone and Lyrica as it is horribly dangerous to simply stop taking medications like these cold turkey. After the tapers were complete, and again with the blessings of my doctors, I began utilizing a tea made out of Kratom plant leaves to help manage the pain I inevitably felt. I wasn't expecting much. I was hoping it helped even half as much as the medications had. I was pleasantly shocked and surprised to find it seemed to help manage my pain. I was able to get out of bed. I was able to shower some days. I was able to prepare simple meals. I still didn't have a good quality of life, but I was managing. I was also pleasantly surprised that it wasn't necessary to be on a strict regiment. With the medications, if I was late with a dose, I would experience very unpleasant and uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. On the days the pain was unbearable, I had to take the pills on a very strict schedule, regardless of the level of pain. With Kratom tea, I can use it as needed. Every 2 hours or even just once a day if the pain isn't overwhelming. I don't experience withdrawals if I don't utulize it regularly and I can drink it every couple hours on the bad days. One joy of the plant is a built in mechanism that will not allow for overdose. Should I take too much, my body will simply induce vomiting. With the medications, there was always a chance of uninteneded overdose, even taking the medication exactly as prescribed. \nI accepted many years ago that I will forever need medications to simply function. I never imagined that government regulations would determine my the quality of that functioning. I understand we as a country have a horrible opiate abuse epidemic. But not everyone who takes opiates abuses them. Some of us just want to live some semblance of a life. Having access to opiates and Kratom allows me to function at the most basic of levels without putting my life at risk of inadvertent overdose, or worse, suicide because I cannot tolerate the levels of pain in my body. \nWith the opiate epidemic we need to be looking at ways to combat abuse and also give people safer alternatives to treat pain. Kratom seems to have the potential to do both. We need to allow science to be able to understand why and how it works. Moving Kratom to Schedule I will limit the ability to study these things. It will also put many people in a place with limited choices, leading to increased disability and loss of life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21975","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dusty Johnson-Armijo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I truely believe it can save those on the path to certain death via current or future opiate addiction from something that was completely out of their control.

I have Rheumatoid Arthritis along with what we've just discovered to be joint damage in my hip/back/sacrum due to the RA.  I was recently told by a pain management doctor that I am not being helped as much as I'd like to believe by 5mg Hydrocodone and should stop taking them.  She pointed out the war against opioid pain medicine and the heroin epidemic as her reasoning, not really caring that I have legitimate and pretty intense pain most of the day.  My rheumatologist disagreed but in the meantime I was introduced to Kratom by a friend who lost her health insurance and has MS.  Kratom has been a Godsend to me and my husband.  It's given me a pain relief that doesn't make me fuzzy or tired.  It's given me drive to be able to walk over two miles every day and join FitBit challenges with my friends.  \nI'd like to point out that I've been so anti-drug because of growing up in a family filled with so much agony due to pills and illegal drugs.  I detested the thought of pills and anything of the like that broke up my first marriage and killed a few of my best childhood friends.  Kratom is none of that.  I am hoping the DEA will help us  by not just stopping the scheduling and making it illegal, but by helping to crack down on the people who are manipulating the Kratom and giving the herb a bad name.  Please help us and we will help you in any way we can.  I feel like this is my way to getting off of opioids and having a somewhat normal life.

First off, I have been using kratom periodically for the last 4 years fro a few different reasons and feel making kratom illegal would cause more harm than good. The painkilling/anti-anxiety aspects of kratom are enough to help me not use heavier pharmecuticals, but kratom does not carry the negative aspects that similar prescription medications have. Kratom isn't strong enough to cause withdrawl symptoms and it is impossible to overdose on, like opiates or anti-anxiety medication. If I take too high of a dose I merely get a very mild headache. Kratom is weak enough to not negatively affect any aspect on my life but has positive benefits pronounced enough that I can handle the anxieties of college/work with less difficulty then when I was on actual controlled medications. In addition, kratom has good antioxidant qualities. I haven't gotten sick since I began taking kratom which I equate to these properties. It is a plant. I assume that kratom got lumped in with the synthetic drug nightmare going on, but kratom is a ground up leaf. That is it.\n\nIn closing, as someone who takes kratom on a fairly regular basis, I just want to point out these simple facts. Kratom is non-addictive, doesn't cause the user to feel intoxicated, doesn't result in withdrawl symptoms but has positive aspects that are greater than many common prescribed medications such as Xanax. I have seen people addicted to Xanax and similar substances and am glad that I found kratom so I don't have to take heavier medications. I feel outlawing kratom would be a disservice and would cause more problems then it solves. \n\nOne last thought, kratom is cheap. Because of this, you don't see the problems associated with illegal drugs when looking at kratom. I can almost guarantee that no one has been arrested for causing mayhem while taking kratom. There is no huge black market demand for it. The problems associated with drugs, even pot, just don't translate to kratom. Kratom doesn't fund some underground economy. No one is getting into shootouts over kratom shipments, like with cocaine etc. \n\nI think you were right in changing your mind about making kratom illegal. I just hope it stays that way.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3727","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Sousa","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do further research on Kratom for pain relief before making it schedule 1","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10427","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Parsons","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket no.

Medically prescribed opiates and multiple surgeries failed to provide adequate relief. Kratom has been a godsend for him.

My name is Melinda. I am 26 years old and currently work as a medical laboratory technician. I would love to express my thoughts and share my personal experiences on Kratom with you today. \n     First and foremost, I want to tell you thank you for allowing for this open comment period. I feel like my opinion matters. I feel like my experiences matter. I am so grateful you are taking the time to hear so many of us out. \n\nMany of us have struggled with addiction throughout our lives, whether it be opiates or alcohol or any number of harmful substances. For me personally, Kratom was a miracle. Kratom got me back on track. Kratom keeps me focused on goals that I have set for myself, as well as the steps I need to take to get there. I have suffered with extreme joint stiffness, degenerative disorders, as well as depression for most of my teenage and adult years. I truly do feel like Kratom has given me my life back.\n\nI turned to harmful habits in order to try to ease many of the unpleasant side effects of the conditions I was experiencing. I engaged in said harmful habits for over 6 years, until I realized I had to quit one day. I took a personal pledge to quit in order to improve my life. I was browsing help forums when I came across the mention of  Kratom. I was  living in Washington DC at the time and decided to give it a try. \n\nEver since then, I've been 100% sober. I take Kratom most days as a dietary supplement, a natural pain reliever, a natural energy booster, and a natural mood enhancer. \n\nI feel truly happy after taking my low dose of kratom. I am running again, after years of not being able to be active. I am social again, as my depression is not near as severe as what it was. \n\nIf Kratom is taken away, I am truly terrified I will have to be put on several different medications by my doctor, such as pain killers and antidepressants. I do not want to have to rely on pills. There are so harmful with so many negative side effects. Kratom does not have any dangerous or unpleasant side effects. It is amazing and I am beyond blessed that it is a part of my life. \n\nThank you so much for hearing me out.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5707","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Melinda DeGeorge","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am Benjamin Virnston, a 27-year-old, college-educated naturalist at a nature preserve. I first tried kratom a few years ago to see if it might help with my anxiety and frequent migraines. I received a free sample in the mail: it helped greatly while it lasted. I wasn't in a position to purchase more at that point so I didn't try to continue using it. Over the intervening years, I was able to get a few more samples and they were similarly helpful. During this time, I also introduced a few friends and acquaintances to kratom, and they were similarly pleased with the results.\n\nMore recently, I found a supplier whom I trusted sufficiently to order more than just a sample. I have begun using kratom more regularly. It has helped greatly with my anxiety and migraines. I have also shared it with friends and family. My mom mildly injured her back a few weeks ago and I recommended she give it a try for the pain. She was ecstatic with the relief it provided and didn't experience any negative side-effects.\n\nMore important than any of that, however, is the fundamental right of each individual to decide for their self what or what not to put in their body. The War on Drugs has been a disaster,  in terms of efficacy, unintended consequences, and violation of human rights, not seen since Prohibition was repealed. Expanding that war to include a benign plant (which has actually helped ameliorate some of these issues via its use as a treatment for heroin addiction) is not the way forward.\n\nQuit using the violence of government to dictate what we can produce, trade, and consume. Quit making terrible problems worse.

I was having bone pain that I tried to ignore, but it was the cognitive deficit , memory loss and confusion that finally robbed me of my career.  After being referred to Pain Management, I was prescribed Lortab; then Norco. Six years passed; the Lyrica and Norco  both became almost ineffective, providing me approximately 30% pain relief. In April 2016, my pain management physician discontinued the Norco, stating the narcotic would long term cause increased pain (CNS pain pathway). Six months that followed, the pain has become unbearable. The lady who does monthly minor housecleaning gave me a marijuana cigarette that is still in the folded envelope. I have never taken any illegal drugs and on a rare occasion, I would have one glass of wine. I haven't had any wine in a while. The antidepressants aren't working and so I don't want to live in pain. There are Fibromyalgia blogs that talked about Kratom benefits. I researched before I bought Kratom October 1, 2016.

So now, after years of suffering, I am much better with my hormones, kratom and vitamins. I can feel normal again. \n What I really like about kratom is that it is absolutely natural.

When he discovered the palliative benefits of kratom, he notified me and ordered me a sample to try as an aid to my arthritis and anxiety. After trying kratom I was greatly impressed by its effects, which were gentle but very helpful. Since then I have been a regular user of this wonderful botanical, and have had much relief from it. I would urge the DEA to strongly reconsider placing this effective and innocuous substance on the Schedule 1 list. In no way is it comparable to the dangerous and toxic drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, that populate that list; indeed, I believe it would be a grave disservice to the thousands of people in our country who find great relief from their suffering by taking kratom. I might also add that I have never experienced any type of adverse reaction, nor dependence issues with it.

While searching for a cure to my opiate addiction, suicide was on my mind, all the time.\n\n\n\nI actually know someone who got into a horrible car accident yesterday because of his opiate abuse.

I have really bad arthritis and kratom plays a huge part in my life to help alleviate the pain. Before I found kratom, I was taking up 15 Tylenol, motrin, alieve, ect. a day. which is very bad for my liver. 3. I have depression, was diagnosed by a doctor. I was prescribed a numerous amounts of different prescription drugs. Each one with its own very bad side effects. I thought I was going to end up killing myself. Kratom has literally saved my life. 4. It has changed my life for the better. 5. The pros definitely out weighs the cons. 6. Making it illegal would fund more criminal activities. 7. Let the government tax it and make it available to all and research it more. This plant can become a u.s. asset. I hope that the DEA can come to terms with not banning kratom.

I have served this great nation and fought for the right to choose a natural plant over prescription drugs that only make matters worse. I see no harm in kratom, where i have lost many of brothers in arms to alcohol and drug abuse, this plant can save lives and reduce if not completely erase the 22 veterans a day that take their lives, it can get veterans and civilians alike off of pills and back to a normal way of life.

I am a former opioid addict of 8 years and found Kratom to be an instrumentally beneficial tool in my recovery from opioids.\n\nI went through 8 different inpatient addiction recovery programs and 5 outpatient programs in my quest to overcome opioid addiction. I have been on methadone and buprenorphine treatment, only to find that these medications actually increased my tolerance for opioids and went through more hellish withdrawals trying to come off these drugs than if I would have just stopped using heroin cold turkey. I tried to cease my buprenorphine treatment with the assistance of my doctor by tapering my dosage over the course of several months, but no matter how low I got my daily dose down, I would become violently ill and suicidal within a week or two after stopping. The longest I was able to make it without any buprenorphine was 21 days, and I was still just as sick as I was on day 3 of my withdrawals. I genuinely felt like it was never going to stop and I was ready to die. I scoured the web for information about getting off of buprenorphine and found that Kratom has been used for thousands of years to cease opioid use with widely successful results. I began taking Kratom and found that it nearly extinguished all of my withdrawal symptoms, with the exception of a runny nose. The aches, pains, hot/cold sweats, restlessness, depression, anxiety, nausea, and diarrhea were gone within a day, and I wondered how I had never heard of this plant known as Kratom. I kept taking Kratom for about 2 more weeks and then stopped. Once I stopped, I was amazed to find that absolutely none of my withdrawal symptoms had returned. I was finally free from the clutches of opioid addiction and have been clean and sober to this very day, which has been 5 years and 4 months.\n\nBecause of my addiction, I had lost my home, money, job, my wife and 2 beautiful children, been in jail multiple times, and nearly died 3 different times from overdosing. I lost everything and was sleeping on the streets. Now I have my life back. I have been working the same job for just over 5 years now, and have had my own apartment for just as long. Most importantly, I have my children back in my life, and I have my health. I never thought I would escape the grips of my addiction and thanks to Kratom I was able to finally get my life back in order.\n\nI am urging the DEA to please consider the benefits of this life-saving plant. I truly believe the benefits of Kratom outweigh any possible negative impacts, and anything that could help reduce the burgeoning opioid epidemic in this country should be kept available for use. There are far too many ways to get hooked on opioids and not nearly enough ways to break free from the addiction associated with their use. I strongly believe that removing access to this life-saving medicine would be short sighted, especially when substances such as tobacco and alcohol are still legal despite the hundreds of thousands of lives they take each year. I urge you to please reconsider the classification of Kratom as a Schedule I controlled substance and leave it as an available option for people like myself who have tried everything else to no avail.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11736","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathan Bailey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom this may concern,\n   Kratom has supplemented and improved my life in so many ways it is difficult to even know where to begin.

He is able to be more active than before and isn't in as much pain.  He also hasn't acted like he did before when he was using.  A couple of times he has come across my ritalin (because I didn't put it away like I should have) and he brought it to me and told me he didn't even physically feel like taking it, like he did before.  He insisted I count the pills and I did and they were all there.  He didn't have to tell me that he found them, but he did and he's done this now three times between the ritalin and cough syrup.\n\nI am very grateful that we have a way to help his back pain and that it seems to be helping with his addiction, as well.

I have been supplementing with kratom tea for a year now. It has replaced Sam-E and my nerve medication, providing me with a more holistic alternative for helping my nerve damage, chronic pain, and emotional mood swings since my mother past away recently. It's like a multi-vitamin that helps me get through my busy days. I am able to have a clear head while I travel on business, speak at conferences, being a mom and a wife to a military veteran. I rely on this plant as much as I rely on my coffee every morning. It would be horrible if this supplement was taken away and banned. It's a plant, a herb that organic seeking people turn to in order to help manage some normal day to day physical hardships that happen to the best of us. Please do not ban this herb. I did a lot of search on the plant before adding it to my daily supplement regimen. \n\nI'm a professional woman, with a clean record, no substance abuse background, so this is absurd that DEA/FDA would even consider taking this away. It's like taking away Ginko Biloba! You walk into Whole Foods, half the stuff on the shelves are foreign and alternative...Just because kratom is one of those things most have not heard of, doesnt mean it's dangerous. \n\nHave you seen the possible side effects to Sam-E? If you don't know, the famous SamE is known to TREAT depression, anxiety, heart disease, fibromyalgia, abdominal pain, osteoarthritis, bursitis, tendonitis, chronic lower back pain, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, slowing the aging process, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), improving mental performance, liver disease, and Parkinson's disease. It is also used for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, seizures, migraine headache, lead poisoning, to break down a chemical in the body called bilirubin, or to help with disorders related to the buildup of a chemical called porphyrin or its precursors. Side effects? Sometimes cause gas, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dry mouth, headache, mild insomnia, anorexia, sweating, dizziness, and nervousness, especially at higher doses. It can also make some people with depression feel anxious..... Sounds a bit dodgy to me.... \n\nPoint is, it's a plant...that's been extremely misunderstood and mischaracterized. Additional research should continue without the need of a ban. There has been more deaths from laundry detergent balls than kratom....and laundry balls are still legal too..... (www.today.com/health/never-seen-anything-more-children-harmed-ingesting-laundry-pods-t88036).\n\nIt would be foolish to take away a plant that has had nearly to no reputable studies done and a massively small percentage of reported issues--that are questionable, to say the least. Im implore you, the DEA, the FDA, to see and hear the masses that are benefiting from this supplement and not be too hasty to take away a leaf that's from the coffee family...... Thank you for taking time out to read my comment in defense of a supplement I value right along with my Ginko Biloba.... Now excuse me as I drink my Monster Energy Drink that I have been addicted to since age 18 (You might want to research this drink BTW...I can swear it's a drug).

Not only has Kratom helped with the pain without the side effects of most Opeoid Medications, it helps with the inflammation and tension in my neck. Which allows me to be able to rest and sleep good at night. I have been able to avoid having surgery on my neck with the help of Kratom & Chiropractic care.

Up until that point, my doctors had me taking highly addictive painkillers, namely oxycodone, hydrocodone, and dilaudid injections while in the ER. I experienced severe side effects from these drugs, and was desperate to find an alternative, preferably plant based. The first time I tried Kratom tea I was surprised at how effective it was at easing the painful symptoms of kidney stones, with none of the side effects of the pain pills perscribed to me. One of the most notable being the lack of dependence formation I had experienced with the prescription opioids. This had been an issue with how frequently I dealt with painful stones. On top of that, I experienced the surprising effect of my chronic fatigue being lifted in a significant way.

I am a 28 year old male and I first discovered kratom seven years ago when looking into natural dietary supplements that were said to help assist in managing symptoms related to anxiety and depression. For well over a decade I have been diagnosed by several professionals with these issues, as well as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and have sought just about every avenue available in dealing with these conditions. Allow me to preface this by saying I am not at all claiming that kratom is a medicine or some kind of cure-all remedy. I recognize there is no magic bullet and that it is not something I should permanently rely on. That being said, since Ive begun taking this supplement as needed (in safe, moderate amounts, and not on a daily basis), in addition to regular exercise and meditation, I have been successful in managing many of the symptoms of my anxiety and depression. Additionally, because my anxiety levels are much lower, the symptoms of my Obsessive Compulsive Disorder are much less pronounced, making my day to day life much more tolerable.\nYears ago there were instances where I literally could not leave my house because of the levels of anxiety I was experiencing. I would often get terrible panic attacks where I thought I was about to die, so much so that I had to stop working for a while. My grades in school started to fall because I found myself unable to go to class some days. There were days my Obsessive Compulsive Disorder was so bad I didnt want to leave my bed, in irrational fears of getting poisoned or sick by the germs I perceived to be coating every surface and floor outside of my meticulously sanitized room. If it wasnt the anxiety/O.C.D., it was the depression, days not eating or getting off the couch because I was so consumed by mental agony and suicidal thoughts that I did not want to move. I could not focus on anything, was constantly either gaining or losing weight, and honestly didnt know how much longer I would live.\nI have seen multiple therapists, doctors, and psychologists for the state of my mental health. For years I was on numerous antidepressants (trying about eight or nine different kinds), several anti-anxiety medications for daily use and--for when my panic attacks were especially bad--benzodiazepines. At first these medications would help a little bit, but then after a while my problems would come back. Sometimes, my symptoms came back even worse. So again and again I would be switched over to new medications, many of which basically turned me into a zombie. There were pills I was prescribed that made me sleep for sixteen hours a day, and when I was finally awake, I was in a mental fog and couldnt think straight, often to the point of feeling impaired. It was nearly impossible to function in my day to day life. Other prescribed medications gave me suicidal thoughts, and on more than one occasion, very disturbing paranoia. I began contemplating applying for Disabilities from the government because I wasnt sure I was able to work again, even though I was a young person who wanted to get a decent job, work hard, and be a productive member of society. \nMy life turned around after discovering kratom. Through a combination of therapy, exercise, anxiety-reducing thought techniques, meditation, and using various dietary supplements and herbs, of which kratom is the most helpful, I was able to drastically improve in managing the symptoms of these problems Ive had. To reiterate, just because kratom and my lifestyle changes allowed me to get off my prescribed medications, it does not mean I am claiming kratom as a medicinal replacement to these drugs, just that it allowed me to get my symptoms under control and move forward in improving my general well-being. Since then my life has improved in many ways: I've maintained a serious romantic relationship, received a bachelor's degree, had several job promotions, drink less, and live an overall healthier and happier life. \nDo some people overdo kratom? Sure. Does that mean we have to punish the vast majority of kratom consumers simply because a handful of people took more than what is recommended and had a bad experience? Should we outlaw people enjoying a glass of wine because a segment of the population abuses alcohol?\nI would like to see kratom sold only to adults, labeled with similar guidelines as other supplements such as kava kava, and only sold in a pure, unadulterated form. The city of Denver recently implemented similar policies, which are completely rational. Kratom is not dangerous. I have used it for years now and I am in excellent physical health and have had no problems with it.

If you are worried about people getting high from it there is none, I get more high from back tea!! Will you be adding that to schedule 1 next? There is no difference. Kratom does not even meet the standards for Schedule 1. The dea seems to ne all up in arms about opioid use but here is an example of Kratom taking the place of opioid use. It seems to me that this proposed ban is based on ignorance and corruption, who is pushing for this big pharma maybe our corporate prison system? You have had a ban on Canibais as well another PLANT that does not qualify for Schedule 1 The FDA has approved THC as medication so there is a medical use for it. Again I ask what is the motivation?

In my personal experience, small amounts of Kratom instead of a cup of coffee in the morning is enough to halt my anxiety throughout my class day. The alternative is going to my psychiatrist (who is delighted that I could find an herbal supplement that works for me) and getting a prescription for Valium, which is not something I would look forward to doing should Kratom get banned. In the past when I have taken Valium, I easily become distracted, making it difficult to focus on my school work, whereas when I drink Kratom, I find that it is easier to forget my anxieties, and just focus on the work I am doing. As far as withdrawal symptoms go, I have gone without Kratom when on family vacations, and other times when I am not at school, without suffering any ill effects, except for the return of my anxiety. However, I know a few people who use Kratom more heavily than I, and when they stay away from it for a while, they report a headache for the first day, and then no problems. When it was announced that Kratom would be banned on September 30th, I began experimenting with other herbal supplements to deal with my anxiety, and nothing seemed to work nearly as well, so unfortunately, should the ban go through, I will have to switch to a prescription. As a law-abiding, hard working, and future revenue generating citizen of the United States, I plead the DEA to not ban Mytragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1404","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I disovered Kratom a couple months ago and decided to give it a try.

I took 5-6 pills/day. It sucked, drained my bank account and hurt not only myself by my friends and family. For a long time I wanted to quit and tried many many times however the withdrawal symptoms were too much for me to handle alone and I had nobody I could turn to for help.\n\nFinally, I was introduced to Kratom which was a gift from god. I dot believe in god but to think that a simple plant helped me overcome my addiction, I cannot explain in any other way than being a gift from god. \n\nI slowly made a transition from taking hydrocodone every day to taking Kratom. It completely eliminated my withdrawal symptoms from not taking hydrocodone. Eventually I was taking NO hydrocodone everyday and only taking Kratom. After a period of a couple months I then began slowly winding down my Kratom use. By the time I completely stopped taking Kratom I had ZERO withdrawal symptoms! \n\nI had previously tried on many occasions to slowly wind down hydrocodone use but the withdrawal symptoms were always just too much. Using Kratom masked the withdrawal symptoms allowing me to stop taking hydroicodone without experiencing the withdrawal, something I could not find any other way to accomplish.\n\nKratom essentially allowed me to completely kick my hydrocodone habit without having ANY type withdrawal symptoms. There is no way I could have ever accomplished this feat without Kratom. It simply would not have happened.\n\nGiven the current level of epidemic in the US with opiod pain killers and heroin I think it is reckless and irresponsible of the DEA to make Kratom (something which has helped so many people kick opioid abuse) illegal without any real investigation into its effects and actual potential for abuse.\n\nSure, there migth be some peple out there who abuse it BUT people abuse coffee, oreos, mcdonalds, cigarettes and so many other things that are way worse for us as humans than Kratom.\n\nRather than focusing on banning something that only a few people say they had bad experiences with yet so many others report great experiences with, I think the DEA needs to look into stopping the opioid epidemic and hopefully look to giving out Kratom free to opioid abusers to help stop this problem of opioid abuse here in the US.\n\nI dont know what else to say other than this is huge, unjust and blind overreach by the DEA. \n\nI thought America was a free country?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3600","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Malcom","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am sending this in an effort to support the continued availability of the natural herb kratom.\n\nI have personally been a witness to the positive healing relief it provides.

I want to express my feelings about Kratom, how it has helped me, and why it should remain legal. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, depression, and insomnia, when I was just twelve years old. More recently, I was diagnosed with chronic back pain, and anxiety. I had been taking pain pills (Tramadol, Morphine, Oxycodone) for around three years. At one point, I was running out of my script within a weeks time because my body got used to the medication, my tolerance was high, and they weren't working the way they did in the beginning. I was going through withdraws every week, nausea, chills, even worse depression than usual, I felt like my skin was crawling, I felt like I was dying, started buying opiates off the streets,  and knew that I wanted to get off of the pain medications since it was no longer helping anyways. \n1 year and 7 months ago, I was in a support group for opiate addicts, going through withdrawals,  and someone had mentioned Kratom. They asked me if I had heard of it, and they recommended that I try it that it would help ease the withdrawals and give me a little energy as well. I researched for months before actually trying Kratom because I was highly skeptical. I found out that it is a tree grown in South East Asia, related to the coffee plant, that they have been using Kratom for thousands of years and also read testimonials where others here in America had tried it. After making the decision to try it, the Kratom community donated some Kratom to me so I could start my journey, and the rest is history.\nI use Kratom as a supplement to help provide a better quality of life. It helps me stay clean from opiates, and gives me enough energy to make it through the day. Without Kratom,  I would still be addicted to pain medication, or dead. Kratom doesn't cure anyone of their diseases or illness, it is simply a tool that is used in addition to medications that are prescribed by a medical doctor. I've never been high from Kratom, or abused it, haven't experienced withdrawals from it or anything of that nature. On days when I don't take Kratom, I still get cravings for opiates and have very little energy which I had before I even took Kratom.\nKratom just helps me stay clean, and continue to live my life as a normal person without the need to get high. Kratom should remain available because it is natural, it has helped millions, and is in no way a replacement for any medications. The Kratom community consists of some of the most genuine, considerate, giving, helpful people I've ever met in my life. They really are amazing, and in today's world, we need more people like them. That is why I want Kratom to remain legal,  it truly does help every day people like me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5289","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rachel Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have never taken kratom but i have never had ailments which might warrant its use yet.

Why on earth would someone deny the right to choose the relief that works the best for them?  Now, I am sure that because this topic has been blown out of proportion, the DEA is AWARE of some benefits from this miraculous plant. I hope they can see how it helps the lives of Americans.

The DEA is basically telling \"us\", \"I deny you the option to have pain relief\". Oh, gee, thanks a lot. I find that behavior disgusting. Putting M. Speciosa in the same class as meth, crack, and cocaine, is insane. I have been taking M Speciosa for three years now. I take it every day.

I do not get that way with M Speciosa. I read about it on a forum and decided to try it. Well, it changed my life for the better. I transitioned over with ZERO WITHDRAWAL symptoms. I felt alive again, slept better, my sex life improved with my wife, my job performance improved, no nodding off.  It is a miracle plant! I think it should remain available and out of the DEA control because I have finally found something that works well and doesn't make me feel guilty when I take it.\nIt is much like cannabis. Different strains do different things. Please don't take my medicine away from me. Thank you, and enjoy you day.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14717","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I hadn't heard of Kratom until the ban was proposed.  It made me curious so I read up on it and ordered some after a few days of research and thought.  I suffer from chronic migraines, psoriatic arthritis, spondylitis, spurring in my bones, celiac, and lots more autoimmune issues.  I use a cane and have a handicap tag for my car although I am 48 years old.  The doctors have me on a lot of different medications for pain control and muscle relaxing but they make me jump through hoops to get it and honestly it makes me feel like giving up because they are treating me like a drug seeker.  I assure you, I am the opposite.\n  \nI ordered a white, green and red vein variety to try plus a couple of other herbs from a company online.  I discontinued the pain meds to try the new ground leaf varieties to get a realistic idea of how it would affect me.  I was shocked at how it felt like I had just had a cup of coffee (it is related to the coffee plant) and an anti-inflammatory.  I didn't feel funny or tired and I didn't get a stomach ache.  It is a big deal for me because I can't take aspirin or any NSAIDS because my stomach and upper intestine bleeds when I do.  I haven't taken pain meds or muscle relaxers again.\n\nFor me, I would compare Kratom to drinking green tea and taking turmeric or other anti-inflammatory supplements.  I believe it is completely reasonable to keep it as a supplement.  I have never tried street drugs or cannabis so I can't compare them, but I would never even worry about trying them as long as the Kratom is available.\n\nThank you for your time and careful consideration.  Please keep this legal so I can stay away from pain medications and function in a more pain-free way and be there for my grandkids.  You have no idea how many times a day I have felt like I had no reason to exist because I couldn't contribute to the household or help with the kids.  This is making it all possible again.  Think of the people who wouldn't require disability or expensive medications at the cost of the state.  Although I have never been high, I did not feel intoxicated in any way.  Hope this helps.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1210","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amy Wolpers","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing this in regards to the proposed ban on Kratom by the DEA. I am able to provide input from various angles as follows.1) A certified drug counselor 2) A recovering person myself 3) Someone who has worked in the criminal justice system for over 30 years. As someone who has personally used it I can say that criminalizing it will create far greater problems than it will solve. It is mild compared to many other drugs and I cannot see filling our prisons with people for using this substance. It would be like placing coffee on the control list today and telling everyone they can't have coffee. It might be for there own good but making people criminals because of it, is not the solution. If used responsibly it appears to be far safer than alcohol, destroys fewer homes, and may have many beneficial purposes. I worked in Prison with Adults incarcerated for drug crimes. This would totally destroy a persons life, if they were made a criminal for a reasonably safe substance. As for those that become addicted I think whether or not a recovering person is safe to use should be dealt with in treatment or with the persons sponsor. Some counselors use a harm reduction model and may consent to this over a relapse into Opiates. If addicted for the first time, they could deal with this in treatment, not in Jail. It's very hard to get your head on straight when you are staring at a conviction.For these reasons I hope you treat Kratom along the lines of Alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine and try to regulate it in that matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15229","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ronald Elias","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am quite upset in the way that the government is trying to take away the rights of the people and I don't want to see this plant take it away.

I have always pushed myself to do things on my own and I believe it is catching up with me.  \n\nI have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, I have a herniated disc is L5-S1, I had rotator cuff repair surgery 18 months ago on my right shoulder, now I need it on my left, and I have multiple bulging disc in my neck that are pressing on nerves on both sides, C4-C5 are in the worst shape.  I have pain and numbness in my arm and hand and it makes it hard for me to sleep.  I currently take Gabapentin, Meloxicam, and Soma on a daily basis and Percocet as needed.\n\nI have worked for the same demanding company for the last 25 years, now as an inventory analyst.  My doctor put me on Wellbutrin about 10 years ago for anxiety due to my high stress management position.  The past 2 years, I was required to work extensive overtime, up to 80 hours per week, 70 hours was common, which probably largely contributed to a very messy and complicated breakup with my boyfriend of 16 years.  That devastated me.  I fell into such a depressed state, I couldn't keep from crying, even at work.  Not cool or professional for Ms. Tuff Independent Girl.  I tried a counselor but that didn't help at all, and didn't feel like searching for the 'right' one, I couldn't bear going through that initial story over and over.  I went to my PCP and she gave me Celexa and I gained 25 pounds within 2 months.  That didn't help my lower back, so she switched me to Cymbalta and I gained 10 more pounds.  I quit crying, but I quit LIVING.  I had no interest in doing ANYTHING.  I would work, eat, sleep.  This happened in about and 8 month span.  I stopped the Cymbalta, back to crying, but not as bad.\n\nI heard about the intended ban on Kratom, I had never heard of it, wondered what the hype was about, I was very skeptical.  But, I read it was taken for pain, depression, anxiety, and could help with weigh loss??  I thought, WOW, THIS IS FOR ME!  I was excited, and so hopeful, still skeptical.  I knew it was on the chopping block, but just wanted to see if I could get any benefit from it, so I ordered some.\n\nI tried it, right away, I could tell a difference in my mental state.  It didn't give me a high, or any real big burst of energy, it just made me feel normal, like my old self.  I felt like doing things I had been neglecting, just taking care of my business, my house, etc.  I never felt that way with either of the anti-depressants.  They just made me feel zoned out, I didn't care about anything, even going to work.  I have called in sick more this year than the other 24 put together.  \n\nI have now taken Kratom about 6 weeks and I feel like I have a reason to get out of bed again.  I hate the thought of Kratom being classed as a Scheduled drug. I feel like I should be able to purchase from my online vendor like other supplements. I don't drink coffee and never have but everyone tells me I don't know what I'm missing, that it helps them so much 'get their day started' or 'give them the extra kick in the afternoon to finish out their day'.  I honestly don't see Kratom any different that I see coffee, soda, energy drink, tea.  And as an added bonus, I have lost about 10 pounds.  I don't know if it is the Kratom or the fact that I feel like living again!\n\nThank you for your time!\nSandy West \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6595","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm 76 years old and have joint pain.

More veterans like my uncle who is a retired Staff Sargeant in the National Guard that served two tours overseas and utilizes Kratom's beneficial aromatics to function healthily in his day to day will also die.

The results on my fitness and health were immediate. I began living a more fit healthy lifestyle which I continualky improve upon day to day week to week. The beneficial aromas of Kratom granted me an enduring strength in body mind and spirit. For these reasons, and multitudes more, I believe Kratom to remain as a regulated dietary supplement.\n\n\n''Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a plant indigenous to Southeast Asia. Its leaves and the teas brewed from them have long been used by people in that region to stave off fatigue and to manage pain and opioid withdrawal. In a comprehensive review published in 2012, Prozialeck et al presented evidence that kratom had been increasingly used for the self-management of opioid withdrawal and pain in the United States. At the time, kratom was classified as a legal herbal product by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Recent studies have confirmed that kratom and its chemical constituents do have useful pharmacologic actions. However, there have also been increasing numbers of reports of adverse effects resulting from use of kratom products. In August 2016, the US Drug Enforcement Administration announced plans to classify kratom and its mitragynine constituents as Schedule 1 controlled substances, a move that triggered a massive response from kratom advocates. The purpose of this report is to highlight the current scientific and legal controversies regarding kratom.''

My brother used to be a hardcore addict but started taking kratom as maintenance and was able to pull his life together when nothing else worked (rehab, suboxone, methadone). He is now off kratom and said there was very little withdrawal. He also said that kratom didn't give him the extreme cravings that he would get from opiates. Kratom isn't an opiate, I don't know what it is besides a miracle. He was never able to handle opiate and would always go overboard on them but on kratom he was a functioning member of society. I fear if (God forbid) he relapses on opiates there will be no way out for him if kratom is illegal. \nThe other family member has a chronic pain disorder called RSD. she is always in pain and her quality of life is horrible. She takes traditional opiates but was able to cut back and not use as much once she started kratom. Kratom also helped her with the depression that comes with debilitating pain. She is no longer suicidal. Banning kratom will kill her. She had tried multiple times before we found kratom. I am begging you for my family's sake to not make it illegal. Please have a heart and let us keep this relatively benign plant. If you must ban something ban the extracts. From my understanding the extracts are unreliable and are sometimes cut with other things.  The very few kratom deaths were attributedoing to the extracts and not the plain leaf.

Take into consideration that millions of people use the herbal remedy without any deaths reported with hundreds of years of use. \n\nLet me give you some background on my personal use of the substance and observations. I am a 20 year chronic pain patient that is being treated by the Veterans administration at the VA Hospital pain clinic. Over the course of 20 years the VA has prescribed everything from muscle relaxers, NSAID's, Opioid's to Acupuncture and Therapy. I was told in July that my Liver function was dismal and that the prescriptions medications (Opioids at the time) were the cause since they contained Tylenol and I had been using them for several years. At that point what does the VA do? They prescribe more Vicodin. This not only makes no sense but also makes me question whether they have my health and well-being as their priority or if they just want to bill insurance for their \"services\". I filled the prescription on August 2nd for 60 Vicodin. 2 days later a friend introduced me to Kratom so I tried it and to my pain level was finally managed for the first time in 20 years. I previously had to pay people to do yard work, had trouble walking on hard surfaces and other situations that aggravated the situation. Since having access to this herbal supplement I have been virtually pain free with no side effects. With Vicodin I had constipation, the pain was still present and really didn't do anything but make my buzzed to where I didn't care about the pain. With Kratom I am able to do things such as jog that I was previously not able to do, I am more active with my family and I feel that I am a more productive member of society. \n\nInstead of banning this botanical substance I think you should be promoting the use of it to fight the Opioid epidemic and not to interfere with the responsible use of a naturally occurring herbal supplement that is safe. Kratom has been in use for a long time with no threat to the public at all.  Also using poison call center data to show a threat was extremely misleading because sure people may call but that doesn't mean they are having a life threatening emergency from the substance. \n\nLook as a disabled service connected veteran I did not fight to have my freedom's taken away from me in this country with no legitimate proof of an imminent threat. Nobody has died since the ban was proposed so it was not an imminent issue. The issue is that the DEA seems insistent on taking away peoples choice to do as they please and address medical issues as they see fit. Had I listened to the doctors I could have possibly needed a liver at this point and putting me at unneeded risk is not acceptable. The VA has failed Veterans and you were attempting to fail the safe, effective use of this botanical. If you really want to stop the Opioid epidemic you speak of you should be promoting this substance to help people as it gives them a safer alternative to actually take control of their own health and well-being. Alcohol kills people yet we saw exactly how prohibition turned out. Many more people died drinking anything they could get their hands on. The war on Drugs has not done anything because if the DEA was effective it wouldn't have this epidemic on their hands in the first place. People choose everyday to drink alcohol even though it attacks the liver and thousands of people die on the highways each year. I don't see anybody rushing to outlaw alcohol so please don't rush to outlaw a plant that is and has been being used for thousands of years without issue. Don't create a black market where terrorist or organized crime will have yet another substance to traffic especially since Kratom is legal in Canada and Mexico and we will just create a situation in which the substance will be smuggled and sold, adulterated, etc. by the criminal element to increase profits. \n\nI appreciate the DEA as an organization but you were wrong on this decision and I appreciate the fact that you have reversed course and began listening to common sense and the people that would not have this herbal supplement as an option. This substance has no place being scheduled at any level and should remain unregulated, available and should be researched, promoted and celebrated because it is the answer to America's Opioid epidemic and abuse problem. \n\nK Wetzel","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1077","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"K Wetzel","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"WHY is the DEA continuing to deny science and keep medicinal plants that have been used safely for centuries away from the people?

It alters ones state of consciousness. But so do caffeine and nicotine.  If you take too much caffeine, you can get a panic attack.  If you take too much nicotine, you can get severely nauseous  and vomit. If you drink a lot of coffee and stop, you can experience withdrawal such as shaking and confusion.  If you use a lot nicotine and stop, you could experience fatigue, weight gain, and even depression. \n\nThe point I am trying to make is that what makes a substance harmful is NOT that it alters consciousness or that it has potential for dependence and withdrawal.  If that were the case, then tobacco, coffee, and certainly alcohol would all be completely illegal.  I am arguing that what makes a substance harmful is a matter of DEGREE.  Cocaine and Heroine --for example-- form dependence rapidly, cause rapid harm to the body, and cause crippling withdrawal when stopped abruptly. Caffeine and Nicotine however, take a long time to develop dependence, cause little short term harm, and the withdrawal--though uncomfortable--does not impair functioning. \n\nKratom --much like Coffee and nicotine-- takes a long time to develop dependence, has limed short term harmfulness, and causes mere discomfort upon withdrawal.  I have no systematic research to back this up, but my personal experience, as well as that of some friends and colleges, is precisely as I stated above.  \n\nI started taking Kratom as a mood stabilizer for depression instead of prescription medication.  I was taking about 1 gram of powder daily for 4 weeks.  It took away the withdrawal effect of the medication, and gave me the ability to withstand that withdrawal to the point where I could quit both the medication and the Kratom.

I find it helps with my back pain (due to herniated disc and sciatica, as well as degenerative disc disease) tremendously. It eliminates the need for opioid medication, and it does so without impairing my motor function or cognitive clarity like the opioids had done... Kratom has been beneficial to me in other ways as well, and I've never had any negative side effects.

Completely dormant! Talk about quality of life. This man doesn't have it without kratom.  He deserves - all veterans deserve - the right to have Kratom available to them.\n\nI've seen a woman whose dermatological reaction to prolonged steroids looked -and apparently felt - like third degree burns completely consuming her skin.

This lovely person definitely deserves the right to access to Kratom.\n\nI've seen personal accounts from people who had previously self-medicated with alcohol who tried kratom and were able to quit drinking, or to drink only occasionally/socially.

They deserve the right to consume Kratom.\n\nI didn't even mention the countless drug addicts who found relief and sobriety through kratom. Or the countless sufferers of PTSD whose SSRIs and Mood Stabilizers had failed them. They, too, found kratom and thus found relief... and hope.  Why shouldn't they, too, have the right to consume Kratom?\n\nAs for me, the thought of returning to opioids frightens me. Pharmaceuticals and I have a lot of experience with each other and let me tell you ... I've dealt with enough side effects from benzos, Mood Stabilizers,  SSRIs, SNRIs, opiates, Lyrica, and all sorts of other things... I'm scared to death of Pharmaceuticals. They are medicine, sure.  Cure? Nope. Side effects cause other conditions which require medication.. and the cycle continues.  I don't want medication anymore.  I want Kratom.  And I, and countless others, deserve the right to have it and consume it as they see fit. Adults should have a right to make these choices.

I have never witnessed a single negative side effect. I have only seen positive results. Prescription drug use is way down. The side effects of those prescription drugs are gone. The financial burden of those medications is way down as well. This individual is healthier and happier. I have taken it a handful of times. Noticing the positive effects that were being experienced by others, I expected to feel something powerful when I took it. I must admit, it was underwhelming in that regard. The effects were mild, but effective. The edge was gone. But I did not feel loopy or lightheaded or unfocused - all symptoms I have experienced with other medications. 30 minutes after taking the kratom, the only thing I felt was less pain. In a sense, it reminded me of coffee. You have a cup of coffee in the morning, you feel more awake, perhaps a little more focused. With Kratom, the pain was very much decreased, but that was the only side effect.

I have found myself to be bettor off with Kratom.  I believe this substance has not had a negative effect on myself, the other individuals I know that take it or the greater society.  I am of the opinion that Kratom has a low potential for abuse, and I see many reasons why certain individuals would benefit from easy access to this plant.  For me Kratom has a similar affect as coffee and I would not consider Kratom to be an impairing substance.  I strongly believe that if Kratom is to be restricted it will result in many people living a lower quality of life with virtually no positive results for society.

This herb has been vital in the prevention of me relapsing into alcoholism and for the treatment of my depression. I have struggled with alcoholism most of my adult life (I am now 49 years old). Through rehab and counseling I have been able to determine that the root cause of my alcoholism has been ongoing mental depression. The use of regular antidepressants provided little in treating my condition. I discovered kratom through the advice of a friend at work. The results in alleviating my depression were almost immediate. I have no desire to drink and for me that is a miracle. I am the kind of alcoholic that wakes up in jail wondering what I did to get there. That is one of the most terrifying experiences one could ever have. I haven't had even the slightest urge to drink alcohol since my use of kratom began two years ago and my depressed state has improved immensely. Please take into consideration people like me that rely on this herb to have a quality of life that without it would be highly detrimental.

In fact, I don't really see much good at all to come from the banning of such a useful plant. The fact that there have been no recorded deaths attributed directly to its consumption already gives kratom a better image than pharmaceutical opioids to me personally. We have an epidemic with opiates in America and the place where a lot of our addicts began was in the pharmacy with short term prescriptions of narcotic painkillers. The prescriptions run out and they turn to illicit substances like heroin because they are left physically addicted to the opioids they got from their doctor. \n The aforementioned narcotics are killing more and more people every day. They are ruining more and more lives. They are tearing apart more and more families, they are costing our society more and more money in the population of correctional facilities, and their presence is more prominent in this country than ever before in history. \n Again, the place that most people get hooked to narcotics to begin with is the pharmacy, with drugs considered to be \"safe\" and medicinally valuable. These drugs can severely slow respiratory function and can be fatal to people in even moderate doses... But a plant that people have used safely for thousands of years for many many different benefits is what we are talking about restricting access to. \n In the past 20 years the western world has discovered that kratom can be a refuge in turning away from extremely addictive and intoxicating opioids. People find that their opiod withdrawals are much less intense when they use kratom. They are able to sleep, they are able to face their day without feeling horribly ill, and they are able to calm the mind-bending anxiety. Many people have successfully kicked their narcotic dependence with the help of kratom. It is a miracle to the people who have used it in their fight against addiction!\n The economic and environmental implications of an American ban on kratom to Indonesia specifically would be negative as well. Kratom is sustainably harvested from trees in the forest without having to cut them down or harm them. It has given people in Indonesia an opportunity at livelihood without deforestation and has recently been competing with the environmentally harmful production of palm oil - the highest contributing factor to Indonesia's rapid deforestation. Banning kratom in America would make the market much more scarce and this alternative means of making a living would be much less viable.\n All this and much more brings me to the question of who would really benefit at all from kratom being a scheduled substance? Certainly not the people suffering daily with addiction to painkillers and heroin. Those people would lose a very valuable tool in their ability to regain control of their lives. Good people who work hard for their living will be taken from their sources of income. People who don't like the intense stimulation of coffee will no longer be able to enjoy a much milder and much more pleasant alternative.\n Please reconsider your stance on the natural botanical supplement kratom. Many people will turn back to heroin and illicit use of prescriptions. That means many more people will unfortuantely die at the hands of drugs as a result. If the DEA's job is to protect us from dangerous drugs then I oblige you to leave kratom alone.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13559","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ronny Rizzat","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please consider the incredible benefits of Kratom before relegating it to a schedule 1 drug.

Kratom mirrors the natural and helpful properties of cannabis. Cannabis was made illegal for a plethora of reasons, none of it had to do with the plant itself - William Randolph Hearst's paper and oil interests, growing resentment of jazz culture and interracial relationships for example. Then during the 1970's was classified as a schedule 1 drug to combat both the anti-war effort and the black power movement.\nHowever, you are now seeing a movement to make cannabis legal and many states have made that move, mine own among them. It has taken over 80 years to repare the damage of the \"reefer madness\" days and I beg you, do not let Kratom go down that path.\nInstead of oil and paper interests, it is the interests and powerful lobbies of pharmaceutical companies that seek to monetize the active chemicals in Kratom.

I have been going to a therapist and a psychiatrist on and off through the years and been on many different medications. \n\nSome of the medications that i started in my teenage years were highly addictive and on top of the issues that already made life difficult were made more complex by a substance abuse and dependency to the very meds that were suppossed to help me. \n\nI then later developed addictions to street opiates and then Suboxone. This combined with the benzodiazapines for my anxiety and the amphetamines for ADD made it impossible to live a normal life. I developed a psychosis and lost touch with reality. \n\nDuring my psychosis i would kind of black out and not remember days at a time. I also developed a fascination with fire and started lighting fires in the woods around my town. Eventually in one of my black outs i burned down a really big church in my town and was arrested. \n\nI spent 2 1/2 years behind bars, got 10 years of probation, and have to pay almost 8,000 dollars in restitution for what their insurance would not cover. Luckily the parishioners were forgiving of me and we have been able to move on and i helped them do a lot of work with the new building.\n\nWhen i was released from prison i knew i would still have my mental health problems to deal with but i could not take the addictive medications that got me where i am now. Then I heard about kratom. I bought some from a friend's recommended online vendor and i made tea with it. \n\nIt helped me in ways that i could cope more effectively with my illnesses. I am still on some Rx meds for my illnesses but none of the addictive meds that i was on before. It is not a replacement or treatment for my illness but helps me enough so that i no longer have the need for addictive drugs and i can start putting my life back together.\n\nIn the last year and a half since I was released from prison I started going to school for graphic design. I have been passing all my classes with A's and B's. I started making music again and just about to release a record. I have an interest in gardening and study exotic plants that I also run a website on. I draw again. I participate in life where before i could not function to do any of these things. \n\nI can't say enough how kratom has allowed me to put my life back together. I have never been able to do anything positive when taking destructive and addicting drugs. My point being is that if kratom was a destructive addicting drug, it would have been disastrous for my well being. This is absolutely not the case. Thank God for kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1328","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adam Finnegan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As someone who grew up in Northeast Ohio and currently reside in Southeast Michigan, I have seen the damage and pain that opioid addiction can cause.

It's not a miracle cure, but it works very well for my pain and allows me to live my life fully & give of myself to the people I love. I have been using this wonderful plant for a little over a year now. It never leaves me feeling \"drugged\" like I felt on pain medication. I never need more than my 1 teaspoon, I never crave more, I've never robbed a convenience store to get it, and no one's ever found me passed out in my vehicle because of it! I just had my annual physical and I'm in great health. My husband and I bicycle often, sometimes over 40 miles on beautiful Saturday in Minnesota.

I am a 34 year old Order Picker/Loader at a Kroger distribution center, in Ohio. I first stumbled upon Kratom a little over a year ago, while trying to find a way of coping with chronic pain (Caused by Fibromyalgia). \n\nOver the counter medications won't even begin to touch the pain that I experience on a daily basis, and can damage my organs. Pretty much any prescription medication that I have ever tried, has either had little or no effect, contained animal products (which I don't eat), or had side effects, that out weighed the benefits. \nThe only medications that Have ever given me any relief, were either muscle relaxers (that incapacitated me), or opioid medications (that come with some serious risks). \n\nWhile trying to avoid going down the road of being dependant on medications, or unconscious in bed, for days at a time.. I stumbled upon Kratom, and it has helped me immensely. \n\nIt takes my pain away, and leaves me feeling awake and aware when I need to be. It provides me with long lasting pain relief, and even helps me with anxiety..I believe. Which as a result, helps me to sleep better at night and function more productively during the day. \n\nBased on how much Kratom has helped me to live a more productive life, (It's also helped me to maintain my 2-1/2 yr sobriety from alcohol, I do believe) and how mild its effects are in comparison to many other substances that I have tried, many of which, obtained legally with no prescription at all, such as Alcohol..  \n\nI Do Not believe that Kratom belongs in a class of \"Drugs\" that has \"no accepted medical use\".\nIf anything it is quite the opposite. Kratom is a Plant, that has helped a lot of people. It needs to be researched, and needs to remain available to the people of this nation.  \n\nI Do believe, that this plant -if available to the public (at an affordable cost), has great potential to steer a lot of Very Lost people, back into the right direction. Away from highly addictive drugs (and alcohol), and back toward a life of normality.\n\nIf it were categorized as a schedule one drug, it would prevent important research from being carried out. It would also give drug dealers a chance to cash in (I'm afraid), and would also put a lot of hard working (otherwise law abiding) individuals, into the position of  becoming a criminal, if they weren't to discontinue their supplementation of it.\n\nAnd in my opinion, it is definitely not the hard working people of this country (or the recovering addicts, for that matter) that law enforcement should be worried about. \n\nI could go on and on.. But I have to be up for work in a few hours. (=\n\nThank you for taking my comment into consideration.

I came to the realization I can't function like this anymore and being  a Special Education Teacher I knew I needed to stop.

Just because the government's allies, the pharmaceutical companies, can't profit off of it, doesn't mean it should be illegal. It's absolutely pathetic that you want to ban a tea leaf that has helped so many people and continues to do so, when it's causing nobody any harm. 15 people died as a result of a combination and likely that combination wasn't synergistic with the kratom - but even if it was solely the kratom, many more people die each year from bleeding out through their penis - should we ban the male genitalia, too? What about peanuts? A fair amount of people die from having a peanut allergy (the few and far between), should we ban peanuts as well?\n\nThe comments expressed by the DEA are disgusting (and that's speaking very highly of them). People are \"abusing\" something because they want a natural remedy that actually works and isn't snake oil? Because it actually works to treat a wide range of issues?\n\nWho am I to drink a tea leaf to heal my ailments because the cost of visiting a doctor is astronomically high given new legislation? Who am I to control what goes into my own body and heal myself of pain and/or suffering? Who am I to drink this innocent leaf that has never caused anyone harm and has caused 0 overdoses? Seriously, who the hell am I to want to be happy? I don't have the right to be happy and pain free without synthetic chemicals and paying an astronomical price for medical care and developing a wide range of health issues and chemical dependence, according the DEA.\n\nI'm not going to kiss your ass and try to write this message in a positive tone. You are ridiculous. You are disgusting. This shouldn't be a fight that we have to do. You don't ban what causes real issues, and you try to ban what helps people. If you ban this leaf, many people are going to die from overdose because they'll relapse, many people are going to go without adequate pain management, many people are going to die from suicide or homicide given it treats mental ailments, and many people are going to not enjoy their life. If that's what you're aiming for, which it would appear that it is (and you're probably not going to read these comments, you just wanted to pretend like you care since you illegally attempted to ban it outside of your authority so you can follow the proper process - which even then, kratom doesn't qualify to be scheduled).

It definitely made the transition easy and I forgot all about the pills. \n\nI keep the Kratom use to a minimum though, and just use it when my knee or back pain flairs up after a longer walk or hard day.

I know there are several others here that also have quite a bit to say on \nthis matter, or would like to say something and simply can't. I'd like to speak on behalf of some of these folks, as I'm\n very much involved still with the veteran community and support fellow veterans that operate non profit organizations \nfor a much greater cause than I could even put into words Over the past year, I have linked up with some of my comrades\n and have talked with many veterans of all sorts of settings. Regardless of the current professions or goals and endeavors, \nwe all seem to be linked by the spirit and that is to provide selflessly to our brotherhood as well as the service to our country. \nBoth items are of pretty extreme importance.\n\n Recently, many of us have seemed to come under attack; not by enemies of a foreign land. This time it is, what we feel, \nour personal freedom. Some of us are very broken people that had been shuffled \nthrough the VA and pumped fool of the same classes of pharmaceutical drugs only to yield the same result: inefficacy. \nOne thing that has obviously been replacing some of these harsh narcotics are the ubiquitous and inexpensive supply \nof herbal alternatives. I used to doubt the idea of taking any substance not approved by the FDA, but I honestly believe this\n time a grave mistake has been made by not giving kratom the consideration or respect it deserves. I've used it for roughly\n8 months and in absolute moderation. I can personally attest to it's usefulness, lack of side effects experienced and most\n importantly, it's ability to give back a part of my life that has been missing for some time now. \n\nKratom for many of us was a source of freedom from hard medications and lack of clarity; lack of self. \nA thousand times over, it has restored many of us to what most would consider \"normal\". \nI do not think it is a good idea to take that right away or to criminalize something that is,\n harmless without honoring it for what it has done for many of these wonderful people. The feeling is a consensus among us \nand we do see the DEA's stance on kratom as a threat to our livelihood. I don't want to go on about the benefits because that\n is simply not my place, but I would like to speak on the very principle of what is happening here. We have elected to choose \nto put something in our bodies that has come with no proven ill-effects. I've looked at the information regarding kratom on \nmany of these .gov sites, and it's insufficient. I think as the greatest government in the world, we could certainly do better on \nbeing more scrupulous with our case studies. I encourage that the DEA take a few steps back and not see kratom as another \ndrug out there in the wild that needs to be taken on because the number of users and types of users vary so widely that it is as\n if you are looking at all of the faces that make up America in itself. I do not think your everyday American is a crook or a \ndelinquent. I urge you not to start a war against a substance that is doing so much good for the men and women that have\n sworn on their lives to uphold the highest code of integrity and give good for you.\n\n If you or anyone reading this is a veteran, \nI thank you for your service, and I thank you for sharing the burdens with me. I have a sincere passion for doing what is right, \nwhat is fair and what is honestly for the better. Thank you for all that you do as an organization. I, too, appreciate the safety \nyou try to bring to our culture and way of life. I just do not believe that kratom is here to cause anyone any harm or provide \nthe financing to criminal activities. I've looked into it practically and economically, and I think we will do just fine with the \nregards we had for it prior to August 31st of this year. Again, I'm very grateful for this opportunity to say my piece and I sure\n hope this address is not falling into a void among the rest of them. Godspeed, my friends.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3943","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"nathanael bynum","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been taking Kratom almost everyday for about three years.

Before I started taking the Kratom, my doctor kept putting me on drugs like Abilify, Prozac, and Paxil. The Abilify gave me muscle spasms so bad that my body would lock up into one position and I could not hardly move. The Prozac made me black out and do things I do not remember doing. The Paxil just put me in a daze all of the time. Kratom was a great solution for me at the time when I needed it for my anxiety and depression.\n     Now that I no longer need it for depression, I use it sparingly to treat menstrual cramps. It works VERY well. Ibuprofen barely takes the edge off of the pain. When I get the cramps, the pain radiates through my back and down my legs. Kratom makes the pain GO AWAY. Then instead of laying in bed feeling sorry for myself all day, I can get back to work. I feel like Kratom is a great herbal supplement that can be used to treat many ailments. It also has very few negative side effects that I have noticed. The only negative thing I have noticed about it is that if you are too tired when you take it, it will make you cranky. That is not a very profound negative side effect to me.\n    I think Kratom should be researched to determine what effects it might have on other medications. It should also be studied to see if it poses a risk to pregnant women and their unborn children. Kratom is just misunderstood due to the blatant lack of research that has been done on this helpful herb.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21418","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kayla Ponder","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Ryan Gregory, I am a student at the University of North Texas studying Drug Rehabilitation Studies.

Because of my background in studying various types of drugs in an academic setting, I was very hesitant. I was wrong. The benefits that I have received have been far beyond what I had imagined. I have been in less pain, sleeping better, more motivated, and my social anxiety has all but dissipated.

Coffee is more addicting. \n\nI heard that the DEA was trying to schedule Kratom shortly after I started its use and It really upset me. I dont understand why it would be made illegal when there are so many other drugs that are so deadly (cigarettes, alcohol), with no health benefits, that remain legal to this day. \n\nI'm making a formal plea to the DEA as somebody who is studying to counsel for drug use, as somebody who uses Kratom and sees massive benefits, and as somebody that truly cares for this countries population and hopes for their best interests. \n\nI would be extremely disappointed if everybody who made a plea to the DEA was ignored.

While I believe the intentions may be noble, I also believe this action will negatively affect many lives who rely on this plant. Kratom has been safely used for thousands in Southeast Asia for relief of chronic pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression and in some cases addiction. I believe many news media stations have made the mistake of making of lumping it in with dangerous legal highs, such as spice/bath salts and have not adequately conveyed the benefits the herb has to its adult users. \n\nI am normally the first one to write off herbal remedies but this plant has a lot of merit, and quite frankly changes lives. A large amount of chronic pain patients have been able to successfully get off their narcotic pain medication using kratom and use it as a safe cheap alternative to control their pain. Unlike narcotic medications, pain patients using kratom can find relief at low doses with relatively less issues with tolerance and dependence. It works in the same area of the brain as narcotic medications, without providing the euphoria or respiratory depression seen with conventional opiod drugs. With the current epidemic of opiod addiction in my state of Florida right now, having non-narcotic/herbal options for pain management is paramount to combating drug diversion. It does not make sense to ban an herb that will result in less narcotics being prescribed and ultimately less dangerous prescription drugs hitting the streets. \n\nAside from the benefits Kratom has for pain patients, it also helps combat heroin/oxycodone addiction. While ultimately abstinence should be the long-term goal of addiction therapy, many people in recovery need to have opiod-maitentence therapy in order to function. For some patients Suboxone/methadone come with a lot of adverse effects and can be potentially life-threatening. Also a lot of the doctors that prescribe these therapies do not get covered by insurance, meaning it is not a financially viable option for most patients. A lot of people have successfully used kratom as a tool to suppress drug cravings and find stability in their life. By outright banning the plant, patients who utilize this herb are at a high risk of returning to heroin/oxy use, which ultimately could be fatal for them. I truly believe if kratom is made illegal it will lead more opiod overdoses, and is losing even one person worth it? \n\nKratom helps me (a 68 year old) combat depression, fatigue and anxiety where I have not found complete relief using anti-depressants or stimulates. While Prescription meds can be useful to to treat these conditions, they can leave me and many patients disappointed or with adverse side effects. On a personal level I can attest that this plant gave me my life back. As someone who has struggled with depression and anxiety for decades, kratom helps me maintain a positive, healthy and productive life. If you do research on the internet you will be able to find thousands of testimonials on the lives this plant has changed. \n\nI started using Kratom over two years ago and was able to stop taking the much more expensive and less affective  pharmaceuticals of Wellbutrin (300mg once a day) and Adderall (25mg three times a day). It is my belief long term use of Adderall is toxic to my system where as I have no side affects from taking a dose of 3g once (sometimes twice a day). \n\nI understand politicians need to do their due diligence to fight the ongoing drug epidemic. I also realize it is important to protect adolescents from trying dangerous new drugs that hit the market. Unfortunately unscrupulous head shops/gas stations have taken advantage of kratom and rebranded it as a legal high for consumption. This is wrong and should be addressed; that is why I would support a retail control of the sale of kratom, or at the very least a law requiring people to be 21 to purchase the plant. This is a much more reasonable step to take rather than making the drug an illegal schedule 1 substance. If this goes into effect, thousands of law-abiding citizens across  will become potential felons. The demographic of an average kratom is not a drug-addled teenager, but rather a baby-boomer adult (me) who most likely has a history of chronic pain, depression or other distressing conditions. These patients should not have to worry about getting arrested or possessing an illegal substance. If this ban makes kratom illegal thousands of residents are going to have to face the choice of breaking the law or seriously compromise their state of well-being. In conclusion, I implore you to reconsider the extent of this ban. I beg you to not to punish thousands of adults based on misinformation about a safe medicinal plant. Without it, I'd have to go back to the pharmaceuticals which are not as affective for me and cost over $300/month - what will have have to do without in order to pay for the medication?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3444","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Cherry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please, do not place any bans or further regulations on Kratom. Our son, while in college, was injured playing sports; un-diagnosed (for two  years) broken spinal process (L4). As a result he fell into chronic pain - this led to a downward spiral into pain causing lack of sleep, causing depression and down and down; pain, no sleep, depression... In the end he dropped out of college without explanation; we didn't find out for a year - he is on the opposite side of the country. For three years his mom and I didn't sleep either - worry and deep anxiety would wake us up at any time of night and cause our days to be filled with uncertainty. Numerous trips back to \"help\" produced only small, temporary results and improvement. We don't have the money to afford alternative, non-insurance covered treatments so could only work with what was available. Then we lost contact. With heavy hearts we knew there was very little we could do.  Out of the blue, after five or six months we were again contacted by him; he wanted me to cosign a loan for school. He  was working his way back into college, taking courses in another college that would allow him to make up the credits he missed, after which working to be readmitted to his initial college, where, after completing his first semester as a senior had accomplished a 3.63 GPA. He is now only ten days away from the end of his senior year, finishing in Dec. as he reentered in the spring. The only thing that has worked to help him manage his pain and keep it controllable is Kratom. I can attest to the change in his outlook toward progress, success-oriented thinking and keeping goal minded. There are so many stories people are sharing, and he is desperately hoping you do not change his ability to get Kratom. This is not a crazy, bathtub-made drug. It has been used for hundreds of years in many cultures for many purposes, is consumed mainly as a tea, and has no evidentiary anecdotes concerning over use or negative causative effects. Please, just leave it alone. \nWe are finally sleeping through the night, or at least are now only waking up due to being older - no anxiety associated issues.

I suffer from fibromyalgia for over 20 years. my daily medication is not only highly addictive but the cost has become astronomical and one, that I have taken on a 2nd job to pay for it. \nI was doing research on a large national  fibromyalgia awareness website and was looking for natural supplements that people had experienced with for overall pain and opioid dependence.  What I was reading was not scientific information or studies, but rather other people who suffer from the same condition and were offering their own personal stories and testimonies.\nI read about Kratom  and decided to give it a try. It is now six months later and because of being able to take this natural supplement, I have been able to work more, live less pain-free, and reduce the amount  of opiates I take.   I cannot afford to continue to see specialists because the insurance costs are too high. I feel so lucky and grateful to have something that is natural  that I can turn to that helps me  to be a better wife and mother.\nwhen I first heard that Kratom  was to become a schedule one,  The hopelessness and darkness I felt was one that I have not felt in years. \nThis plant had been a savior to  myself and my family. If it becomes a crime to possess it,  I am scared of the effects that it would have on me personally. I would be forced to turn back to opiates and depression medication,  in addition to not being able to work at the same level I do now to support my family.\n Please listen to the thousands of people who are begging you to hear them. We are good honest hard-working people that just want to feel good,  while suffering from many chronic conditions. All I want is to feel healthy and be a productive member of society.\nI reached out to my local Congresswoman who in fact agreed and signed the dear colleague letter in October.

In the past i have used Kratom (about 6 years ago) for anxiety. It got me through a tough time and I no longer needed it.\nNow, I suffer from many different back problems, due to an old injury. I have been through multiple physical therapy- pain management, injections, 5 different medications, chiropractor/acupuncture, massage, creams, and the list goes on. I have found NOTHING that compares to the relief I achieve from Kratom. \nI remembered Kratom, and started taking it again- regularly 2 years ago. It has changed my life. I am able to live my life again, take care of my home and family, run errands, and chase after my toddler and be the best mom i can be. Before I started taking Kratom again, my family life was taking a turn for the worst. I rarely slept without meds and they rarely helped anyway. I couldn't get out of my bed in the morning. I had to take MORE prescription meds, and still couldnt really do anything. The side effects I had from everything I took were terrible. So terrible, I was angry, depressed, gained weight, anxiety- my fiance and I fought daily because he didn't know how to help, and I felt I was a burdon. \nI was depressed about everything, especially not being able to play with my baby. THAT was the hardest. Sometimes I had to call my fiance home from work because I was in so much pain I couldn't lift my baby, let alone stand any longer. I couldn't cook healthy meals, take care of the home, nothing. It was very sad, and i knew everyone was better off without me.\n Now, I have a wonderful life again. My family is happy, I am happy, and we were able to move into a new house. WE plan to be married in spring, and we have achieved so much together. \nWhen i heard Kratom would be banned- we were all upset- I was devestated. Like hearing someone died. My heart breaks to think about going back to the place I/my family was in. We are very active, always busy, going places and enjoying our lives... I can't imagine the impact I would have on my family if I was in such pain again. It would be a sad thing for sure. I'm writing this with tears in my eyes and I can only pray that Kratom will not be removed from my life.

I was losing touch with friends and family simply because I would always find it exhausting to socialize.I found myself contemplating suicide a few times but was too scared to leave my loved ones behind. I discovered kratom when I began to suffer from withdrawals after taking prescription pills. The pills were extremely helpful with my mental illness, but I was stealing from my families medicine cabinets and I knew then that i had become an addict and it had to end. I needed help whining myself off these pills, and fortunately i found a herb that helped me out extremely well. I have been using kratom as my daily morning dose since 2014 and I will say kratom is not a \"High\" inducing drug. If anything I will compare it to drinking coffee but a more subtle surge of energy and well being and not as euphoric as Hydrocodone or Oxycodone. Ever since I started using kratom I was able to get a job and continue my school work. I have made many new friends and have even began a relationship with a beautiful girl. I wouldn't be where I am without this herb. However, I do agree that we should have a regulation to make sure people who do not sell the herb with laced drugs. Possibly even making it a 18 or older product.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3682","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Dwane","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be illegal.

All signs so far point to Kratom being immensely positive for those struggling with opiate addiction, and it also seems to have little to no negative effects overall in the overwhelming majority of cases.

Approximately three years ago, I was prescribed anti-depressants after being diagnosed with depression. My psychiatrist, at that time, prescribed me with a few different SSRI's and a dopamergenic. I know that for some people, anti-depressants may work, however they had an adverse affect on me and the side effects far outweighed the benefits. I found that the SSRI's made my depression worse. I tapered off the medication, which was difficult, even though I was only on them for a couple of months. At that time, I heard about Kratom and decided to give it a try. I consumed Kratom for approximately two months in the wake of my negative experience with prescription medications. Kratom did not cure or treat my depression, however it noticeably enhanced my quality of life. I still struggled with depression and I still had anxiety, however, Kratom helped promote a sense of well being that made it possible to get through those two months and still be a productive member of society. To further expound upon how Kratom has helped me, yet not treated any condition of mine, I would like to go into detail about just what my condition is. Recently, I discovered through a gene test that I have a genetic mutation of the MTHFR gene and this means that my body does convert folic acid into methylfolate which is the precursor to serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. I have been supplementing with a prescribed medical food, L-methylfolate, which has targeted that genetic anomaly and balanced it, therefore increasing my serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine levels safely and naturally without any adverse affects. Also, my serotonin transporter has a genetic mutation where the presynaptic transmembrane protein (SLC6A4) has an intermediate risk of being non-response. Essentially my serotonin levels can pool up, therefore generating large risk with any intake of a prescribed SSRI. This also means that my glutamate levels are higher than the average person, which can generate large amounts of anxiety and also create insomnia because your brain cannot turn off. I would like to reiterate and say that Kratom did not fix these gene mutations and increase my serotonin levels like L-methylfolate has, nor did it force my glutamate levels down like a prescribed medication would. However, in that transitory phase of my life, Kratom safely helped promote a healthy lifestyle and gave me the energy to continue working. It's a safe alternative to caffeine and I would like to compare and explain why Kratom is safer than caffeine. I consumed a lot of caffeine in my years prior to my experience with Kratom, and it damaged my health. Caffeine acts on the adrenal glands, which is the bodies primary defense against stress. With my genetic variations, stress and depression were amplified, and when my adrenal glands were exhausted, I had no physiological defense against that stress which contributed to developing GERD and other digestive imbalances. Kratom has proven to me to be safer than caffeine and has not had any negative impact on my body like caffeine has nor has it inhibited my bodies ability to fight stress. In fact, some of the many alkaloids found in the kratom plant, act as an immunostimulant, which has helped my body fight off infection. Granted, when it comes to fighting bacterial and viral infections, there is no replacement for proper diet and sleep. I implore the FDA to do rigorous testing of Kratom and allow for data to be put fourth from many reputable and independent sources in order to prevent bias. \n  I would like to pose a few questions to the regulatory agencies that have read this comment in addition to thanking them for taking the time to read my testimony. Firstly, I would like to ask the DEA as to why they chose to pursue a ruling over Kratom before the synthetic substance, U-47700. I am aware that they have stated their ruling to schedule Kratom was in the interest of public safety, and I believe public safety should be top priority. However, as reported by FoxNews in June of 2016, research chemical U-47700 was directly responsible for fifty plus deaths nationwide in a span of less than a year. This poses a much greater danger to public safety than any recorded threat of Kratom, however legal action was first initiated against the natural plant Kratom and not synthetic chemical U-47700. This leads me to my next question, will the DEA publicly release the footnotes that were the basis for their decision to schedule Kratom under the FOIA?\n In conclusion, Kratom has been legal for over two decades in the US and has never caught on as a recreational high. It does not incapacitate the brain like alcohol does and has a long history of safe use. Please keep Kratom legal.\n Thank you for your time in reading my public comment and considering my questions. May you all have Happy Holidays this year.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15578","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carl York","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Doesn't matter how your citizens fill about it anyways Does it?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17862","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel boutwell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has therapeutic use, and for the public good should NOT be made illegal.

I have been on prescription medication's such as Oxicodone 5mg and Tramadol 50 mg for 4 years following extensive neck surgery in 2012 from a car accident. My pain level on any given day from my neck and lower back which was fractured in the accident is anywhere from a 4 to 8, with 8 being severe and extreme pain. Having to take 2 doses of Tramadol with Aleve in the am, followed by Oxi in the afternoon, followed by another 2 doses of Tramadol in the evening just to be able to function. I have been wanting to get off of the prescription medication's for some time, as it has decreased my quality of life. Pain is very debilitating on it's own, and factor in heavy doses of prescription medication taken for years has greatly reduced my thinking clearly, with forgetting simple tasks and appt's, getting very irritable, and just existing on a day to day basis. I was introduced to Kratom just a few days ago only have read some articles online. I can honestly say that on the first day of taking my first dose, my neck and back pain was almost completely gone within 1-1/2 hours and not having to take any other medications with it. it also lasted for me about 15 hours just from 1-8oz cup made into tea. Next day towards late morning, not having any Kratom, all effects had worn off, pain was back with a vengeance, and back on my prescription meds. Yesterday had an 8oz dose of Kratom tea after extreme pain in my neck and shoulders, and almost pain free throughout the rest of the day and night into today with having my dose of Kartom tea now. This stuff works. I can imagine that it can be misused, and in large doses daily, one can get addicted, but if it's not abused, this is truly a miracle plant that needs to be further tested, not outlawed like marijuana prohibition. Look, it's taken 40+ years for marijuana laws and state after state to either legalize it medically and or for recreational, because it's finally at the forefront and studied extensively, and has shone to give much needed relief for chronic pain, cancer treatments, depression, and other aliments. Please don't do this to another plant that can help millions that need this. The pharmaceutical companies don't want this plant because it's cutting into their profits, but it will save lives from those that are dying daily from opioid overdoses. This country in in an opioid epidemic with hundreds of people dying every month, and this is societies magic solution that is natures answer.

I just know from plenty of personal and shared experience, that the dangers alleged are unfounded, and the effect to any human life is definitely primarily positively impacted by this 100% natural leaf.\nCaffeine, from natural coffee beans appears to be more dertimental to the population at this point, yet coffee and such caffeinated beverages are not scheduled. This plant is equally, if not more beneficial than coffee, and is only comperably as dangerous, at MOST. I feel it is a human rights violation (as well as unconstitutional) to utilize systems such as the scheduling one to ultimately prohibit free choice of responsible plant use like this. It would be a great harm to the United States to place this in the Schedule I Category, which will ultimately allow pharmaceutical and illicit narcotics use to continue skyrocketting while this safe alternative is ultimately inaccessible.

The natural herb can not be compared to such mind altering, addicting, life destroying substances, when it can only affect you as much as a cup of coffee and has many benefits for people like me.\nAs of last year I was taking 6 different psychiatric medications a day in an attempt to help control my depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I felt like I could barely keep my head above water, if I did anything it was the bare minimum. And I thought that was just the way my life was going to be, take pills and hope things improve. \nAt the beginning of the year I added kratom to my daily regimen and began decreasing the amount of medications I was taking. The last and hardest psychiatric medication I was on was 450mg of Wellbutrin, I never had a doctor tell me that is a dangerously high dosage. I spent several months tapering off it, scared that my depression would become out of control and I would have to go back to taking that medication again. I take kratom strains that tend to help with depression and energy. As of today I have not taken a single psychiatric medication for approximately 2 months, only a small amount of kratom daily, and not only is my depression and thoughts very manageable. My quality of life is the best it has ever been. My thoughts are clear, my energy level is higher than it has been in years, I am happy to be alive.  \nI am also a recovering opiate user, since taking kratom I have significantly less cravings for pain killing drugs. I still have my struggles with mental health and addiction, but today is so much better than it ever use to be. And I give the credit to working on myself and to kratom. Today my kids have a mom who is present and active in their lives. My spouse has a significant other who is happy to be alive. I have become the best version of myself naturally.\nPlease let kratom continue to help us, taking it away means taking some of our lives away.\"","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5360","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Bugg","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Greetings, please don't let this important medicine be taken from the many because of  few irresponsible experimenters.

I have  lived with this pain for over thirty years, trying every option out there, from opioids, benzos, botox. If  it is out there I have tried it. A year ago I was running out of treatments to try and had three neuro stimulators placed in my head with no relief. My son  was researching natural supplements and found several that has helped us both. When I take kratom on a daily basis, it helps me to feel just a part of life again after spending many days bedridden. I have missed out on many family activities, on disability, can not work or play with my little granddaughter. Kratom has given some of  that lost time back. It is natural and helps with my depression,anxiety and pain. All the prescribed meds I have taken did not work and had many bad side effects. Kratom does not haveany of those, it is natural and has helped milllions of people. More and more people are killing themselves using illegal drugs, not one person has died unless they mixed the kratom with heroin or benzos.. If this drug is scheduled my son will probably relapse and die, and then how will I feel?Thank you for your time.

I have a request to make. \nWhen making your decision, please take into account the psychology of drug addiction, pain management and the overall human condition of pride. People dont want to be told what they can and cannot do with or put into their bodies. If this werent true, we wouldnt have an illegal drug market, or crime of any kind for that matter. Many addicts start out on prescription pain medications, as you well know. When their prescriptions are suddenly stopped, which has been happening and will continue to happen more frequently, the withdrawal symptoms are so intense and scary that they will do just about anything to make it stop; that often means turning to harder, illegal drugs. It takes a lot of willpower for a person to swallow their pride and seek help, which is why many dont. If they do manage to overcome that hurdle, they are given another drug to combat the withdrawals that is just as addictive, dangerous and able to be abused as the one(s) theyre trying to escape. It doesnt make sense and often fails. \nWith half the states in the nation legalizing cannabis for either medical or recreational use, eight more added just this election, it should be abundantly clear that the DEA/FDA banning yet another harmless, helpful natural botanical is the wrong path to take. It also makes it hard to ignore the implication that this is all financially motivated. Public trust in government institutions is and has been on the decline. If this Intent to Schedule Kratom goes through, it will only serve to further that distrust.\nLeaving unadulterated Kratom on the open market, and making cannabis legal at the Federal level, could be the solution that science has failed to satisfactorily provide. People who want to get off of addictive drugs need to have options to do it on their own as well, or they simply either wont do it, will fail trying and go back to their old drug habit, or will become addicted to the cure itself. That is a no-win situation. Allow it to be studied, mandate labelling requirements, ensure product purity, limit the age to 21, but please, for the sake of the American people, keep it legal and affordable for all. Its time to start earning back some of that lost trust.\nThank you,\nAmanda Newingham","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4678","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amanda Newingham","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom stopped the Parkinson like side effects from a medication I was allergic to.

I've suffered with a heroin addiction since I was about 15 years old, and had not found any way to get out of this mess. Before long, 5 years, I found kratom, and it changed everything. I didn't want to get high anymore, I just didn't want to get sick! The idea terrified me. But so did pharmaceudical drugs. I know suboxone has even more dreadful withdrawals (from what I have heard), and was not interested in switching my drug of use to another synthetic product I can't really trust. When I found out about kratom, it changed everything. I have'nt used kratom in about 2 years, and it helped me get completely off heroin in as little as 4 months. It was truly a miracle to have come in my life, and I am disappointed in the fact that pharma and special interest groups are doing anything they can to remove it as an option from society. If they were interested in truly finding solutions, kratom would be a goldmine. The opiate epidemic must end at some point, and people must accept the notion that there are more (usually better/more tolerated by the body) options out there to help. I am a living example of this and thank God I found this instead of another synthetic opoid that would keep me just as addicted as I always was. I never imagined being clean... this has been a dream come true.\n\nWithdrawal from opiates is hell; that is often why people don't take days off. You're freezing, but sweating bullets, every part of your body aches and is weak as fuck, you get RLS, you throw up and get diarrhea... it's not a fun time. \nEdit: some people can do it, but I never could. I could never find the willpower not to use if I had shit. I would try sometimes, but heroin (my DOC) is a hell of a drug. Kratom is like a godsend to me. I no longer run off to pick up the second I get any money at all. I don't get high, and I'm perfectly fine with that. I've never, not once, have taken a shit while high on dope... I can shit using kratom, and function like a normal human being. And I don't take it everyday, and I'm okay with that. This shit is saving my life.\n\nMany lives will be lost to opiate addiction that could be saved with kratom. Please keep it around! I understand that pharma companies see no benefit in its legality; one cannot patent a plant. However, this comes down to the fact that people deserve the right to use the substances they wish to, especially when scientific research has many conclusions leading to the notion that this is a generally safe substance to use especially in comparison to pharmaceutical drugs. I am begging you, and know that many people do not have the time to write this message, so I beg for them as well, please do something to stop this madness. There is a much bigger problem here than just having kratom available. This is about maintaining power and free choice to the tax paying citizens of our nation that expect a certain level of freedom and free will in their decisions!

I have a job and I do not receive any type of government assistance. I've never been in trouble with the law, not even a ticket. I first learned about kratom while researching natural remedies to ease prescription drug withdrawal symptoms for my sister, an addict. She's been clean for more than a year. She's gone back to work, has gained weight, has her finances back on track. I decided to try kratom tea myself, to help with my insomnia. The right amount helped me relax and sleep. I've never received any sort of high from kratom, nor withdrawal symptoms. Please don't disregard the testimonials of others, especially those who use kratom to manage pain and avoid deadly prescription pain killers. Research has shown that kratom does NOT work like an opiate, that it cannot cause respiratory depression. We in the kratom community welcome more tests, regulation even. We are aware that some companies have sold perverted kratom products with many synthetic ingredients and little kratom. That, understandably, has to stop. But for law abiding citizens, kratom should be available as a natural means to aid in our health and well being, just like ginseng or green tea. Kratom is an herb, not a drug. Please consider keeping it legal for adults.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15541","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandy Wells","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would just like to say that I personally went through an addiction to heroin almost 3 years ago and got off without any supplements or other replacements. I remember how hard and long a struggle it was to get off that drug and when I finally did it changed my life tremendously . Now I  am watching my current boyfriend go through a very similar addiction with opiates. He has tried to get off of them through suboxone, methodone, etc and nothing has worked. A couple months ago he was introduced to Kratom and it has been the only thing that has saved him. His mental stability has went back to normal and it is amazing to see how quickly he was able to get off it with Kratom. The beautiful thing is unlike methodone, Kratom has not been another addiction but instead a harmless replacement when he starts to feel cravings come on. His health status has come full circle and if it gets banned I don't know what will happen. I personally have tried it once or twice as a recovering addict and it hasn't caused me any cravings for it like other replacements. Please understand that if we ban this we are opening up the gates to relapse across the country to recovering addicts. I hope you consider this carefully when makeing your final decision.

I'm almost 68 years old.  I learned about kratom about four years ago after a lifetime of seeking energy and clarity of mind and a positive mood that didnt involve sugar or large doses of caffeine. Katom supports my energy and a healthy positive mood. It contains no caffeine and also has helped defeat the sugar and alcohol cravings, which were a poor source of energy and alertness, anyway.\n\n\nKratom may also be helping with my 40 year history of chronic back pain by keeping my muscles relaxed and supple. I give most of the credit for that to the high-quality nutritional supplements that I began taking about the same time I learned about kratom.\n\n\nI am semi-retired now and in very good health. After a long career of doing a variety of work to pay my bills while pursuing my deeper personal interests of health and athletics, I have settled down to write &\n\n\nWhy is the DEA trying to ban an herb that is mostly being consumed to help people permanently withdraw from narcotic addiction and habituation? All at a great cost savings to ourselves and our insurance programs!\n\n\nWouldnt it be a better investment of DEA funding to prevent heroin, fentanyl, and other synthetic drugs from entering the country on the basis of # of lives saved?\n\n\nWhy does the FDA and DEA both say that kratom causes respiratory depression? Several researchers have found no evidence of that in new experimentation or in reviews of the medical literature.\n\n\nSee this recent study: https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/americankratomassociation/pages/21/attachments/original/1467415534/Journal_Of_The_American_Chemical_Society_6-6-16_Report.pdf?1467415534\n\n\nPlease also see this review, which mentions the lack of respiratory depression produced by kratom: \nThe pharmacology and toxicology of kratom: from traditional\nherb to drug of abuse, 2015, Marcus L. Warner, Nellie C. Kaufman, Oliver Grundman\n\n\nSee also this patent by Drs. McCurdy and Boyer, who have done the most research into kratom of any American researchers, where they say in [0098], section (i) Kratom use has never been associated with respiratory depression. https://www.google.com/patents/US20100209542 \n\n\nWhat proof do you have that kratom causes hallucinations? No-one in the kratom community of tens of thousands of responsible consumers of kratom have ever mentioned having hallucinations.\n\n\nWhy do the DEA and the FDA always assume that the public is full of idiots who abuse herbs? Has it ever occurred to you that the majority might be taking kratom in moderate, even tiny doses because they have learned thats what works best and avoids the side effects that only appear at very large doses? \n\n\nI am not aware of anyone in the U.S. kratom community who has experienced hyperpigmentation of the face. Can you show me some proof of this in the U.S., where there is no other likely cause? I have met kratom consumers who have been taking the herb for ten years and they look and act happy and normal.\n\n\nHow did the DEA get the idea that kratom was a threat? Your agency seems to have a very negative perspective of the many middle-class people, with a surprising number of nurses and even a few doctors, who consume kratom to support their health and well-being.\n\n\nIf youre comparing studies done from the Ramathibodi Poison Control Center in Thailand and are expecting to find that level of multidrug abuse throughout the U.S. kratommunity, you will be disappointed. That was a very sloppy study, with no blood testing done on intake to determine what these wigged out patients had been taking besides kratom. No consideration of their diet or whether they had been eating or hydrating at all (which could cause hallucinations and delusions, by themselves). Very sloppy reporting of the facts.\n\n\nIn conclusion, it would be unfair and unwise to ban or otherwise schedule an herb that is being used successfully by millions of Americans to support & promote their health and wellbeing in order to protect the small minority who will always seek out and abuse virtually any available substance. In fact, the very language the DEA uses to describe kratom, portraying it as a drug of abuse causing hallucinations, delusions, and classic symptoms of opioids, only serves to invite abuse by this minority of chronic drug abusers.\n\n\nKratom is helping many people, including myself, to enjoy a better quality of life -- without impairment -- and producing few significant problems, even among those who intentionally misuse it out of ignorance or a desire to pursue the legal high that the DEA and the media have led them to believe it offers. Why not leave kratom alone and pursue the truly dangerous substances your agency was created to defend us against?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12438","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paul H Kemp","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Now, as someone who has only been taking kratom for about 5 months i don't have much experience with it.

I am a 30-year-old disabled female and have been a kratom consumer for about 3 months. I became aware of my addiction to opiates roughly 3 years ago. Unfortunately, I didn't know of any alternatives to prescription opioids then that weren't just as addictive and detrimental, or worse. At that time I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't allow my doctors to raise my dosage or add any more opioid drugs to my regimen. \n\nBeginning at age 25, I had to undergo 9 surgeries in 3 years and was bedridden for 2.5 years. These surgeries were the result of an unrelenting disc that herniated 3 times and a gastric bypass gone wrong. For each surgery or difficult procedure, my doctor increased my pain medication or added something new to the arsenal. At its highest my dosages were 40mg of Oxycodone every 4 hours around the clock and 100mcg Fentanyl transdermal patch every 72 hours as well as an entire pharmacy of other drugs to combat the side effects of the aforementioned. I used kratom to help free me of these hard prescription drugs.\n\nI came to learn of kratom through a close friend. She had previously struggled with heroin addiction, and at the time she was in rehab, where they prescribed her a drug called Suboxone. Suboxone is a decent tool for recovering addicts, but only short term, as it is highly addictive. When my friend learned this, she turned to kratom to aide her in the violent withdrawal from Suboxone. She has since been clean from opiates for over 4 years. Seeing the way kratom helped her first hand, and reading of others success I was certain it could help me too. \n\nKratom has changed my life quite drastically in just 3 months. I am now in control of my own mind and body, instead of the drugs. Aside from its assistance in my new found freedom, kratom also helps me stay focused and motivated throughout the day, similarly to caffeine in coffee, but without the jitters and stomach cramps. Overall I have a far better sense of health and wellbeing. \n\nKratom is only one, among many natural supplements I've come to rely on, but the simple fact is I rely on ALL of them. Furthermore, I've had more positive effects with kratom than with any other single supplement (or prescription drug for that matter) on its own. Kratom is a very necessary support in my not having to take dangerous, addictive opioid pain medications. If it is scheduled and therefore banned, I will have no choice but to go back. I am allergic to many over the counter drugs, as well as many anti-inflammatory supplements. \n\nI want to go back to work. I want the option of starting, and subsequently caring for, a family. I want to function like most 30-year-old adults do, and with kratom that isn't some distant hope. It's a very probable reality. With opioids, it's not. Please, allow myself and millions of other kratom consumers LIVE. Instead of simply trying to survive. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21385","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Casey Bennem","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, \nMy name is Victor Hayes. I am a 24 year old college student living in Missouri. I started taking Kratom 2 years ago at the suggestion of a friend who saw me struggling with chronic back pain ( I have scoliosis). I also have been battling severe depression and anxiety all my life. Before I started taking Kratom I was mentally tired of being in both physical and mental pain constantly. My life has improved SO much since I started taking it. I have more energy, I am more social, I am more focused, get better grades. I could go on for hours. I would also like to point out I have never been addicted to or done drugs that were not prescribed to me. I will say though that any time I have taken prescription pain medication for my condition it always increased my anxiety and left me feeling tired and weak the next two days after. There was a time when money was tight for me that I had to stop taking Kratom for about a month. I was a little concerned because I had heard it could be habit forming but even after taking it for two years the only thing that happened was I was groggy for about a day or two and I was a little cranky( that may have been because I was so tired and still had to go to class and work.) I would compare it to the time I cut caffeine out of my diet. In no way did I feel sick or in danger after quitting. I am writing to ask you to PLEASE not to schedule this herb. I can say from PERSONAL experience this herb is not dangerous and not at all like opiates.

I hold a B.S. in physics, an M.S. in chemistry and have co-authored four peer-reviewed scientific journal articles.\n\nWhile this information may seem irrelevant, I deliberately mention my credentials because I believe the average person is uneducated about Kratom and its effects, and therefore assumes the profile of a Kratom-user to be like that of any other druggy - irresponsible, unreliable, untrustworthy, and in general a burden to society. My hope is to convince you that Kratom is a low-risk and beneficial herbal supplement which has positively affected my personal and professional life - here is why: \n\t\nI was diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder (ADD) when I was in high-school and was prescribed Adderall to treat my symptoms. The medication was helpful, but after a few years I started developing strange anxieties and abnormal habits that made it difficult to function properly. Bouts of unmanageable anxiety and depression ensued, which turned me into an entirely different person. If there was any time I was a druggy, that was it, while I was taking my medication as prescribed by my doctor. It got to the point that I had to take a term off of college so I could stop taking my medication, acclimate to life without it, and transfer to another university to make a fresh start. \n\nIt is difficult to be in the sciences with ADD; I work with very intelligent people and I feel frustrated and inadequate every day because my brain does not work the same as theirs. But, when I take Kratom, this frustration becomes much less of a barrier for me. I am able to focus quickly and retain that focus despite the normal disturbances of my shared work environment. For comparison - without medication it takes me 10-20 minutes to switch between tasks and my thoughts are repeatedly fragmented by the relentless distractions of a busy room that the normal mind would not even consider. \n\nTo achieve a similar level of sustained focus, I would have to take an amount of Adderall that causes unbearable side effects. To name just a few: extreme social anxiety, inability to communicate effectively, and tension headaches stemming from subconscious jaw clenching. Kratom allows me to live a healthy and normal life while simultaneously meeting my career goals; it has improved my quality of life dramatically. \n\nPlease dont make a felon out of me, and please dont force me back onto my prescription medication that turns me into someone I dislike - a druggy. My story is just one among many that demonstrate that the action you intend to take by scheduling Kratom is one that will cause more suffering that it will prevent. \n\nI hope you will consider stories like mine when you make your decision.\n\nThank you for your time,\nJenna","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21631","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jenna Wardini","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a mother of three, happily married to my childhood sweetheart of 30 years, living in the same community for 35 years, and working two professional positions; one as a Realtor and one at UC Davis in Health Sciences. I am also very active in my community and in humanitarian efforts. I began taking Kratom about a year ago. I have arthritis, former injuries, and am going through menopause. My doctors gave me Norco for a year or so to help with the pain. I took less than what was prescribed to avoid dependency on drugs. When the DEA moved forward on the strict guidelines for the Norco, I stopped taking it because my income and schedule do not afford me to go every month to the doctor. I was also concerned about the side effects of the Norco. After suffering, I looked for an alternative. I cherish homeopathic medicine and natural ingredients over chemical products of any kind. In addition to taking regular care of myself, I would take two Kratom in the morning to help ease the pain and stiffness. It works wonders for me. It doesn't make me feel high and I do not have any side effects. I have been taking the same amount as needed without increases or irresponsibility. It has been a God send for me and helps me to take care of my family and loved ones. Since it helped me so much, I gave some to my mom to try for her arthritis, diabetes, and depression. It helped her to get out of bed and be able to move. I gave some to my dear friend who has suffered from depression and it helped her to feel much better, when nothing else helped. I think it is great that Kratom helps addicts to recover and helps people to have alternative forms of medicine and therapy that are non-addictive. Now I find that the DEA is swiftly banning Kratom. I am hoping that there will be a stop to the ban. I have no problem with Kratom being researched and regulated as most things should be. It is an all-natural plant derivative that helps folks naturally like Chamomile, Lavender, Willow Bark, and Valerian do, among so many natural products. Taking away Kratom would leave me feeling like I have no choice over my own body and well-being; to make my own informed decisions for my own welfare. I see a world that is hooked on everything from food, sex, alcohol, tv, drugs, and everything in between. Too much of anything is not a good thing. Just like most things in life, we must look at the individual, not a collective. An addict is an addict, no matter what they are addicted to. We do not ban things like sex, sugar, salt, and alcohol that have proven to cause problems if taken in excess and handled irresponsibly. I pray for our government and authorities all the time, even when I do not agree with them. But banning Kratom would intensify the idea that is in our country that big pharma and their big dollars matter more than people and their well-being, their needs, their wants, and their choice. Kratom is a derivative of the coffee tree that has been around for centuries. I can imagine that some have taken it irresponsibly, but for those I know and I, we take it to greatly improve our quality of life. Please listen to the people and how we have shared our hearts and lives with you in efforts to stop the ban. It takes courage to do that. If the ban on Kratom goes through, I will live; but it would be more painful.

At 38 I was diagnosed with Stage IV Melanoma, after multiple experimental treatments and 18 surgeries I reached my goal of being clean of my Cancer.  It seemed at the time as it does now the life long chronic pain would be a small price to pay For keeping my leg (primary) And my life. \nBy the time I reached 47 the pain was passed the Tylenols and into percocets. Fast forward over 20 yrs later of off/on pain medications have taken so much from me.  So many foggy memories, incredible embarrrasment too many times to mention at pharmacies, insulting moments at new doctors (as I had moved for a period of time ) as they judged me, fear of the toll the continual doses of opium based medications were having on me.  It's indescribable the constant brain fog you fight to stay in the moment to be a good mom, teacher, wife, friend, human. Last yr. I went searching  for something different.  After 2 months of researching I decided to try Kratom.  My daughter, a Harvard graduate in Psycology, helped guide me to do some real research, not just watch a couple you tube videos.  I saw that a couple deaths had been attributed to Kratom.  However, it was also clear there were no deaths attributed to Kratom Alone.  The other chemicals in those  who past all were dangerous drugs and certainly could/do cause death on their own.   Another concern was dependency.  Yes , my research lent the potential for dependency. Here is where I really appreciated having a research /Psycology geek for a daughter.  Turns out there is just tons of scientific research on this topic.The likelyhood of anyone doing the same behavior over a period of 14-18 days can and oft times does cause at least psycological dependence. At this point we considered behaviors such as exercise, running, lifting weights,  drinking coffee, chewing gum, stopping for that beer on the way home, pouring that glass of wine while making dinner, lighting that cigarette after a meal,even taking vitamins.  Yes there are thousands of productive good citizens, perhaps even you, who if we were to hold their behaviors to the definition of dependency , well they surely would be in the Dependent group.  Now, I realize there is a serious difference between physical and mental dependencies.  I've experienced both stopping my medicines over theses many years.  I know the nausea, the leg cramps, the diarrhea, sweets, insomnia of stopping opiate based medicines.  I've cried through the psycological hell of telling myself I'll be better off not taking my pain medicine. Yes, I understand withdrawl.  I've walked through them more than once!I've also witnessed first hand my mom stopping her daily coffe my friend stopping running daily because of her health, my cousin stopping her daily chocolate bars, even my husband stopping cigarettes - what I saw from all of them was irritability, anxiousness, impatience moments, some lack of social graces. They were Dependent and all displayed psycological dependency withdrawls, BUT None of them doubled down with cramps, none, rolled in a ball in bed an begged for it to be over, none of them needed medication to numb their withdrawls, and after 5-7 days ALL OF them found themselves happy and finished mourning that which they had used daily for years. No one is rushing to the hospital with coffee withdrawls. \nThe research we have today tells us Kratom is a plant that is no more dependent than my mom's coffee or husbands cigarettes.  So I bought the Kratom from a researched vendor, no extracts, no added anything just Kratom.  The first day I took Kratom instead of my pain medicine, then went about my day.  We were shocked at how normal I felt, how well it managed my pain. I seriously thought it was like a placebo effect, since I so wanted it to work.  But for the past year I've found Kratom to be nothing short of a blessing to my life.  I still take my Dr prescribed pain medicine, but I've cut that back more than have.  My days are so clear, most of the day time is Without brain fog.  I also don't crave to grab my script bottle, let's be honest after all these years of my medicine I certainly am dependent on those medicines.  It's impowering to have this chance to add a supplement into my life that brings so much positivity.  My adult children comment on how happier and in the moment I seem.  I'm trying to take even less of my pain medicines, relying more on the positve effects of Kratom.  Now, unlike in the past, I actually believe I will see the day this coming year that I just keep my pain medicines for once or twice a month for the very worst of days I know Kratom can supplement me enough to have real quality of life.  \nI respect authority and the need for oversite.  Please respect Kratom users as citizens who are not trying to be high, who want more for our lives and our families.  Let us use this plant the Lord has given us instead of the chemicals man has made. \n\nRespectfully,\nAmerican Citizen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16585","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped my boyfriend tremendously.

I have not used Kratom, but from what I understand there are several important facts regarding the substance. First, it is a naturally occurring plant. Second, it seems to be far safer than both other schedule 1 drugs and other legal substances (e.g., alcohol and tobacco). Third and perhaps most important, there is some evidence that it is helpful for people trying to overcome opiate addiction. The pharmaceutical industry and government regulating bodies are partly responsible for this epidemic. This makes it particularly egregious that they are considering a course of action which would limit individual freedom (something we value in this country) and prevent people who are struggling with addiction from helping themselves out of the hole they are in. We have already seen that those in charge of narcotics scheduling are unwilling to deal honestly with the American people, sidelining an initiative to remove marijuana from the schedule 1 list. This should have been an incredibly easy decision as marijuana meets almost none of the criteria put forward for schedule 1 status and no informed individual can honestly say it belongs on the list. And now the DEA is considering an overly aggressive action to add Kratom to this list without offering sufficient justification. This is utterly tone-deaf and would be a step in the wrong direction for drug regulation in this country.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12733","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ben Perrodin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"hello , i feel it is important to let the public use this plant instead of the harmfull alternatives , i have been using kratom for three years now and it is the absolute best thing ive ever used in for social phobia! i wake up, i start my day like everyone else, i make a kratom drink, it gets me through the day without as much social anxiety that im usually burdened with.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22780","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kim Doxey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do more research on this supplement before deciding to ban it.

This causes debilitating muscle and nerve pain as well as fatigue and depression. I started taking kratom as a supplement to my standard medications. It has offered me great relief. I have had zero episodes of pain or spasms and I have not had one single day of being unable to get out of bed. Prior to supplimenting with kratom, those episode were constant. The episodes caused me great pain and depression, hurting both myself and my family. I had originally tried an opiate regimen. This made me horribly sick. I was tired and out of it. I could not function day to day on the doses that I was required to take. When I stopped this regimen I suffered a prolonged withdrawal and decided to not use those medications again. Instead, I turned to the supplemention of kratom into my diet. The benefits have been profound. I have suffered no episodes from my neuromyotonia and I have also felt none of the effects that the opiate regimen cause me to feel. For this past year, I have felt like \"me\" again. It has been a blessing. \n\nI understand that this suppliment must be weighed in relation to its benefits and it possible dangers. I can only tell of my personal experience with kratom that I have only felt benefits. It does not make me feel tired or out of it. It does not make me nauseous or dizzy. It has never caused me any discomfort if I have had to stop taking it or if I missed a day of supplimentation. I have never felt \"high\" or suck from this suppliment. I am sad and fearful of this natural, safe, and effective suppliment being taken away from me and from others like myself due to misinformation and tying this suppliment in with the synthetic chemicals that actually pose a real danger. This should not in any way be lumped into that category.\n\nI am not afraid of having to stop taking this suppliment. I am afraid of my neuromyotonia and its devistating effects and me and my family. The bottom line is that this suppliment helps and it causes none of the negative side effects that medications have caused me. It is natural, safe, and no more harmful than a cup of tea. I was devistated when I realized that it could arbitrarily be taken away without reason or consequence. Then my faith was restored when the ban was lifted and the dea started to take reasonable measures to hear our voices. I appriciate that. I hope the dea continues to hear us and I'm confident that kratom will be shown to be both safe and effective. Please do not ban this suppliment. You would be sending me back into the suffering of my neuromyotonia, a disease which not only effects me, but my entire family. Thank you fir hearing my voice!\n\nSincerely,\n\nRyan Cutter","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12728","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Cutter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Joseph Bishko, I am 39 years old, and from Asheville NC. I am a Social Worker and help support people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities  and their families obtain necessary State funded and Medicaid funded services that they need to live the best quality of life possible and to support inclusion into their community. I am a strong advocate for the I/DD community and have been since 1998.  I now find myself advocating for myself as well as other responsible people throughtout America who take an herbal supplement to ensure they have a good quality of life. These are other responsible people like me, who may have anxiety, pain, depression, PTSD, that have decided to utilize a more organic and natural way of life instead of taking pharmaceutical drugs. I would like to \nvoice my concern about The DEA's decision to ban and put Kratom on Schedule 1 substance list without an educated understanding of what Kratom is. To ban Kratom and label it closely related to an opiate is dangerous. Kratom is related to coffee, is a plant, is natural and not man made in some big pharma lab, and has been used for thousands of years. By banning Kratom,  a regulated dietary ingredient, will stop important scientific research. A ban will also decrease the quality of life for so many people. \nI began using Kratom to manage my back pain in 2013.  I learned about Kratom from a friend who studied Pharmacology and decided to turn her attention to Herbal Pharmacology after identifying better results from using natural and homeopathic remedies not synthetic drugs made in laboratories.  She has increased the quality of life for so many people with diagnoses that include diabetes, MS, PTSD and chronic pain. I am one of them.\nI was always active as a dancer, in gymnastics and some sports. I had an injury in college, late 90s, to my lower back. I have gone through physical therapy, regular chiropractic appointments along with massage and it has been determined I will eventually need back surgery. I have been prescribed multiple painkillers since the late 90s that have included oxycodone and hydrocodone. The side effects of these drugs, and at times reliance, caused many side effects that have included depression. With depression came another plethora of drugs.  I was prescribed antidepressants including Zoloft, Paxil, Wellbutrin and Prozac. With antidepressants came so many side effects and the only one that had the least was Prozac. However, in 2004 I attempted suicide as a side effect from Prozac.  With the increase in prescription opioid abuse and side effects I searched for another alternative and turned to my friend for support, assistance and natural plan of care.  I use a variety of natural products and herbal supplements that include turmeric, willow bark, essential oils, cod oil and Kratom.  I no longer take any prescription painkillers, antidepressants or even over the counter medications; Tylenol. I am now more active, work out 4 to 5 times a week and feel surgery is far down the road!   My quality of life has increased by the use of Kratom.  As of October 1st I was very concerned I would be a felon, along with many other responsible people, without providing any input on how Kratom has provided me a better quality of life without the use of opioids or other medications.\nTo attempt to label Kratom as a controlled substance, schedule 1, an opiod or synthetic is  not responsible. I do no buy my Kratom at a head shop or a gas station but from a safe and reliable herbal supplement vendor. Kratom is a safe and natural alternative to all opiod medications and not in any way as dangerous as what is listed for scheduled 1 controlled substance. People overdose on heroin and legal substances including alcohol and prescription painkillers.  With the opioid epidemic currently happening all around this country it is harmful to take away a plant that people are choosing to use instead of opioids.  This ban will be turning  people who drink tea into criminals. The DEA's attention  and Federal money would be better spent on more facilities and more/better access to Mental Health and Substance Use treatment.  The number of people needing substance use and mental health treatment will only increase and I hope the funds will be there to support all of us as this will fall on the state of NC to provide.  I have worked in the MH/SU and I/DD field for close to 15 years now and see the small amount of of money and support currently being provided so I also can see this from a different angle. Please, reconsider an outright ban of a natural plant that continues to help so many people to live a great quality of life free of potentially dangerous prescription drugs.  As a responsible person in a noble profession I'll continue to choose a more natural way to live the best quality of life. \n\nSincerely, \nJoseph Bishko","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1025","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Bishko","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for opening this up for comments.

I am well-acquainted with the dangers of illegal drug use. I have never used an opioid illegally and have no dependence- my only narcotic use has been post-surgery.\n\nIn 2014, I picked up mono. About 9 months later, I was diagnosed with Chronic Myalgic Encephalitis. This condition has severely altered the course of my life. I was unable to work full-time for over two years. My physical health suffered tremendously, and I now deal with anxiety and emotional issues that I could not have imaged before.\n\nI have worked with upwards of a dozen healthcare providers- I have seen anti-immune, infectious disease, and psychiatric specialists. The pharmaceutical industry doesn't offer a cure or effective treatment. The drugs that do offer minor relief have significant side-effects and come at great financial cost. \n\nI have made significant lifestyle changes: I have recently moved out to Utah and taken a lower-stress job in the hopes that I may begin rebuilding a life for myself. But nothing has been more effective in helping me to work and maintain relationships with family and a handful of friends than Kratom. \n\nI don't take Kratom every day- in fact, I try and take it as infrequently as possible. But I can't hold a job if I'm constantly too worn out to work. I won't be able to maintain relationships or my emotional health if I am constantly worried that spending time with others will jeopardize my ability to hold a job.\n\nI have never experience any significant side effects from the use of Kratom. I get my blood and liver tested regularly and have seen no sign for concern.\n\nI would not be opposed to greater regulation of this supplement, and I certainly support greater study. I have no wish to see anyone harmed by misuse of what is clearly an effective substance. While I am not prone to conspiracy theories, the fashion in which the kratom ban was proposed by the DEA sparks of pharmaceutical industry intervention. We allow alcohol and nicotine in grocery stores, and a number of states now allow for recreational consumption of marijuana, but the DEA has proposed forbidding the single substance that has ever effectively helped me mitigate my illness.\n\nI implore the DEA to reconsider this ban, allow for study of Kratom's usefulness and potential harm, and I encourage the FDA to regulate the supplement to help ensure its purity and safety.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22877","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Ptak","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a public health professional.

I am a 61 year old chemist.  My wife is Karen bacon, a 58 year old housewife. \n\nWe have both used Kratom, on and off, for about 5 years.  \n\nI suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  This entails severe body aches, mental fog, and crushing fatigue.  For me, Kratom provides pain relief with a gentle stimulation.  Pain relief has been superior to other supplements, and even some prescription medications.  It also provides a slight mood elevation. it does not make me feel high.  Quite the opposite. It gives me a clarity of thought.  Some days, Kratom is the difference between a productive day, rather than a day in bed.\n\nMy wife has scoliosis and arthritis.  She finds that Kratom provides superior pain relief and made it easier to ween off the heavy narcotics given after surgery.\n\nThere are few options for those of us in pain beyond NSAIDS.  Kratom is an herbal supplement with a unique profile (at least in my observations):pain relief without sedation or loss of clarity.  \n\nWe have seen no indication of habituation.  Stopping use after a period of daily use causes no discomfort.  I find no \"urge\" to use Kratom, no desire to increase dose.  In fact, higher doses are unpleasant, inducing nausea.  \n\nKratom has been a \"life saver\" for my wife and I.  Given it's characteristics, it provides unique relief for our symptoms, unmatched by other supplements or even prescription medicines.\n\nThe safety profile (from my observations) is far superior to dangerous narcotics.  There is no addiction or craving,  accidental \"overdoses\" are impossible and there is no recreational use.\n\nGiven the recent concern about opoids, I would think that the DEA would look closely at this herbal supplement.  For many, it provides pain relief without opoids without the danger of addiction or overdoses.  I also understand that Kratom helps folks get off of narcotics.\n\nPlease keep this supplement legal.  Depriving people of Kratom will surely cause some to turn (or turn back to) narcotics.  A rational look at the trade-offs will show that Kratom is not a drug problem, it is a solution to a \"drug\" problem.\n\nThere is also a scientific reason that Kratom (or it's constituents) should not be Schedule 1.

But my father Bob Pedlow who has had multiple surgeries (back, knee) and walked miles every day as a USPS worker did have these problems. I am writing this because any natural substance that could potentially be a substitute for OPIOIDS deserves the opportunity to be properly studied and given the chance to help people. \n\n    2.5 years ago my Dad was out shopping with my Mom on his day off when suddenly his heart stopped. Earlier on this day I was running late for work and ran out of the house right by my Dad without even saying anything, that was the last time I saw him alive. The next time I saw him was naked on an operation table in the ER with dozens of tubes connected to him and dozens of doctors running all around him. He had accidentally overdosed on his doctor prescribed drugs/painkillers/OPIOIDS, whatever you want to call them. My dad was kept alive by machines for 2 days until we decided to let him go and donate his organs to Living Legacy. \n\n    From what I understand natural substances like Kratom could be a great and much safer alternative to OPIOIDS. If my Dad had the opportunity to take Kratom instead of addictive painkillers I would be able to see him stuff his face this Thanksgiving instead of looking at an empty chair.\n\n    Not sure if this comment will make any difference but I'm glad we are given the chance to voice our opinion.\n\n        KYLE\n\n     ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6730","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyle Pedlow","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am an employed 34 year old male. I suffer from bipolar disorder, anxiety, insomnia, restless leg syndrome and social anxiety. Kratom has changed my life so much after many years of suffering with mood swings and feelings of rage, sadness and anger. I was not able to feel control of those emotions in the past, even after many years of trying different prescription medications. Those medications caused weight gain, sleepiness and other issues. It has helped my depression a ton but also let me just be myself, finally! I am finally able to enjoy things in my life, my hobbies, my family, and my work. Kratom has helped my social-anxiety so much, if it wasn't for kratom I wouldn't leave my house to grocery shop or just be with my family, much less, be able to work a normal full-time job. Before I found kratom, I was unable to sleep more than a few hours per night. I used to have to depend on benzodiazepines, which alone, caused me great worry as they are very addictive and very difficult to stop taking when used often due to horrific side effects, however, it was necessary so that I could sleep at night to handle my daily responsibilities.   I feel that because kratom is a natural plant, in the coffee family, is very mild, non-addictive, and it is not an opiate or benzodiazepine, it is my safest option.  I would like to thank you for your time, I believe that kratom should stay unscheduled for people over 18 to use for their needs.\n\nSincerely,\nChad Woods","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9390","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chad Woods","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Good Evening,\n\nMy name is Eric Bonilla. I wanted to add my experience with Kratom during the official comment period for your consideration.  Over the past several years I've been using Kratom as a way to naturally deal with anxiety which has greatly improved my quality of life.  I work in hospitality, therefore a large part of what I do is interact with guests.  I was suffering panic attacks with some regularity which is now under control in a natural way removing the need for very strong prescription medicine. \n\nI also happen to live in South Florida which was ground zero for the pill epidemic in the last decade.  As of late like much of the country there has been an enormous increase of heroin use in our area which has lead to many broken families and deaths. Heroin was never really prevelant here, sadly I've lost two friends this summer.  I can't help but think their lives may have been saved if they were able to transition to this plant as many addicts have.  South Florida is also home to the greatest concentration of drug treatment centers in the country. We have a large amount of addicts from all over the U.S. and Kratom is fairly well known here being served in local kava shops. Access to this plant actively reaches addicts in our community and it has had a positive impact on many lives.\n\nI respectfully ask that you do not restrict this plant with a Schedule I designation.  Many in the Kratom community including myself understand the need for increased oversight be it age restrictions or purity standards and believe we can reach a sensible compromise that will allow those who need this plant access to it.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEric Bonilla","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20109","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Bonilla","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It's a plant.....

There is no sense in making this plant illegal in light of how we as a country are starting to realize the amazing medicinal uses for cannabis, and compared to the overwhelming acceptance for more harmful substances like tobacco or alcohol. As a nation we need to stop demonizing substances and instead work toward treating the negative conditions that lead to addiction. The people of our communities are hurting, and the options for safe, legal, effective, and above all else affordable options for treating ourselves, are dwindling. Our government is to blame.

I learned of this more natural remedy from a friend who had multiple knee surgeries and found himself quickly dependent upon the pain pills prescribed by his doctor. Due to his unwillingness to continue that prescribed course of medication which made him dependent upon those substances within just a few short weeks, my friend sought a more homeopathic remedy for his extreme pain while recovering from said surgeries. \n\nI, too, had noticed a very swift craving had once developed from being prescribed Vicodin for oral surgery, and understood my friend's desire to find something to mitigate the pain without causing his brain to persistently seek soothing for the opiate cravings. The epidemic of opiate addiction and the ever-growing use of heroin as a cheap alternative to the prescribed pills which hook many people in the first place is a social condition that deserves intense scrutiny. I urge the DEA and FDA to consider the ramifications of NOT providing alternatives to these medications. The detriment to our society from the OUTRAGEOUS prescribing and overuse of opiate-based medications is of far greater concern than allowing herbal remedies to be available to those who suffer pain but do not wish to suffer the side effects of the currently regulated pain remedies. \n\nIt is astounding that the DEA continues to classify marijuana as Schedule I narcotic, effectively ignoring the  abundant scientific research which demonstrates the effectiveness of cannabinoids for many medically relevant purposes. Accordingly, it would be an abject failure to society to also list kratom -- a natural painkiller used for centuries in Eastern medicine -- to fall under this classification. The DEA would essentially force the American population to be at the mercy of pharmaceutical companies who have clearly demonstrated their interest in profit margin over public health. \n\nThank you for allowing the matter to be discussed rather than implementing a knee-jerk reaction at the behest of the companies who aggressively lobby on behalf of their profits.

It is in NO WAY like any drug. You don't \"feel\" anything, you just feel better. I have been hooked on prescription pain meds for 7 yrs, the withdrawals coming off the pills is worse than the original pain that I'm taking the pills for. Kratom has stopped me from withdrawing completely. It doesn't take my pain away completely but it makes it tolerable. People are taking Kratom to get off illegal drugs and prescription drugs. Please don't take this from them. Especially the people who have quit illegal drugs because of Kratom, don't make them have to go back to drugs. My boyfriend who doesn't take more than an 800mg Ibuprofen took Kraton once because he had pulled a muscle at work. He said the pain was gone by about 75% and I asked him if he \"felt\" anything? He said he felt nothing, it was like he didn't take anything, he could only tell the pain got worse. He is against me even taking my prescription pills and he said he had no problem with me taking Kratom, he said it was nothing like pills or drugs to him. If he can say that I KNOW no one can \"feel\" it like a drug. Please do more research before you ban it, give it a chance, it is NOT a drug. I am against legalizing Marijuana, I don't condone drug use, this is no where near being a drug. If you think Marijuana is ok, then there should be no issues with Kratom, they are no where near in the same category of any drugs, it is safer than pills. Please do the research. Put off the ban for at least a yr while you research it. I think someone who is in charge of the ban should take some Kratom themselves and see for themselves that they won't \"feel\" anything, that it's NOT a drug. I've heard some people say it's similar to a cup of coffee, I personally think coffee is stronger. I think Ginseng & Ginkgo Biloba are worse for you, I had a reaction to taking some energy pills that had Ginseng & Ginkgo Biloba in them and an allergy pill and I think I might have had a mini seizure, I prayed myself to sleep, I think I should have called 911. Kratom is not addictive and you don't withdrawal from it. Please do the research and find out for yourselves. Thank you for your time.\nIvy M.

It is sheer lunacy for an agency tasked with combating dangerous drugs to consider banning kratom-- doing so eliminates one of the safest, cheapest, and readily available treatment options in the US, and would only serve to exacerbate the dangers of real drugs of abuse.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9328","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I used kratom for awhile when my lupus was bad to help with inflammation, pain and energy.

My severe migraines and headaches can at times cripple me and keep me confined in bed for up to 17 hours. Every single minute is torturous. In the past, doctors have tried me on anti anxiety medications and anti seizure medications as prevention. Every prescribed medicine I was put on had terrible side effects like weight gain or loss, anxiety, cystic acne, memory loss, shakes, lightheaded effects, difficulty sleeping, night terrors and so on. I'm a married mother of 2 teenagers and I simply could not function to the best of my ability, for my family, on those drugs. When I first did my research by reading online how other people dosed on very small amounts to get the pain relieving effects on Kratom, I took note and placed my order. The next time I started to get a migraine and took the all natural Kratom, I was so surprised that I hung my head and cried in relief. It worked! I haven't had to miss a single day of my daughters lives, lying in bed with a migraine, whilst I've been using Kratom. My entire quality of life has improved. I've been able to go to the gym daily, enjoy going to my kids activities, jog with my dogs in the park, help my daughters with homework and make dinner (not just order takeout on headache days) every single night. To take this miracle herb away from people would have tremendous negative effects on their lives- mine included. I don't want to go back to that pain. I want to wake up and know that headaches and migraines aren't going to keep me shut in and away from my kids on any day. I look forward to every minute of my life now, instead of dreading \"headache triggers\" and being held back. \nI've watched my kids grades go up, their happiness grow- and I know it's because they don't have to plan their lives around their mothers pain. To take this herb away and classify it the same as heroine or prescription pain medication would be horrible for my life. I don't want to go back to that constant state of worry of when the pain might hit and take me out of service. \nOn another note, when I was seeing doctors to get prescriptions for medications that left me worse off, I was paying about $50 a month. Now, I'm paying about $20 a month for a small bag of Kratom that comes with zero side effects. Can you put yourself in that mindset for a moment and see the damage it will do to take that from me and others? To force us back on chemical filled prescription drugs that harm us more than it helps? Knowing that there is an all natural plant that could prevent it all? Please don't do that to us. We could be your spouses, parents, siblings or children. What would you want for them?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0927","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"kratom is a miracle herb that has saved my life, i was in a terrible accident and doctors gave me so many pills i became addicted and it ruined my life, i had a house, family and a good job but after being on pills i stopped caring about life, kratom helped me get off of these terrible pain meds and if u make it illegal i have no choice but to go back to a doctor i cant afford and get on pills that will make me hate life again, if u make it illegal you will force so many addicts to go back to heroin and the deaths will be on your hands, the only reason to make it illegal would be to benefit the industry thats making these terrible drugs and we all know it, do whats right, quit listening to the people who know nothing about this herb and talk to the peole who are using it to make their lives livable, i cannot even walk without pain relief it provides, if u take away my medicine i might as well be dead because the pills ill have no choice but to go back to made life worse than death, please do whats right","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14878","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"D M","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\"Hello my name is Dakota.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

I am a 24 year old female army veteran, single mom, full time student, and full time employee. I went to Afghanistan in 2012 and endured many tradgedies for my country's right to freedom, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The ugly part of deployment followed me back home. The sound of a door clicking to open even startles me because it sounds like a round getting loaded into the chamber of a weapon. I have since been diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety disorder. The military put my on a number of drugs, even Xanax while I was pregnant with my child!!! I didn't want to have a child that had any kind of bad side effects of me taking the medication so God willing I made it through my pregnancy. After my son was born his father left us and my anxiety got ten times worse. I was an active duty soldier, with a newborn, paying the bills without any child support on top of trying to balance a severe mental disorder PTSD. A friend told me about kratom and the rest his history. I put down the bottle of Xanax, the bottle of ambien, the bottle of citalopram, and the bottle of buspar. And now just take a capsule of kratom once in the morning and once before bed. My PTSD is almost gone and my panic attacks are manageable. I have since gotten out of the military and am using my GI bill and going to school full time while also keeping a full time job so my son lives a fulfilled life. I have never been a drug addict and have never gotten addicted to kratom. kratom has just given me hope that I can live in a world where I'm not haunted by my PTSD. Please don't take this away from me and every other American fighting through the same struggles.\nSincerely, Kristian.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12168","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"K M","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi DEA,\n\nListened to the Joe Rogan Podcast with Chris Bell.

I was mostly confined to my couch. I tried every doctor's advice: medicine, exercise, classes, acupuncture, supplements and chiropractic care. They tried to get me to use barbiturates and I refused. Four years ago a friend told me about Kratom and my life changed. I am still in pain and still fatigued, but I can play 9 holes of golf and exercise. The pain is much more tolerable. \n\nKratom is a safe natural supplement. You CANNOT get high on it. You CANNOT OD on it; to much makes you nauseated. You can use it while you are on antidepressants without harm. I've gone off of Kratom before surgery and had minimal side effects mostly I just fatigued fast and had more pain again. \n\nPlease don't send me back to my couch. Don't takeaway my quality of life and millions of others like me. Don't make me a criminal; it helps people get off bad drugs not get addicted.  Compare the true statistics with those of schedule 1 drugs and listen to those who know what life is like without Kratom. Imagine what life is like when there is no HOPE to feel better except legal bad drugs. Then, do the right thing.

I was 26 years old. \nOn June 1, 2013, Kyle Mason, my friend of 14 years, overdosed on heroin and died. He was 30 years old.\nOn November 17, 2016, Lisa Smith, my aunt, overdosed on heroin and died. She was 46 years old.\nI wrote those dates here to show that I have had personal experience with drug abuse and its consequences, and that the opiate epidemic in our country has affected my life in irreparable ways. \n\n\nI've suffered from severe depression my entire life, and had multiple suicide attempts, beginning at the age of 10 and the last at the age of 27. Then last year, I was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III, Raynaud's phenomenon, early-onset osteoarthritis, and degenerative disc disease. Now, at 32 years old, I suffer from pinched nerves in both my neck and lower back, muscle spasms, fatigue, and anxiety as a result of my chronic, incurable illness. I've been told that I would have a better prognosis if I had Lupus, as the only course of action for my doctors is to treat my symptoms as they emerge.\n\nBefore kratom, I felt hopeless. I missed work, and couldn't sleep for more than an hour at a time, because of my pain level. I wasn't showering, wasn't eating, and wasn't maintaining interpersonal relationships. I was terrified of losing my job, of being physically unable to continue to work, and of what my future would be, living in constant pain. I was terrified of not being able to take care of myself. I was more depressed and suicidal than I've ever been before, and that scared me more than anything else. I was being prescribed pain killers, but as someone with a history of opiate drug abuse, I knew that I would either begin to use more and more of the pain killers, or go through terrible withdrawal symptoms in order to stop. I just wanted to be able to do normal everyday activities, keep a job, have friends, take care of myself - all the things my chronic pain and illness had taken away from me - without being dependent on a doctor or a pill just to function like any other person. The worst part was how often I found myself thinking about doing heroin again, and how much easier it would have been for me to get heroin off the street than it was to get anything to help from my doctor.\n\nThen I found kratom, and it helped me stop using the prescription pain pills and get my life back.\n\nI started using kratom 3 months ago. I'm still under a doctor's care, and have radio-frequency ablation done on my neck every few months, but kratom has been the only thing I take for my muscle spasms and pain. I've found that it also alleviates my anxiety and fatigue, and has helped me do the simplest things like clean my apartment, go to the grocery store, or take a shower. I haven't missed a single day of work since I started taking kratom, and I'm working on strengthening relationships with the loved ones in my life. It doesn't affect my thinking or my moods the way prescription pain pills did, and I haven't experienced any type of withdrawal symptoms when I've stopped its use. It's not a cure-all, and I still experience some pain on a daily basis, but kratom makes enough of a difference that I haven't felt any desire for anything more potent. With kratom in my life, I feel more capable than I have in a very long time. I'm no longer afraid or anxious about my future well-being.\n\nKratom has been a literal life saver for me, as I know it has been for many others, and could have been for so many more.

It is a plant with extremely high medicinal potential and to recognize it as anything else is, as far as Im concerned, a crime against nature and a forfeiture for modern medicine. I am writing this as a brief testimonial of my own personal experience with the plant known and sold as Kratom.\n\nI have experienced widespread chronic pain for years. I was at first taking OTC medications to manage the pain but quickly realized that I am very sensitive to NSAIDs and even a small amount can make me sick. My doctor also tried tramadol on me and I did not like the way it seemed to slow my mental capacity and seemed to interact with my anti-depressant when I started taking it. I was working a manual labor job and ultimately I ended up having to quit because the side effects of the pills I was on and unmanaged pain became too much for me. \n\nI began researching and I discovered this Asian herb on the internet. I made the traditional tea with the leaves of a Kratom tree and, after drinking an amount recommended to me, for the first time in a very long time I was not in considerable pain. Better than that I didnt notice any side effects other than a little bit of drowsiness.\n\nSince then, for nearly 3 years now, I have been taking Kratom responsibly as I would a medication my doctor has prescribed me. I have noticed it can cause indigestion and upset stomach if not taken with food but I do not consider it a serious side effect as almost any medicine I have ever tried has some mild digestive side effect. Since I had begun taking Kratom for pain management my social life has dramatically improved. Im not afraid to go out anymore in the otherwise very likely chance that I would be in pain and not be fun to be around. I can go out and have fun much more often. I can exercise without relatively superficial discomfort holding me back and, most importantly to me, I can hike again. I can go to the store again and be able to trust myself to be able to get and carry the entire shopping list from the isle to my shopping cart to my car and to my house. I no longer feel exhausted and strained all the time due to my chronic illness. I admit that I do still have my bad days, as most people do, but they are few and far between. I have held a successful white collar job for nearly 3 years now as well. I am almost certain I would have been forced to quit due to absences if I had been working all this time with unmanaged pain or the sickening side effects of the common pain relievers I was once on.\n\nI do NOT mean to make any claims that cannot be backed up by science nor do I ask you to leave this substance unregulated. I ask you to do the job assigned to you by the federal government and the duty to the American people you have been named responsible for and allow proper medical research to be done on this substance.\n\nI simply ask you to hold solid clinical trials and review the data gathered in a scientific setting before you reach a final decision.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19544","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sara Thompson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern,\n\nMy name is Matthew Polk and I am writing this comment in support of the botanical substance known as Kratom (mitragyna speciosa) and to voice my opposition to any attempts to ban or make this plant unavailable to US citizens.\n\nI am a public school teacher in Florida, and I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder in 2014.  I have taken several prescribed medications recommended by my specialists since my diagnosis and have had some success with only one of these medications.  I refused from the very beginning to take benzodiazepines because of the negative side effects of the drug, but I am currently on an SSRI.\n\nI am divulging this information because my support for the kratom plant stems from my experience managing my current condition.  I have been using the kratom plant as a supplementary substance in conjunction with my prescribed medication for more than a year now, and it has helped me tremendously in combating the negative effects of my diagnosed condition.\n\nI am in no way making the statement that kratom (mitragyna speciosa) is medication, as I do not have a medical degree and cannot make recommendations as to how to combat medical conditions.  However, I am stating my anecdotal experiences with the plant so that the governmental agencies that have regularity power over it's availability will reconsider how they plan to regulate the plant.\n\nThe plant affects me in several ways.  Firstly, it has painkilling, or analgesic, effects that are mild but effective.  Second, the plant does create a feeling of well-being and euphoria that is nice, gentle, and uplifting.  Thirdly, the plant helps the anxious loops that my brain sometimes gets into (as a result of my GAD) and calms them so that I am able to function to the best of my ability in situations that would normally cause a high level of discomfort.\n\nIn the absence of the plant, I find that I have small, inconsequential withdrawal effects that I would describe as being less severe than those of caffeine (which is a widely available and consumed substance in the US).  Nothing about this plant, in my anecdotal opinion, warrants the extreme measures, including banning and scheduling as a schedule 1 controlled substance, that governmental agencies have signaled they wish to pursue.  Not only that, but there is quite a bit of science behind the plant that backs up my anecdotal claims that the plant is useful and relatively harmless (from well-respected, peer-reviewed journals and institutions).\n\nI am of the opinion that kratom should not be banned, nor should it be regulated to a position where it requires doctor approval to purchase and use.  My anecdotal experience with this botanical substance is that it has useful qualities that could be beneficial for consumers, and provides a safe, effective supplement that consumers should have access to if they so choose.  I support regulation that requires the kratom industry to regulate how the substance is packaged, how it is produced, and how it is marketed and sold just as other substances like alcohol, to an extent in some areas, marijuana, and other botanical substances that are regulated and sold all across the United States.  We should focus on education and scientific research, not simply banning the substance, and most certainly not making US citizens criminals for possession (which, as we have seen over the past many decades, has been a destructive and backwards system). I believe that it poses no immediate health risk based on my experiences and do not support any move to ban or schedule the substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4524","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Polk","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello and please do not ban the only nature's gift available to everyone for treating multiple problems.\n\nI myself had to be in a hospital and when I managed to get up - what was I given?  A bunch of pain killers which gave me bad random side effects.  There was no choice but to take it, as the pain was great and my body couldn't seem to live without it.  As time went on the effects lessened, as problems increased and I just got really mad and asked someone to hide a bottle where I couldn't find it.\n\nAfter discovering kratom - it...it was miracle.  It helped me fight, while clearing away the mind numbing pain.  Within a few weeks I was good to go and more than grateful.\n\nAnother thing, is everyone able to quiet the \"voices in their heads\"?  I don't mean actually hearing voices, but being more of a person that constantly worries about everything and everyone?  I don't think so.  Kratom to the rescue (again)!  Not only it helps you think clearly, it gives you that energy boost (without actually giving you a heart attack from other \"energy granting remedies)\".\n\nNot everything is perfect of course, but the only bad thing (which isn't a bad thing at all) is probably throwing up.  IF you decide to take a bunch of it at once (not sure why you would want to).  Apart from that...keep the product going!

That said, it is utterly amazing to me how easier everyday life has become thanks to a simple leaf.  I've been able to ease off of the cocktail of pharmaceuticals that have governed my life for over a decade(I was diagnosed as having Fibromyalgia  in 2006, which joined a 1997 clinical depression diagnosis.  Needless to say, there's been quite a combination of medications, some strictly to combat the side effects of the 'staple' drugs), have become more productive in my daily life and career than ever before, and have generally been a far better person than Western medicine was *ever* able to mold me into becoming. The cessation of my pharmaceuticals has been under the close eye of my medical specialists, and kratom was actually recommended BY my psychiatrist, as she had seen positive results in her own self-care through the use of it.  Three years have gone by since I took my last prescription medication, and every lab test and body study since has shown one thing to be true:  I am *better* with kratom than I ever was on the half dozen medications I was bound to for the years prior to it entering my life.  I am only 35, but have been shackled to pill bottle after pill bottle for nearly half my lifetime.  Since starting kratom, I have founded my own business, something the anxiety-ridden 'old me' never had the courage to do. Doing so has allowed me to be the parent I've always dreamed of being, one who is very active in every facet of her children's lives.  The wholeness of self is something I had all but given up on experiencing, and I truly do not wish to risk losing 'me' again. The quantity I take is very, very low -- rarely more than 2 grams in a full day, and that is only on days I have need for any at all.  It's glorious, truly.  No more fuzzy-headedness, no nausea(something I've fought for nearly 2 decades, which is just as horrible as it sounds: feeling like you need to vomit around the clock, for 19 years, will make just about anyone crazy I figure.), no more unexplainable numbness in my extremities...just a whole, better, me.  A me I truly love being, and am proud to have become. \n\nI wake rested.  I spend days laughing or in peaceful quiet, rather than constantly doubting  or fighting myself and the world around me.  I do not ache constantly.  I am a better parent, a more supportive partner to my husband, and a far more active contributor to the overall betterment of my neighborhood(and the world around me).  My external appearance has improved dramatically, as I am no longer hormonally imbalanced due to the heavy combination of medications; this in turn helps me appreciate myself more, lessening my depression *greatly*.  The constant weight of anxiety is gone, and I could write for hours about how positive an impact kratom has had on my life, however mine is just one story among millions. As with anything of worth, there are some in the world who go beyond beneficial usage, however there are gluttons of all kinds, and there are so very many people just like myself who would suffer if this plant, used for millennia, were to be deemed unsafe for the public at large.  For many, many people who seek a less invasive means of self-care, kratom is the answer.  When partnered with knowledge and safe sources, it truly is an amazing thing.  Please, do not take this from those like myself, but rather leave it as it currently is -- a choice for consenting adults to make for themselves.  For myself at least, this isn't a matter of 'altering' myself, or 'getting high'.  There's no fear of addiction, something I *did* fight with several of my prescribed medications such as Cymbalta and Zoloft.  Just a better, more whole, me.  I love the complete me, enough to share my story with you in the hopes the plant that led me to the 'whole me' isn't taken from myself and those like me.  Let us keep our plants, they give us so much.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3908","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kimberley Killebrew","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello.

Tylenol doesn't work and NSAIDs are not an option for me because of the stomach problems it causes.\n For years I had to rely on pain killers to help ease the pain and it took its toll on me.  It was awful to have to rely on narcotics just to do daily tasks that required me to just move.  I was constantly in a fog.  It was no way to live.  Someone told me to give Kratom a try and I did.  It was wonderful to finally have an all natural remedy that actually worked.  I am finally able to do things without worrying about taking heavy duty narcotics that only impaired me.  I even have been able to go camping again without the worry that my back would go out.  The DEA says that there are too many people addicted to pain killers and yet we find a safe and workable solution and the DEA wants to take it away.  There are many of us who do not want to take Vicodin or Percocets and have been able to live a drug free / pain free life with Kratom.  Why would you even try to take this all natural remedy away if you truly felt that there is an epidemic with pill addiction?  If you make Kratom illegal you will only succeed in forcing people back to using heavy pain meds just so they can function.  I do not have any desire in having to go back to using pain killers.  I know Big Pharma has a problem with the fact that Kratom is hurting their profitable business.  Is this why you want to make it illegal?  You want to do your part in the war against narcotics but you take away a solution to narcotics.  How does that make any sense?  I beg you to reconsider.  I now have my life back and it is very upsetting that you want to take it away.  \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8935","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christi Hulme","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I suffer from Lyme Disease and have been freed from opiates (Percocet 10mg 6/day) by kratom use.

I have previously worked as a compounding pharmacy technician and as a chemical dependency counselor intern for adolescent girls. I oppose proposal 81 FR 59929 intending to classify mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, the active compounds of kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) as a Schedule I substance. This plant is not a recreational substance. It does not produce a \"high\" and has low potential for abuse. People who use kratom take it as a natural supplement to help maintain a healthy, happy lifestyle. I began taking kratom when a friend suggested I try it to help get through my day. I suffer from major depression and generalized anxiety. Every day I take a 1/4 tsp of White Maeng Da strain kratom with my juice and it gives me confidence and energy to go about my daily routine. Without it, there are some days the depression makes it impossible for me to even leave the house. No prescription medication has been able to control my depression and anxiety. If kratom becomes illegal I most likely will not be able to maintain a full time career as I have lost jobs in the past due to crippling panic attacks. In addition to my own experience, I have read many personal accounts of individuals who claim kratom helped them break addictions to heroin and their abuse of prescription opiates. In the US, more people die of overdose than vehicular accidents and most of those overdose deaths were from abuse of prescription opioids. (see attachment, \"Injury2007.pdf\") From my personal experience in substance abuse counseling, I have seen what addiction does to people and to their families. It always stems from other problems- depression, abuse, poverty, etc. Our current system of treating addiction is not effective. Either users are expected to quit cold-turkey or they are made to replace one highly addictive substance for another e.g, heroin for methadone. In the midst of the current opioid crisis we need to further investigate any other potential solutions. Kratom shows promise of helping people struggling with addiction to regain control of their lives (see attachment, nihms-51959.pdf) and needs further study. To fully restrict a potential treatment could potentially cost hundreds if not thousands of lives. I understand that the DEA exists to protect the public from harmful substances, but I do not believe kratom to be dangerous and the benefits far outweigh potential risks. While I am absolutely opposed to classifying kratom as a Schedule I substance, I would be open to regulating it to ensure the quality of leaves being imported for consumption.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4299","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear who ever it may concern,\n\n When I found Kratom it changed my life for the better. It never dulled me down or made me incoherent or unable to operate a vehicle, even at higher doses. It doesn't make you feel high or any different, all it ever did was give me ambition and drive to work hard for longer periods of time with little to no pain. It helped my abstinence from pain meds that made me incoherent and unable to accomplish daily tasks. It saved my life and my family, by allowing me to break a pain pill addiction that was controlling my life and taking me down a destructive path.\nOn pain meds I couldn't feel emotions or empathy for life in general. But when I started Kratom and stopped the pain meds, I started to regain my ability to feel real emotions. It was as if a dark vail had been lifted from me and I could actually remember what it was like to cry again with an open heart with tears of joy. Thats when I relized what my life had been missing. And what opiods (pain pills) had been taking from me. \nKratom is not a drug, it is not an opiate nor an opioid.\nKratom is composed of natural active alkaloids 7-Hydroxymytraginine and Mytraginine.\nAnd should be available to everyone in its natural form who could benefit from its possible life changing qualities. If the government takes Kratom away from the people we are not really living in a free country. And millions of daily lives will suffer tramendiously and our society as a whole will suffer.

This supplement has been safely used by millions of Americans for many years, not to mention for millennia across the globe. It is primarily used an an herbal tea that can provide energy, minor pain relief, and general mood enhancement. It is a plant relative of coffee, and is extremely similar to the way it affects humans. There have been no recorded deaths solely from the herb itself, and besides that, millions of people die each year from tobacco, alcohol, and prescription drugs, so in comparison to safety and legality, there should be no question that it doesn't belong in the same category as illegal narcotics, because if that was the case, alcohol and tobacco should be immediately placed into schedule 1 classification. Kratom is not used to cure any sort of disability, it is merely used as a supplement similar to Coffee, St. Johns Wort, Guarana, Yerba Mate, Ginseng, and many others. There is absolutely no \"public health hazard\". I myself drink the tea occasionally for an energy boost with my coffee in the morning as a pick me up, and have never felt any sort negative effects, or \"high\" with it. I am a responsible adult that works full time as well as goes to school. I don't drink alcohol, or take any illegal drugs, and I feel that it is an abomination to potentially incriminate me over something that is so ridiculously minuscule compared to the real drug problems America is facing right now. I also feel that banning this could have a substantial effect on the black market drug trade, kratom is fully legal and available in our neighboring countries; Canada, and Mexico, which would make America a prime target for an herb that is high in demand, thus taking precious time away from law enforcement to engage in more serious crime. As history has shown us, making drugs illegal has no effect on the drug trade, and increases violence from cartels, and increases incarceration at astonishing rates at the cost of the tax payer. The drug war needs to end, and the DEA has overstepped their bounds in this matter, and has shown a complete disregard to the science behind this. Please reconsider your decisions as they could negatively impact our country greatly.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21605","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ashley Enfield","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban Kratom.

I became very addicted to opiates. I lost everything including my child and ended up in jail. After spending 62 days there I was released and decided to get my life together and stay off opiates. Fours day after being let out of jail I had job. I was working and making strides to regain control of my life. But after a few months, I still felt like something was missing. I was still suffering with pain in my shoulder, I was fatigued all the time and basically went to work and came home and got in the bed. This went on to for about six months. I then accepted a position at a staffing agency as the intake coordinator and my route to work changed. And on my way home from work one day I noticed a shop and remembered someone telling me about kratom while I was still in addiction. Well, I had tried it back then but to be honest it wasn't strong enough. It didn't get me high and I wasn't interested in slowing down with my drug use. But this time things were different. I bought the kratom and took it home and mixed it some yogurt, I heard that was one way to take it. Not long after I took it, I began to feel better. My shoulder didn't hurt and I had a little energy. Well, that was 13 months ago. And to this day, I am still clean. I take kratom regularly and maintain employment. I have amazing relationships with my family and friends. I have began proceedings to get my daughter back and am visiting with her regularly.  I have been paying child support for 11 months , with ease. And I only missed 1 day of work due to illness in the last 13 months. Without kratom I know I will not be able to maintain that attendance record. I strongly suggest that kratom be kept available to adults. Quality standards and age restrictions are completely understandable and at very least, availabilitiy under a doctor's care. I'm not claiming that kratom cured me but it has helped ease my pain and curbed my addiction and currently I do not take any other medications.\nAmanda Rae Davis","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4875","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amanda Davis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using kratom in place of coffee for the past three years.

Most of them are now dead because of it. Of course, I too had terrible issues with alcohol dependency as well as other drugs. I started taking kratom daily about three years ago to combat addiction to prescription opiates. Prior to that, I was just drinking incredible amounts of alcohol to try and come even close to making life without those things livable. Going through my regular routine of making absolutely sure I had alcohol ready to go prior to going to work on my night shift, I one night bought 3 bottles of wine and a bottle of vodka. Went through the night not really realizing that I wasn't drinking, but the next day realizing that I had not even opened any of the alcohol. I would have had a panic attack requiring an ER visit if I did this before from the lack of the alcohol that my body desperately craved. I not only did not, but woke up feeling great. For the first time in as long as I can remember. I took my normal dose of kratom, showered and went to work. It was a wonderful day. I felt clean. I don't know how else to describe it. I did not immediately make the connection that it was the kratom that was somehow curbing my alcohol addiction. \n\nI have been clean and sober for over two years now. I had given up. Thought I was just going end up just like my mother and father. I feel great. Still take kratom daily, though I don't feel like I have to. I also had severe anxiety issues. These are gone with daily kratom use. The only thing it does not stop is an occasional sudden panic attack, which are less frequent now than they were even when I was wasted all the time. \n\nThis feeling of normality in my life is priceless. I have a wonderful girlfriend, a little family and some close friends. If kratom is made illegal, so many people who have experienced exactly what I did will die. There is no doubt in my mind of this. I've never been a heroin addict, but I've heard the stories of some. Just waiting for that dose that they don't come back from. And kratom allows them to lead normal lives. \n\nPlease, consider what you are doing here guys. So many people's lives are in your hands. I know people in the online communities that have been using kratom for 10 years and have zero health issues. Like perfect health. Anything you can find wrong with this incredible plant with be dwarfed by the help it has provided. Yes, it's addictive. Like coffee is addictive. And wow, cigarettes. Will you be able to sleep at night knowing that you are selling this ban as a \"public health emergency \" while I can smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol freely? I don't think you will. Speaking of which, I also smoked cigarettes for several years and now have zero desire for them. Man, I don't even drink coffee anymore. So much good is being done in this realm. Don't mess this one up guys.

Recently, due to more changes with the laws, I have been advised since I am not terminally ill, and also no further surgery can be done since it would kill me (allergic to metal in my body that can no longer be removed), I can no longer receive the treatment that has helped me. The rest of my \"life\" is feeling and looking very dim. When I was a little girl, I used to believe what my mother, a registered dietician, told me about our Unites States Government... that they looked out for us, had our best interests at heart, and I could trust in them. However, as I have grown into a middle aged women, I sadly do not feel nor believe that anymore. I hope to believe again, one day, that these agencies truly do want what is best for people. However with the decisions made within the past several decades, I hope you can see why citizens have lost faith in our government. I oppose the ban on kratom nationwide and statewide. Thank you. It has come to my attention that it seems the DEA is not being completely forthcoming when faced with a freedom of information request. Investigative reporter Anthony Roberts of MUCKROCK has requested all information on Kratom including any emails from FDA, DEA and pharma companies, and very specific sections of the intent to schedule, footnotes 17 and 18, 22. This information that the DEA is withholding is critical to the public mounting an offensive against such claims. It seems completely INAPPROPRIATE not to release all information.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22910","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Leslie D.","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom. There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\n\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation and respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\n\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22826","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Stover","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom saved my life. Fentanyl addiction nearly killed me more than once. Luckily I found Kratom and have never looked back. When I hear that Kratom is going to be banned, I really have to scratch my head. Kratom does NOT get me high, it simply allows me to enjoy life without pain. Let me ask you this? How can you ban Kratom when alcohol is legal for consumption. Alcohol is way more inebriating than Kratom. I have never acted like a fool while on Kratom, but I sure have on alcohol l! Should Kratom be regulated like tobacco? Yes, there should be age restrictions. There should also be quality assurance. But to make it a crime to ingest a plant like kratom is asinine. The fact that the DEA wanted to put Kratom on an emergency ban is seriously ridiculous. Emergency? Come on DEA, you're way smarter than that.

The only reason the DEA wants to ban this is because pharmaceutical companies can't patent a plant and want to keep selling us their synthetic garbage.  It would be detrimental to so many people to take something that many many people find medicinal and call it non- medicinal then take it away and make it illegal.  Just leave it as it is.
