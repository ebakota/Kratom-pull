I'm gainfully employed as a data processing and customer service professional.  I'm a homeowner,  a mother, a grandmother, a National Merit Scholar (way back in my school days).  I'm the farthest thing from a drug addict, but prescription painkillers nearly got the better of me.  I had an accident a few years ago and was very slow to heal.  Before I realized it, I'd been taking the Vicodin my doctor prescribed for several months and I'd become extremely fond of them.  \n\nMy doctor said I could register for long-term pain treatment and continue the prescriptions, but I didn't want to get hooked any further. So I quit taking the pills and felt miserable and depressed. My doctor put me on anti-depressants, but they didn't suit me.  They made me grind my teeth and feel apathetic.  So I quit those too and started searching for ways to get my life back to what it was before the painkillers.  I read a lot online and decided to give Kratom a try.  And it did just what I needed it to.  Kratom helped me get past the craving for the pills and get back to a healthy and productive work & social life.  \n\nI would hate to see this plant taken away by an ill-advised scheduling.  I shudder to think back to the path I was headed down with prescription painkiller addiction.  If Kratom had not been readily available and legal, I'm not sure I'd be here writing to you now.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19199","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bettina Meadors","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not think kratom should be banned.

It was then that I sought help and was put on suboxone. That started a long period of more than fifteen years, where I tried to kick my opiod problems, \"prescribed solution.\" While I was fairly stable, I could not stop the bupinorfine for years. The withdrawl was so terrible that I began to believe it could not be done. Fiinally after many failed attempts I endured the 60 day withdrawl.  After a year it had become painfully clear that the years spent using my prescibed opiate treatment may have left me forever physically and mentally damaged. I had to make a decision,  either go back on an opiod or find a healthier solution. See, after a year clean I had no motivation. Getting out of bed in the morning was a choir. Being a successful employee or worker was literally not physically possible.  So as a last stitch effort I turned to the legal, natural, and I dare say, the only option I had left to lead a successful and fulfilling life. That final option was kratom. While I may never have gone back to opiods, though I suspect I would have eventuallly, I would most certainly not have been able to achieve, and more importantly maintain, the level of success that I have to this day. Opiods are a severe problem in this country. I need not tell you. Just know that kratom being legal and readily available most certainly saves thousands of lives, as it has most certainly saved mine.

To hear that we are in a battle to keep kratom legal is by far one of the worst feelings I have had. Not just because of me, but for the thousands of people it truly helps assist in living a more productive life. Im sharing my story in hopes that it will touch the person reading this and let them see that kratom is not bad and it is not mind altering in any way. I'm a 34 yr old mother of 4 and wife to an amazing man. I also work full time in business management. I have had horrible back problems since the time I can remember. I was told I would be on pain pills the rest of my life, or I would need to undergo a back surgery for the.list of issues. I have always woken up in the morning involuntarily screaming from the pain. That was my norm. I would need pain pills at the side of my bed, or I wouldn't be able to function for a moment. The pain pills didn't really help, besides numbing my mind to the pain. I ended up abusing vicodin. One day I realized what I had done and broke down crying in the shower. I did not want to be \"that person\". It wasnt me. I ended up going to a suboxone clinic and put on suboxone for 2 yrs. It helped my pain, so I figured I will stay on this for a while. It got to the point that I had no idea how I was ever going to get off suboxone. A friend told me about kratom. It sounded too good to be true. Well, I ended up trying kratom and it not only helped with my withdrawals from suboxone, but it helped with my back pain. I functioned with a clear mind for what seemed to be years of clouded thinking. I didnt feel numb anymore. It all hit me that I was thinking and functioning like a person that never took anything. I no longer woke up screaming and crying in pain trying to find my current med just to get out of bed. I had energy to be able to get down and play with my children. I have taken kratom in the tea form ever since. This has helped my life and for the good. Nothing negative has happened to me in the year I have been taking kratom. I ask you to not take away my herbal supplement. I am finally the wife, mother, and worker that I was always meant to be.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6230","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alicia Adcock","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a disabled veteran and was on opiate pain killers for a couple of years.

I was in a bad accident 15 years ago and broke my left ankle, right knee cap, femur, and hip. I have since recovered but I have been in various levels of pain ever since. I have come to accept that this will be the case for the rest of my life. Initially I was prescribed narcotics by my doctors and while it worked, after years of this I couldnt stand the ever-increasing dosages and hated being so dependent on a drug. My health started to suffer, as did my personal life and the focus on my business. Because of this, I managed to stop taking them for various lengths of time, but the pain I felt always brought me back. What people who have never experienced chronic pain dont understand is that taking nothing is not an option. No matter how good everything else is going in your life, there is always that cloud overhead darkening everything. The pain has to be treated otherwise you simply cannot go about your daily life.\n   In an effort to find an alternative, I went to a pain clinic and tried all sorts of non-narcotic medications and treatments, but nothing was a good enough substitute. Then a year ago while searching online for all natural alternatives, I discovered kratom. It is simply crushed up leaves from the plant that I mix with water and drink as a tea. I have a couple teaspoons as needed and it controls my pain almost as well as the narcotics. The greatest thing about it is that I am not dependent on it and I dont feel the urge to keep taking it. My mind is clear and I don't have to be scared of taking too much. The effects are extremely subtle, and at its strongest it feels like a relaxing coffee buzz. It even has a ceiling effect, where if you keep taking more it doesnt give you a greater effect. In the past year I have completely turned my life around and if it is banned I will be forced to make a decision to go back to my doctor and start taking narcotics again, or live in pain for the rest of my life. Either option terrifies me and I honestly dont know what I will do. Just when I thought all this was behind me and I was finally happy with my life, something out of my control like this happens. The very people who are supposed to protect me are threatening my right to live a normal, pain-free life. \n   Id like to point out that I am not some teenager trying to catch a quick, legal high. The DEA seems to think that this is what kratom is, but they couldnt be further from the truth. I am 34 years old, and a successful small business owner. I am a normal, tax-paying citizen with a great family. It is not my fault that I require pain management for the rest of my life, but I have the right to take a safer alternative to pharmaceuticals if I want to.\n   Kratom has the potential to improve millions of lives. Others use it to help with Lyme disease and Crohns disease, two diseases that are notoriously hard to treat with modern medicine. There are veterans who take kratom for PTSD. Some of them have to suffer for the rest of their lives because they were protecting this country. But now they are being told that they arent important enough to allow them to take something that makes them feel better? Every 65 minutes a veteran takes his/her life and if there is any possibility that kratom actually could help treat PTSD, shouldnt it be studied? Our country is in the grips of a fentanyl epidemic and banning kratom is going to leave thousands of people with no alternative to dangerous narcotics. How can the government say they are trying to combat this issue when they are trying to take away a safer alternative? Kratom has been used for thousands of years in Southeast Asia and there has not been one reported case of someone dying from it on its own. How is this an imminent danger to our country? There was a Whitehouse.gov petition with over 145,000 signatures. This is not what the public wants. \n   I am glad that the comment period was opened up, but now the DEA/FDA need to leave this up to science, not their opinion. I dont know why they are so biased against this plant, but if a proper study is done, the truth will be revealed. There are plenty of more dangerous substances out there that should be focused on. I have been through enough pain in my life and shouldnt have to worry about something like this in the United States of America. Kratom should be regulated like kava, perhaps with an age limit, but nothing more. And that should be the end of this.

I was stunned to find out there were plans to categorize this alongside truly awful drugs like heroin. \n\nI strongly oppose the DEA's proposal to make Kratom and the alkaloids found in Kratom a schedule 1 controlled substance. I believe it unnecessarily circumvents normal procedure for criminalizing substances. Moreover, it would also severely hinder and impair further scientific study.\n\nThe DEA's argument that it is a public safety hazard is well-intentioned (I believe) but misguided. I think every coherent, caring person wants to address the crisis we've seen in this country around painkillers and subsequent heroin abuse. However, this simply misses the mark. In the scheduling letter poison control center calls were cited as the basis for this action. However they fail to note that people were often using it in conjunction with other substances making attribution impossible. Moreover when one compares Poison Control Center reports on Energy Drinks, Caffeine, e-cigarettes and other over the counter medications the incidence rate of Kratom is miniscule. . \n\nI think it's imperative that people have the liberty and freedom to make choices unless severe potential for harm exists. Nothing in my personal experience would indicate that's the case here.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19223","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Benning","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, thank you for allowing me to tell you about my experience with Kratom.

Kratom helps me with my pain, energy and focus. I work 2 jobs and I am raising my son on my own. Before Kratom I would be tired constantly and would barely have the energy to  do any thing. I have not and will not take any prescription drugs for pain or depression. I find Kratom to work wonders and its natural and safe. I lost my wife to prescription pain and antidepressant meds almost 3 years ago and I know the damage they cause first hand. I only wish I had found Kratom earlier and maybe my son will have his mom here with us today. Please keep Kratom available for the many people who depend on it.

Prescription painkillers make my body itch all over. Kratom worked very well for my pain, but little did I know that it was going to have a more meaningful impact on my life. Because Kratom didn't mesh well with alcohol, I eventually completely quit drinking as well, which was actually one of the best things to ever happen to me.\n\nI've spent years addicted to alcohol, drinking nearly half a 5th of spirits a day. It was slowly and painfully destroying my quality of life. Now that my injury is mostly healed, I have a new lease on life, because I am free of my alcoholism. Everyone keeps asking me, \"Hey do you want a drink?\" And I always politely decline. If it wasn't for Kratom I would still be stuck in the cycle of chronic alcohol abuse. If it can work for me, it can work for others, so I think it is imperative that Kratom stay legal and affordable for those who need it for medicinal purposes, but also for those who can use it to recover from drug and alcohol addictions. \n\nSincerely,\n\nANONYMOUS","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6215","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped myself and several other individuals that I know cope with severe anxiety.

My brother, an opiate addict, recommended it to my father for his severe anxiety and panic disorder. The effectiveness it had on my fathers anxiety was truly fascinating to me. It seemed to eliminate his anxiety and brighten his mood far better than the medication his doctor prescribed him. \n\nI myself suffer from depression and social anxiety. Kratom has helped me manage my anxiety and calmed my mind, allowing me to focus and not be so all over the place. Shortly after getting into Kratom, I started a successful business which I am still doing today. My brother has managed to avoid using heroin with the use of Kratom and we are all tremendously grateful for that.\n\nIn all of my life I have never seen anything like Kratom. I have been involved with the community, keeping up on blogs, etc. and I can tell you it's use is overwhelmingly medicinal. While pot advocates often argue its medicinal value, marijuanas use is mostly recreational. Kids aren't skipping school to go drink Kratom. People who take Kratom are looking to alleviate symptoms of anxiety, depression, and most importantly addiction. The wide range of its medicinal use is Godly. \n\nKratom is clearly preventing drug overdoses in this country. If the DEA worked on behalf of the American people, like the government is supposed to, they would encourage the use of Kratom. The fact that they attempted to ban this plant when there is substantial testimonial evidence that it is saving lives not only frightens me, but it breaks my heart. Im wondering how this comes about. Who in the DEA is being incentivized? The life and death of the American public, the laws of our land, and our freedom  is jeopardized by pharmaceutical companies.

Please do not ban kratom. Perhaps it should be regulated as a supplement ,although I regard kratom along the likes of chamomile tea or oregano oil. An herb that quite bluntly has completely changed the quality of my life. I suffer from chronic pain due to two bulging discs in my neck that tends to pinch a major nerve. I revamped my diet and attended physical therapy regularly but was in almost constant pain. This made it very difficult to care for my child as well as the two children in my care. The pain management specialist told me they didn't give pain medication to stay at home moms yet offered me no alternatives other than \"just dealing\" with it.

I learned about kratom from a pain management website and tried it as a last resort. I didn't want to obtain illegal prescription medication but I was desperate for relief. When I tried it ,it felt like a miracle. My pain went from a daily level 8 to about a 2 which is amazing. I don't feel \"high\" or not myself I am just able to live my life without feeling like a bear with it's paw stuck in a trap. I still attend physical therapy and maintain a strict diet. I just take my kratom when I take my other vitamins and supplements. It has completely changed the quality of my life as well as my children's.

And when we suffer and cannot function, it falls upon our families and friends to take care of us. That is, for those lucky enough to have family who understands or at least cares.\nMany people who use kratom are able to have jobs, go to school, have a social life, etc. The other significant benefit is health related; with kratom, opiates are not needed and therefore the liver (and other organ) damage from the acetaminophen fillers in opiates is avoidable. At 25 years old I worry about how much I have hurt my body in my endless pursuit of pain relief. Pain has consumed my body, my life. Kratom, when I can afford it, has increased my quality of life dramatically. I was able to be a bridesmaid in my brother's wedding, able to take care of my a family and home, and able to be the mother I have always strived to be for my son. At 5 years old, my son understands more about pain than the vast majority of those who determine what is supposedly effective treatment but never realize PAIN IS NOT OBJECTIVE and rarely do tgey truly try to empathize\nThe DEA has already wreaked utter havoc upon the medical community. Doctors are terrified to do their own jobs. Pain clinics operate more like probation offices with drug tests and doctors who punish patients with threats of dismissal and/or outright refusing to continue treatment. Sometimes life is a living hell because not only do we have to deal with the overwhelming pain but we also have to use what little energy we have to fight for the treatment and medication we should have the right to responsibly use. \nSo leave kratom alone. Don't criminalize another valid and safe method of pain management. Not to mention the ways it helps those who struggle with mental health issues like anxiety and depression and PTSD. Because if you take away our right to have kratom, you take away our right to function and to have even a small amount of control over what we choose to put into our own bodies to manage pain that would bring you to your knees. Those who have been able to work will lose their jobs. Families will suffer. Keep it legal.

My first experience trying kratom (5 grams mixed with OJ) was only a couple of months ago, and I noticed an almost immediate relief of my chronic pain symptoms that I have been suffering with for over a decade.\n\nI have had five surgeries, including a two level cervical fusion, and two lumbar discectomies due to herniated discs in my spine. I continued to suffer moderate to severe pain (in my neck and lower back) even after these surgeries, as I have had other adjacent discs herniate after these procedures. The surgeons whom I consult with are are not recommending any more supplemental surgeries for me at this time, and are instead treating me with anti-inflammatories and opioids. I notice that I am not really \"myself\" anymore, when taking opioids. I feel stressed and irritable, and the opioids only help to a certain extent, as I am never pain free any longer. \n\nI only learned of kratom rather recently from a news article that I read regarding the DEA planning to put it on their list of controlled substances this year. I read a lot of the posted comments from the article from fellow chronic pain sufferers like myself, and almost all of them had very positive things to say about kratom. I thought that I'd give it a try since it is so cheap and was legally available near me.\n\nSince I have been using kratom, I have not needed, or even cared to take opioids to treat my chronic pain. The side effects that I had suffered previously are not present any longer, and the kratom seems to help my condition better than the opioids did. \n\nI would never consider writing a letter like this if I wasn't truly passionate about how much kratom has helped changed the circumstances that I've suffered with for over a decade, and have had to accmodate for and deal with for such a large part of my life. Indeed, I don't even remember ever advocating for anything this strongly before. Kratom's effectiveness has made me an advocate, and I sincerely hope that my words don't go unnoticed here. \n\nKratom has drastically improved the quality of my life. And in conclusion, I beg you to consider my (and no-doubt every other advocate that will leave a letter of support here) endorsement for this Godsend of a plant. \n\nSincerely, \n\nDavid Parsons","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20731","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Parsons","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think the plant should be kept as legal and there should be multiple entities doing research.

My wife of 35 years and I spent 28 years on a cooperative organic farm where we raised our children. My wife's family has been herding dairy goats since she was 2 years old, and our job has been to manage  livestock. We have used primarily herbal remedies with our animals, and ourselves as much as possible. We maintain a healthy diet and immune system, and have never needed pharmaceutical or recreational drugs or alcohol.\n\tIn 2008, I had made major investments in a farm-scale bio-diesel facility for our farm, and when the economy fell through, we finally had to file for bankruptcy in 2010. My life took a turn for the worse. My wife discovered she was pregnant with twins, after several years of thinking we were finished having children. We had to sell the livestock and start life over again. We moved to Kentucky, where I started a retail shop that sells and repairs musical instruments. I struggled, since I had to start from scratch. I never thought anxiety and depression was a disease until it happened to me. I would have become an alcoholic had a friend not told me about Kratom. I have been using Kratom since 2010, and have much to say about my experience with it.\n\tMy business requires me to interact with customers every day. If I become overwhelmed with anxiety and depression, I simply cannot function. One teaspoon of Kratom powder in the morning gives me a guarantee that I will maintain a good attitude, and motivation to conduct my daily tasks. It works pretty much like coffee. I am able to have a clear outlook, and communicate articulately to customers. Here are some of the things I have experienced concerning Kratom,:\n\nIt's impossible, in my experience,  to abuse Kratom or to overdose with Kratom. Anything over a tablespoon causes nausea, and is quickly regurgitated.\n\nI begin to feel the effects within 20 minutes, and it lasts approximately 6 hours. After 6 hours, I take about  teaspoon to finish the day. Sometimes I will need about  teaspoon of Red Kratom (see below about the different types) before retiring.\n\nI have never experienced any notable side effects with Kratom, except the nausea from taking too much.\n\nI like having total control of when and how much Kratom to take. If I am doing fine, then I don't need it. If  I start feeling overwhelmed, or depressed, a will asses the situation, and decide if I should or should not take Kratom. \n\nI have suffered with chronic back pain due to several work accidents in the past. Kratom has provided relief. \n\nIf I need energy and focus, I find that the green variety helps. I usually use the green variety in the morning. If I need focus and clarity, I find that the white variety helps with this. I take this variety in the afternoon. If I need relaxation, then the red variety helps. As I said before, this is what I take occasionally in the evening.\n\nAs with any herbal supplement, I find that there is a need to gradually increase the amount used to get the desired effects. However, as I said before, I get nauseous when I have too much. I will have to gradually taper off, and sometimes stop for a week or two. This has only happened twice for me. I have learned, with practice, to keep the amount a a minimum.\n\nI cannot see how this herb can ever be used, or referred to, as a recreational drug. There is no 'high' involved. To me, it only assists in maintaining 'normalcy'.\n\nAfter seven years of taking Kratom, I have had very little desire for alcohol. My son, who is 24 years old, and lives in another State had, at one point, become  alcoholic. We were very concerned. He started taking Kratom, and now, he has totally stopped drinking. We were so happy and proud of him. He told me he had a friend that was addicted to heroin, and now, he's clean because of Kratom. To me, this is amazing. I hope they can tell their stories, too.\n\n\tIn conclusion, I do not believe it is necessary to regulate this herbal supplement in any way. So far, I have not found a merchant that would even think of only offering Kratom in it's purest form. Kratom cannot be abused by the consumer. Kratom does not impair in any way. On the contrary, it can only increase health and well-being. Kratom has benefited my life in many ways. There's nothing about Kratom for the DEA to be concerned about.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17030","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thomas McShane","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not make Kratom a schedule 1.

As has been pointed out repeatedly and in depth, this plant is very safe and has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the wotld. While I do appreciate the government's desire to keep our United States citizens safe this would be an extreme overreach!\n\nIn the United States alone hundreds of people have found relief for a variety of ailments using this plant. While I do not used this plant personally, I do have a personal testimonial regarding my girlfriend. We have been together for approximately 16 years and I have watched her change from a scared, always in a panic, always worried that either herself or her children would come to great harm in some sort of imagined accident type of distracted person to a level headed confident woman who enjots  wonderful relationships with both her children and grandchildren, a productive member of society with a successful career, and a loving partner. She suffered extreme panic attacks and before she found Kratom she tried several Pharmaceuticals that just left her drowsy and not caring about anything going on around her.\n\nI have heard countless stories as to how much this plant has helped so many people and have seen no evidence showing that it is dangerous. The evidence that was brought forth from the DEA and or FDA proved to be flawed.\n\nI will refrain from sending supporting evidence that shows this plant to have \"mildly\" addictive properties that do not rise to a level that would nesitate drug scheduling. It is ridiculous and even embarrassing to put it beside Heroin or Methamphetamine.\n\nPlease consider the help it is given so many. This is not a plant used by a bunch of teenagers or young kids looking to \"get high\" This is a plant that has saved people's lives. Please reconsider the scheduling of this plant and the on-going \"nanny-state\" that the United States government tries to smother its citizens with.\n\nSincerely,\nBrian P.

There are no ill effects nor habits developed from this \"chronic\" use, and anyone that says otherwise is just regurgitating misinformation. I began taking kratom more daily after I had several injuries that eventually turned into chronic pain. This plant helps give me relief along with energy to do things I would normally not be able to; I can't even get legal treatment where I reside due to the legality of marijuana and being of a certain age range that doctors fear prescribing anything that could actually assist thanks to ageism. Not that I actually want to be on prescription drugs, I am just saying that was another thing that pushed me to use kratom in the first place.\n\nDo not feed into the fear mongering pharmaceutical companies would have you believe because this is a plant that, along with marijuana, threatens their ability to make billions of dollars annually off the pain and suffering of those dependent on their chemicals. I read that this  proposed ban was instigated because of fifteen deaths over two years. Toxicology shows each individual was consuming other chemicals at the time, so the fact that kratom even comes up as a suspect is completely coincidental. Going back to that number though, fifteen....  Fifteen people? Really? Over two years, a whopping fifteen people? Let's think about the number that die from already scheduled substances, or from the very legal and original drug, alcohol. Not even counting the very legal tobacco use... If we collected all of these numbers and put them together in an easy to view chart, or even just basing it off of two years and percentages. This blip of supposed kratom induced death would barely register. You couldn't even make it out on a number of charts.\n\nThis isn't to discount those fifteen deaths, but to make light of how irresponsible it would be to control something that has little to no evidence of causing serious health problems or death. This plant helps me and millions of other people every day because of its' properties and effects. To ban it would be willfully ignorant and wrong given the information available. You are judging a book by its cover, you know nothing of what it really does, and the people always lining up to ban something don't usually have any foot to stand on when it comes to personal experience. Not always, but a lot of times if you haven't ever tried something, then you have no right to tell someone else they cannot use it without some type of real in depth scientific research that has been done by several independent groups over an acceptable amount of time.\n\nDon't subjugate the American population to more propaganda that this naturally occurring plant causes more harm than good. That is just outright misinformation and you yourselves even admit you want time to study it before a permanent ban is in place. There are plenty of testimonials available right now that can attest to the benefits kratom has, only thing is they'll also tell you there aren't any negative side effects either.

While friends make careers working with disabled through Association of Higher Education and Disability (AHEAD) and Access Technology Higher Education Network Professionals (ATHEN), I modestly assist patients diagnosed as \"chronic pain\".\n\n My support groups in no way substitutes for qualified medical care, I make this point abundantly clear. I spent years in South East Asia, learning Asian practices which pre date western medicine several thousands of years. This includes centuries of herbal plant remedies like Kratom. I prescribe only exercise; relaxation; mind exercises/meditation/visualization techniques; and sharing conversations . \n\nPatients range from low level recent accident victims; to long standing illnesses; to those with severe life long intractable pain. \nIn the group of ongoing medical illnesses/diseases we've LUPUS [SLE]; fibromyalgia; degenerative disc disease; rheumatoid arthritis and patients with other ailments. \n\n Naturopathy and holistic health care are popular in my area. These include herbal & nutritional supplements as Kava, prescribed medical Cannabis (legal in my state) or Kratom. \n\nPatients disclose all modes employed for pain control via in depth profiles and ongoing journals. One third of group has tried and benefited from Kratom. At the time I questioned the group, I'd just read about DEA & Kratom for the first time. I needed information. I began no less than 40 hours research.\n\nIn patients with LUPUS SLE, painful symptoms range from intermittent \"flares\" as infrequent as once per month to ongoing  daily symptoms.  Lupus' daily symptoms include fatigue; fever;joint pain, swelling, and stiffness; facial rash; skin lesions; kidney inflammation and more.\nTypical prescriptions for Lupus is ongoing corticoid steroids (Prednisone). Patients find after a year or two, steroid relief  diminishes for symptom management and pain control. The side effects and dangers from long term steroid use are well documented and can be severe. \nOne SLE patient suffers daily from kidney inflammation back pain  on top of swollen joints; another from constant open wounds totaling not less than 900sq cm on 85Kg patient. The wounds appear deep, painful, with nerve involvement.\n\nCommon SLE treatments are Methotrexate and Plaquenil  with Prednisone. Drugs' side effects are similar to chemo therapy (hair loss, nausea, dizziness, water retention, cellulitis, et.al) \nThese patients admit to 1-4 years use of Kratom supplements with benefits they're very afraid of losing. \n\nI hardly believe an herb such as Kratom is considered needing more strictly regulation than these strong and dangerous medications.(Methotrexate ,Plaquenil,Prednisone) \n\nI'm tired of repeated FEAR Monger arguments on abuse, addiction and dependence.(wrong for pain patients). There's no evidence that Kratom has ever been fatal, or in itself addictive. Conversely, more acceptable Rx medicines haveLD50s off the chart. Plaquenil has related cardiac deaths;  Prednisone's long term effects leading to irreversible damages/early death  are well documented; Methotrexate is so toxic to the body it's oft prescribed in bursts with drug vacations in attempts to avoid serious deterioration.\n\nActual FACTS = Kratom itself cannot be overdosed on and can't/hasn't EVER been fatal(confirmed see NCIH-PubMed). Some biased news accounts refer to \"blended\"; in combinations with; in persons with mental health issues; found with OTHER causes upon autopsy. \nThousands of years of Asiatic Kratom use, yet NEVER fatal.\n\n In a world where we haven't developed cures for many painful ailments, I refrain from judgment when a patient extols personal wonderful results from herbal supplements like Kratom.\n\nWe've long known of benefits in European countries from natural treatments as daily red wine for heart health. Yet we do NOT rule grapes a schedule 1 drug, although known to impair motor function/cognitive ability. \nIt doesn't  follow logically that other culturally practiced alternatives like Kratom or Kava be treated in such a manner.(sched 1)\nI discussed this DEA proposal with Kratom using patients, asking if they'd experienced purported hallucinogenic effects. Not one had. I was reminded though that nutmeg's reputedly been accused of having the same hallucinogenic effects. \n\nWhen a nation reaches the point that natural anti oxidants require a schedule 1 prescription to obtain, including wine; kava; Co-Q-10; amino acid supplements, etc. we've implemented a cruel disservice to thousands of sufferers.\n\nPatients use Kratom medicinally, similar to using vitamin C during winter cold season.\n\nI ask you TO NOT make this a schedule 1 substance in a knee jerk response to the unknown. What IS KNOWN is fact: Kratom alone in moderate doses is safe, is non toxic, is beneficial for many.\nThank you for your consideration.\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4619","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"India Paige","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I understand there is not lengthy  scientific studies on the effects or health issues related to Kratom, it seems clear there are some benefits people receiving from its use.

I am currently a graduate student studying school psychology and am also a NAVY veteran. I have to say, this plant has made my life easier by helping my back pain so much. I have had chronic back pain for longer than 10 years now. The doctors prescribed Tramadol for the pain. After taking Tramadol for approx 9 months, I had a grand-mal seizure, due to the medication itself, as it tends to lower the seizure thresh hold in individuals. \n\nSince I had such an adverse reaction to the medication, I had to stop taking it. This was when I looked into more natural ways of aiding in my pain, as I realized just how much damage a foreign substance (a man-made chemical substance) could actually do to my body. I soon found Kratom, and it has been a God-send. \n\nI know Kratom has positively affected so many people, including myself, and it would be an absolute shame to see this go away.

It gives me a lot of my motor skills back, motivation, easiness and much more pain relief that I've never been able to find in the past 10 years of my life. I discovered Kratom back in March of 2016 which was a true blessing for me and my family cause they've seen me in my darkest times.

Essentially, the aim is for people to stop \"self-medicating\". But people who are suffering with unbearable pain, depression or addictions, the uninsured and underinsured, and those who may have sought treatment and ended up worse for it, or people who fear retribution for having done illegal drugs; are going to instinctively seek to self-treat without medical supervision. They will readily seek out alternatives and things that fall into a category other than prescriptions and doctors visits, because they have lost confidence in those courses of action or do not have access to those services. In keeping Kratom unscheduled, you have an opportunity to leave something in place for those people who simply won't otherwise find relief.  The drugs are killing them, but kratom won't. There is scientific research as well as thousands of personal testimonies now to support that claim, on top of centuries of tradition in other cultures of regular, safe use. But it will only be useful to this population if it remains affordable and accessible in a preexisting, self-regulating open market as it is now. \n\nI am 44, a single mother, and self employed as an artist with a very small home based business. I have suffered from depression since early childhood. This wasn't anyone's fault, I had a healthy home and was not abused, it was just something different with my brain chemistry. By the time I was thirteen I was trying every substance I could get a hold of to numb the pain. I tried antidepressants at fifteen, long before Prozac became a household name. I've been on three or four SSRI medications without any positive effect whatsoever, but with devastating side effects.\n\nIn my twenties I drank astonishing quantities of alcohol, not knowing about my liver disease until I became sick, and was diagnosed at 30 with alcoholic hepatitis and hepatitis c. I stopped drinking quite easily when I received this diagnosis, because it was a matter of life and death for me physically. It was never about addiction as a disease with me;  I could stop using a substance without medical intervention. But I was constantly compelled to try and mitigate my crushing sense of despair and loneliness; unable to cultivate real relationships and using substances to feel the rush that other people get from normal activities and interactions with loved ones. \n\nUnsurprisingly, ten years ago when I was treated for carpal tunnel syndrome with opiate painkillers over the course of two years, I became very heavily dependent on my prescriptions. I wanted to stop using them, as they weren't treating the pain effectively, and just further damaging my health. I read everything I could find about kratom, from anecdotes to academic research, found vendors that were considered safe and reliable by others in the kratom community, and educated myself about potential benefits and hazards.  \n\nKratom was very effective for easing my discomfort from withdrawal from large quantities of oxycodone and morphine. But after a few weeks, something else started to happen. For the first time in years, I wasn't craving anything. Frequent back spasms and phantom pains in my limbs went away. I wasn't feeling soul-crushing depression looming around every corner. I no longer felt angry and deprived of the opportunity to drink, even socially, because I was comfortable with how I felt inside. I can't even remember what it feels like to crave a drink anymore. \n\nOver the past eight years I have struggled with financial and family circumstances like anybody else. But I have also remained completely sober, stopped smoking, and started being truly productive for the first time in my life. I have built a business around my craft and persevered in turning my creative passion into a career. I work long hours and support a household. I take kratom everyday to assist me in keeping the depression and anxiety that has plagued my life in check, and it rewards me by helping me stay entirely healthy and clean. I've had the amazing experience of not looking outside of myself for relief. \n\nUsing kratom as a daily supplement, I've never increased my dosage, never have had an adverse reaction or done something regrettable. It does not alter my consciousness or interfere with my ability to make rational decisions. I feel that kratom is a lifeline, both for myself and thousands of others, and that it is a choice that I make for myself, as a responsible adult, to lead the healthiest, most emotionally balanced life I've had so far.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19212","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Martha Proctor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This idea that banning a plant is the way to move forward is a huge mistake.  By banning this highly beneficial plant you will be forcing those who benefit from the use of the kratom plant to have to find other means to help them manage their pain.  The worst part of this is the fact that this will lead more of these people back to the highly addictive and far worse,very deadly opioids.  The use of kratom is not the danger that your organization is making it out too be.  This is not some random drug that people are using for recreation, although the prohibition of other plant, namely marijuana, has not worked and for that matter WILL NEVER WORK.  The banning of kratom will cause far more problems than it will ever solve.  Furthermore, the idea that a bureaucratic agency, one in which the people do not vote for, thinks that it is their right to dictate what an adult can or can't put into their own body is not only un-American, it makes our once great country no better than those dictatorships that we claim are so bad.  There does need to be regulation, along with age restrictions for 21 and up.  Prohibition failed with alcohol, it has been failing with the war on drugs, and it will fail with kratom.  This desire too ban drugs only leads to a thriving black market, which of course will lead to more violence, and worse deaths from opioids will skyrocket.  That blood will be on your hands, you will need to look in the mirror and live with the fact that you think you have a right to dictate to your fellow countrymen and woman, you do not have the right nor should anything from your agency be followed.  You have zero credibility with the American people.

I vote, pay my taxes and obey the law. I really appreciate the opportunity to comment on such a very important issue for me. Im against any scheduling or banning access to this plant called kratom.\nI came to learn about kratom about 2 years ago from online research for chronic pain that Ive been suffering with for many years. Doctors have prescribed many different pain and preventative meds that didnt work or would stop working after a while of use. Some had unbearable side effects that made them impossible to take. \nI suffer from back and joint pain sometimes severe enough to incapacitate me for days. Among the many doctors that Ive seen Ive been to several specialists for treatment with limited results. I have observed over the years that many of these same doctors are confused or even unwilling to help with treating chronic pain.\nWith kratom I can function and do the simplest of things in my everyday life because of the positive results I get without the negative side effects. I consider myself a responsible user of kratom and it gives me much better control of my chronic pain. My life would surely return to a daily painful and sad state if I were to lose access to kratom.\nIn conclusion I see kratom as a safe natural way to help with pain and no more harmful to me than my daily cup of coffee, Vitamins or low dose aspirin. It has definitely changed my life for the better and my family would certainly agree. Again I ask that you please do not ban or schedule kratom. \nThank You","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21506","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Keith Miller","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I submitted a comment previously and heard there was a problem with the system and it may have not been received by you. I didn't get a confirmation email so I am resubmitting this to you.\n\n I am a 51 year old male citizen of this country.\nSince the age of 13 I have been a working taxpayer until 2012 when I became disabled after surgeries on my spine.\nIn addition to six laminectomies I had a spinal cord tumor excised.\nFor years I dealt with the symptoms associated with severe spinal stenosis and cord compression. I have permanent spinal cord damage and as a result I have lost a lot of motor function in my hands and legs. Additionally I have severe back pain which keeps me from doing the work I have done for more than twenty five years. The surgeries I had have left me in more pain than ever before and so for the past four years I have been trying to figure out what I'm going to do with the rest of my life.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints is all of the medications I have been prescribed for all the pain and other symptoms I deal with every day. You see, pain meds just barely take the edge off. They help for a little while and then wear off and I have to take more. I was taking medications for easing the side effects of other medications. I was experiencing situational depression so there were more pills for that too. There was a point where I was taking thirty pills a day and I was miserable. My life was a mess and I didn't want to live anymore if this was as good as it was going to get. In fact the prognosis was even worse for the future.\n\nMy brother told me a friend of his might be able to help me if I was interested in looking into some natural herbal supplements.\nI was skeptical because how could there be anything better than a pill prescribed by a doctor? How could a little old lady down the street at the apothecary shop have anything better than Walgreens?\n\nI had nothing to lose by looking into it. I wanted so badly to feel better and so far nothing was getting me there.\nThat was three years ago when I was introduced to kratom. I started to do research and found a couple vendors online that sold various strains that historically have helped people all over the world feel better. \nBefore I knew it I was one of millions of people who found a way to feel better and manage my chronic pain without pharmaceutical drugs. I found kratom was helping me deal with my symptoms and my quality of life was starting to improve.\n\nI was eventually able to quit taking a handfuls of pills everyday and was able to make my 30 day oxycodone prescription last over two months. Eventually I was able to stop all prescription medications and deal with my pain naturally with diet, exercise and kratom.\n\nAll I wanted was to feel good again. What is the crime in that? This whole idea of making kratom a schedule 1 drug just doesn't make any sense to me. I have never experienced being high from using kratom. I don't think you could even take enough of it to even get high. Maybe someone has altered it in some way to cause it to become dangerous and give it a bad reputation. I think regulation makes a lot of sense. Banning it makes a lot of people regress back to a life of pain and agony and in many cases an early death. That has to mean something! There has to be someone left in your organization that still cares about the human element and cares about people! Will you please listen to what we are saying to you?\n\nI feel like the DEA and FDA are guilty of overreach in this hasty decision to ban kratom. We as citizens should have the right to make our own decisions as to what we put into our bodies. The war on drugs is a huge failure and kratom does not even belong in this battle.\n\nI don't even believe the government cares about the people. I don't believe the war on drugs is about health anymore. I think it's about keeping big corporations shareholders happy. The pharmaceutical companies don't like it when a natural plant cuts into their profits. There is no money in cures, only in sickness. The private prison systems don't like empty beds either and these kinds of thinks is what breeds corruption in our government.\n\nPlease do not take away our last hope of making the best of our situations we were dealt.\n\nI sincerely thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6017","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cory Johnson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After recently learning about this natural plant, I'm very opposed to the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.

In 2001 I was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis at the age of 29. Being an ex-collegiate soccer player, it was very difficult  to handle the fact that my body was turning against me. In addition to debilitating pain, I experienced severe depression, anxiety, and fatigue. Shortly after my diagnosis, my rheumatologist  prescribed NSAIDS and Vicodin. The NSAIDS were not effective, but the Vicodin gave me an escape mentally and emotionally, and I began using it irresponsibly. In 2003 I began Enbrel injections which addressed the pain associated with AS, however the depression and fatigue were still present. For the next 11 years I would use the Vicodin almost daily to battle my depression, knowing that I was playing a dangerous game that could ruin my life. Fortunately it never got out of hand, but it was almost impossible for me to see a future without a Vicodin Rx. That is an extremely scary thought. \n\nIn 2014 I contacted a Naturopath to see if there was an alternative anti-depressant that I could take instead of misusing Vicodin. He recommended Kratom. This has been a literal Godsend for me. I no longer take Vicodin, I have no need for anti-depressants, and the anxiety from the stress at work is held at bay because I have Kratom. Kratom also alleviates any pain when I \"over do\" any activities, such as soccer, golf, or Jui Jitsu. \n\nI can't overstate how important it is to keep Kratom legal. I would love to see testing and research completed on Kratom so that we are aware of any long term risks, as well as a thorough review of the benefits. Kratom does not belong on Schedule 1. The benefits that I experience are literally life saving. Please keep it accessible to the public. Feel free to contact me if I can offer any further information or help.  \n\nSincerely, \n\nTodd Eric Williams","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14095","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Todd Williams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"You've already dropped the ball by not rescheduling marijuana please don't do it with rescheduling  kratom I myself am presently taking opioids to help aleaviate pain due to suffering with RSD .

In my opinion, it should be widely publicized that there is a natural alternative to opioid pain relievers.  Kratom has few side effects for me, which I can't say about opioid drugs.  There is no need to make it only available with a prescription because its not THAT great.  Its not a wonder drug, and it needs to be studied much more before its considered a controlled substance.  However, there should be some regulation when it comes to purity.  The FDA should protect the consumer to ensure that the Kratom they use is not laced with ANY addictive drug or chemical, and that it isn't compounded with fillers.  I ask the FDA to keep Kratom available.

I do. When you become a parent, you experience a love like you've never imagined. I tell my kids they won't understand how much I love them, until they become parents themselves. Only then, you'll know the love a parent has for their child. You dedicate your life to raising this child and have so many hopes and dreams for him as you watch him grow. You do everything possible to keep him safe. Just as the love you have for him is unimaginable, so is the pain when you lose your child. I came very close to experiencing that pain, more than once. My son is a heroin addict. I've done everything possible to raise him to be an amazing man. But, it wasn't enough. When he was prescribed pain meds for injuries in an accident, he became addicted to them because he found they also helped him deal with his depression. When access to more ran out, he turned to heroin. He has been battling addiction for 10 years. My sweet, big hearted, wonderful son was no longer there, only a sick, frail, and troubled young man. He was lost in addiction. He was hurting and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't help him. He was in inpatient rehab several times, did outpatient treatment, NA, Oxford House. It wasn't enough. The depressiion haunted him. Heroin kept calling him back. I lived in fear every day, not knowing if he was OK. I never slept, was up crying and praying all night. When the phone rang, I was afraid to answer because it might be bad news. One night, I got that dreaded call. My son had OD'd. He was found in time and was resuscitated by medics, flown to the hospital, and admitted to ICU. He survived, thank God. He has 2 little boys that almost lost their father that night. I almost lost my baby boy. Even that close call was not enough for him to stop. When released from the hospital, he got his drugs. We went through years of this. He had also attempted suicide 3 times. I was glad whenever he was arrested because I knew he was safe in jail. He hated being stuck in the trap of addiction. He wasn't happy being an addict. It's not what he wanted for himself, but didn't know how to be free from the chains. He tried countless times to quit, but withdrawals were too much. Most addicts continue to use just to avoid withdrawals. That is the biggest reason for continued drug use and remaining in active addiction. My son found something that might help him through it, kratom. He used kratom to lessen withdrawal symptoms, and it worked! Kratom helped him through the worst of it, helped him quit, and it keeps the cravings for heroin away. He does not get \"high\" from kratom. He is not passed out, or struggling to stand up, or slurring words, or have a distant look in his eyes, all of which he did with heroin. He does not experience the side effects you cited. He does not abuse it, or engage in drug seeking behaviors like he used to. His mind is clear and he has a sense of well-being. He is finally happy again and enjoying life, free from the chains of opiate addiction. His depression has improved. He has once again become the person I used to know, the real person underneath the disease of addiction. I have my son back. His babies have their father back. My son is now active in helping to change our state laws regarding recovery treatment of people with deadly addictions. He is giving back and helping others. He is a productive member of his community. He is working and supporting his children. In the midst of a deadly opiate crisis in the US, why would you want to take away such a helpful tool that could actually save lives, without any scientific proof that it is harmful? Kratom is a benign plant that has been used for thousands of years. It not only lessens withdrawal symptoms, but also significantly decreases cravings for more harmful substances, including alcohol, which is legal and easily available. \n\nKratom also aids in relieving pain. I have another son, a young adult, who is battling cancer and experiences a lot of pain. He won't take prescription pain pills. He has adverse reactions to them, some he is allergic to. He has tried kratom to decrease his pain and it has proven to be quite helpful. He takes it only when his pain is at a high level, and kratom makes the pain tolerable. He is able to get out of bed. When my son is in agony from cancer pain, and going through terrible side effects from chemo, all I want is for him to be comfortable. Kratom does that for him. As a loving and dedicated mother, it is very difficult to see my children suffer. It's even worse for them going through it.\n\nScheduling kratom in classes I-V will not help anybody, at all, but doing so can hurt people. Kratom use is not a public health or safety issue. Our current opiate crisis, how we manage chronic pain patients, depression, anxiety, and PTSD are public health and safety issues. Do not take away a natural herbal remedy that can help people dealing with these issues. There are too many American lives at stake here.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22800","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Katherine Harris","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \n    My name is Jessica Clarkson.  I'm a single mom who works and goes to college full-time, studying psychology with a concentration on substance abuse and addictions.  I currently have a 4.0 in college and am in a national honors society.  I say this to show that I am a fully functional person in society.  I also use Kratom daily.  I completely disagree with the DEA proposal to make alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, Kratom,  a schedule-1 controlled substance.  \n    Kratom changed my life.  I started drinking Kratom tea 2 in a half years age at the recommendation of a close friend.  There are a few different reasons I tried drinking Kratom  First was because I was prescribed adderall and xanax for years from my doctor for ADHD and anxiety.  I had recently been winged off of it because I didn't want to take either anymore.  I felt it was doing me more harm than good.  But in doing that, I was in a deep depression.  This depression was only made worse from being drugged and raped by a guy that I worked with. I was not doing well at that point in my life.  I couldn't function.  My anxiety was so bad that I couldn't leave my own home.  I couldn't go in public without having a major panic attack. I wasn't me anymore. \n    After plenty of research, I saw there was minimal side effects and no risks.  It was just a herbal supplement and it was legal.  What could it hurt? So I tried Kratom.   It was the most amazing thing that could have happened to me. I felt like myself again.  I could function in society.  I could accomplish normal, everyday tasks without a panic attack.  Now I won't say that it completely dissipated my problems.  I still have issues with anxiety and other issues. But Kratom helps me push past them to be my self again. Kratom helps me sleep at night without nightmares and fear.\n    I'm begging you to reconsider this proposal to ban Kratom.  I know this ban is going to hurt a lot of people; more than it could save.  It's just a plant.  If yerba mate tea is legal, if alcohol is legal, if tobacco is legal- then why can't kratom be as well?\n\n    Thank you for your time and consideration,\n\nJ.

About 4 years ago I was prescribed Opiate-based (oxycontin) painkillers for a back injury.  After 2 years of prescribed usage the medication was negatively effecting my everyday life.  I attempted to stop taking the doctor prescribed opiates and went through terrible withdrawals.  After I couldn't function any longer due to the withdrawals I sought help from my doctor.  I was then prescribed Suboxone which helped eliminate the withdrawals.  After 1.5 years of suboxone treatment I attempted to stop usage as I had become dependant on it and felt it was again negatively effecting my daily life quality, the same as the aforementioned opiate painkillers.  Around this time I was introduced to the plant Kratom.  Not only did taking Kratom help ease me off the Suboxone, it also helped with pain management for my back injury.  After almost 2 years of daily Kratom usage my life is back to normal.  Kratom has helped me get back to living a normal life as a functioning, contributing member of society.  From my experience with Kratom and from the countless Kratom success stories I've heard I believe that further medical research should be performed before placing Kratom on the Schedule 1 controlled substance list.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

I am a professional Real Estate Appraiser, Mom of 2 and Grandmother of 2. I found myself addicted to opiates around the year 2,000. My family doctor prescribed hydrocodone 7.5. I had to go in the office every two months in order to obtain my refills and of course PAY. Fast forward to 2014 when he decides to retire (after the Government/DEA placed restrictions on pain med prescriptions). I could barely work part time for the past 7 years due to opiate withdrawl, yes I usually ran out. If I was sick from no pills there was no way I could function. I was filled with anxiety at the mere thought of checking my email and having to carry on intellectual conversation with any client. After google for a solution to my miserable life, I read about Kratom. I properly researched and joined as many online groups as possible to educate myself. I ordered some and to my amazement it helped. It helped my pain, my anxiety and I was able to get out of bed and be proactive. I now work full time and provide financially for my family. For the past two years my income has increased at least 50% each year and I do have tax returns to validate my claim.  \nI just also want to add that I had always heard about Heroin, growing up an in school whatever. I knew that was one substance that I would never touch or want to be around anyone who did. I had no idea that my own trusted family doctor supplied me with Heroin.

I would much prefer to see some hard science behind this and am glad the FDA Is now investigating. Having experienced  several surgeries, I know the downside of opiods. Kratom not only helped me  with the  post surgical pain but also with the related depression. I would definitely like to see it as a possible alternative  to opiods for pain management  and as a potential treatment  for anxiety and depression.  If it turns out it needs to be regulated, then fine. But  there appears to be too many positive stories about it to simply relegate it to \" no medicinal value.\"  We've already discovered this with the marijuana plant being classified as schedule I  yet it's active ingredient, THC,  can be prescribed by physician in the drug Marinol (schedule III).  At first glance, this action simply appears as a sellout to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nSo let us have kratom scientifically reviewed and have the science support  any regulation needed.  Otherwise we will  end up in the same situation we have with states legalizing marijuana, yet the federal government still considering it an \"Illegal\" drug.

We tapered the Vicodin and supplemented with kratom. After I was completely off pills I waited six months and tapered off the kratom. Kratom made getting clean a million times easier. I've been clean four years and would not dream of taking another opiat. Kratom help me a lot more than the doctors did.

I am 36 years old and have rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis.  I also have Chiari Malformation.  I deal with chronic pain on a daily basis specifically in my knees, left hip, right shoulder, neck, both hands, and left wrist.  I served eight years in the United States Army from 1998 to 2006 and have two children ages 14 and 10.  I work full time as a contract specialist for the VA.  For many years I had difficulty getting out of bed to go to work; especially during season changes.  Because I was so young I had difficulty getting doctors to believe there was something wrong with my knees.  I had my first knee surgery in August of 2013.  The pain increased dramatically after that surgery.  Several months later I was enrolled in Pain Management with the Cleveland Clinic.  I was given a heavy duty long-acting narcotic called Opana ER (oxymorphone).  When the pain management physician who had been treating me left the Cleveland Clinic, my care was taken over by a new provider in the practice.  He explained if I did not quit smoking cigarettes in the 14 days before my prescription was to run out, he would not refill it.  I did my best to quit cold turkey as he stated nicotine replacement therapy was not effective and would not support the use of the patch.  After I took the blood test to test my nicotine/cotinine levels, he refused to call me back.  My prescription ran out and I was thrown into withdrawal only seven days after I had surgery to remove Stage II melanoma.  I was so weak I passed out getting out of the shower.  My husband called the pain management practice and we were not called back.  I sent an electronic message asking to withdraw me from the program.  Soon after, I began a quest to find something completely natural to help me deal with my pain.  I found kratom and did research for several months before trying it.  In 2014 I started taking kratom.  I could not believe the relief I found.  I felt incredible.  In early 2016, I had another surgery on my knee.  This one was performed by the VA and included drilling, screws, and I was non-weight bearing for six weeks.  During my recovery I took kratom to assist me with my surgical pain.  It helped incredibly and reduced the amount of narcotic medication I took.  I truly believe kratom helped relieve my pain enough to be active in physical therapy and to get back to work sooner.  Since then, with the help of kratom, I have been active physically exercising on a daily basis.  In July 2016, I was hiking the Great Smoky Mountains on my honeymoon!  I have not missed work for pain since I began taking kratom regularly, no longer require a handicap placard and have not visited the doctor for pain related concerns in a year!  I cannot imagine how my life will change if kratom were to be scheduled.  I am a productive member of society who raises my children with a strong work ethic and this is because I take kratom to assist me.  It does not take all my pain away but it helps me maintain a life like a \"normal\" 36 year old woman.  I urge you to consider how a decision to schedule kratom will impact veterans and other hard-working individuals like me.  Not only does kratom help my pain, it also helps my depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  I no longer take my benzodiazapine anxiety medication and, with a kratom and therapy regimen, I rarely suffer with the negative effects of these disorders.  Kratom has helped so many veterans suffering with PTSD and pain conditions.  Please allow us to continue using this amazing and 100% natural plant to assist us in living the lives we deserve to live.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9132","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michelle Rhodes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helped my husband get through a very hard part of his life.

I have been to a doctor and have prescribed 800mg Ibuprofen for the pain.  Taken like twice a day, but I only took them when the pain was bad.  I was weary about taking these pills because of the damage it could do to my liver.  So one day I Googled \"Natural Painkiller\".  I seen links about Kratom.  I did further research and I started to purchase it online from a trusted vendor.  I use Kratom to deal with the back pain, I use it responsibly.  I have even introduced Kratom to my aunt who was hooked on heroin for years.  She says it works good. and she uses Kratom instead of the methadone which isn't natural.

The death toll from drug overdoses continues to rise. It seems that even though heroine and cocaine for example, are illegal, people still use and subsequently die from these drugs. \n\nBy making kratom illegal, that is 1 more controlled substance that can potentially imprison more Americans. With that said, many Americans use kratom to help with a variety of illnesses that they face. Kratom is not used recreationally, it WILL NOT make the user \"high\" or intoxicated. \n\nMany years ago I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). for about 2 years I took a variety of SSRIs which included many unwanted side effects and withdrawal symptoms, so I stopped taking them. I had been dealing with my GAD for about 6 years until I discovered kratom. I find that kratom helps with GAD and also gives me the energy that I need to function at work.

The goal of the people must align with that of its government; that is the social contract. We all must strive to make sound and just decisions in all matters. The scientific method has proven to be the most reliable way to do so. This plant, Kratom, has already shown anecdotal evidence that it may have immense medicinal value. Let us not take that lightly. Let us not give in to knee-jerk reactions and political pressures to act without reason. Let us keep the doors open for scientific study and also encourage and support it. Before we schedule any plant or compound we should have a valid and justified reason, beyond reproach, to do so.

Last June, I attempted suicide, and though Im grateful I did not succeed,  my life and body was left an unravelled mess, psychologically, emotionally, and physically. I went back to psychiatric counselling, and I finally got a diagnosis for a hormone disorder that has haunted me since high school, and is substantially responsible for the mood swings that make my education career so fraught with crisis. Though I am currently receiving professional treatment hormone therapy, the periodic relapses can be traumatizing, and even when I am not experiencing symptoms, the embarrassment I feel for my actions during those relapses is crippling. In the past, I took St. John's Wort for the feelings of sudden and deep depression that were symptomatic of my disorder, but that supplement can impact hormonal balance upsetting my prescribed treatment. St. John's Wort also requires regular dosage, and cannot be taken \"as needed\". Thus, I had to keep taking it and could not measure my progress. For these reasons and more, I started searching for a different supplement. After extensive internet research, I discovered Kratom and tried it in low dosages during periods of serious emotional upset. It gave me an elevated, energized feeling similar to the one I experience with St. Johns Wort, but it left no lasting delirium beyond the expirations of its positive effects, unlike  St. John's Wort. I didn't have to deal with the choice between having a personality dictated by medication or feeling depressed. \nHaving a hormone disorder also effected my reproduction cycles. With conventional birth control pills off limits on account of my treatment I resorted to an IUD which though effective produces abnormally painful cramps during my menstruation. While there are other supplements that can reduce cramps, Kratom is a very effective pain killer.\nThough in my experience Kratom has always been beneficial, I was initially unsure if all experiences were similarly positive. Not only did I not find any claims of a negative Kratom experience, I have found many prominent doctors who any decrying any  claims that Kratom possesses any capacity for adverse effects at all. According to Dr. Jack E. Henningfield of John Hopkins Institute, \nMany kratom-based preparations are available in the United States and used with little evidence of dependence or serious adverse events and no documented kratom-caused overdose deaths. Consumption does not typically interfere with work or social activities and commitments, and in fact are widely reported in the U.S., as in Southeast Asia, to contribute to work productivity, quality of life, and social relationships.\nKratom does not have potential for abuse. My experience is that at low doses it is similar to various herbal supplements and at high doses, I fall asleep with no side effects. \nIn the United States, the justice system espouses the sacrosanctity of innocence until proven guilt. Though future research may potentially show deleterious effects on individuals and society, at the moment, Kratom has no proven abuse potential and thus should not be scheduled as a schedule I substance. \nDuring my research I learned that much of the data that was cited in the letter of intent to schedule Kratom was based around poison control call statistics. By your agencys own admittance there were 660 Kratom related calls between 2010-2015. Looking at the American Association Of Poison Control Centres annual report, I found that there were over 1000 related to prescription estrogen supplements during that same time period.\n Overall, Kratom has greatly improved my well-being.

That is simply ridiculous!  You cannot get high on kratom. I know! This tree leaf is helping so many people in many different ways all without the possibility of death. You take too much you get blurry vision and really really nauseated. Kratom should be left alone! We were doing just fine with it before you got involved. The biggest argument is that it acts like an opiate. Yes it does! We get all the benefits without risking death! But \"acting like an opiate\"  is as far as it goes. The alkaloids in kratom connect with SOME of the receptors in the brain that opiates do, BUT NOT ALL THAT THEY DO. Kratom helps with pain of all sorts and some people even get the added benefit of their nervousness and shyness being lessened. \nLet me tell you my brief experience with kratom. I have chronic back and neck pain. I get pain pills but it takes more and more to do the same work as one pill used to do in the beginning. So I run out and have to go through opiate withdrawals. That really sucks BAD!  I was working out of town in North Carolina a few years ago and ran out of my prescription pain meds. I was freaking out. I had meetings to attend and work to do. I couldn't afford to deal with the pain and withdrawals. I searched Google for help with my situation and I kept seeing the same herbal item KRATOM. I did my research on kratom for the next hour. It sounded too good to be true!  I did a search in my area for kratom retailers and found one. I went there on my lunch  and bought some capsules of it. I took a few and just waited. Not expecting anything I was COMPLETELY AMAZED!  Not only did kratom ease my pain and suffering, it even got rid of the opiate withdrawal symptoms!!  I went back to the store and bought some more to get me through my week and trip back home. After I got home I started dear ching my locality for kratom sellers. And what I found out literally brought tears to my eyes. Kratom was banned in my state of Indiana a few years earlier! I couldn't believe it!  So in between my trips out of town I had to settle for buying pills from neighbors and friends when I ran out! I really looked forward to my trips to Charlotte, NC for work because I could buy and use kratom! I was no longer a slave to that damn pain pill. The freedom was a glorious feeling although short lived. After a week out of town I had to come back to the state that would not let me choose a herbal solution for my pain!! The lawmakers of Indiana bought into the hype and misinformation about kratom when they banned bath salts and that fake marijuana incense stuff. They just clumped kratom in with those killers!! \nPlease don't ban kratom across the US. I wouldn't wish what I have to deal with and go through not having access to kratom and doing whatever I have to do to get pain pills just to avoid withdrawal. PLEASE LET ME CHOOSE THE HEALTHIER ALL NATURAL SOLUTION FOR MY CHRONIC PAIN. PLEASE MAKE IT LEGAL IN INDIANA AGAIN. PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME KEEP USING THESE PRESCRIPTION PAIN KILLERS. I'M SO AFRAID I'M GOING TO ACCIDENTALLY OD WHILE TRYING TO TREAT MY PAIN. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE HAVE MERCY ON US. Kratom is a better option than Norco & Percocets, etc. I want my life back please. This \"hydrocodone haze\"  is changing me. Withdrawn, unmotivated, depressed, apathy. Kratom did not have those side effects. Please don't make us suffer.

In my opinion, banning the Kratom plant would be a huge mistake as it is presently used medicinally in the United States by millions of persons. \n\nThe \"war on drugs\" has been a disaster and severly curtailed police departments' efforts to focus on crimes that actually harm our communities. In my 20+ years as a law enforcement officer the number one complaint I have heard from those in the community that we serve is that more of our efforts are not spent on other crimes. Expanding the failed \"war on drugs\" will only place even criminalize and marginalize an even greater number of people and will further hamper the efforts of law enformcement to \"serve and protect\" the communities they work for. \nThe 'war on drugs' has had a catastrophic impact on the trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. We need to restore that trust, and allowing for research and regulation of drugs like kratom will be a significant step.\nHere are some other points as to why I vehemently oppose any move to criminalize Kartom.\n\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20272","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sean O'Neil","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my name is Misty and I suffer from fibromyalgia chronic pain and disc degenerative disease.

After I was court ordered to rehab I stayed cleaned for several months but my mind still constantly thought of pills, I did stay clean though. I drank lots of coffee during this time and it became my new vice. Around this time I found Kratom. It did what coffee did but felt a little cleaner (no jitters or crash). I found a new vice that was all natural and really worked for me in such a way I could keep my life manageable. That was almost 2 years ago. I have taken Kratom atleast 5 times a week ever since then. Today I have 2 years of clean time under my belt, my family, friends and relationships have been rekindled, I work a good job, rent my own house, pay all my bills, and most importantly, my girlfriend (the one that came back to me after finding sobriety) and I have big plans for our lives. I worry that if Kratom was made illegal that my mind would drift back to old habits of using pain pills. This is a terrible thought... I would really like to know I can continue to do what works for me (kratom) and see where I will be in another 2 years!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0553","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Thompson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This affects you and I - this rush to ban kratom without sound evidence of its supposed danger is clear evidence of our government's motives.

Kratom is NOT addictive and it does provide a host of benefits to those of us who have used it regularly. \n\nI started taking kratom in 2009 (7 years ago) and have used it regularly since. I am NOT an addict, nor am I a criminal. I have never been arrested and I've not even been suspected of any crimes. I donate regularly to organizations and charities to make this country (and world) a better place and I work 12 hours per day most days. And kratom allows me to keep up that pace (along with exercise and a solid foundation of nutrition). \n\nI ask that the DEA NOT schedule kratom as there is absolutely no reason to put this miraculous plant in the same category as other controlled substances. To be quite honest, anyone who has ever taken it laughs at the idea of comparing it to opiates and other street drugs that the DEA would like to categorize kratom with. \n\nLike so many others, kratom has saved my life in no uncertain terms. It's been a part of my daily regime for those 7 years and it has allowed me to (finally) lead a normal, healthy life after years of struggling with 2 main ailments: atrial fibrillation and inflammatory bowel disease. Both of those conditions kept me tethered to my bed and lead to massive depression as a result. \n\nI'm not suggesting that kratom heals people or that it's a panacea because I know it's not. It is, however, an amazing natural herbal supplement that helps people help themselves. Can we get over colds without Echinacea, zinc and Vitamin C? Of course we can. But having access to those supplements makes it easier and allows us to manage colds much better with them. Studies have proven that all of those supplements work against the common cold. That's why they remain available to everyone. \n\nKratom should be no different. There are no records of deaths or serious harm due solely to kratom and the millions of daily users all around the world are a testament to its safety and efficiency. \n\nScheduling this miracle plant would be a slap in the face to common sense and a slap in the face to Americans who are helping to manage their health with its use. So again, I'm asking the DEA and the FDA to recognize that kratom is a wonder plant, 100% natural, unadulterated&unprocessed. Americans should always have access to it as long as we consider ourselves a 'free' country. Thank you for your time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18259","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Valerie Hayes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Greetings,\n\nAs an occasional user of kratom, I find it's benefits to overcome chronic pain to be phenomenal.

I first discovered Kratom in early 2004 while looking for an alternative to narcotic pain medication for treating chronic lower back pain and arthritis. At that time it was relatively unknown in the US and identified as being from the coffee family. I began using Kratom at that time and found that it actually was helpful for pain relief with none of the side effects of opiod pain meds. It is not a substance that has ever resulted in my being intoxicated. In smaller amounts it is mildly stimulating at best similar to coffee. In higher doses it may be somewhat relaxing, however I can emphatically state it is not at all comparative to prescription drugs I have used in the past such as opiods, tranquilizers, sedatives, etc..- I have seen this misinformation in the media and unless it is somehow being tainted with other substances or drugs plain kratom is nothing like those drugs. It has been almost 13 years of my using kratom, and the past 7 include regular and almost daily doses. I am very active and also extremely health conscious. I have regular medical check ups and lab work done every six months for thyroid/cholesterol as well as liver/kidney function and all tests have been in normal range. I have had two shoulder surgeries in the past 5 years and used kratom rather than opiod medication throughout the recovery. I must really emphasize that kratom does not impair you and something like Benadryl has a much more sedating effect than kratom in my experience. Although the significant benefits of Kratom are considered mostly anecdotal I have seen it proven to be nothing short of miraculous in saving several people I know personally from long term and severe addictions when no other treatments had been successful. It saved their lives. Please do not schedule this drug as planned. It has benefitted myself greatly but even more importantly it has actually saved, and will save the lives of so many others, especially with the current opiod crisis in this country.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4673","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello I am a recovering heroin addict currently on methadone treatment in Bellevue Washington.

Before discovering kratom, I was addicted to opiates from the age of 18 to 24. The withdrawals I experienced from Lortab and Oxycontin when I could not get them were nearly unbearable. The addiction was both mentally and physically taxing as well as being detrimental to many relationships and friendships in its wake. I am indisputably not alone in these struggles. Upon discovering kratom, I was able to kick my habit smoothly and quickly, nearly painlessly. When I do not need kratom, I find that it is no challenge to stop taking it, and there are no withdrawal symptoms that I've experienced as of yet. My life has straightened out exponentially, my mind is sound and my pain is treated when necessary thanks to kratom. I do not see any reasonable reason to classify kratom as such a dangerous drug as heroin or any of the schedule 1 narcotics. It is natural, only an herb, and one cannot overdose from kratom alone. The worst that can happen is that the body will reject it. Anyone who has \"died from kratom\" may have had kratom in their system, but had myriads of other illegal drugs in their system as well. This is a harmless cure for pain that flies in the face of highly addictive and destructive drugs that are deemed legal even though they are absolutely harmful and soul-destroying. Please do not subject myself and the thousands of others that utilize this alternative to going back to being addicts. We are free.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7747","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chase Funk","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am in support of keeping Kratom readily available to the public.

My surgeon says I'm his poster child, he said, at first, that I wouldn't be able to go back to work. I'm afraid I'll lose my job because the pain without Kratom is too much to bear.

My family needs me to be at my best, and kratom makes me at my best. It helps me work more. Without kratom, I would not be able to work as much, or maybe not at all. Kratom makes me feel well enough to work extra shifts and earn more money. Kratom  makes a huge difference in so many people's lives, they just want to be able to take care of themselves naturally. If one can take valerian root and turmeric, than one should be able to use kratom, natural herbs should not be banned, if they are safe. Kratom does not hurt people it only helps them. I think that a ban on kratom would ruin many lives because some people would have uncontrolled symptoms, and they may commit suicide or hurt themselves. Kratom only makes people feel motivated and happy, it does not cause any psychosis or aggression. Kratom is an innocent victim in the war against opiates, which kratom is not. Kratom has already become a necessity for many people, and taking it away will have terrible consequences. Please do not ban kratom, or we will have a major crisis on our hands.

I mean simply just not profitable enough to bring to market in the US) \n\nI am well aware that there are many examples of downright DANGEROUS substances such as the fentanyl analogs that are in circulation as counterfeit painkillers and heroin that should be justifiably banned to save lives. But there are many other gray area compounds that have not harmed anyone (like kratom) and unscgeduled benzodiazepne and antidepressant type substances that provide releif for responsible adults who use them for their therapeutic benefits which are being lumped together with more dangerous things, \n\nThe DEA should not seek to ban ANY substance UNTIL there is sufficient proof that the substance in question poses a specific threat to the public in order to be banned. Some may disagree by saying it is wrong to wait until someone dies to outlaw a substance, but lots of people die EVERY DAY from drugs that are already approved and continue to be prescribed. So I hope this message reaches you, and you understand that in this modern age where one person has access to all the information that a Dr prescribing a medicine has, free adults should be able to choose which supplements/drugs/herbs they want to consume.

Although there are a small number of deaths in recent history in which kratom was consumed by the victim, it would be unfair to attribute these to kratom. In all but one case these deaths can be attributed to the presence of other substances that were also ingested. In no case has kratom ever been shown to be the cause of death, or even a contributor. If someone had coffee earlier in the day and died of a heroin overdose later, you wouldn't blame the coffee. So why blame kratom when someone dies after having consumed several illegal substances alongside it?\n\nNot only does this make no sense, but banning kratom will turn its 3 to 5 million consumers into felons. America already has the world's highest prison population, with a substantial percentage being non-violent drug offenders. People like me, who are simply trying to cope with devastating health issues, will find ourselves with two options: continue taking kratom anyway and potentially share a cell with a rapist if we are caught, or go back to suffering from a disability that is otherwise unmanageable.\n\nLike most responsible kratom users, I am definitely in favor of regulations that would prevent adulterated products from being sold to consumers. Similarly, I can see the validity of arguments in favor of keeping kratom out of the hands of minors and ensuring responsible advertising. However, it is vital that kratom remains easily accessible to those in need. Scheduling kratom, much like scheduling coffee, would place needless restrictions on an important tool, making it inaccessible to a large number of people.\n\nFor these reasons, I strongly urge the DEA to avoid making kratom a controlled substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10122","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Megan Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"DEA, \n\nI believe there should be much more scientific study on the beneficial uses of kratom.

I ignored it, as most do, until it was unbearable. Went to the doctor and got antibiotics to help. Unfortunately for me, I had a bad reaction to the Cipro and my whole body hurt in horrible pain. My antibiotics were switched the day after and I went on my way to heal the kidney infection.\n\nUnfortunately, my body itself never rebounded. Sure, the intensity of the body wide pain subsided, but it never went away. Every single action I took (and take) causes reverberating pain in the form of soreness and swelling that lasts for 2-3 days. Walk the dogs around the block? The following day my right leg would be so swollen I wouldn't be able to step out of my bedroom. Chop vegetables? Purple hand with unbend-able fingers. The pain feels like my muscles are literally being torn asunder.\n\nI always liken it to when we would have double-day football practice. Where your muscles felt torn and swollen. But imagine it never gets better. It always lingers. And you never get stronger or used to it.  Always the ache, the spasms, the dread.\n\nFor some reason, it affects my right side worse than my left. I stopped being able to use my right arm for .. anything really. The pain was unbearable and my hand was purple and swollen. I couldn't figure out why, turns out it is from typing. See, Im a web developer. I also loved to draw and 3D model. Oh and lets not forget play games. So many things I'm undo able now. So much taken away.\n\nI tried everything the following year. I literally broke our bank account looking for a diagnosis. My life was spiraling out of control because I could no longer work, draw, move, play, etc. But I tried to stay hopeful. I learned how to write left-handed, I switched to a trackball, learned to type with just my left hand, etc. I even programmed some addons for games I enjoyed to limit my hand usage so I would have something to put my mind to in order to ignore some of the pain I was (am) in. \n\nEventually, after many, many tests,  I was given hydrocodone to help me walk and type. It worked pretty well and I was able to resume work part time as I already worked from home. I Just needed help getting through the pain so I could type. I retained one of my local clients who I still work with to this day. \n\nI found a steady doctor to help manage and she continued the hydrocodone prescriptions. Unfortunately, she steadfastly refused to increase them from the 7.5mg they were at. As their effectiveness waned, I pleaded with her. I begged. But as increasingly more diagnostics turned up unknown, she stopped caring about the excruciating pain I experience. So, I eventually stopped asking for them. They weren't denting the pain anymore, I just gave up doing anything. We moved in with my wife's parents because I could no longer work without pain management. \n\nLast year however, behind tears of pain, I was desperate and ordered something called Kratom from the internet. I did not think it'd work, but it was in the chronic pain forums as helping. Surely by now you can tell it worked well enough or I wouldn't be setting myself up for misery typing this to you. \n\nKratom doesn't work as well as the hydro for me. But it has enabled a portion of my life to be lived. I can work to some capacity, still hurts a lot, but at least I can do it. My wife and I have a 1 year old little boy now too. We are still living at her parents house as to help me with my disabilities, but also to help us with their grandson. Without Kratom I couldn't lift him, play with him, or be there at all. Let alone partake in creating him.\n\nI'm sure I'm not alone in saying my life, what little is left, will be completely destroyed should you ban Kratom. I just want to be able to hold my son. I just want to be able to produce what little I can. So many of us must bare our souls to ask for such simple desires. I hope if anything, this campaign sheds light on the millions suffering and we work together towards better treatments.\n\nPlease don't ban it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18281","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Durbin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I am a 62 year old mother of three grown children, and grandmother to seven grandchildren. I have health issues that include chronic pain, depression, anxiety, and obesity. I have several herniated discs in my lower back, and need to have surgery to fix them, but due to the obesity the surgery is out of the question. All that can be done is to take pain medication which includes opiates, and muscle relaxers. After several years of opiate use, I realized I was addicted, and was sick from it. I researched natural things that would help with withdrawing from the opiates and found an abundance of positive and promising information about an herb/plant called kratom. I read that it would ease the withdrawals. I read that it was a natural alternative to pain medicine, and that it was helping people with anxiety and depression also. I researched several reputable vendors and found one that had excellent reviews from the public, and I ordered some kratom. When I received it, I mixed a tiny amount with juice, and drank it. It was about a teaspoon. With that first dose, I left the world of opiates behind me. I quit cold turkey and had absolutely no withdrawal symptoms. I had tried to quit pain pills in the past, and was very sick for at least a week, so I knew what it was like. I had zero sickness. I also had no pain. At all! That was three years ago. I use kratom daily. One teaspoon twice a day in my juice. It does not get me high, nor could it even if I wanted it to. It has kept me pain and drug free for three years. I feel like it has given me my life back. I am able to play, and do things with my grandkids I wasn't able to do before. It is very exciting that it's a 100% natural product. I cannot imagine how my life will turn if it is made illegal. It is beyond me that it could even be made illegal. If it was to be made illegal then a lot of people will be forced to become addicts again. It is my wish that kratom remains legal, and that there is even more research into how this plant can replace addictive pain medicine.

Kratom has simply been pivotal in saving me from the opiate plague that is out of control in this nation. Kratom also helped address the reasons that I became addicted in the first place. Kratom allowed me to feel energy and the sense of well being that I had lacked before. Kratom has helped me stay sober, happy and productive. I would likely be in jail on drug charges or dead from an overdose if I had not been introduced to kratom. My family and friends have been amazed and thankful upon seeing the difference in my attitude towards life and robust health since I started consuming kratom. It would be a grave mistake to take away or limit the benefits kratom bestows upon people. It would take away the chance for others like me to return from the horrors of drug addiction. \nHere is the message I wish to impress upon you as being very important to the well being of millions and the uncounted others whose lives will yet be saved by kratom. \n1) Kratom consumers strongly object to scheduling kratom controlled substance . Kratom definitely does not fit into the definition of a schedule 1 substance and could very well be a weapon against the opiate plague and give people an option to not experience narcotics in the first place, therefore avoiding the danger of getting caught up in the opiate plage themselves. This plant needs to be researched extensively and I know we will find MANY vital benefits from this plant.\n2) Kratom is safe. Kratom consumers know this and the scientific community knows this too. It is as safe as coffee and much safer than many of the over the counter products freely being sold right now that regularly kill thousands. Do not make it so that we have to go to a doctor and be prescribed kratom. This would only make for further financial burdens that many kratom consumers simply don't have the income to go through. Many cannot jump through the many hoops that would be required to obtain a simple plant. This would not be fair to the public at all.\n3) I do support MINOR regulations on kratom. Proper labeling , quality standards , age restriction for 18 and older, and MINOR and I mean MINOR taxation is fair. It is simply all that is needed and doing more than this would only serve to to create additional hardships for the many whom are poor , impaired or disabled. \nThe whole concept of seeing kratom as a drug instead of beneficial herb and adding kratom to the failing war on drugs is obviously terribly unjust. Please show the American people that you care for their well being instead of people to be exploited. Please show us that the FDA and DEA are responsible agencies that deserve our support instead of our resistance and oversight. This is your chance to win the American people's trust again and be proud of your work. Don't squander this chance. \n\nWith all my heart,\nBrann Adams","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1448","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brann Adams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I am a 57 year old male with back and leg injuries and my wife has lung cancer and trigeminal neurolgia.

To schedule this plant from the coffee family would open a doorway that far exceeds the authority of any government or it's agencies, in that, it would allow such entities to continue to decide which lifeforms that have developed over a four plus billion year evolutionary process are viable and which are not. Some would argue, only God has such an authority and I am most certain, no member of society can claim such a designation of authority. \nFurther, all studies performed on this plant have concluded it should be studied more, not less and less study would result should Kratom become a schedule one substance. Science has been perfectly clear on the safety of Kratom and no known deaths exists that can be attributed solely to it. On the other hand, the same cannot be said for many of the synthetic drugs made by the pharmaceutical industry, so perhaps DEA should encourage more regulation of that industry  It would also be wise to keep in mind that, Kratom is NOT a synthetic substance, but the opposite. To take action that would effectively ban it would be akin to banning tea, coffee, or any number of plants people have been using and/or studying throughout human history for no other reason than, \"Rumor has it\" and it's possible to do so under current law.  I'm referring of course to the CDC Poison Control Center report that amounts to nothing more or less than rumor.

While I cannot speak for its efficacy as a medicine, (I have not used it) by and large the reasons given for the scheduling are deplorable. In recent years, twenty people have possibly died from kratom and 600 poison control calls have been made in its name. Meanwhile thousands people have actually died due to substances with lesser drug schedulings in recent years, namely, prescription opiates, alcohol, and benzodiazepines.\n\nWhile there may be reasons for kratom access to be limited to those 18 years or older, placing kratom and its chemical constituents in the same drug schedule as heroin would be a tragic mistake to the detriment of thousands of kratom users looking to stay away from undeniably more dangerous prescription drugs. \n\n ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4091","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Gray","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have gout.  My doctors prescribe me expensive pills that I am required to use daily.  A friend of mine from work introduced me to kratom about 5 months ago.  Since i have been taking kratom I have not had any gout attacks.  Gout is quite painful and i would get attacks just about every week.  I also sleep better at night taking kratom. I don't need energy drinks and I am more efficient in general.  I personally do not feel like kratom should be illegal.  It has helped me in a lot of ways.  Drugs like Meth, cocaine, ecstasy and so forth have understandable reasons why they are illegal.  I have never experienced any type of symptoms that would even compare to the side effects of other drugs.  I won't be sneaking around in back alleys to buy it.  I'm not selling my goods and possessions to buy more of it.  I am able to focus and perform well on my job.  I function normally in public and do not experience paranoia.  I hold intelligent conversations and bathe regularly.  This is not a street level junky drug.  Its genetic make up is comparable to a coffee plant and it does not incite mischievous behaviors or cause a person to become delinquent.  The pain management benefit is the main reason i use it.  When i have gout in my foot or elbow the pain is unbearable, but with kratom i never have the attacks.  I can't help but feel like pharmaceutical companies are pushing for a ban because this works and helps people.  Please reconsider taking this accessible help away from us.  it boggles my mind how many states are legalizing marijuana which does cause some of the above mentioned issues, but we are going to lose kratom which does not.

When I came to I had no that my life was about to change. Thankfully I was wearing my seatbelt, but that didn't wasn't enough to stop me from loosing everything. I went from having a full time job as a financial planner to not being able to get out of bed. I was diagnosed with Neuropathy in February of 2013, and then Fibromyalgia in October of 2014. In the first 6 months after my accident my first dr had me so amped up on pain medication that I couldn't function, my parents thought I was taking drugs on the side. The truth was I had even stopped drinking because I was so scared because I had heard that mixing Fentyl and alcohol could kill you. My dr had me on 100 mct of Fentyl, 30 mg of Oxycodone 3-4 times a day, Gapapentin am 300mg/ mid-day 400mg / bed time 900mg, Valium 90mg, Adderrall 60mg. In this 6 months I couldn't function, I was lost, I eventually ended up in the ER with a shot to reverse the narcotics, and the ER drs believing I had a drug problem for 2 reasons, they didn't run a back panel to verify the adderral and second they thought I was over medicating. When they realized I wasn't, well I'll skip ahead. My first dr that over medicated me red flaged my chart despite other medical records including her own that contradicted her Flag that I had a drug problem. She was covering her mistakes, but let me assure you that after that shot and those narcotics left my body that was the last time I allowed any dr to take control over me. \nTwo weeks later I was introduced to Kratom, and I have never looked back. Since then (3 1/2 years) I research every single vitamin, medication and food that goes into my body. Since I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia I have also been diagnosed with Lupus and MS, I have gotten off all narcotics, Valium and Gapapentin. I do still take aderrall, I have narcolepsy so it's kinda essential. I feel that my background is extremely important so you can better understand where I am today. True, I can't work a full time job, but considering my conditions I should be bedridden. Because of Kratom I am able to paint, I also do photography, yoga, meditation and I'm doing a chronic pain study at my drs office. I don't drink, nor do I do drugs. Kratom has given me a chance to live, to function without the side effects, the cloudy head, the withdrawals that opiates give you. Do I still have pain? Yes, but I get by, with out Kratom what point is there to go on? I did everything right in my life, I still lost everything, now I am a burden on my parents because I lost my life savings. I'm begging you to please don't take away the only dignity that I (and many others) have left and speaking for myself I don't want to burden my family anymore by having them physically care for me to. I like so many others are sentenced to a lifetime of pain, please take this into consideration. Thank you.

I am a 33 year old professional employed full time at a non-profit in Columbus, OH. I began taking kratom four years ago after learning about it from a close friend who had been having some success using kratom as a supplement to help alleviate some issues surrounding her Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Although I am very cautious about medication and supplements, I had been having my own issues with depression and anxiety for many years and was unable to reach the level of comfort and productivity I was looking for despite engaging in traditional methods such as therapy and pharmaceutical medications. In the past four years, I can say that kratom has been nothing short of a huge help to me in dealing with my various medical issues and I have not experienced any noticeable side effects or detriments. On top of this, as I began to engage with the kratom community following the original DEA notice several months ago, I have discovered that so many more people than I imagined have had similar success stories often dealing with even more serious disorders or addiction issues, which are of course incredibly important issues right now. I understand that kratom is not a miracle cure and I understand that it is important to be cautious, but I truly believe a Schedule 1 ruling would be a disaster for myself and many people. I have also seen a huge willingness within the kratom community to work with agencies like the DEA or FDA to make supplements like kratom as safe and understood as possible. Given all of this, I urge the DEA to reconsider their decision and to take this very real opportunity to work with organizations like the American Kratom Association that represent people this ban would effect to create the type of positive change that we can all get behind. \n\nThanks very much for your time,\n\nJim Calder","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5395","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Calder","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was an opioid addict for 12 years\n. it ruined my life.

Some strains make people feel energized and alert, increase desire to exercise, and promotes general well-being. Other strains help people relax or get a good night of sleep.\n\nAnd it does all of this without destroying the bodies of the people who choose to take it, similar to Marijuana. \n\nMeanwhile alcohol and big pharmaceutical companies pump out drinks and drugs that kill a few people an hour and wreck countless families, and are incredibly easy to go out and acquire perfectly legally, yet you won't find Vicodin or Percocet on the Schedule 1 drug list, or any awful social stigma attached to alcohol.

Please allow me to explain a little of my history. I have already at 43 had both of my knees replaced. I have constant pain in my lower back. I also had migraines for many years. My issues though came not only with physical pain but also with alot of mental. You see, when i was 19 a guy put a gun to his head and told me to watch, i did. My dad worked for the prison system and retired a decorated guard. On the outside to everyone he was a highly respected man, to us at home, he was abusive and a highly addicted man that turned his daughter into his drug dealer. Then in 2008 i lost my brother to an overdose, in 2009 i lost my mom to cancer, in 2010 i lost my husband and in 2015 i lost my boyfriend. Mentally I gave up. Because you see when that guy pulled that trigger, not only did he take his life, he took some of mine with him. I got into drugs and got addicted to everything I touched. I was no longer Teresa. For the next 18 years, I was known as addict. I robbed my son of a mother, my mom of a daughter, my sister of a sister. I was drowning and i didnt care anymore. I begged God to take me and didnt understand y he didnt. I knew suicide was against my bible-or was I too weak to actually do it??? So I had to prove to myself that I wasnt weak. So i downed the whole bottle and just ended up puking for the next 12 hours. I knew then God had a plan for me, I just didnt know what. I tried getting clean and got on suboxone and did that route for six years. Until i decided I was going to try this on my own. I did it for 6-7 months. But relapse was inevitable for me. The depression and pain was hand in hand. Ibuprofen wasnt doing it anymore and my depression was backing me into a corner. Then my friend introduced me to Kratom. The first time I sampled it I knew this was a journey worth exploring. I have a different outlook on life. I look forward to getting up everyday and living life again. Im in groups where we support each other. I feel more love from strangers than some people I know personally. We all help each other. Kratom not only helps with our ailments but brings people together. What can be wrong with that? I have many friends that are hooked on drugs still and cant get clean because they dont have insurance or cant get a bed at a rehab. Ive told them also about Kratom. I want it to be here for them when they are ready. They matter. We matter...Kratom matters to all fighting.....Please I ask that you reconsider making this a schedule 1 drug. You will be destroying many lives. Do the research first. What's the hurry? Heroine is still on the street. Crack, cocaine, acid, and many others that really do make people \"high\" and sick are flooding our streets and killing our people. This is a plant that makes it possible for many, many people with pain, chronic pain, and addiction to get up everyday and focus like normal human beings. Please, please listen to us as we scream out for you to hear our cries. Even our soldiers are crying out asking for the very right to do what they themselves went on the front lines to do, fight for this very same freedom. LAND OF THE FREE SHOULD MEAN WHAT IT SAYS!! NOT JUST BE WORDS TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY LOOK APPEALING ON PAPER AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE COMING DOWN TO WHEN OUR RIGHTS TO RELIGION AND NOW A SIMPLE PLANT ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY.

I am twenty four, and I am a customer service representative at a technology company that is a leader of the industry. I also am a full-time single mother, the most joyful responsibility life has to offer.\n\nI was diagnosed at age 15 with depression and bipolar disorder, which has carried on through my teenage years, into my adulthood. I refused to take medication as a young teenager, because I  was afraid I would lose myself. Fast forward to 2016 and I am currently taking one antidepressant and one mood -stabilizer. These are both very effective, but do not treat other problems I have. \n\nFor one, I experience heavy fatigue daily, and used to have to get through my days with head-splitting migraines. I am afraid of social situations with other people, and often have a hard time going out in public because of my fears. Once I started using kratom, I no longer has any migraines and experience no more fatigue. I have a great amount of energy that no energy drink gas given me. I'm not jittery or nauseated and I feel cool, calm and collected. This is very helpful being a single mother. I can play with my toddler-aged son endlessly and take him on walks and teach him new things whereas before I was fatigued and unmotivated to do anything of the sort.\n\nIn 2015 I was hospitalized on and off and in and out for a cyst that ruptured on my ovary. It was the worst pain I'd ever experienced in my entire life, and it did not subside for about eight weeks. My doctor kept prescribing me hydrocodone 10mg, which was very strong, and i developed a habit for, but it never really took away the pain. After about three weeks, my roommate's sister introduced me to kratom - and at first I was skeptical, but tried it anyway. At this point, I would have done anything to reduce the amount of pain I was in.\n\nAfter using kratom regularly, I started to feel less in pain and was able to regain my ability to go back to work and take care of my son. I started to look into it more and more as time wore on and realized that this is a miracle plant here on our Earth that has the ability to help this who need it! This isn't a synthetic, dangerous drug but a plant with medicinal properties.\n\nThe most amazing thing I found as I was reading about kratom was that opiate addicts were using kratom to suppress their withdrawal symptoms, and this led me to read several significant success stories. My father died when I was 17 due to a heroin overdose. Heroin and opiates became evil to me. I hated them and was angry that they took away my dad's life. He no longer would have a relationship with his grandchildren. He missed my graduation and prom, triumphing through college, and all of my other huge life events. Because of a hideous drug that is masking its rounds to reach us at our most vulnerable and drain the life from completely. \n\nI always think to myself, that if kratom has been accessible seven years ago when my dad passed, maybe he would be alive today. I think of all the other addicts that use kratom and have become completely clean! It is amazing and truly shows the beauty of this planet's natural resources.\n\nHere I am at twenty-four. I live in my own apartment with my son, I can socialize and get to know other people comfortably without thinking I'm going to panic, I'm able to get up and go, go, go because it reduces pain in my neck. I also have some sort of inflamed tendon in my arm that is so painful I wake up crying in the night because it hurts so bad. I brew a cup of tea and drink it and then go back to bed. And I'm fine. \n\nI've never experienced any kind of negative side effects from kratom and I trust it much more than most synthetic medicines. I pray to God that it does not get banned - not only for ME, but for everyone who needs it. Especially those succumbing to a dark world of addiction. This kratom medicine saves lives.\n\nI genuinely believe that this plant, among others, can start the process of ending addiction and healing us as people.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBrianna Moss","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12754","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brianna Moss","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir/Madam, I have already sent in my comment, but wanted to add that, because Kratom lessened the nicotine withdrawal, I have recently been able to quit smoking.

I oppose the DEA's decision to place Kratom on the Schedule 1 controlled substance list. \n\nI first heard about Kratom by accident but was intrigued by some of the life-changing stories I came across.  I've tried high and low doses of multiple strains with varying results.  I prefer a low dose (4g) because it helps me focus at work and it's especially great for cleaning and doing menial tasks.  The high dose (8g) makes me more social and slightly elevates my mood but the effect is ever so subtle.  I've got friends that use Kratom as a sleep aid to help them fall and stay asleep.  They tell me they've never slept better and I've always been an insomniac so I was excited to try it for sleep purposes.  However, regardless of dose, Kratom keeps me awake so unfortunately, it doesn't help me as a sleep aid. \n\nFrom my experience, Kratom is a safe drug and adults should have the choice to use it legally for recreation.  Statistically, it's less dangerous than alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, McDonalds (or any fast \"food\") and probably most pharmaceuticals on the market today.  The biggest opponent of Kratom is Big Pharma.  They are frightened that Kratom, a safe, cheap, pain reliever, will eat into their opioid sales.

I found out about Kratom after scouting the internet, looking for something to help lower back pain. I have had lower back pain issues for a while now, stemming from an old High School sports injury. You see, I had previously been prescribed Hydrocodone and Tramadol. I became addicted to Hydrocodone, without it I would feel lethargic and begin shaking. When on it, the pain would subside, but I couldn't be myself. I would become drowsy, and emotionally void. I went from one pill, to four or five a day.  It was slowly ruining my life. I found a Kratom website after looking for something else to help with the pain. Kratom helps with my pain, and gives me none of the side effects the pills gave me. The reported \"high\" is no different than a cup of coffee gives. All I need is one teaspoon a day and I am fine. Kratom has literally saved my life. There are countless stories of former heroin addicts whose lives have been salvaged by Kratom. Kratom has become a life saver for tens of thousands of people across the U.S alone. With a person lost to pill addiction every 19 minutes, Kratom could be a miracle plant, but won't if we ban everything that isn't a pill prescribed by a Doctor. \n\nThanks for reading and best wishes,\n\nHunter Smith","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16499","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Hunter Smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Don't ban Kratom","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6706","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Randi Finley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I work with people who are struggling with addiction.

I have  suffered from chronic pain after a neck injury I sustained when I was 20, and have been prescribed oxycodone, tramadol and hydrocodone intermittently when the pain came to be too much. However, I don't enjoy taking these because I end up tired and woozy. I found kratom about 2 years ago, and haven't taken a pill since. I don't get high off of kratom, nor do I wish to. I just want to remove the pain without introducing any other negative side effects. I don't see the wisdom to banning a natural, safe, herbal remedy when opiate addiction is reaching epidemic levels in this country. There have been, to my knowledge, zero deaths directly caused by kratom use. There are hundreds of yearly deaths due to caffeine overdose, thousands due to alcohol and tobacco usage, and tens of thousands due to legal painkillers like OxyContin. Kratom is significantly less likely to do harm than any of these. On days where I don't use kratom, I don't notice any withdrawal effects; all of those substances I listed above do cause them. I strongly recommend that we don't rush into anything without proper research. The kratom ban will do much more harm than it will do good.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3657","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life.

I am writing to encourage the DEA to not place the kratom plant on the list of schedule one drugs. I will start with the personal details to explain how I arrived at being a kratom user. For half of my life I have been a chronic pain sufferer. At the age of 13 it began as a single herniated disk. Thirteen years later I now have 2 herniated disks, several bulging disks, degenerative disk disease, arthritis, cervical and lumbar radiculopathy, occipital neuralgia, and in addition also suffer from moderate depression and anxiety. My issues are separated into two groups: past the point of treatment, and too soon for treatment (meaning surgery, everything else has been tried and has failed). So all that can be done for me at the moment is pain management. Which is unfortunate because I do not like the idea of being on pills for the rest of my life (there is a history of addiction in my family), and Ive tried all of the more conservative methods of treatment; but my stubborn, broken body refuses to obey. So, while I did not like having to take pain killers, or deal with their side effects, I dutifully took the amount as prescribed by my doctor. While I would not say I was in any way pain free, the medication kept my pain to a manageable level. That is, until the CDC released their new guidelines for opioid prescribing. Less than 2 weeks after the guidelines went into effect, my doctor cut me off (cold turkey) from my medication citing the new guidelines as the reason. I feel it important to mention that I was on a very low dose of hydrocodone, that I took only twice a day. I never breached a pain contract in 13 years. I never failed a drug test, never missed a pill count, never tried to fill a prescription early. I was a model patient. I was devastated. The one and only thing I had to keep my pain at a manageable level was now out of my reach. A little pill shouldnt be able to do so much, but I realized just how much it was helping me when it was taken away. Thankfully, I was on too low of a dose to deal with any kind of withdrawals, but it did affect my pain levels dramatically. I couldnt work. I couldnt sleep. I couldnt do any household chores. Or take my dogs for a walk. I was effectively bedridden. Then one day, as I was browsing the page of an online chronic pain support group Im in, someone posted an article about the effectiveness of kratom for dealing with pain. My curiosity piqued, I did a little research. And while I fully expected the claims to be too good to be true, I had nothing to lose, so I placed an order and patiently waited for it to arrive. On arrival day, I opened it up and took a very small amount. I will never forget the moment that I felt my pain just melt away. I quite literally cried tears of joy. I didnt feel high, or loopy, or tired, or lethargic, or crabby like I did with the hydrocodone. I just felt like a better version of myself, a version of myself with less pain. I hadnt felt this close to pain free since I was a preteen, which is a big deal for me as I dont really remember what life was like before pain. It was like a weight that had been lifted. I started being active again. Immediately began looking for work, knowing I would now have the stamina to do so. I could finally keep my house clean without being in tears from the pain. I could play and exercise with my dogs. The one and ONLY negative side effect I have experienced is the occasional nausea. But compared to the multiple pages of side effects you get with medications, Ill take a little nausea over that. I was even able to stop taking the antidepressants I was on. So, you could rightly say I was on cloud nine! So imagine my horror when only two weeks later the news broke that kratom was about to be banned. To say I was devastated would be quite the understatement. First the CDC, now the DEA. I feel as though these government agencies are targeting people like me. Why do they want to punish us? We didnt choose this kind of life. I certainly did not. I was born with this broken body, I didnt choose it, or even do something to cause it to happen. But I absolutely should have the choice of how to deal with it. And with the CDC guidelines, and the DEAs possible banning of kratom, that choice is being taken from me. And quite frankly, Im angry about it. No agency should be able to tell me how I handle the excruciating pain I live with every day. Maybe if those in charge had pain like mine they would think differently, though I would never wish this on anyone. But I do sincerely hope the DEA does their homework this time around, and listens to all the science that says that this plant is safe, non-addictive, and has multiple beneficial uses. It has also been used for millenia around the world. People around the world have always recognized its safety and efficacy. So who are we (the U.S.) to decide that theyre wrong?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9365","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kailey Lindsey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a natural pain reliever that I use to help me sleep at night.

If kratom is banned, users will just turn to more addictive and dangerous opioids. There is a need for a softer, safer alternative to such drugs, now more than ever.

My dad is in his late 70's. has worked hard all of his life, and unfortunately now suffers from debilitating arthritis and chronic pain.  His doctors have been prescribing hydrocodone for him.  As most everyone knows tis is an dangerous and addictive drug.  Also my dad d hates the side effects, won't take hydrocodone and just suffers and stays on the couch instead of living the active life he would prefer.  My dad is conservative and skeptical of anything new so I was pretty surprised when a new lady friend (my mom passed away a few years back) persuaded him to try a new herbal supplement called kratom.  In our recent visits, (I live a day's drive way) all we had been able to do together was watch t.v. and eat.  My dad surprised me by announcing he had tried a new herbal medicine  that had  been helping him  feel better and then suggested we go for a bike ride down by Pensacola bay and over to Bayou Grande.  It was the first time in years we had been able to enjoy some active time outside. \nDad uses kratom about three times a week and now works out at the YMCA, walks with a senior walking club (the Seville Quarter Milers)  and rides his old paper boy Schwinn around the  neighborhood.  All this ion the last few months since he began using kratom a few times a week.  I sincerely hope for my father's sake and many others around the U.S that you will not reschedule this safe and beneficial medicine and make it unavailable to people who benefit from it. I would argue that this herbal medicine is much safer than narcotic alternatives which are addictive and over the counter pain relievers which damage the stomach lining and liver.   There is no true public safety concern to justify re-scheduling this herbal medicine.  I would agree that it should not be available to minors but nor should cough medicines, allergy medications, nasal sprays, etc. but these are not unavailable to the general public.

I generally brew one dose of Kratom, as a tea, twice a day. Since I have been brewing this plant as such, I have noticed that I feel a lot more at ease and less sensitive to things I know shouldn't be an issue in the first place - because of this, my relationships with loved ones has greatly improved as there is no longer unnecessary stress and tension on my part. \n\nRecently, I found out that all four of my wisdom teeth are coming in impacted. I do not wish to take the prescription opiates my doctors are giving me as I have witnessed first hand how easily addiction can happen. Since I was already brewing Kratom, I looked into the different strains and tried one with pain relieving properties until my appointment. This plant has worked like a miracle and it is my hope that I may have to ability to continue taking this strain after my surgery.\n\nI urge you to take the correct measures and allow the scientific community to review this wonderful plant and its ability to help those who suffer from anxiety, depression, pain, add/adhd and more. Kratom is a natural part of our ecosystem, here to help us when used properly. For hundreds of years there has not been a single death strictly related to Kratom. It is when, like prescription drugs, people begin to abuse its potential by mixing it with other drugs and alcohol. Please, do not make this a schedule one drug.

I am an executive assistant to the chairman of the board of a Fortune 1000 company.  I came across Kratom while doing an internet search for alternative pain relief for my husband who had just come out of his 7th back surgery in April of 2016 and on top of the recovery from that he came out with neuropathy and could barely walk. \n\nHe has been on Oxycodone or other opiates after each of his surgeries and because of the way his system is, he has been highly resistant to any opiate pain medication and it takes way more for him than the medical field will give him so getting decent pain relief has been a 35 year battle for him.  Not only does Kratom help him tremendously with his pain, it is also a great natural herb plant to get him off opiate pain killers that works.  \n\nThis natural plant that is related to the coffee plant has no side effects, is not a drug, does not cause a high like the other drugs that the DEA wants to put this in the same category as such as marijuana, heroin and the like.  I just recently found this wonderful natural plant that gives my husband more pain relief than opiates do and am not only very worried that if this unreasonable ban goes into effect, where that will leave him and the millions of others that rely on this plant just to be able to get out of bed each day without the dangerous side effects of opiates.  If this ban goes into effect I believe the number of overdoses due to people going back to opiates such as heroin, oxy and the like will skyrocket.  There is not a single case of a death associated solely from Kratom and the 15 deaths that are on record all had other opiates/drugs mixed with the Kratom.  Tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of people die each year from overdosing on opiates.  Opiates are way, way more dangerous than Kratom.  Kratom should not be made a Schedule 1 narcotic.  Please leave this plant alone and let it help the people that need it so much, including my husband.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nConnie H.\nMinneapolis, MN  55420","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3491","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Connie H","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jessica Fenlon.

Basically, I want to study addiction in all of it's forms. I state that so that you realize that I fully understand the harms that can come from drug use, substance use, and addictions to things other than substances, such as gambling or sex. \nThe DEA scheduling procedure is not based on science. We have the science that can determine the addiction level and harm level of almost anything. We know what is physically and/ or psychologically addicting and what is and is not physically or psychologically harmful. Therefore, I am writing this comment not to ask you to make a determination on kratom, but to overhaul the system so that these decisions are made by panels of experts in medicine, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, pharmacology, biology, and so forth instead of having these decisions made by person's whose background is in politics or law enforcement. If one does not have a background in these established sciences, it is easy to get lost in the scientific jargon and fail to understand the the meaning behind the words. \nKratom is known to have medicinal qualities, but then again so is marijuana. Yet, one is already set at a schedule one status and the other is being considered for schedule one status. This flies in the face of modern science. Schedule one is reserved for substances with no medicinal value. We know this to not be the case for these two substances. Not only do we do a disservice to medicine by stating that drugs with known medical uses have no medical uses (which is effectively lying because we know this to be false), but it also serves to lessen the severity of those drugs with no known medical use. If you place kratom and marijuana on par with Psilocybin, heroin, LSD, or mescaline then people falsely believe these drugs to be as safe as marijuana or kratom. This is simply false and is dangerous.

I've taken countless types of medications to help, however none of them have truly benefited my life in a positive way. I've  caused greater damage than I could imagine to my friends and family because of my sickness.  About a year ago I was in such a deep depression that I was to the point of suicide. I would lock myself in my room every single day after work and speak to no one. I wouldn't even want to see my boyfriend. I pulled through and decided to keep going and hope that it would pass. Eventually I came out of the dark space, but still felt that I was not \"better\" despite the medication I was using. Two months ago a friend of mine who has a similar story told me he was using Kratom to combat his symptoms. Within a week of using this I found myself to be more social than I ever have been in my life, I was performing better at work, and my overall sense of happiness was greater than I've felt in a very long time. I haven't been able to say I am happy and truly mean it until now, because this is really a miracle for me. Please do not take this away from me.

I'm aware the DEA is researching the plant to try and help protect people from drugs. I however do not belive that making kratom a scheduled 1 drug will help save anyone, more like hurt allot of people. I started taking kratom about 2-3 years ago when a friend of mine told me about it after finding a empty narcotic pill bottle in my car. I'm in the medical field and have been for more than a decade now and I see addiction everyday. I to was closet narcotic addict until I tried kratom. It hard to explain the way narcotics effect a person's mood and energy level while taking them. I almost lost everything in my life do to pain killers. Kratom gives me the energy and attention that pain killers gave me but WITH OUT the side effects.  In fact if you take to many pain pills ypu die, if you take to much kratom you puke. Also kratom isn't effected by alcohol. I use to drink like a fish when I was popping pills because the alcohol increased the effects. Kratom is opposite, alcohol actually lessons the effects of kratom making it much safer and alot better for your health. I have also been able to stop taking blood pressure medicines since i started taking kratom which I have read that kratom can help BP bit it's also probably from the decline in alcohol cunsumption. Please if you decide to schedule Kratom in any way please don't make it a schedule 1, at the maximum make it avial able with prescription but not scheduled 1 as hospitals do not allow schedule 1 drugs even with prescription. Please don't take away the plant that has saved my life!\n\nSincerely \nLuke mathis","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5276","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Luke Mathis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a recovering opiate addict and struggled for years to get clean and stay clean. Ever since I found Kratom and started taking a little in the morning and a little in the afternoon, I have been able to maintain 8 months of sobriety. Compared to my past, this is unheard of for me. I feel motivated, my struggle with triggers is minimal and I've been able to cope with my depression/anxiety more than ever in life. Kratom has indeed changed my life, my mood and my mental health. I would be very sad to see it be outlawed. It's not at all comparable to any controlled substance I've ever taken. It's mild and yet enough to keep me on the straight and narrow. Call it a replacement, but it's so much better for me than the alternative which are methadone and suboxone, which I've taken in the past. I couldn't stay clean with either one of those. Please consider not banning Kratom. It's helped me and so many people I know, personally! Thank you for your time and for taking comments.

If kratom was such a dangerous substance there would be far greater  problems over its decades of american use. Scheduling kratom would also prevent further research which so far has shown the alkaloids in kratom to be helpful for pain without the respiratory problems associated with opiates. \n\n   I started using kratom a while ago for pain associated with a knee injury. It did not \"get me high\" as the sensationalism of mainstream media would have you believe. Furthermore, an overdose simply makes you sick to your stomach. Withdrawls are about as horrible as a simple headache,  similar to the drug we all use known as caffeine. In order to dangerously overdose, one  would have to mix kratom with other substances or consume massive quantities that only those with room temperature i.q. would consider. As we all know, you cannot legislate stupidity away. \n\n   Kratom has helped my pain quite a bit, and has been used safely in Asia forever. To have kratom taken away from me by people who have never used it and thus have no first hand experience is not only unreasonable, but wrong. Kratom is not some sort of epidemic, it has proven safe and does not lead to criminal activity any more than nicotine or caffeine. In fact most people are unaware of kratom, so who are you trying to protect?\n\n   Please respect the voices of the people. For once, dont assume you know better than us. Let real research be done BEFORE you jump for more regulations and controls over the every day lives of the people. We are, after all, supposed to be free. \n\n   Remember that if we banned every potentially dangerous substance we would have to ban sugar due to diabetes,  and salt due to high blood pressure. Paint, gasoline, and whipped cream cans are all abused by those seeking a high. Do we ban those items as well?  Where do we draw the line? When do we accept that anything can be dangerous if abused? \n\n  Thank you for your time, I trust you actually read this comment out of integrity, and did not simply skim it over.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7803","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It helps me my shoulder and lower back.now will need even more then ever.

There are people that literally depend on this plant, drug or whatever you classify it as, to go through the most simple of life tasks like talking without a speech impediment or walking without pain. I truly think this plant needs to be further researched for the well being of so many people, and if you find evidence that truly proves it is anymore dangerous than alcohol, tobacco, or prescription drugs then I have no problem with it being illegal. But I do believe the time and effort of our government should look into this with unbiased intentions that are influenced by outside involvement such as big pharma and public opinion, and to truly help its people in which it is governs and sworn to protect and help, instead of looking out for these corporations with intentions that mean well but don't always create for what is best. Please, if this can help people without the use of prescription drugs I hope it can create some good. If this supplement would be introduced into the public sector the competition of businesses and free markets would turn this stigmatic drug into a blessing for so many individuals, who one day could be me, you, your mother, father, or even child.

Please, I am respectfully and strenuously urging for no action on the part of the DEA to classify Kratom in any schedule, let along schedule I. Do not do this. It would be plain wrong to place Kratom in with dangerous and addictive drugs. Kratom is not a drug. I do not hesitate to categorize kratom as a life-saving plant. I have been blessed with the knowledge of kratom for over five years and I could not disagree more with any claim of its danger. This plant, a relative of coffee, is similar to Ginseng and Ginkgo Biloba. Kratom has been used for hundreds of years and it is amazingly SAFE. KRATOM IS NOT A DRUG. The alkaloids in kratom seem to have an effect on the same receptors as opiate and opioid medicines without any psychoactive or euphoric properties. This is an amazing and marvelous thing! Kratom does not cause respiratory depression. It is not addictive like opiates, and overdose is next to impossible. I cannot imagine how much kratom leaf someone would have to ingest - I'm not using hyperbole here, I actually can't imagine that large an amount of kratom in anyone's system - it just isn't possible. I doubt the volume of plant needed would even fit in someone's stomach. The effects of kratom are milder than anything I have ever been prescribed. My asthma medication, strong coffee, alcohol, nicotine, opioid medication, cough syrup, NyQuil - all of these things produce a stronger reaction than kratom. It can dull pain signals. It does not cause euphoria (it does not get one \"high\"), it does not impair motor function, it does not cause constipation, it does not negatively affect my job or my hobbies or my family or any of my responsibilities. It helps me to live a productive, normal, and happy life, just like my morning coffee. I do not know where I would be without it. If you actually analyze reports of kratom involvement in calls to poison control or other reported negative situations, you would see that nearly ALL of these were the result of dangerous substances _labelled_ as kratom but actually containing a host of other things. If any action was needed concerning kratom it would be as quality control! Tainted products and false advertising are causing the problem, NOT kratom itself. Kratom is a dietary supplement. It feels similar to coffee or ginseng. Tylenol can kill a healthy adult in small amounts. Laundry pods cause exponentially more harm and calls to poison control. Alcohol and tobacco can kill. Prescription opioids can kill. Kratom is not in this group of potentially deadly and legal substances! Kratom is an ancient plant and this proposal to schedule it does not make sense. There should be more studies on kratom and scheduling it I would not only be unjustified, it would inhibit these studies. It has potential to help millions of Americans. It could potentially help in fighting the opioid crisis in this nation - a notoriously difficult problem with very few working solutions. Americans should be hearing praise of kratom from the rooftops. It has the potential to save lives, not cost lives. It can help people, not hurt people. It is a plant, not a drug. It should remain available and should be studies, not made illegal and discarded. I would be available and happy to discuss the matter further. I would travel to Washington, D.C. at my own expense to enthusiastically defend this plant and to teach its history and uses and the miraculous potential it has. Please listen to the tens of thousands of Americans who have contacted their government and have made their voices heard. Please accept the evidence from the scientific community that this plant has potential and should be studied further. Please make the correct decision and allow kratom to remain legal and available as a supplement. Thank you for your time and consideration.

It is an enjoyable herb in the same way coffee and tea are. Similarly, it is also very useful for exercise, mindfulness, contemplation, relaxation, motivation, focus and work productivity. It also appears to have a positive effect on the immune system - consumers of kratom seem to get sick considerably less often than average.\n\nWe comprise an intelligent and successful country founded on freedom. How much freedom remains when one can no longer decide to ingest an herb or tea on their own volition? Restrictions and punishments are not solutions - education is. Adults should be free to make informed decisions on what herbs, drinks and other substances to consume. In addition, researchers should be free to perform studies and tests on all available herbs and substances in order to determine their safety profile, uses, and benefits, and of course provide the information for adults to make their decisions. \n\nCurrently, most evidence regarding kratom is anecdotal, but there is a growing number of reports and legitimate studies surfacing. Thus far, the grand majority of reports have been positive, and many users have consumed the herb on a daily basis for years with little-to-no negative effects on the body (subjectively confirmed by physicals and follow-up blood work). At the very minimum, there are no clear cases where a person has died from kratom consumption alone; this already makes it FAR safer than alcohol and even energy drinks. Regardless, it would be wonderful to have access to more extensive studies and research in the future.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19281","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"H L","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I oppose this ban.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22357","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for reading my comment.

It is extremely important that we learn through science the benefits and dangers of kratom.  If this plant is made schedule 1, no further research will be able to be done on it and it will only be available on the black market.  If this is the case most of the information people think they know about Kratom good or bad will be lacking scientific evidence because the plant will not legally be able to be studied.  Please do not let people's fears of the unknown put this plant in a classification that will Outlaw scientific study.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12004","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Colt Napravnik","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern\n\nI appreciate your taking the time to read my comment concerning kratom. On Nov 13 I will be 66 years old and I am fortunate to live a healthy life. I have been taking natural supplements recommended by MDs as well as other medical professional for quite some time and usually prefer them in the place of pharmaceutical drugs which often carry unwanted side effects. Over the last few years I have been battling recurring anxiety related depression. I found the medication I was prescribed to be both ineffective and unpleasant. In August of this year I read about kratom and how it has helped so many other people with relief for not only my condition but also with severe pain, addiction and  insomnia. Once I found a reputable dealer online I ordered some kratom powder and carefully read the instructions and recommended dosage for my condition. I also passed the information along to my psychiatrist who encouraged me to see if it might help me. I have found that 1/2 tsp in the morning and again in the afternoon gave me additional alertness and also produced a much more positive mood. I have been taking it daily since and really like the way its working. I am taking care of my wife who is sick and disabled and I have many responsibilities. When I learned about the DEAs intent to place Kratom as a Schedule 1 controlled substance I became very concerned and have taken the suggested actions to attempt to delay the process. I am now asking the ones who will make the final decision to please consider holding off taking any action that would cause an obstruction in my ability to acquire this wonderful plant. Having been in touch with many others who are a part of the kratom community I know Im not the only person who feels this way. For me its a safe inexpensive non habit forming means of getting important necessary relief. Isnt that something we all want? Thank you so much for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4036","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeff Schreiber","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Keep Kratom legal, it's safe and effective to use responsibility.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19215","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Seth Nicholls","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 48 year old woman who was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 21 years ago.

The doctors diagnosed me with psoriatic arthritis and finally ankylosing spondylitis. I was at first prescribed hydrocodone 5 for pain and as the years passed the mg went up every so often until I was at 60 mg of morphine 3x a day. My pain would worsen and the Dr. would up the rx to help me function with the pain, as I am a teacher. Then one if my friends told me about kratom. A week later I got some and I tried it. In 30 min I felt normal for the first time in 20 years. The pain was gone and I felt normal. Kratom has helped me get off of  opiates and mostly skip the withdrawals. I've been taking kratom for over a year and I've once again felt normal and pain free. I am a better wife, mother and teacher.

I also have introduced many of my friends to kratom, a vast majority of which have had similar positive experiences, with no real negative effects aside from the occasional nausea that newer users occasionally have if they take a little more than their body is accustomed to. Overall, I believe kratom not only should be legal for all to use, but I also believe that it is a very important supplement for a lot of people who are getting off their addictions, who are treating their anxiety, and who are treating their pain, without fear of overdosing or being thrown into the grips of an addiction. There is no evidence, not even a trustworthy study that suggests kratom is a dangerous substance, an I am willing to bet that it will forever stay that way.

I have dealt with depression and severe migraines my entire life.  These conditions have both taken a toll on my professional and personal life, as my migraines will leave me bedridden for the entire day. I discovered Kratom after a lengthy period of research on alternatives to prescription narcotic painkillers.  After researching the substance in great detail, I ordered an ounce online from a reputable vendor, and my life was changed for the better.  To this day, Kratom is the only substance that reliably relieves my migraines, while at the same time not causing undesirable or negative side effects. I have also given it to one of my friends who struggled with a Vicodin dependency and I can happily say he is two months clean for the first time in years. Does this mean Kratom is perfect? Absolutely not.  There are negative effects to the drug, and if one overuses and has an addictive personality, a dependence or habit can be formed.  However the positives far outweigh the negatives.  In this simple plant, there is a strong painkilling factor, WITHOUT the overdose dangers, rapid addiction, and slew of side effects that come along with prescription painkillers.  Since Kratom acts on the same receptors in the brain, albeit in a different way, many people who are addicted to painkillers now have an affordable and safe way to break free of the cycle of suffering and misery.  By scheduling this substance, millions of Americans will be forced to choose between a life of chronic pain, or a life of addiction. The DEA will be making its own mission more difficult, as more and more americans fall prey to the opiod epidemic that has claimed so many people.  While scheduling will do more harm than good, the DEA can still take helpful action. Much of the negative press on Kratom stems from teenagers buying the substance ad headshops, marketed as a legal high, with ridiculously misleading labels. Most headshop owners know little to nothing about Kratom, and are harming the portion of the population that takes Kratom for legitimate reasons.  I believe that a minimum age for buying or consuming Kratom would be helpful, just like with tobacco and alcohol.  In addition, the DEA should invest resources into providing education and knowledge about Kratom, which will encourage responsible consumption, as well as cracking down on companies that distribute Kratom to unknowing consumer bases under false advertising.  By making Kratom available to only responsible adults and providing knowledge, the DEA will be doing a great service to the American people.  Kratom is a very viable solution to the opiod epidemic, and is a life changing substance for people who life in chronic pain.  The DEA can take real tangible measures to end our country's drug problem, and keeping Kratom legal would be an amazing first step. Because of Kratom, I can live pain free, and I have never struggled with addiction or dependency.

I have even been suicidal in the past because of the pain and with what seemed like a very bleak future to look forward to. I once was a very active designer, painter, mother, friend, active in my church and a volunteer in ministries for young adults and women.  Now I am disabled, but have found a ray of hope in Kratom.  It has added to my ability to relax and deal with pain.  I find that it can help with my energy level without the jitters of coffee.  I also have Tachycardia, so I stay away from anything that could cause additional issues.  I have felt \"high\" on certain medications and it caused me great anxiety.

Your change in direction also shows humility and grace, and for that, you should be proud. \n\nI am a 34-year-old man who works as the Director of Communications for a nonprofit, overseeing copy, design, web development, PR, email marketing, event promotion, film editing, and so on. I am a husband, a follower of Jesus, a rescue-dog owner and advocate, a community volunteer, a cyclist, a musician, and a big fan of good food. \n\nI do not drink or take illegal drugs, but sometimes take Kratom as a dietary supplement to help me focus at work while feeling more relaxed. At most, I take 5-10 grams every day, but often go for days, weeks, or months without taking it. \n\nI have never experienced any painful or harmful side effects, either from taking Kratom or from quitting Kratom cold turkey. The biggest downside of Kratom is that if you take too much of it without drinking enough water, you will become constipated--that's about as harmful as it gets, and I don't think we'll be regulating cheddar anytime soon :) \n\nKratom is virtually harmless supplement whose toxicity does NOT warrant scheduling.

I am very much against the DEA putting Kratom (Mitragyna Speciosa) on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.\n\nI have used Kratom for approximately 2 years based on a recommendation from my son. I purchase this relative of the coffee tree from a highly regarded importer in powered whole leaf form.\n\n I have an uncommon bone disease, Paget's Disease of the Bone, in an uncommon location, my C2 vertebral body.  The location and nature of the disease results in my suffering extreme pain on a regular basis. I have had the symptoms of this disease for over 25 years although, because it is so unusual, it has only been diagnosed for the last 12. There is no cure for it, although there is a treatment with bisphosphates that can reduce its activity. Unfortunately, the treatment did not eliminate the pain.\n\nI am currently on permanent disability from my job as an Air Line pilot and took early retirement from by subsequent position of Principal Aeronautical Engineer at Mercer Engineering Research Center due to the debilitating effect of chronic pain. Other than narcotic pain medicine, there is no other approved pain relief mediation available and effective. Long term use of narcotics limits its effectiveness and was discouraged by my physician. The relative rareness of my disease means there is little or no on-going research on it and I am largely left to my own to manage it.\n\nPrior to discovering Kratom, coffee, caffeine, hot/cold compresses, and limiting my activity through retirement were the only treatments that even slightly helped.  Kratom has been a tremendous tool in the management of the effects of my bone disease. In fact, it has given me the confidence to go back to work again on an engineering contract with the Air Force and I start this week. There is no way I could do this without Kratom.\n\nWhile I would absolutely love to have a non-narcotic pain medication that has been the subject of a 2000 person, double blind study that proved its effectiveness, that just isnt available. The rareness of the disease means the economics of such a study are pretty remote. Perhaps the current attention given to Kratom will drive such a study and I will welcome that. Until then, please dont classify Kratom in such a way that it becomes unavailable for informed users such as me. My own experience with Kratom has proven to me that it is easy to use safely and the relatively minor side effects it does have make it self-limiting in its use.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment. I appreciate all the effort that is going into looking at issues such as this.\n\nSincerely, Robert Heath","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14149","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Heath","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 27 year old mother of 3 children  ages 9, 8, and 3.

Kratom has excellent medical benefits from pain control to opioid addiction. It is ridiculous to ban something people use to free themselves of the bondage of addiction. You can not get high off the product, if that is what this is about. It produces no effects that mimic those in opioid use. In fact, it causes gastrointestinal issues if you consume more than 3 grams. I honestly do not understand why the DEA trips over itself to keep expanding regulations. What kind of culture is gong on there? Has anyone at the DEA even  used this ? If your  job is to police people's choices to keep them safe from themselves  (it's ridiculous to begin with) then banning Kratom is the very last thing you should do. You can not keep expanding the role of the DEA as if this was some Fortune 500 company with shareholder profits. Everytime you do this, you cost this nation more money. Your waste everyone's time. You set quotas on how many types of scheduled drugs can be sold at any given pharmacy.  If a patient happens to use a pharmacy that has met your quota, they are turned away, causing them to go on an Easter egg hunt that could include multiple counties. The patient eventually gets their prescription but not without untold headaches and frustration. I have no idea what purpose this even serves you, other than job security. You can not place every plant on the planet under your umbrella. If you ban Kratom, people will still buy it. Truth is most people in a struggle with addiction do not care a whit about the DEA rules. You unnecessarily expose all these people to the criminal justice system or death because they are in the black market. The health and safety police role is overreaching and causing resentment among adults who DO NOT wish to be babysat by other adults, most especially those less knowledgeable. I applaud that you lifted the ban on kratom while receiving public comments, something you really should have done ahead of banning a plant that has had such a positive impact on peoples life.

It helps me take a shower,  put on my shoes and other things that most people take for granted each day.  Please be certain that without the aid of ALL therapies I have chosen to utilize in my arsenal of  \"being able to partake in life\", I would not be here today.  Unless you have the type of pain I am talking about, there is no way you could EVER understand how vital each and every therapy is.  Insurances choose not cover most alternative therapies, so what am I supposed to do?  Scream?  Die?  Until there is a cure for chronic intractable pain and the diseases that cause it, please stop taking away the things that actually give us a chance to live.\nSincerely,\nMelissa Dobbs","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15292","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Melissa Dobbs","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a RN for 30 years I have witnessed the opioid epidemic.

There hasn't been enough thorough testing. Allow for more research, more thorough studies, more unbiased data versus exaggerated negative data, and less of the stereotypically biased forms of decision-making, before banning something that could be a healthier option for thousands. A significant amount of people (including U.S. veterans) have found themselves and their lives altered because they became addicted to legal prescription drugs and significant numbers of people lived with someone who has been addicted to drugs prescribed to them by doctors. Yet, those opiods are still readily available to the public--via a doctor. Even TV commercials advertise prescription drugs that have proven negative side effects and that, in some cases, result in addiction, strokes, heart attacks, and even death. Seems like a double standard is taking place in regards to Kratom, the same way Congress and the DEA put cannabis (hemp) under Schedule l, despite it's proven medicinal and healing properties. And how many tax-payer's tax dollars went into campaigns that mis-labeled and demonized the use of the medicinal cannabis plant. Allow for more thorough research that is not being conducted merely to satisfy the biased agendas seeking to ban it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8097","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please reconsider your impending ban on Kratom, it has many therapeutical benefits and very few side effects.

After years of suffering from a medical condition, I became addicted to prescribed pain killers/opioids.  I had 2 unsuccessful surgeries and hospitalizations too numerous to count.  I was admitted to inpatient drug treatment centers 13 times, only to relapse when the pain returned.  I was given methadone while in the hospital and placed on a methadone clinic when I was released.  My doctor told me I would probably be on methadone for the rest of my life because it was the only viable option to managing my pain, which was dangerous because of the vomiting that resulted from it.   After being on state funded methadone for 27 years, I decided to try and detox.  Through internet research, I learned about Kratom as an aid to detox from methadone.  I had already been able to reduce my methadone dose from 95mg to 20mg daily, but couldn't seem to get past that last 20mg.  Using Kratom, I was able to reduce my dosage much faster and without any withdrawal symptoms.  I have been methadone free for almost 2 years.  I no longer feel like a burden to the state and have a much more normal life.  I didn't have any problems stopping Kratom because it's not addictive.  In fact, I was more uncomfortable giving up coffee.  I want to ask you to please not  make the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, two constituents of the kratom plant, schedule 1 controlled substances.  Using plants and herbs is a God-given right that should not be infringed upon and the constituents of Kratom are not drugs.  Therefore, it is unethical and illegal to take away our rights to use plants.  Kratom doesn't act like a drug at all and it's impossible to overdose.  If someone takes too large a serving of Kratom, they simply throw it up.  There have never been any deaths caused by Kratom.  Every death that has been blamed on Kratom use has been found to have been caused by dangerous substances that were also in the victims' system.  As a former drug addict, I can tell you from experience that Kratom acts nothing like a drug.  It's a plant related to the coffee plant and is used as a tea leaf.  Since numerous studies have found Kratom to be safe and effective for many purposes, there is no need to categorize it as a schedule 1 substance.  Even though I no longer drink Kratom tea, I know there are countless Americans who use it to manage chronic pain, PTSD, Fibromyalgia, anxiety and opioid withdrawals.  It doesn't work for more acute pain or anxiety.

I am highly concerned with the DEA's decision to place Kratom on the schedule 1 drug category, and comparing it to the same as heroin, and cocaine. Heroin and cocaine destroys lives. It kills, and it tears families apart. The Kratom Plant is the complete stark opposite of these horrible drugs, and it baffles my mind how they can be lumped together.  I have responsibly consumed kratom now going on 4 years. It has been a TREMENDOUS help in battling my pain, fatigue, and mental health.  It makes me very happy knowing that something pure, unadulterated and natural from the earth is capable of fighting these issues, and I do not have to worry about trying to function under the influence of pain and psych meds. When taking prescriptions, I would be in a fog, and running out meant I would suffer uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. When consuming kratom, when I stop, all I have to worry is my symptoms that I unfortunately suffer from coming back. Nothing added to it, like withdrawals.

While I have no first hand experience with Kratom, I do have friends of friends for whom it has been a boon and a blessing and would like to see it remain available to them as a supplement.\n\nSo I urge you, please do not schedule Kratom without doing the proper amount of research and due diligence into it, which clearly has not yet been done. It's an extremely useful supplement for Veterans with PTSD, addicts who are trying to kick opioid addictions, people with chronic pain, those with anxiety, and a host of other problems. Instead I would urge you to do proper research into the plant, study it, and then make an informed decision before you pass judgement and say it has \"no medicinal value\" while also not having any hard data to support that statement. To do so without proper evidence and scientific research would rash, careless, and be an embarrassment to the DEA.\n\nFrankly, I don't see the harm in a plant that's been in use for thousands of years without any documented fatal doses. I'm willing to admit that I might be wrong, but in order to do so I'd need to be shown hard, factual, scientific evidence that just isn't available not only to me, but also is not available to the DEA because it doesn't yet exist. Making something schedule 1, claiming it has \"No Medicinal Value\" is a death sentence to any sort of scientific research into this plant, which frankly hasn't even begun to have been explored.\n\nThank you so much for your time reading this. Again, I urge you to NOT make Kratom schedule 1, and to do further research into the plant before scheduling it in that way.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18222","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nathan Talley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please leave this as it is.

However, in this case they are seriously off the mark and misinformed.  The DEA & FDA should not convolute Kratom with synthetics like Spice, Flaka, or any of the other manufactured substances.  In this day when opioid addiction is truly out of control as a direct result of big pharma lobbyist and the associated government policies, Kratom truly offers a viable option for managing pain and, ironically, weaning addicts off of heroin & pharmaceutical opiates.  It is unconscionable that the DEA would unilaterally classify this plant as a schedule 1 drug while doing zero research in what appears to be a knee jerk reaction to some of the other substance related issues facing this country.\n\nA more cynical view would be to say that big pharma once again is pulling the levers of power in the hope of preserving huge profits and perhaps isolating Kratom's active alkaloids inorder to corner a market and turn a new, government sanctioned drug loose on the populous.  \n\nBy the way, I have never used Kratom but I do know several good, productive & responsible people who do. They use it mostly to manage a dependency on pharmaceutical opiates. These addictions were a direct result of irresponsible prescriptions eagerly passed out by well intentioned, if not lazy physicians. \n\nI take notice when Our Government threatens to ban a plant and criminalize the behavior of good people who harm no one. In general I believe the DEA continues to be blinded by an antiquated drug policy which was contrived to serve political power and the industry dollars that are in bed with it.  Now is the time for drastic overhaul of US drug policy and abandon a regressive, bankrupt ideology. \n\nIf not then what? How many drug enforcement agents can this country have?  How many doors can be knocked down? How many citizens can we put in jail?  How many prisons can we build? How much money and resources would be required?  And who are Kratom users hurting?  And are you sure they are even hurting themselves???","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10772","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Butler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"we need things like this that works for the people ailing, and I hope that it stands the test of time, as it does work much better than any thing our government says is better, and does not have to have doctors bills and lab bills and government control of.

I do not think enough testing has been done to label Kratom as a schedule 1 controlled substance. I beliebve that Kratom has medical value as do other opiods and I think banning it outright is missing an opportunity to use it's medicinal qualities. It's been used for that purpose for thousands of years and while it can be abused-- so can virtually anything: Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, Fentanyl patches, Aprazolam and Lorazepam, all of these are prescribed by doctors and  are constantly on the news relating to deaths/deadly withdrawals and ODs. There has not been a single case of a Kratom OD from Kratom alone, nor are the withdrawals life threatening. We should absolutely do further research into the medical benefits of Kratom before banning it if we are able to use much more dangerous drugs in a medicinal way.\n\n I myself have never taken kratom but both my girlfriend and my brother take it 2-3 times weekly. Both of them suffer from chronic pain. My brother has been prescribed NSAID and Opiod medications before to medicate his pain. Right now he is diagnosed with severe tendinitis and will likely suffer some sort of chronic pain for the rest of his life. The NSAID drugs are not sufficient to counter his pain nor a viable long term solution due to their effects on the stomach. Opiod medications could lead to a more dangerous addiction than Kratom and impairs function for work and school to a much larger degree(Not to mention our parents think it's too dangerous for him to get a prescription and won't let him). The only thing that has worked for my brother's pain is Kratom. \n\nHe had done everything from accupuncture to wearing full medical boots. Kratom has drastically improved his performance in school and allowed him to start being active but still alert again. It is possible to use this drug in a responsible way. He doesn't even need to use it every day just when he plans to be on his feet. My girlfriend has a spine related injury and also has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Rather than put her on SSRI's whose effects are even less fully understood than Kratom and also have withdrawal symptoms, I suggested Kratom. It has done wonders for her pain and her anxiety. Instead of putting her on a much more dangerous, addictive, and potentially life-threatening to withdraw from drug like Alprazolam for her panic attacks, I'll mix her some tea with a very low dose of Kratom. It does wonders for her pain and anxiety and she never needs it more than twice a week. \n\nMy point is to not make you all at the DEA feel sorry for me or my loved ones but I hope you'll understand that my opinion comes entirely out of my concern for their well-being. \n\nHere are several articles from research that I have done regarding the Kratom Plant\n\nMedical Toxicology of Drug Abuse by , Donald G Barceloux\n\nNon-medical use, abuse and dependence on prescription opioids among U.S. adults: Psychiatric, medical and substance use correlates\nby William C.

It is a miracle plant that has a wide array of benefits that I have been unable to find in any other single plant or medicine. It is entirely natural, and I haven't experienced any negative side effects in the 3 years I have used it. It has alleviated menstrual cramps and headaches, calmed anxiety, lifted my mood when I feel depressed, helped me get more restful sleep, and is a healthier energy boost alternative to caffeine. To place this natural plant with other schedule 1 drugs would be a tragedy. It has helped so many people get off of unnatural substances, such as pharmaceutical medications, which have serious side effects. To take away our freedom to have this plant would be utterly preposterous. It is a plant. It was put here by nature, and we should have to the choice to use what nature has put here for us. To make this benefical plant illegal with the amount of chemicals and substances that are allowed for human consumption to remain legal, might lead one to believe laws are in place to take away what is natural and good, while encouraging what is detrimental, addictive, and possibly lethal- such as prescription drugs. Compare the death tolls of prescription drugs and alcohol to Kratom and let those speak for what should really be classified as a schedule 1 drug. Even laundry detergent and other household cleaning agents are more lethal than Kratom. Why are those allowed? It seems the governments real intention is not to give people what will be healthy and good, but what will give them a slow deterioration leading to death. At least that is one could be lead to believe if Kratom gets classified as a schedule 1 substance, while those other more toxic substances are allowed to remain legal. People should have a say in this. Our voices need to be heard, and should be the determining factor on this decision. Government should not be in place to control and manipulate people while taking away their basic rights, such as using plant medicine, and giving us toxic chemicals. Government should be doing it's best to ensure the health and wellbeing of it's people. If we are saying this is helping us, that needs to be listened to.

While it does not have anywhere near the strength of pharmaceutical drugs, it is an effective pain reliever that does not have the risk of serious addiction like the others mentioned.  I became a victim of of addiction from pain killers legitimately prescribed by my doctors as have millions of other Americans.  Kratom was the only way to manage the pain and break the addiction and when you want to stop, it is very easy, unlike pharmaceuticals that are impossible to stop taking and lead to far more serious drug abuse by some.

I personally don't don't consume caffeine, however my husband imbibes regularly in a tall icy Coca-Cola. \n     In 2007 we invited a young man, his wife and three children to live with us.  They had hit a rough patch - Fresh out of jail having served time for non-support and driving without a license he was unemployed.  His wife was 8 1/2 months pregnant, couldn't work while he was gone and they had lost their apartment. The family was homeless.  We did not know at the time that he had a pill problem. \n     Over time, his child support was caught up, his driver's license was reinstalled, and he had different jobs that were almost enough for him, his wife and his (now) four children to move out.  Success was always lost at the last minute.  Something would go wrong;  the boss cheated him out of a paycheck, he lost his wallet, there was a mix up in the of hours he worked.  In retrospect,  we were nave and missed the obvious signs of drug addiction. \n     One day, he took me aside and told me  he was again addicted to opiates (he had been through this before). He wanted to quit, but he needed help.  This was an extremely tough process that, at times resulted in me giving him money and a ride to his pill pushers (usually 85-year-old ladies supplementing their Social Security) because I couldn't stand watching him wither in the pain of withdrawal.  Finally, he started on methadone which seemed like a godsend. In reality methadone is no different than other opiates, or for that matter heroine,  and he was soon abusing methadone. Again, we didn't recognize what he was doing. He would take all of his weekly doses at once to have a GREAT Monday-Tuesday high, then he'd be sick in bed the rest of the week. We believed him when he said it was the flu or side-effects of methadone.\n     When that behavior was figured out, and we were watching his methadone intake much closer, he began sneaking out and supplementing with pills. When that was discovered and his money was much more closely monitor, he began supplementing with meth as that is much less expensive.  Meth was pure hell, and we all thought we had lost him.\n     Available rehab for uninsured people is nothing more than a  dehumanizing group lock up that allows you to suffer cold turkey withdrawal  in the most painful way imaginable. We couldn't do that to him, but if he ever got caught and put in jail, that's what he was facing. He avoided that.\n     As is common with methamphetamine addiction, he went into a psychosis. He was sure that the government was spying on him and all of us were against him.  He started gathering large knives, talked of killing people he caught following him and, quite frankly, became a very scary person. At one point he tried to kill himself cutting his own wrist.\n     It was during that time, in desperation, I actually Googled \"homeopathic cures for opiate addictions\" and came across the term kratom.\n     It wasn't quite overnight, but he is now almost two years drug-free. He and his wife and (now) five children on their own, supported by his 40+ hours per week job in construction/home repairs.  When clean he was always hard working and a very talented man.  \n     He is still a regular user of kratom, and from what I have come to understand, it helps him with his underlying depression and gives him the energy that depression robs from a person. \n     If there were a way to get high on kratom, I do believe he would've found it and abused it.  Instead, it just took away his cravings for opiates, but left him with the energy to have a good life.\n     I am not a regular user of kratom and would personally not suffer if it were banned.  That said, I believe wholeheartedly that kratom should not be rescheduled or reclassified as harmful in any way. I have seen the life-changing difference kratom makes, and I believe it would be not only unjust but harmful to take this option away from people trying to take control of their lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5035","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Iris Fields","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My wife has thoracic outlet syndrome which can be summarized as compression of her nerve which has caused her to be in chronic pain for the last number of years.  \n\nInstead of getting choosing opioids, which daily cause \"over 1,000 people are treated in emergency departments for misusing prescription opioids\", we have chosen Kratom as an alternative. \n\nIn short, this ban seems nothing more than a power play by the drug manufacturers to eliminate safer, alternative forms of treatment by pushing Government legislation on plants. \n\nWe are, however, pleased that the DEA has postponed their ban, but the period of commentary ending December 1st seems ominous.

A contributing condition to my disability is chronic pain related to two reconstructive surgeries received while an active duty Marine.  \nI was medically separated from the Marine Corps in 2011.  This was the beginning of a long, arduous journey through the world of pain management.  Leading up to my medical separation I was prescribed a plethora of pain killers and nerve damage medications prescribed by a civilian pain management specialist.\nUpon separation, I enrolled in VA healthcare and my medications were being prescribed by a VA doctor.  At the peak of my experience, I was prescribed 330 Norco a month as well as the nerve damage drug Gabapentin.  \nI became addicted.  Physically and mentally the drugs had taken hold of me.  I tried many times to quit.  These drugs were a huge contributing factor to my divorce, one of the darkest times in my life.\nEventually I was able to ween myself off of the pills, but the pain still persisted and turned to alcohol for relief.  \nIt was not until a fellow veteran let me try kratom that I felt that I could return to a normal, productive way of life.  \nI have been using kratom for over two years now, and I can say that I am at one of the highest points in my life as I write this.  The kratom is effective at treating my pain and arthritis without leaving me to feel altered or addicted.  \nKratom is a plant.  It is affordable and natural.  I have experienced no adverse health effects using kratom and it is treating a condition in me that was once dealt with with a number of drugs whose names I could barely pronounce.  \nI sincerely hope that kratom can remain at it's current legal status, as there are many suffering veterans (and civilians) such as myself that are finally able to see the light after finding out about it.  It has turned my life around for the best and I honestly don't know what I will do if my right to treat myself in a safe, natural way is taken away. \nI hope that my country will choose to serve me as well as I and many others have served her.\nSemper Fi.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22211","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Grant Burger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi There,\n\nI am a 29-year-old professional who has dealt with some form of anxiety and depressive tendencies my whole life.

I'm writing from Los Angeles, CA with concern about the US DEA moving classification of two alkaloids (mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine) into the Schedule 1 category of controlled substances. \n\nMy concern is born out of what I understand to be a significant lack of evidence showing there is any danger posed by the alkaloids cited above. On the other hand there is at least one academic research study demonstrating that at least the alkaloid mirtagynine may have significant potential for helping opoid addicts (and other substance abuse addicts) finally break free from their addiction. The study I'm speaking of was led by Christopher R. McCurdy, a pharmacology department member at the University of Mississippi (a.k.a. \"Ol Miss\") Please see this link to a brief article about the implications drawn from the study:\n\nnews.olemiss.edu/new-hope-for-addicts/\n\nI'm not a drug user nor am I a former drug user or recovering addict but I do have a lot of interaction with the public and community where I live. I work as a hotel front desk clerk in Santa Monica and I see a growing problem with addiction to opioids and methamphetimine. I'm also aware that it is a growing problem around the united states and I am optimistic about the potential of Kratom as an alternative pathway for anyone who is interested in kicking the habits of harmful substances. From what I've read about Kratom it is not dangerous and is showing great promise as a way for people who suffer from addiction to improve their lives, especially the masses of those who don't have the means to undergo treatment at a professional addition treatment and recovery center. \n\nPlease take these words and thoughts into consideration when you make your decision. In fact I encourage your team to delay passing any classification assignment at all at the moment. Instead I would like this substance to be studied, carefully and scientifically, and then classified in an official way -- after an impartial interpretation of the findings are reviewed by peers in the scientific community. There's no current documented risk to the public by way of Kratom so I see no need to rush into a classification, especially of Schedule 1.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14574","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alexander Leighty","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 52 yr old woman with chronic pain and I am highly sensitive to so many side effects in the pain medication.

The only changes I would advocate are: 1) regulation of its purity by the FDA (in the same manner as meat, etc.), 2) sustained scientific research into its long-term health effects.  If this research finds kratom to be carcinogenic (like tobacco), users should be made aware of that fact.  But even if it is found to have deleterious, long-term health effects, it should remain up to individuals to judge whether its benefits outweigh its drawbacks (like tobacco, alcohol, high-cholesterol foods, and a host of other legal substances).  Allowing personal judgment is necessary because each individual's circumstances are unique.\n\nI am a 49-year old father of two children (14 and 12) and a happily married husband of 15 years.  I do not use illegal drugs and have no criminal record.  For the past 10 years, I have been an award-winning, internationally recognized professor at a major research university.  I am the author of numerous scholarly books and articles.  Kratom is the reason why I have been able to be an engaged father, loving husband, and productive scholar.\n\nAt age 30 I began experiencing crippling outbreaks of pain and immobilizing inflammation in my neck and upper back.  Over time these attacks became more frequent, more debilitating, and more persistent.  The last attack I had (which occurred before I discovered kratom) was so severe that I was confined to bed for 3 weeks.  During that period, I had to cancel all my classes and completely stopped work on the book I was writing.  I took out my helplessness and frustration on my family, lashing out at them even as they were caring for me.\n\nEver since my problem began in 1998, I sought expert medical care.  I have consulted leading orthopedists in Los Angeles, Atlanta, the Mayo Clinic, and even Paris, France.  None were able to identify the cause of my problem.  I also tried physical therapy, chiropractors, massage therapy, acupuncture, and yoga.  Nothing helped at all.\n\nTo cope with my outbreaks, I was prescribed a regime of anti-inflammatories and Oxycodone.  The anti-inflammatories were hard on my stomach.  The Oxycodone also had drawbacks.  I was aware of the dangers of dependence, so took care to keep my dosage low and to avoid it as much as possible.  To a certain extent, the Oxycodone was able to mask the pain, but did nothing to restore my mobility and functionality.  Worse, by 2013 it actually began to make my symptoms feel worse; it would temporarily relieve pain, but when it wore off, it seemed that the pain and inflammation were actually worse than before.  In short, Oxycodone seemed to have stopped working and instead began to have a negative effect.\n\nAs a doctor and scientist, I have little truck for non-traditional remedies.  But in desperation, I began to conduct research.  That is how I learned of kratom.  Not expecting much, I gave it a try.\n\nTo my utter surprise, it completely eliminated my pain and inflammation.  Since I began taking it, I have not had a single outbreak.  Kratom changed my life.\n\nHere is how it works on me.  It reduces pain, but its most powerful effect is to reduce my inflammation (and consequent painful joint immobility) more effectively than any of the two anti-inflammatories I was taking (Piroxicam and Meloxicam).  Its anti-inflammatory effect is so powerful that my body feels as it did when I was 30 years old, when my problems began.\n\nBy giving me back my body, kratom has given me back my life.\n\nIt has given me back my professional life.\n\nIt has given me back my ability to pursue a regular regime of cardiovascular exercise (Exercycle 45 minutes per day, 6 days a week, and 3 miles walking 5 days a week).  Before kratom, I had been forced to give up exercise - something with potentially fatal consequences for me because I have genetically-predisposed high-blood pressure and high cholesterol.  By allowing me to engage in heart-healthy exercise, kratom is allowing me to fight against my heart disease and increasing my life expectancy by years.\n\nFinally, kratom has given me back my family.  Free from pain and no longer confined to bed for weeks on end, I am now able to participate in all of our activities - from the pleasurable ones to the not-so-pleasurable ones of parenting teenage children.  Being able to share again the burdens of parenthood with my wife has helped our marriage - it was frustrating and unfair to her to leave her with the full responsibility for guiding our children through the world while I was debilitated.\n\nWhat has produced all these life-saving benefits?  One tablespoon of powdered kratom leaf each morning and one tablespoon again in the evening.  That's it.\n\nIf the DEA decides to criminalize this substance or ban it from the U.S., its decision will be tantamount to banishing my ability to be productive, healthy, active, and responsible father, husband, professional, and citizen.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0348","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dr. Patrick Henry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Addiction to pharmaceutical pain medication is at an all time high, as are accidental deaths from the misuse of them.

I have never tried Kratom, but my Opinion is that it should be researched and tested before it's determined to be unsafe and of no medicinal use. I was a criminal for years, because I used Marijuana for medical reasons and recreational uses, thankfully the state of Michigan no longer considers me a criminal because I have a medical marijuana card, but unfortunately I am still considered a criminal by federal law. My own experience with Opiates has shown me that there needs to be more options for those of us who in the past have struggled with addiction and currently are suffering with addiction. I became addicted to opiates after a back injury and being prescribed Vicodin at that time, my doctor never discussed the possibility of being addicted to this medicine at the time and when I did tell him I was having what I now know to be withdrawal symptoms, he prescribed higher and higher doses or stronger medicines. i don't blame him or anyone else for becoming addicted, it was the combination of the physically addicting qualities of the medication, using more medicine than prescribed to cope with not only my physical pain, but emotional pain as well, not to mention family history/genetics. I ended up buying extra opiates from friends, family, and drug dealers, finally coming to the point of stealing pills whenever I could from friends, family, whoever and where ever I could find them. After finally being confronted by those same friends and family, I sought help and went to  methadone clinic, that was one of the worst things I ever did! I became addicted to stronger and more dangerous methadone under the belief I was getting help. After 3 years of dose increases and no real therapeutic assistance, i did the research and finally decided to get off methadone. Due to the fact  I was being blind dosed the methadone, I had no Idea what dosage I was receiving, until I guest dosed at another clinic. The Doctor came out and told me I was on 170mg of methadone, which he said was very, very high. So at the repeated and almost  pleading of the doctor at my clinic to not get off methadone, I cut my dose 5mg a week until I was down to 15mg of methadone and I left the clinic, against the advice of everyone at the clinic that I would be on heroin within a month if I quit methadone. Well, I suffered 13 days of no sleep at all, horrible flu like symptoms, and emotional peaks and valleys, I made it to the point of I could mostly function again. I then had post acute withdrawal symptoms for at least 6 months. It was miserable and one of the toughest things I ever did. Would Kratom have helped at any of the points of my addiction? I can't say for sure, but I have read alot of people have used it to quit all together or used it for the withdrawal symptoms or the post acute withdrawal symptoms.  It seems that with the opiate epidemic this country is having it would be another option for people suffering with their addictions , after the research has been conducted. I currently have Degenerative disc disease, several non-operable bulging/herniated discs, Arthritis, Spodylitis, and severe nerve impingement. I am in constant disabling pain that I don't have many options for, I either have to live with it, find an alternative for pain management, or go back to opiates. My quality of life is horrible, constantly in pain, depressed to the point of suicide on some days, and what kind of father/husband can I be while dealing with this issue. It's not a small thing. How many others arein this same situation or worse? Please don't put this possible life changing plant on the Schedule 1 list before it can be researched, as once its there, research or having it removed from there, is next to impossible.\nThank you for letting my opinion be heard.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10116","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Day","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA equating Kratom to deadly narcotics, such as heroin, is pure insanity.

Kratom should be promoted, not prohibited.\n       A few years back I decided something, I decided I didn't care if I was alive or not. Maybe even I wanted to die and thought of suicide. I figured what's the fun in that though, If I don't care then I might as well have some fun before I go. I started abusing narcotics, self medicating anxiety and depression. I knew, at the beginning, that It would take control and I'd be addicted. I had felt withdrawal early and new that if I was going to continue I'd need to feed it everyday and stay high. I didn't care. Soon I was budgeting a couple hundred dollars a week for pills. then more and more, until I was buying more than I could afford. Borrowing or doing whatever I had to stay high. I would spend $600-$700 a week on them. I had always promised myself I would never do heroin, but things changed. It was cheaper and easier to get, so I tried it. I sniffed it, refusing to use a needle, but it hit me. I had lied to even myself. I started to care again, through the few years I was addicted, I never lost my job and things were going good for me there. Started treating my anxiety properly and it helped but I was afraid of the withdrawal. I was still taking whatever pills I could get my hands on. By the end I would take 300mg of morphine a day. 3, 100mg extended release tablets through the course of the day. I wanted to stop and tried once. Took some time off of work set aside a 3 day weekend. If you've never felt it, those were the longest 3 days of my life. Couldn't sleep, can't get comfortable no matter what you do, shaking from cold and the same time sweating through clothes and sheets. It's like the worst flu you've ever had, and you know exactly how to stop it. When it's as easy as popping a pill and the flu just goes away, and you're normal again, and even stoned. I was afraid to go to a rehab, I didn't want to take Suboxone or Methadone either. I didn't want to just switch to another narcotic. Plus I regularly abused both of those drugs in the past. It wasn't fixing the problem to me. So, I went online and I did a search for \"natural remedied to narcotic withdrawal\". A few things popped up but Kratom seemed to be suggested everywhere. I figured I didn't have anything to lose so I bought so online, hopeful but skeptical. I figured I would still end up suffering but that maybe it would do something to help, maybe enough for me to get past it. When I got it a few days later I had gone a day without any pills and I was utterly desperate. I had gotten it i a powdered form and just dumped that into a cup of tea with a ton of sugar. As disgusting it was I downed it. 30 minutes later I started feeling better...in a way that I can't describe. Like it gave me exactly what I needed. I had no withdrawal, none. Gone. The weight off, the relief and surprise as it surpassed my expectations. I knew I didn't need pills anymore from the first time I tried it. I was giddy with happiness. I haven't taken any narcotics since I discovered Kratom. I turned a close friend of mine onto it, he also kicked his opiate problem and now has a family. Having that sort of addiction you know a lot of people with it, it almost becomes a lifestyle. Everyone I know with a problem with opiates I point to Kratom. They say the urge never goes away...I know what heroin feels like and not too much out there compares, so from time to time I think about it, and when I do I reach to Kratom. A few times a week. I'm afraid of what will happen if I can't reach for it anymore. Don't take that away from me. The relief I felt when I first tried it, don't take that away from others who are struggling. Anyone who would call Kratom \"herbal heroin\" has obviously tried neither. They don't compare. Kratom takes away all the withdrawal, without the high. This is something that helps people. It helped me. If the government is serious about combating the opiate addiction plaguing America, this should be promoted, not prohibited. I hope this confession is actually read, and that it's purpose is understood and realized.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18274","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dylan Thibault","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, My name is Aaron Morales and i am in support of a non-ban of Kratom. I am a fan of the Joe Rogan Podcast and have just finished watching an episode featuring Chris Bell. I have heard his story and am familiar with Chris's work on other shows and documentaries that he has put together (Netflix Documentaries). I have also heard his personal story on how Kratom is helping him naturally alive his arthritis and other day to day pains that he has to live with for the rest of his life. I support Chris and his work and think that he is doing the right thing in exposing the interests of certain powers to keep this plant banned. I am not a user of ANY drugs legal or illegal both because of my great health and my non interest to be addicted to any substances. HOWEVER i do not support the illegalization of any natural remedies or healing options. I believe that consumers should have a choice in how they want to heal themselves, wether they want to take doctor proscibed remedies or look to holistic healing for their cure, we should have that choice. All i ask is that more research goes into this plant and its properties and it is looked at in full scope before any conclusions are made. I know that if i was in a situation where i was sick or hurting the first thing i would look to is natural cures rather than packing myself full of prescription drugs, please don't take that option away.\n Let's look out for the betterment of humanity in all its entirety, the world could always use a little more open mindedness.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12790","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Aaron Morales","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm trying to remain anonymous, but I shouldn't have to.  If public threats like alcohol and prescription opiates can be hidden in our homes, kratom should be sitting on the kitchen counter.  It's that safe.  Overindulging in kratom causes nausea and in some cases vomiting, much like many substances.  There is no risk of death when unadulterated kratom is abused on its own.\n\nI am a male, early 50's, with degenerative osteoarthritis in lower back and both knees.  Opiates have been prescribed by my doctor for my pain until I could barely function.  They have the ability to take the pain away, but they also erode your ambition and personality with long term use.  So what's the solution?  The doctor prescribes another pill.  \n\nI got off of the pills by mixing a teaspoonful of kratom into my coffee or tea twice a day and have been doing this for a year.  I don't mix it with other psychoactive substances except caffeine.  Kratom gives me relief, ambition, and in some ways helps my mood.  Kratom is a miracle plant that has restored my life and given me optimism for the present and the future. \n\nTaking kratom away from the people that rely on it will increase the abuse of deadly substances like heroin, hydrocodone, and alcohol.  More people will die from overdoses.  A black market for kratom will be created and good people will be labeled criminals for simply wanting to be able to feel relief for their pain and afflictions.  \n\nOne word describes the ridiculous pursuit of a kratom ban, and that word is greed.  Those that want it banned are looking for the big payout when it is finally established that this plant has medicinal properties, but just for once can we let the people decide what's right for them rather than the government?  I'm tired of the government telling me, a grown man with a good family and good career, what I should be doing and how I should be living.\n\nSincerely,\nM.D.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21754","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mick anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not make the beneficial Kratom plant into a schedule 1 substance.

I used Kratom several years ago for a time span of about 1 year while struggling through difficult times and debilitating social anxiety. This was a period of my life when everything seemed to go wrong due to unforeseeable events and was in financial trouble.\n\nI decided to use Kratom because an alternative would have probably been to take prescription antidepressants which have many known side effects that I couldn't risk putting myself through. (www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825) I also didn't have health insurance which prevented me from accessing the drug. Kratom on the other hand is accessible to everyone since it is a leaf found in nature and from my experience without adverse side effects. Kratom's subtle energizing effects helped keep my attitude positive and stay motivated without being dependent on it. I took it as needed about 2 - 3 times a week in a similar fashion to how I would consume coffee to start my day. After about a year's time passed, I no longer felt the need for Kratom, so I stopped taking it and did so without any issues. I genuinely believe that Kratom helped me remain a productive member of society during these difficult times. \n\nTaking my experience into consideration and many others on the internet who have benefited from Kratom, the government would be doing a huge disservice to the public (and probably an illegal one since it clearly doesn't meet the criteria of a Schedule 1 drug) to revoke access to this natural supplement and criminalizing it's use.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17776","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 58 year old man.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

I am a student at Columbia Community College, a massage therapist, a musician and an accountant's assistant. I am strongly opposed to the DEA putting Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substance. I started supplementing with Kratom in early 2016 after it was recommended to me by a friend who found it useful for combating anxiety and depression. I suffer from PTSD and Depression and I have found Kratom to be an invaluable tool in my struggle against both of these. As such, I oppose the ban as I have firsthand experience of Kratom's positive effects. \n\nI've finally returned to college this semester after 3 years of being unable to due to my struggle with depression. I have finally returned to the social spheres that I retreated from due to anxiety caused by PTSD. This is largely thanks to my supplementing with Kratom. I have, at worst, had mild nausea resulting from the use of the plant. This is a far cry from the side-effects I've experienced (suicidal thoughts, insomnia, weight gain, etc.) from the prescribed pharmaceuticals that i used to take. \n\nIf this plants alkaloids were to be made illegal, I am afraid that I and many thousands of other responsible Kratom using Americans might  be forced to resort to taking pharmaceuticals with serious side-effects that might not even be fully effective on an individual basis. I am afraid that thousands of American veterans and others with chronic pain, opiate addiction, PTSD, or other issues may resort to self-medicating with dangerous street drugs like heroin.

This is in contrast to most mu-opioid receptor agonists, like oxycodone, morphine, codeine, etc. that do cause fatal respiratory depression.

I was introduced to Kratom by a very close friend of mine and it was a miracle, Kratom helped me make it through the withdraw from prescription pain medicine. It helped me get my life back, gave my husband back his wife and my children now have their mother. Not only did it help me become free of my addiction, but helps keep my migraines under control. My story is like many others who suffer from chronic pain and/or addiction. Taking Kratom from law abiding, tax paying Americans will hurt so many people. There will be hundreds of people resorting back to narcotics or herion. I truly hope that our lives matter enough for our voices to be heard.

Most of them are now dead because of it. Of course, I too had terrible issues with alcohol dependency as well as other drugs. I started taking kratom daily about three years ago to combat addiction to prescription opiates. Prior to that, I was just drinking incredible amounts of alcohol to try and come even close to making life without those things livable. Going through my regular routine of making absolutely sure I had alcohol ready to go prior to going to work on my night shift, I one night bought 3 bottles of wine and a bottle of vodka. Went through the night not really realizing that I wasn't drinking, but the next day realizing that I had not even opened any of the alcohol. I would have had a panic attack requiring an ER visit if I did this before from the lack of the alcohol that my body desperately craved. I not only did not, but woke up feeling great. For the first time in as long as I can remember. I took my normal dose of kratom, showered and went to work. It was a wonderful day. I felt clean. I don't know how else to describe it. I did not immediately make the connection that it was the kratom that was somehow curbing my alcohol addiction.\n\nI have been clean and sober for over two years now. I had given up. Thought I was just going end up just like my mother and father. I feel great. Still take kratom daily, though I don't feel like I have to. I also had severe anxiety issues. These are gone with daily kratom use. The only thing it does not stop is an occasional sudden panic attack, which are less frequent now than they were even when I was wasted all the time.\n\nThis feeling of normality in my life is priceless. I have a wonderful girlfriend, a little family and some close friends. If kratom is made illegal, so many people who have experienced exactly what I did will die. There is no doubt in my mind of this. I've never been a heroin addict, but I've heard the stories of some. Just waiting for that dose that they don't come back from. And kratom allows them to lead normal lives.\n\nPlease, consider what you are doing here guys. So many people's lives are in your hands. I know people in the online communities that have been using kratom for 10 years and have zero health issues. Like perfect health. Anything you can find wrong with this incredible plant with be dwarfed by the help it has provided. Yes, it's addictive. Like coffee is addictive. And wow, cigarettes. Will you be able to sleep at night knowing that you are selling this ban as a \"public health emergency \" while I can smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol freely? I don't think you will. Speaking of which, I also smoked cigarettes for several years and now have zero desire for them. Man, I don't even drink coffee anymore. So much good is being done in this realm. Don't mess this one up guys. Please.\n\nBest wishes,\nJosh","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18852","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Josh Wood","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello!\n   I used Kratom for 3 1/2 weeks to taper down off of a serious drug addiction.

During that time I was on heavy opiates for numerous conditions, but mainly terrible osteoarthritis in my back, and knees. I was tired of the way these pills/patches made me feel. Lethargic, as well as altering my moods.\nI felt the pain management Dr. Really had no real vested interest in me, or in seeing me improve. It was all about the mighty dollar.\nI searched the web for natural alternatives, when I heard about Kratom. Long story short, I received my order, then began to keep a log of how much I used, adjusting the amount until I found what worked for me.

I have two bulging discs in my mid back, Osteoarthritis in both of my knees, which I've been told I'm too young for a knee replacement, and Osteoarthritis in my lower back, which causes me excruciating pain.  I receive all of my medical care from the Oklahoma City VA Hospital.  I've been through six different doctors in the last 16 years, some better than others.  I received a steroid injection in my lower back, once, ONCE, and more injections in my knees than I can count.  Now a team of doctors, the pain management team, and the Neurology department got together and decided that there was nothing else they could do for my back pain, except give me Tylenol #3, which has Codein and Tylenol in it; my primary care doctor gives me a muscle relaxer.  BUT, the OKC VA seems to be on a mission of taking away Veteran's pain medication.  I'm not the only one this is happening to!  That's right, all I have for my excruciating pain now is plain Tylenol and the muscle relaxer.  The maximum daily dose for Tylenol is 3,000mg per 24 hours, it is not good for the liver.  Once I heard about Kratom, I gave it a try and it absolutely took all of my pain away; it also helps me sleep, which had been all but impossible due to the pain.  Due to my time in the Army, I have been diagnosed with PTSD and Depression, both of which I have medication for because my mood is sometimes labile.  Thanks to Kratom, my mood has become more on an even kilter, which makes me and my husband happier.  Please take my words as actual testimony that Kratom works.  I mix it with my hot tea and honey or with yogurt, and it's as good as or better than an opiate, even though it is not an opiate, it is an opioid.  With Kratom, I don't have to worry about my liver being inundated by Tylenol.

Over the past several years I have come to see Kratom help a number of people, myself included. I have one friend who was injured in a car accident and was taking numerous medicines for pain and just to get through the day. She wanted to lead a normal life again but her dependency on narcotic painkillers and their affect on her daily activities was an everyday concern. She couldn't drive herself around or work. I recommended that she try Kratom and within several months, she was able to move around better and didn't feel like she was in a \"fog\" from the prescription medicines. I have seen Kratom completely change her life and she has been thankful to me since for the recommendation.\nAs for me, I had a very bad fall down the steps when my daughter was a baby.  I woke every morning after that aching and having a hard time getting out of bed to take care of my children. I am not one to take synthetic prescription medicines so I found myself in a dilemma of not wanting to be on regular medicine but needed something to help. I started doing research into natural supplements and I came across Kratom. I decided to give it a try and within a short amount of time, realized how much it was helping me. When the pain was too much, I would have a little Kratom tea and it made it possible for me to get back to my normal routine.  I now only take it very infrequently when my pain flares up. This supplement helped me be able to care for my children in a time when I was very troubled about how I would accomplish my daily activities. I don't feel dependent on something which is a relief because I know too many people that rely on prescriptions on a daily basis. \nI believe that this leaf was a lifesaver for myself and my friend. I have read many stories since then of others who have used it for more serious afflictions and addictions and I know that it has saved lives. \nThe people that turn to Kratom are regular everyday people, doctors, teachers, mothers who are not criminals or addicts. People who have looked to treat themselves naturally and have had success without getting addicted to narcotics.  I believe that to take this natural medicine from all of the people that it has helped would be devastating and push some people back in to dependency that they have fought hard to change.  Never once have I heard anyone who has had any bad experiences with Kratom and I know it's been a life changer for many including myself.\nThanks again for taking time to read my opinions and for helping many of us to continue with a healthy full life free of dangerous medicines.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5884","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Wendy Boatwright","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratum has drastically improved my quality of life.

These include peripheral neuropathy, sciatica, cramping/spasms, eye pain, migraine and bursitis.\n\nI do take pharmaceutical pain medication, but it does not cover all of my pain and I am reluctant to increase my dose level. It also doesn't address the fatigue and cognitive fog that greatly impact my quality of life. Kratom addresses both for me. Kratom provides a slight mood lift but does not get me high. It sharpens my cognition which allows me to operate at a much faster pace. It eases my pain and gives me energy that I desperately need. \n\nIf I believed kratom was a truly dangerous mind-altering substance I would want it to be controlled and regulated, but it is not necessary. This natural substance should be made abundantly available to all Americans without restriction, and should also be studied by our researchers and that knowledge shared with the people. There is a very real opioid epidemic which both needs to be addressed more aggressively and which this very plant can positively impact.

Until someone recommended me to try Kratom and I figured I would give it a shot since it was an all natural plant. I made sure I did plenty of research on it before trying it and when I saw nothing but good things to come from it and absolute no danger in it I was definitely on board. After taking it I felt relief I hadn't felt in 7 years. I actually felt like I could go run and kick the soccer ball like I used to and soon enough I did! I have been able to do almost everything I used to without breaking down in pain. It feels like I'm my self again, my family has even been in awe of the impact it has made on my life.

I was completely surprised and astounded that the DEA gave only a 30 day notice with no period for comment.\n\n I have been using Kratom for over 2 years now, with very positive results regarding my mood and anxiety levels. I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder 3 years ago and prescribed Sertraline at 150mg/day. I continue to take my medication as prescribed, however it does leave several unwanted side effects. After doing an examination of published work, interested organizations, testimonials, and mentioning it to my psychiatrist, I decided to try it.\n\nI started with approximately 3 grams of a strain popularly known as \"green malay\" and the results were just how they had been described in several testimonials. The sense of \"calm\" and a general feeling of well-being was apparent. In addition, I felt an increased desire to share my thoughts more openly, especially with my wife. I've had no desire to increase the amount and it has remained at 3 grams since I started.\n\nEver since I started Kratom, both my personal life and professional life have benefited. I've received 2 very significant promotions (currently managing a large team) and I've submitted just under 20 invention disclosures to the patent office. As for my personal life, some of the very unwanted side effects from Sertraline such as low libido and the inability to reach sexual climax, have been drastically reduced and at times completely gone.\n\nSome of the Kratom side effects include an increase in sweating, drowsiness (in larger doses), and a slight numbing of my tongue (where the Kratom made contact). Fortunately, these side effects are tolerable and mostly unnoticeable.\n\nI hope that Kratom remains legal and additional funding for research is encouraged so that scientific studies can further unlock the potential and promise of Kratom.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15754","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tomas Frausto","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 41 year old husband and father of three, and a fully functioning, law abiding member of society.

I am 38 years old and I was once a software developer. I suffer from severe, chronic depression, anxiety, tiredness, and suicidal thoughts that have impaired me to a point that for the past four years I have been unable to support myself or cope with regular employment. Some of my siblings have similar problems. I have found that kratom, while not a cure, is amazingly effective at temporarily relieving my symptoms and getting me through especially rough times, thereby protecting me from suicide and even enabling me to enjoy life while I seek a cure. None of the over twenty prescription medications I have tried over the years has helped me, and neither have doctors or therapists. Not only have doctors failed me, but also herbalists, religious people, and lifestyle changes.\n\nRight now, kratom is the only treatment I have, and it has been a great blessing in my life. I am thankful to my brother for introducing me to it several months ago. My life has improved greatly because of it. With kratom's help I can accomplish more, and be more willing to continue seeking a real cure. Just knowing it is there for me if I need it helps me relax and avoid panic.\n\n\nHow Kratom Helps Me\n----------------------------\nThrough experimentation I found three different varieties of kratom that are beneficial to me. Each supports me in a different way.\n\nOne strain helps me with stress, anxiety, panic, and despair. When I take it, I soon feel cheerful, hopeful, and at ease again, and I can reengage socially or relax for sleep, or whatever I need to do.\n\nAnother strain helps me with depression-induced lethargy and lack of motivation. It seems to energize my emotions so that I can care about things again, and feel inspired to get off the couch, get outside and exercise or run errands, and enjoy doing it. \n\nThe third variety, which is actually a blend of two strains, helps me when I am physically lethargic. It seems to energize my body rather than my emotions. I use it when I am in good shape emotionally, but need a physical boost, or need help getting over morning grog.\n\n\nKratom's Effects Are Relatively Subtle\n------------------------------------------------\nKratom is not a \"main event\" herb, at least not in the amounts and in the form in which I use it. I use only plain, powdered leaf that has not been enhanced with concentrated extracts, and I generally take 1.5 - 3 grams (0.75 - 1.5 tsp.) per dose orally, up to twice in a day. So I cannot speak for concentrated extract products or large doses. My doses do not give an overwhelming or exciting effect, but a very pleasant and uplifting one. The effect does not replace life experience, but helps me engage with life and enjoy it. It is nothing like so powerful as, for instance, cannabis, and it lasts only a few hours at best. Kratom also causes me no impairment of any kind.\n\nFrom all I have read about kratom, these statements are also true for large doses and enhanced products. I have seen no account that described kratom as being useful as a party drug, or as causing impairment.\n\nI see kratom as an aid to continuing to live my life and even enjoying it a bit until I find a real cure.\n\n\nNo Addiction Problems or Negative Effects (For My Family) \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI have not experienced any addiction to kratom, and neither have any of my family. That may vary by person (we also have no addiction problems with such commonly addictive chemicals as alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine). My brother and I, who use kratom most heavily, have used kratom regularly for weeks or months, and then abstained from it entirely for up to a week and experienced no negative effects from the lack of it. We also have not experienced any major negative side effects from its use.\n\n\nBanning Kratom Will Do More Harm Than Good \n------------------------------------------------------------\n[Omitted due to character limit. Please see PDF version]\n\n\nKratom Is Remarkably Safe, Judging By the DEA's Statistics\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKratom, even by the DEA's account, seems have an extremely low risk. The DEA claims that 660 kratom-related calls were placed to poison control centers between January 2010 and December 2015 and up to 15 kratom-related deaths between 2014 and 2016 (I think this was revised to 1). These numbers, especially over those time periods, are insignificant in my opinion. Moreover, a mere call to a poison control center does not necessarily indicate a true emergency. And if we are to blame the calls and deaths on kratom, we must at least determine if any other, dangerous, substances were involved. I am not aware that this research has been done by the DEA, except perhaps in the case of the deaths, which I believe is why the reported count was reduced to 1.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20163","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My boyfriend has been using Kratom for almost a year now.

It is not a deadly drug that gets people high. In fact, people that purchased it in hopes to find an alternative 'high' from opiates were sorely disappointed. People that are looking for a drug experience pick up kratom, realize it for what it is, and then move on. The majority of people that purchase kratom are serious about their sobriety and their health. Please allow researchers and other individuals to continue their work with this amazing tree. A more appropriate action would be to allow the states to decide if an 18+ purchasing law would work. In general, banning any sort of plant, unless it is deadly, is not conducive to anything we strive for as a society.

I love that it is a substance that I can take when I need it but don't have the accompanying anxiety of needing to take it to feel normal, which I experienced after getting my wisdom teeth removed and being prescribed Vicodin. After my prescription ran out I felt uneasy,  anxious and aggressive, as if I didn't have any coffee after waking up but much worse\n. \nThat has not once happened with Kratom, nor is there a comparable feeling to a prescription pain pill either, which is the general misconception. Sometimes coffee makes you feel really good but you're not going to drink as much as you can or break into someones house and rob them so you can make a Starbucks run. I think that classifying Kratom as a schedule 1 drug would be detrimental to the advancement of pain management in our country, especially considering the issues we are seeing with people becoming addicted to pills and moving on to harder drugs when their prescription runs out, which is something that I assume most people have had happen to someone they're close to. \n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider the scheduling of Kratom so that it may continue to help people in need and eventually become a legitimate, studied,  and beneficial medicine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6225","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Dziurman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI have suffered from extreme pain due to several health issues, some including migraine pain, a tumor and blood clots In my brain.

I have personally seen it first hand save my brothers life and actually give my mom a life.  My brother fell into a heroin and opiod addiction. He was so bad not only was he shooting it but he was stealing from our whole family. Taking any and all valuables and money for drugs. My dad found him one night unresponsive on the floor in his room. He was rushed to hospital and is lucky to be alive. Since he got out he found kratom and it has changed his life. He is a productive member of society working a solid job installing commercial sprinkler systems. He was promoted within a year and is working and studying to get his journeyman's license. He has not touched any drug since because of kratom. He currently lives with myself and my daughter part time. He is an amazing uncle to her always trying to teach her something or be with her. He is not the same person he was before he found kratom.  \nMy mom on the other hand struggles with numerous heath issues. She suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic migraines unknown to mankind that keeps her in bed roughly 85% of her life along with other issues. She has suffered with  these for over 20 years. She had these leads permanently installed in her head to help her migraines and they did nothing. So now she has to live with all these wires and boxes in her body that doesn't relieve any of her pain.  She has seen every type of doctor, been turned down by mayo clinics for no legitimate reason, she has been on almost every medication and pharmaceutical ever created. The only relief she gets and the only way she can get out of bed at times is kratom. It allows her to actually see her 4 year grand daughter at times even though she lives only 15 mins away. It's saved both my brother and mother's life for different reasons. I am currently a 33 year old white male with a 4 year old daughter as a single dad. I have a bachelors degree in finance and currently work as a Realtor and sales rep for a new home construction company. My mom used to be a registered nurse at the University of Michigan before her health problems became to much to continue working. I currently take it for anxiety and stress and none of us have ever had any symptoms of withdrawal or any kind of \"high\" from using it. It's become our go to supplement and I am scared if it gets taken away or banned in America my brother will start using drugs again and will end up dead very soon and my mom will be in bed 24/7 having nothing of a life.  This harmless supplement has saved my family, please look at the facts and all the other testimonies on how many people kratom has helped and saved. Thank you for listening to our comments.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20514","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Murdza","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am unfortunately a person who deals with PTSD, anxiety,  arthritis and depression.

I'm currently a University graduate, studied IT.\n\nI opposed the DEA's actions to ban Kratom because of its lack of studies that shows it is actually dangerous and based on personal experience Kratom is not dangerous and is well tolerated.\n \nI started using Kratom 1 year ago while searching for natural alternatives for depression and anxiety. I have been diagnosed with severe depression, generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety.\n\nKratom helps me remain calm when my anxiety gets too much to handle. It helps eases my mind of depression when I'm depressed. It also helps my physical pain from various things or physical extended exertion. My depression and anxiety disorders have been significantly reduced now. I can function and have a good day instead of a bad day and wishing I was dead for the moment.\n\nKratom has been proven to be safe by millions of users throughout thousands of years.

Coffee actually is too stimulating for me and is hard on my nervous system. \n\nIf it was a dangerous people would be dying. Instead it helps me live a better life instead of turning to pharmaceutical drugs with dangerous side effects. I have the right to decided how to treat my aliments. The DEA has no authority to tell us otherwise when the evidence is clear that Kratom does not pose a hazard to public health. \n\nKratom should remain legal in all of the United State of America and around the world. Just imagine how many live will be lost and negatively affected if kratom is made illegal. Families will be destroyed and hurt. It will just create worse problems on the failing War on Drugs. Upright citizens from teachers to elderly citizens will be arrested for possessing a medicinal herb that helps them function as a productive member of society. The obvious choice is to keep Kratom remain legal. Anyone with an upright and righteous heart can see this and past the false lies put on Kratom by evil forces at work.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13018","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jacob Cruz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI'm here today to include myself in the large number of people who have all banded together for a single cause.

If you are even considering taking kratom away PLEASE try it for yourself so you can understand how ridiculous that is. It is like a strong cup of coffee with no jitters. It's effects are mild while being strong enough to effectively help people feel better overall. \nThere are plenty of good reasons for the DEA & FDA to exist but stuff like this is infuriating. I'm an adult. If I want to use a SAFE herbal supplement that has significantly LESS risk than something I can buy at just about any gas station- I should be able to. \nKratom has helped hundreds of thousands of people either get off opiates or avoid getting on then all together. While being safe. Why on earth would you want to stop that, especially in the middle of an obvious opiate epidemic in the country? This decision is literally life & death for many people. \nTo this day there has still not been a single death attributed to kratom alone. While kratom is relatively new to the US it has been used for ages in other countries- safely. The few deaths they tried to blame kratom on had other drugs (like fentanyl for goodness sake) or other medical problems involved. There is no public health crisis involving kratom. That said, there is evidence that overdose deaths have increased in areas that banned kratom. Please let common sense win this one! It's absurd.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13449","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Heather Patrick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern, First let me congratulate you on making the wise decision not to pursue emergency scheduling of Kratom. It is not only my opinion, but my experience that this is an extremely valuable substance with minimal health-dangers. It would be very rational to conduct medical research and attempt to develop medications both for pain and for opiate de-addiction based on the alkaloids of the Kratom plant. In the meantime, the free use of Kratom should not be banned, since it is literally saving lives. I firmly believe that the prohibition of Kratom would lead to an immediate spike in opiate overdose deaths, since so many chronic pain-sufferers as well as recovering addicts rely on it to avoid using the much more dangerous prescription and non-prescription opiates, which as you know are killing more Americans than any other drug. \n\nMy own experience of Kratom: First let me tell you that I am a university professor, a highly functional and respected scholar and member of society. I suffer from a very rare inherited neurological disorder (Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia), whose symptoms first began manifesting in an urgent way just as i began my career at the University of Hawaii four years ago.  The disease compromises the lower body and the resulting destabilization often has, as in my base, secondary effects on the body that can be quite profound. I suffer from acute and chronic lower back-pain that can severely restrict my mobility. Four years ago I found myself on regular long-acting Morphine pills as well as substantial doses of Hydrocodone. Despite the side-effects of these drugs--the physical lethargy, emotional dulling, etc.--the alternative, not being able to function, was worse. Overtime, I found the side-effects of regular opiate use to be almost as bad as the physical pain, and I was desperate to find a way to escape them.\nThis is when I started using Kratom, which allowed me to gradually end my physical dependence on prescription painkillers as well as to manage my pain and extreme stiffness. Now i require occasional prescription painkillers when the pain becomes very severe, but Kratom has freed me from the total dependence which literally threatened to ruin my life.\n\nKratom has far fewer side-effects and health risks than prescription painkillers. It is not nearly as psychoactive so that one is able to maintain a clear head, emotional and physical presence, while also managing moderate to severe pain. It also produces nothing like the physical addiction of conventional opiates. Furthermore it does not lead to mounting-tolerance and increased dosage like conventional opiates. It has a plateau effect where after titration the same dose remains effective long-term. It does not produce respiratory depression and seems to have zero potential for overdose death. It is also a strong anti-oxidant and may actually support one's overall health, rather than harming it.\n\nIn the context of the present opiate epidemic, restriction of the availability of the one healthy alternative would be just about the most counterproductive action that one could imagine. Again, if Kratom becomes illegal and unavailable countless chronic pain-patients and recovering drug addicts will be thrust back into the arms of highly addictive and dangerous drugs. This will be inevitably correlated with a spike in overdose deaths, as well as a spike in the profits of drug companies. It would be unscientific, anti-social, and fundamentally immoral. If the DEA had gone ahead with its plan at the end of October it would have literally had blood on its hands, while big pharma raked in a few more blood-stained dollars.\n\nI hope the DEA is receptive to these public comments as well as the views of the scientific and medical community on this issue. Making a wrong decision on this would essentially constitute terrorism.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3649","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"University of Hawai'i, Mnoa","postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jesse Knutson PhD","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Help people with addiction","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10938","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Kedian","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This ban is going to allow the black market to regulate kratom which has helped so many people including myself.

Honestly I feel like a new person after I've started drinking kratom tea in the morning. I'm able to actually talk to strangers and go out in the world and be productive. There was a time when I'd go weeks without leaving the house, but after taking this herbal supplement, I've found a renewed positive energy and the motivation to improve my life. This was after Prozac and Wellbutrin completely failed to do anything for me. \n \nI hate taking \"drugs\" (and have never taken ANY illegal substances ever.) so I researched it a lot before I started drinking it. I found plenty of evidence and research that says it's completely non-dangerous and non-addictive and okay to take in moderate quantities for the long term. I'm sure anyone who is truly neutral on the subject with no ulterior motives will be swayed by the vast majority of positive stories and research on this herbal supplement. I gave myself a chance to hear the negative stories out there as well but have found they've either been debunked or proven as someone taking it irresponsibly in excess (like eating a whole cup of the powder which I'm not even sure is possible).\n\nIf this herb was made illegal I'm not sure what I'd do. Honestly I felt so ridiculous when I heard they were going to schedule kratom, like one day I am perfectly fine buying an herbal tea from a small business and then all of a sudden the next day I'm a criminal- just because someone in an office somewhere whose never taken kratom decided to listen to some fear-mongering comments by a few paranoid people. It made me think a lot about our laws and legal processes and made me want to get involved. I'm not going to go into the specific articles and studies about kratom because there are a lot of people out there smarter than I who have typed up some really great letters about the subject.\n\nI just want to add in my voice to balance out some of the negative comments made by fake accounts with some unknown end-goal and major biases.

However, if kratom is  moved to schedule 1 the countless people, myself included, who were able to replace life threatening opiates with kratom will no longer have this viable alternative.\n\nTherefore I humbly urge you to think long and hard about the opioid epidemic our country is currently embroiled in and decide if kratom is one tool in our collective arsenal to help ameliorate the deleterious effects of this epidemic.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12420","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeremy Jones","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep kratom legal","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6288","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason Smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be made illegal.

I started using kratom because someone told me it was great to use to get off opiates. I abused opiates for four years of my life and I hated being addicted to something so dangerous so this kratom definitely perked my interests. I tried some at work one day and found that it worked quite well as far as giving you energy and increasing productivity, weeks went on and I finally decided I was ready to quit opiates so I started ordering kratom. I have been taking kratom for over 3 months now at least twice a day. 4 grams per dose roughly. I haven't taken a single opiate since I started using kratom. It definitely does have some side effects. in larger amounts you will be sweaty, get dry mouth, irritable, sometimes even itchy. may experience stomach pain if you do not eat well while consuming kratom. so not all of it is well, and who knows what long term effects it has if used frequently. I wanted to know if you could withdrawal off of kratom though so I stopped using it for a few days to see the effects. There were definitely some effects. I would temporarily get chills randomly throughout the day. I was very tired. I had the urge to take more and I had very sore muscles. I only stoped using it for a few days but just in those few days I was feeling basically normal again and it was nowhere near what opiates were to me but I haven't used kratom for an extended amount of time. I don't thin kratom is something that should be completely illegal. after all it is just a plant, but we know that doesn't matter. thank you for your time I hope any of this may help in deciding this matter","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17494","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Travis Majeski","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,  I am a 29 year old Store Manager for a local independent business. I am writing to tell my story to explain why I oppose kratom being put on the schedule 1 list of controlled substances by the DEA. Here is my thoughts on why kratom should remain off the list of scheduled substances.\n\nI found out about kratom 4 years ago. I have depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. I had, 4 years ago, also a severe eating disorder. But and happy to say that now I am healthy. I am proud to say that I have a successful career, a beautiful home, and a family. These are things I thought I'd never be able to do/have while I suffered so much with my problems. I think somehow, Kratom tea might be a small part of what has helped me manage my depression and recover from my eating disorder. Its been a multi-faceted journey but I do believe the tea has contributed. From my diet, exercise, and work I have learned how to balance my life day to day to improve it to take me to where I am now. I no longer suffer from any eating disorders, and although my depression is not gone, it is now manageable. \n\nAround 6 years ago I saw my cousin - who also suffered and struggled with depression - eventually go to the doctor to see if they could help him. I saw him fade away when his doctors prescribed him supposedly \"safe\" medications for his depression and back pain. When he started taking these intoxicating medications, my family and I witnessed him changing for the worse until when, 4 and a half years ago, he overdosed and died from prescription pain pills. Due to becoming addicted to the medications he was prescribed, he lost his career, his house, and his family. I saw this charismatic and formerly successful man waste away physically and mentally from the disease of addiction to prescription pills. Clearly these medications are dangerous. \n\nBut kratom tea isn't anything like those prescription medications. It's not intoxicating or addictive, and I have never experienced any ill effects that have been rumored to occur with Kratom. It's just a tea. Yet the DEA seems to think the tea leaf is so dangerous that it needs to be controlled, scheduled, and/or even banned. Why not focus on actual drugs that claim people's life year to year? So many Americans go down the same path as my cousin did. Situations like those is where the real problem lies in America's drug epidemic. Kratom is not a drug and is certainly not something that you could overdose on or \"get high\" with like people do with drugs. \n\nThe problem doesn't lie with the natural tea leaf kratom. I just don't understand why anyone would want to ban or schedule a tea leaf that is harmless and might help people in a safe way. Much like coffee, or chamomile tea, or St Johns Wort might help people. It is certainly equally as harmless as those things. It isn't comparable in any way to the drugs found on the DEA's list of controlled substances. So it shouldn't be put on that list. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe kratom should remain off the schedule 1 list of controlled substances. I believe it shouldn't be scheduled at all. Because Kratom is not harmful and it is not something you could \"overdose\" on. It is not even close to being dangerous like the prescription medications my cousin was prescribed and eventually took his own life with. How could anyone say it is more or just as dangerous as that? It has been taken safely for decades and is just as harmless as coffee. That has been proven to me time and time again throughout 4 years. I can attest that my life has improved throughout those years and it has taken a lot of work. Depression is a blanket that is difficult to get out from under. But Kratom tea has, I think, helped in a way for me to be healthier and more mindful to keep balance in my life. So please don't take that away.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16700","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mika Gillispie","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, I discovered Kratom a few years back while struggling with a pain pill addiction I had gotten from hurting myself Roofing. I'm somewhat of a research fanatic so immediately started researching everything I could find about the drug. At that time there was little negative to say about it.  I found than its history withbMankind and the benefits that it has shown throughout the years. Also that it is directly related to coffee and not much more powerful. It just activates different parts of the brain. I've noticed that there can be a mild withdrawal comparable to caffeine withdrawal. But through my research I found out that I had so many more benefits. For example, my daughter has extreme eczema which no medicine or steroids seems to cure. Non fragrance all-natural soap with kratom leaves added to it is the best thing we have found for her skin. Also there are overdoses in my town almost every other week. These are people that cannot find Suboxone doctors and obviously have a drug problem. I believe if Kratom was legal people would have a safe alternative to help them stop relying on heroin and pain pills. Do not get me wrong, the feeling you get from kratom is not a powerful high that someone would get from pills or heroin. It is enough to stop pain and to lighten the withdrawal effects of heavy opiates. Kratom was outlawed in Indiana years ago due to the spice Frenzy. Kratom is in no way shape or form related to spice but that is a state related issue. Alcohol is horrible, marijuana is popping up legal state after State and Kratom is a mild plant that has many safe and reliable benefits.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18094","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Fisher","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have personally witnessed what Kratom can do for someone that suffers daily with endometriosis.

Schedule 1 drugs run rampant through all of the US; your agency's arrests do nothing to stop the actual flow of illegal substances. What the arrests do accomplish is ruining the lives of average Americans who are only trying to survive in a society that's already staked against them.\n\nPlease, to anyone that may be able to affect a change, take heed my words: the lives of millions of people depend on your open-mindedness to a peaceful alternative to this nonsensical drug war. In the same vein, please refrain from rescheduling Kratom.

The 5 miscarriage took a toll on me, intense depression hit me. After my fifth miscarriage at five months, pregnant was the worst because the fetus was already formed. MY days were full of sadness and pain making it hard to care for my other children, I was unable to function as a normal adult. I also suffer from chronic pain due to endometriosis, arthritis, and chronic kidney stones. The pain and depression mixed together made it real hard for me, my days were spent  in my bed full of sorrow and pain. My life was going downhill quickly it seems that I had no hope left with life. Every day I would wake up just hoping the day would be over with, I really didn't know how long I could continue like this.I was  at a point where I felt life would be better dead than to continue this life of misery. I still can remember seeing my baby dead in my hands, this must be one of the most painful experiences I had and that of mother's death when I was only 21 years old. 3 years ago I was one day looking through the net and came to find kratom, I ordered  100 grams of kratom. 4 days later I received the kratom, I was real  reluctant taking this , so the kratom sat on my desk for a week or so. One day I was feeling so bad that I said to myself I have nothing to lose. I took the kratom and with a week or so I started to feel so much better. I was no longer in my bed, I was playing with my children. After a month of taking kratom my life  improved quite a bit, I was looking for a job i was cooking,cleaning and caring for my children. A month later my youngest daughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Many think it is like type 2 diabetes but it is far from type 2. With type 1 diabetes my daughter needs constant attention , she has to inject herself 5 times daily, check her blood sugars all the time,it is very hard work taking care of her. Nights are especially fighting because if her blood sugar level is too high she can die if it is too low she can die, I am awake most of the nights. Her pancreas just decided not to work anymore  after  her diagnosed I felt as my depression was starting to kick back in but it did not. The kratom helped me greatly, the depression never really hit me,it did not take away all my sadness but it did help greatly. 3 years later now I am doing great I am working,cooking, cleaning, going on outings with my kids and caring for my children. kratom really helped me become a functioning adult. If kratom is taken away I fear for my future, I fear for a future of pain and depression. I really do not want to go back to that life of being in my bed with sadness   and pain. I need to be A functioning  adult to care for my children especially my youngest of 10 with type 1 diabetes.  Kratom is relatively harmless like camolie tea, I have not  had any negative side effects from kratom except for vomiting if I take to much. I  also like to mention that the less kratom token is best, it does not matter if you take a lot of kratom you still have the same effects , it has a ceiling effect.  I do not get high from kratom, like stated above taking more does nothing but cause vomiting. Please do not schedule  kratom, kratom has helped me in many ways.  I believe kratom should be a dietary supplement, I take iron for my anemia and should be able to take kratom for my pain and depression. Kratom should be available to adults,  I do agree that there should be an age limit of 18 and over and also taken away from the head shops.  Kratom has helped improve my life. I DO NOT WANT TO GO BACK BEING BED RIDDEN, please keep kratom available.

I came across Kratom while doing an internet search for alternative pain relief for my husband who had just come out of his 7th back surgery in April of 2016 and on top of the recovery from that he came out with neuropathy and could barely walk. \n\nHe has been on Oxycodone or other opiates after each of his surgeries and because of the way his system is, he has been highly resistant to any opiate pain medication and it takes way more for him than the medical field will give him so getting decent pain relief has been a 35 year battle for him.  Not only does Kratom help him tremendously with his pain, it is also a great natural herb plant to get him off opiate pain killers that works.  \n\nThis natural plant that is related to the coffee plant has no side effects, is not a drug, does not cause a high like the other drugs that the DEA wants to put this in the same category as such as marijuana, heroin and the like.  I just recently found this wonderful natural plant that gives my husband more pain relief than opiates do and am not only very worried that if this unreasonable ban goes into effect, where that will leave him and the millions of others that rely on this plant just to be able to get out of bed each day without the dangerous side effects of opiates.  If this ban goes into effect I believe the number of overdoses due to people going back to opiates such as heroin, oxy and the like will skyrocket.  There is not a single case of a death associated solely from Kratom and the 15 deaths that are on record all had other opiates/drugs mixed with the Kratom.  Tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of people die each year from overdosing on opiates.  Opiates are way, way more dangerous than Kratom.  Kratom should not be made a Schedule 1 narcotic.  Please leave this plant alone and let it help the people that need it so much, including my husband.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nConnie H.\nMinneapolis, MN  55420","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3496","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Connie H","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please reconsider the ban on Kratom.

I may or may not try it at some point because I have had bouts of anxiety in the past but I do not like the option of taking most medications, especially those known to be addictive.  It's comforting to know people are exploring more natural options to treat pain, anxiety and depression. I do believe 100% that pain medicine addiction is an epidemic and I know a number of people who suffer from chronic pain and have no options other than extremely addictive prescription meds that come with a variety of negative side effects.  I believe it's the DEA's responsibility to conduct appropriate investigations into the health benefits, or possible risk, of Kratom before taking it away from the many individuals who have been using it with no issue for years.  Medicine should be regulated based on how they benefit/harm American citizens, not on how it affects the bottom line for the big pharmaceutical companies.  If Kratom is really helping people kick opiate addiction and is helping treat people without any significant side effects, the government should be rushing to investigate.  Do the proper studies and if it is helping people then more people should know about it.  This might be the perfect thing for many Americans that are feeling like they don't have any options.  I appreciate that the DEA opened up this website and are actually listening to the opinions of the people.  This is how real progress is made.  Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17686","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jacob Kolb","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 37 year old mother and wife who suffers from a debilitating desease called interstitial cystitis. IC- intersticial cystitis, also called a painfull bladder, is a condition that had my bladder covered in open sores or wounds. Its pain is compaired to stage 4 bone cancer. After my diagnosis i tried eveything under the sun to help myself get better, from prescription medications to vitamins, teas, diet etc. Because of the chronic pain i was suffering from depression, anxiety and the overall loss of will for life. I had days where i felt like dying. I thought this cannot be my life. I was taking pain medications such as norco every single day for two years but still wasnt getting the relief i needed to be able to function, work and care for my children. By desperation and coincidence i found kratom online, researched it and started taking it as part of my daily rx routine. Kratom changed my life. I was finally able to wake up in the morning and feel like living instead of dying. I take very little amounts which are enough to take the pain away. Since there is no cure for IC, this is something i will have till the day i die, kratom is my only hope. With kratom i can take a walk, go to my childrens school plays, go out to dinner etc. \nMy intimate life was non existant. I am very fortunate to have a husband who understood what i was going thru. With kratom i dont have any pain and can be intimate. Kratom gave me my life back.  It is not something i seek to have fun with, its purely medicinal. I dont know what i would do if kratom is banned. I hope for more research and regulation so that people like me, who donot abuse it, need it to function. Since starting kratom i stopped taking narcotics and anti anxiety pills. I can finally laugh and enjoy my children. \nBefore starting kratom i was given a rx for fentanyl patch for pain relief as that was the only thing left. Thank God i found kratom and never filled my prescription as i never needed it again. \nI hope my story reaches you with an open mind.

I have a friend I informed about it that takes it at night for restless leg syndrome and it had been a miracle for her where nothing else has worked.  \nWhen I had insurance, I saw neurologist and pain management. Had Physical therapy, injections,a lot of pain medicine and anti-depressants. When I lost my insurance I would go on line to get Tramadol, which a doctor told me was not a narcotic and safer for me to take than narcotics, I was taking ALOT. I did get addicted to them, then the DEA scheduled it as a narcotic and I couldn't get that anymore of that either. I panicked. I went on line seeking a natural remedy, I wanted OFF the pills! I found Kratom and not only found a way to not suffer from major withdrawals but I found pain relief, anxiety and depression relief. I DO NOT get high. I take in the morning and mid afternoon while at work and just had 3 year job review with an increase in pay so it obviously is not debilitating. \nI'm not only worried about myself if this gets banned but I'm worried about thousands of other people that take for anxiety and severe pain that might relapse or worse if cannot obtain this plant. Not from withdrawals but going from having pain relief to having pain again can really be mental suicide.\nThe DEA has not done their due diligence in researching the medical benefits and \"we the people\" feel like we were not hurting anyone by using this age old remedy WHY did they have to get involved! Just leave us be!\nPlease feel free to contact me if you wish, there is a wonderful community of people that are fighting for this cause.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1939","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"1999","postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christine Loughrey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir(s) & Madam(s),\n\nMy name is John Rosenberry.

I have been using kratom for 6 years now.  I was discussing with a doctor friend about alternative medicines and he suggested kratom to me for my muscle soreness and mild anxiety.   Kratom has made a significant difference in my life.  Kratom allows me have the quality of life I desire.  Kratom enables me to have a life free from muscle soreness.  So many medications (OTC & Prescription) cause stomach discomfort for me, and leave me in a fog for the day.  Kratom enables me to accomplish what I need to get done, without the mental fog and stomach issues so many \"traditional\" medicines cause me.  I have experienced ZERO side effects from this plant.  This all-natural wonder also keeps my mild anxiety at a level I do not notice it anymore.  I can't tell you how many situations kratom has made not just manageable but enjoyable because I was not having to deal with muscle cramps and becoming overwhelmed by stress.  I enjoy outdoor activities so much more now.  I am able to enjoy a dinner out with family at a crowded restaurant on a Friday night.  I am so thankful for this herb and all the benefits of it.

At first, when I was suffering from anxiety, I took the capsules, but quickly moved up to the powder because it was more economical and I could take more of it to help me calm down.  There is definitely a pharmaceutical benefit to kratom.  It absolutely helped mask my nerve pain and definitely calmed me down, sometimes to the point of feeling completely \"zoned out\" and dull-witted.  The trouble is, like any drug, as time goes on, you build up a tolerance and need more.  Look at the forums online about kratom addiction and withdrawal and you will see a frightening pattern.  What starts as a \"holistic\" and \"natural\" way to help with anxiety and pain quickly turns us into slaves for this plant.  For the last year, I have structured and reworked my life around kratom.  I won't go out for longer than a few hours so I can come back and get my fix.  I have cancelled vacations, because whenever I go off kratom for more than a day or two, I get fiercely sick.  I have wished my kids away, so I can go into my bedroom and zone out.  I have come to absolutely despise who I am on this plant.  It's robbed me of my ability to be a good mother, wife, worker, and friend.  I'm not saying there isn't a benefit to the plant, because there definitely is.  But it needs to be regulated.  It needs to be studied.  It needs to be dosed so that we kratom users are not overdosing, becoming addicts, or hurting ourselves with an unregulated plant just to get that tranquil feeling.\n\nWhen I first heard that the DEA was going to make kratom a Schedule I drug, I was so relieved.  Finally, I would be forced to find my way out!  But then came all the outcry from people who are still using kratom and don't want to give it up.  I understand them.  I've been them.  I've lived my life around this plant for two years and, for most of that time, I would have panicked too if someone had told me I had to give it up.  But it is now time for me, at least, to fight my way free.  Though you have withdrawn your notice to temporarily place kratom into Schedule I, I still used this decision to find the will and determination to get off of kratom.  A week ago, I dumped out all the powder and haven't had any since.  The withdrawal has been intense.  Body aches.  Hot flashes.  Cold chills.  Depression.  Total body-numbing fatigue.  I have been online, learning about others who have been through this same withdrawal experience, and who have suffered for about a week physically and up to a month emotionally.  But I am committed to seeing this through. I pray I can see this through, even if kratom stays legal.  I understand that you're going to hear from many people who see value in the drug, and I'm not denying their claims.  What I am saying is that kratom has a highly addictive quality, and acts very much like an opiate.  I believe that it needs to be treated in the same way as opiates--with scientific study and careful dosing.  I believe it is very difficult to take kratom without it becoming an addiction.  I believe it has a place, and that's behind a medical counter, with people who know what they're doing with pharmaceuticals.  Please, please, consider following through with your decision to schedule kratom as Schedule I.  From there, I believe the scientific and medical community could take over the study and distribution of this plant so that it can help people instead of ruining their lives.  Thank you for very much for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0163","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christy Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a life safer.

I was addicted to opiates for around 10 years starting when I was in high school. I was born with scoliosis and suffered a series of injuries that left me in severe pain. I developed other habits out of the opiate addiction such as a cigarette and chewing tobacco addiction,  experimenting with other drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy, and believe them all to be caused by the effects of putting a young man on powerful opiates. I discovered kratom 4 years ago and began taking it in place of the pain medication. I have since been able to take my life back, I don't reach for the bottle of organ and life threatening medication and instead I don't feel I am in a haze as I did for 10 years. Kratom and marijuana have similar characteristics that suggest they should both be researched (and not tampered with by pharmaceutical companies) in order to provide the human race with safe, affordable healing. I have no pain, I don't use other elicit drugs, and kratom has even helped me take steps towards quitting tobacco altogether as well. I am a firm believer and I hope you will give kratom and the people a chance to do this right.

It was CRE's interest in enhancing the public's communications with regulators, consistent with the principles enunciated by Judge Wald in Sierra Club v. Costle, that led CRE to create the first Interactive Public Docket. CRE created the IPD to \"allow the public to be in constant communication with regulators\" outside of the notice-and-comment process.  \n\nCRE created the Kratom Policy Forum IPD, http://www.thecre.com/forum11/, to provide the kratom community with a platform for voicing their comments to DQA through a substantive, structured and respectful dialog. Irrespective of DEA's final decision on scheduling kratom, and the FDA's related decisions on the regulation of kratom, the forum has been a success, as evidenced by DEA's decision in its October 13, 2016 Federal Register notice to open this comment period.\n\nConsistent with CRE's commitment to make the kratom community's voices heard by DEA, we are hereby submitting into the docket about 1,500 comments that CRE received on its IPD. The comments that follow, all from readers of the Kratom Policy Forum, are organized in three sections with each section reflecting the comments that CRE received in response to specific communications with federal officials. The sections are,\n\nAppendix A, Reader responses to CRE's letters to DEA, http://www.thecre.com/forum8/?p=294 \nAppendix B, Reader responses to CRE's letter to the Department of Justice describing \"A Roadmap to Sensible Regulation,\" http://www.thecre.com/forum11/?p=37 \nAppendix C, Reader responses to CRE's essay, \"The Birth Of A New Black Market: Is There an Elephant In The Room?\" http://www.thecre.com/forum11/?p=46 \n\nCRE applauds DEA actions to increase public participation in its rulemaking activities.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9134","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Center for Regulatory Effectiveness","postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jim Tozzi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I want to express my desire that the plant Mitragyna speciosa, also known as Kratom, and its components mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine not be placed under a schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. I, along with many, use this plant to treat chronic pain. Although there has not been much scientific research on this plant, the ongoing numerous personal trials people have subjected themselves to with this substance, including my own, has shown proof that this plant has many advantages, and can help treat many different ailments that much of the population find themselves with. Some say it helps them treat their depression, others say it helped them get off of legal and illegal opiates. It helps many others with pain. It has helped me with my pain for sure. The ability for this substance to alleviate my pain is very good. As someone who has had a long history with pain due to a near fatal accident, I find Kratom to work well. I have been on hydrocodone numerous times, Neurontin, and Celebrex ongoing for the last 15 years. Hydrocodone worked the best when I was having a bad pain day, and Celebrex worked ok for daily pain, but only for some of the time. Kratom works just as well as Hydrocodone, but without feeling out of it, or sleepy. Kratom also doesn't have the horrible side effect of constipation that Hydrocodone (and the like) do. I can understand the need to make this dificult for minors to obtain as they would be much more likely to abuse such substance, much like alcohol, or any opiate drug. However, like I stated before, many users of Kratom use it responsibly, and need it sometimes daily for pain management. Please do not schedule Kratom or any of its substances.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9852","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"  In a nation where citizens are free to buy alcohol, tobacco, firearms, aspirin, and many more dangerous products, there is no sound basis for prohibiting kratom.

I am a 51 year old mother of two, and grandmother to 2 beautiful girls, by my daughter (age 26), ages 6 and 7, who live with me and their grandfather. I have been unable to work since 2009 due to lack of motivation and health issues. I've been in 2 automobile accidents that have limited my daily functions, and not to mention severe spinal degeneration, fibromyalgia, bulging disks in neck and lower back, osteoarthritis, hypertension, and 2 brain aneurysms. I've basically been bedridden for nearly 3 years. I've tried different vitamins, diets, physical therapy, exercising, and pain medications that left me loopy, drained and irritable. Also, being Asian, my mother would try her home remedies like walking on my back, seaweed soup, and other concoctions that I couldn't begin to tell you what was in them. Then a few months ago, I saw an article about Mitragyna Speciosa, aka Kratom, and the benefits it has to offer. I began researching and reading up on all I could find about this plant. I saw all the advantages, but didn't find any disadvantages. I decided to order some from an online vendor, and added it to my diet by mixing it in with my coffee each morning. It took a few times before I noticed any changes. One day I decided to get out of bed and try to clean around the house some, to take a little responsibility away from my daughter. Before I realized it, I had cleaned a lot more than I intended to. It was like a sense of well being, motivation, and energy that came over me. I have also been able to take my grand-daughters outside to play. I can sit a little longer, walk a little further and even cook a meal, or two. All of this without the drowsiness, jittery feeling, and irritability. Please don't make Kratom Schedule 1. It's not more than a tea bag. Like, drinking coffee or tea, or taking a vitamin or supplement. It's a plant in its natural form, doing natural things, the way God intended it to do. I ask you to please do not take this away from me.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDeborah L.

Without insurance coverage for the Suboxen treatment, I spent $800.00 for my Suboxen and office visit with Suboxen doctor. I was praying Suboxen would be what finally freed me from my addiction to pharmaceutical opiate pain medication. I was excited to start the \"treatment\". I followed the doctors instructions and dosage exactly but the Suboxen made me sicker than I had ever been in my life. Following the doctors directions I continued the Suboxen for 3 days, only to become even sicker. I had to do something different, anything else. I was desperate so I tried the Kratom. It worked. My withdraw symptoms went away. My mood was better. Everyday I felt a little more like myself.   \nI am now on day 71 without opiates.  I know from my experience this tea leaf works. I only wish I had known sooner. Kratom had zero side effects for me. \nOpiate use in the US is out of control, no one can deny that. Why would the DEA want to ban a tea leaf that has helped so many Americans ?\n\nThank you for allowing me to comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7836","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mindy Boyd","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, my name is Chad and I'm 39 years old. I am a quality assurance technician. Please rethink your ban on Kratom.  I am not a scientist or doctor but this stuff really helps. I get a full physical once a year through my employer and have not seen any adverse side effects from using it. I have been consuming kratom, in the tea form, for almost 2 years. Prior to finding out about kratom,  I was on pain pills (lortabs) for lower back pain for almost 9 years and my physical showed that I had high liver enzymes . Well when the govt stepped in and put a halt to doctors giving them out like candy, my doctor closed his practice making me look for another doctor, which I could not find one. So after doing some research online,  I found kratom. I drink it about 2 to 3 times a day and it drastically reduces the pain or it tells my brain that it's not hurting, but whatever, it sure helps. Thank you for taking the time to read this and please rethink.

I am writing in my personal capacity, not in my official capacity as a judge. I am also a retired US Army Officer.  I mention my professional status only to provide a backdrop for my comment.  Kratom and has been indispensable in assisting me to manage chronic pain. Crucially, several close friends of mine also use Kratom for this purpose. We are all hard working, honest, highly educated, tax paying citizens with good careers and families. All attorneys, and all with science backgrounds. We are not freaks or junkies, as some news stories might try to portray Kratom proponents. I have several orthopedic injuries which I sustained during my 23 years of military service. I have had two major orthopedic surgeries in the past 4 years. I live in chronic pain.  Yet I never miss a day of work due to pain, largely because of Kratom. Kratom reduces the amount of pain I feel in my back, and reduces the tightness and spasms. Because of it, I almost never need to use prescription pain medications. I simply mix some Kratom into a milk shake and it helps reduce pain for about 6 hours. Furthermore, the Kratom has been totally non-addictive and produces no significant side-effects for me. Overall, it is far superior to prescription pain medications for these reasons. For the past 18 months, it has been a savior for me. And it has been equally important to my close friends who also use it to manage their chronic pain from injuries sustained in military service. In sum, it is vital to my ability to remain a hard working federal employee--less pain, no need for inconvenient doctor visits, and no significant side effects.  Please do not schedule Kratom's components as controlled substances. Such an action will be a dire setback to my health, and the health of many others who also battle chronic pain.

I had written a lot of my testimony of how Kratom helped me with very severe allergies.  No powerful medication prescribed by an allergist doctor with 30 years experience gave me relief like Kratom did within an hour. I tried this after torment of spring and fall allergies while working on an aircraft modification contract in North Carolina. I am a 41 year old man that has a responsible job as a commercial aircraft maintenance technician. After suffering from terrible allergies for over 10 years starting in my homeland of Northern Ireland have I ever had the relief I that got after hearing about the strong benefits of herbal Kratom in reducing Inflammation. Allergies have had a serious affect on performing my duties in my occupation. I have tried every medication on the counters but once my allergies take hold nothing has ever given me relief like Kratom has. I have also been treated for depression in the past from possible PTSD growing up in a country of conflict in N Ireland. Anti depressants made me feel worse and diminished my sex drive. When previously taking Kratom made into a tea for my allergies I had better feeling of all around well being without drowsiness and adverse side affects. I just wanted to give my story of experience to ask the powers that be keep this wonderful tree leaf legal as it evidently helps so many people for various ailments.

Kratom has helped me with my general anxiety, my chronic back pain, and has helped me in the past quit smoking cigarettes. I also have introduced many of my friends to kratom, a vast majority of which have had similar positive experiences, with no real negative effects aside from the occasional nausea that newer users occasionally have if they take a little more than their body is accustomed to. Overall, I believe kratom not only should be legal for all to use, but I also believe that it is a very important supplement for a lot of people who are getting off their addictions, who are treating their anxiety, and who are treating their pain, without fear of overdosing or being thrown into the grips of an addiction. There is no evidence, not even a trustworthy study that suggests kratom is a dangerous substance, an I am willing to bet that it will forever stay that way. If not for the liberty of self-ownership and the freedom as individuals we all have to put what we want in our own bodies, at least think of the thousands of lives you could ruin by criminalizing this substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10196","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 46 year old registered nurse and I am writing to ask that you do not schedule Kratom.

Im 61 years old.  I work in the hospitality industry, and my experience with kratom compels me to write in opposition to your mandate that would make kratom a schedule 1 controlled substance. \nIve been using kratom on and off since January, 2016.  I started using it because I had been plagued by a very painful elbow joint for a long time.  Over-the-counter pain remedies did not help, and I found a moderate measure of temporary relief by taking approximately 4 to 5 grams of kratom, twice a day.  \nAfter several months of daily use with virtually no adverse effects, I abruptly discontinued its use to discover absolutely no physical dependency, or withdrawal symptoms  whatsoever.  I did not crave more, nor did I crave more during usage.  Those results were enough to convince me that kratom is non-addictive and I deem it totally benign in that regard.  \nConfident of its innocuous nature, I eventually resumed taking kratom for my more minor aches and pains and for the lift it seemed to give me while executing my never-ending list of responsibilities.  I found some increase in my productivity and a major improvement in my attitude towards completing those tasks both at home and in the work place.  I also found it to be excellent for stress relief. Responsible use of this substance causes no apparent harm and while it is easy to confuse ones daily use of kratom with an inherent addictive quality, quite the opposite is true.  Specifically, I choose to do it daily precisely because there is no danger of addiction.  \nYes, this is a feel good plant but since it is not addictive, a more valid concern could be directed to discover any potential detrimental physical effects, and its effect on cognizance and behavior when ingested.  One way to determine those things is to allow it to continue to be studied.  Please do.  Perhaps an even more effective way of determining those things is to continue to let it play out openly in American society.  I can also condone that method without any serious reservations.\nI do not wish to trouble you with comparisons because I believe that kratom is unique in the effects it produces.   Nor would it be fair to try to minimize the benefits I receive from taking it.  But to consider kratom as a danger worthy of a schedule 1 classification clearly indicates that the DEA has been unduly influenced if not by money or power, then by a significant amount of misinformation, exaggeration, and lack of proper perspective. \nKratom is the only viable feel good option available to me, (as opposed to alcohol or marijuana) and if it remains legal, I will no doubt end up crediting it for extending my years in the work force.   A cup of Sleepytime tea just doesnt produce the amount of desired relief after 8 to 10 hours on my feet at a stressful job.  Should it be banned, I will be saddened but will enthusiastically and strictly obey the law.  I encourage you to rethink and reverse your position.  America deserves to have access to this wonderful leaf.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12904","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 30 year old male who turned to kratom after a botched hernia surgery.

A few years ago I was diagnosed with no lordosis and instability in my cervical spine.  Two spine surgeons and two neurosurgeons recommended four dramatically different surgical fixes. I was told that a minor stumble or fender bender could leave me paralyzed or dead. I opted for fusion at the most unstable location. The surgeon declared the fusion a success, but the pain never went away, and the pain has become increasingly unbearable and a major negative impact on my quality of life. Recent testing revealed that my neck is in really bad shape, and likely getting worse. Again, the recommendations from various doctors is not in agreement. Based on the recent feedback from surgeons I have consulted, my neck is a very complex problem with no clear fix nor guarantee of success in relieving my pain nor preventing eventual severe disability. Some suggest injections, and others point out the injections are not appropriate for my condition, are very dangerous, and neither are FDA nor AMA approved in the cervical spine (but not illegal). So I begin to wonder if some doctors specializing in pain management or spine surgery may recommend dangerous injections and discourage opioid pain medication so they don't have to worry about scrutiny from the DEA.  Or perhaps higher income from injections is a motive. As I attempt to better educate myself about my condition and evaluate the various options, I hope to identify and eliminate which proposals are snake oil sales pitches for spine pain industry profit and which are well thought out genuine solutions for me. In the meantime, or possibly for the rest of my life, if there is not a safe and appropriate surgical solution, it would be nice to have a new chronic pain management option that is readily accessible and doesn't cause me more health problems. I heard about Kraton last month and have never tried it because I heard about it after the DEA intention to make it illegal. Popular chronic pain relief options now include controversial opioids with all sorts of scary risks (most harm attributable to irresponsible abuse), acetaminophen that can destroy your liver, and Nsaids that will give you a heart attack or stroke. Based on what I read from many others I would like to give Kraton a try. My long term goal is to minimize time spent dealing with doctors for pain management and not be subjected to additional unnecessary health risks from injections, acetaminophen, Nsaids, etc.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6936","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Pamela Garcia","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm commenting today in response to the proposed ban on Kratom.

After many rehab visits I had lost hope in myself and the world around me.  After giving myself another chance, I grabbed my computer and started doing some research.  I came across a substance called Kratom.  I decided to give myself the option of trying it.  Within three weeks I had stopped shooting drugs, gained employment, and became a contributing member of society rather than a leech or parasite.  I believe without Kratom, this would not have been possible.  I have not taken any other substances other than kratom in over two years.  Given that I have been using many drugs daily since the age of 16, this is quite an achievement for me.

I have been a user of this miraculous plant for over two years now and never once have I been impaired or \"high\" under its influence. If anything, it makes me much more productive throughout my day, much like coffee does for many Americans. Which should not be at all surprising as they both come from the same family of plants. Seeing as though our country is currently in an opioid/heroin epidemic, in which thousands are dying yearly, it would be irresponsible to ban a plant that is helping so many people in a myriad of different ways. Any plant that is saving lives and helping people become productive members of our society should be lauded by all people, and an effort should be made to help more people find this miraculous herbal remedy. The last thing we as a country need to be doing is making more criminals out of ordinary citizens simply because they choose to help relieve their pain or fight their demons of addiction through the use of a natural botanical. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this matter and urge that you take our opinion into consideration before acting hastily and banning a leaf that is beneficial to society as a whole.

I have suffered for the past two decades with back, neck and shoulder pain, mostly the latter (two torn rotator cuffs) the result of heavy outside work.  Until the past four months I've self-medicated with an unhealthy combination of ibuprofen, alcohol and, less frequently, Oxycontin, I was introduced last April to Kratom, both as a beverage and in capsule form. \n\nWhile I am normally skeptical of botanical, homeopathic or other home remedies, I can say unequivocally that Kratom has had a profound and lasting analgesic effect on me. Not only has my pain become much more manageable (improved sleep, ability to sit for longer periods of time at my computer), I have noted a sharp decrease in my alcohol consumption, as well as ibuprofen. I've been able to give up the Oxycontin altogether. I take Kratom around twice each week, in beverage form, like a normal herbal tea, in moderate amounts. The effects are truly miraculous, particularly given that I'm the the type of person that likes to have my wits about me. While I can sometimes feel mild euphoric effects, I am always able to carry on my professional work without skipping a beat. \n\nThe only downsides I've so far experienced is the occasional headache the following morning. Every now and then I have vague cravings for a cup of Kratom (no more intense than say coffee, and a whole lot less so than alcohol) but find that I can shrug it off unless I'm having a particularly bad pain day. \n\nMy only concern at this point is one of long-term side effects that may emerge. This is one reason why I earnestly hope that formal study will continue into this potentially important alternative to traditional, and often harmful, forms of self-medication used by tens of millions of chronic pain suffers each day. Further, I hope that only if Kratom is proven to be a health or societal threat would the DEA consider banning this botanical, particularly in view of our society's inability or unwillingness to stem the epidemic (and socio-economic consequences) of far more serious substance abuse in our country.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nJosef Woodman  \n ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1655","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Josef Woodman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We don't need to ban Kratom.

I have worked as a manager for the last six years and have been drinking this tea for the last four. Kratom is a tea that can be used in place of dangerous \"FDA APPROVED\" medications. Americans consume almost all of the globally prescribed Hydrocodone a very dangerous and additive pain management pill (www.cnbc.com/2016/04/27/americans-consume-almost-all-of-the-global-opioid-supply.html).  I got diagnosed with epilepsy four years ago and went through six different medications to find the right dosage to keep the seizures from ruining everyday life.  While going through the process of trying each new medication I had to deal with different medial issues such as pain, nausea, fatigue, depression, head aches, and so on.  When I started to take Kratom my symptoms subsided and the best part was I didn't feel anything from the tea.  It is not a drug so to classify it as such would be a misguided ill-informed decision.  This tea could help millions of people currently hooked on the pain pills prescribed to them, anti anxiety medications, anti depressants.  Kratom is also used to overcome Heroin addiction. Drug overdoses is one of the leading causes of deaths in America and heroin plays a big part. There are thousands of deaths every year due to heroin abuse that could be prevented starting with children as young as 12 years old. (Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the US, with 47,055 lethal drug overdoses in 2014. Opioid addiction is driving this epidemic, with 18,893 overdose deaths related to prescription pain relievers, and 10,574 overdose deaths related to heroin in 2014.) Kratom has no addictive properties and I can say from experience with medical issues both physical and mental all Kratom had done for me is be a positive change in my everyday life.  I have never felt a drug related \"high\" while drinking the plant, I never feel a \"withdrawal\" from this tea like you would a scheduled drug.Making Kratom, a plant related to the coffee plant, a schedule one drug would be a big mistake.  It would be asking moms, dads, children, Military, to give up something safe and good for their bodies and replace it with dangerous, expensive, man made drugs (drugs, not  a natural plant).  If you make Kratom a schedule one drug I, along with the thousands of other people drinking this tea, expect to see the same thing happen with cigarettes and alcohol. A schedule one drug is something illegal because of high abuse, no medical use, and safety concerns.  Kratom does not fit into any of those categories but alcohol and cigarettes are some of the leading causes of deaths in the united states and legally allowing those on our streets but preventing the use of something helpful and safe such as Kratom will just show the people of the United States of America the government and the FDA do not have our best interests at heart and do not use facts in their decision making process. I urge you to rethink this decision. Please allow us to continue to use this harmless, medially safe, and medically helpful plant in our everyday lives.  It can save people, it can help people, it can change lives for the better.

Many people in my life recommended pharmaceutical pain killers but I feel the risk is too high considering the fact that my mother battled an addiction to Oxycontin for 25 years. I have seen what opiates can do but Kratom is simply not the same thing! Kratom is an opiod not an opiate, it is not derived from the poppy plant and does not carry the same ill effects on the liver. I have watched people get off of Heroin with Kratom and it is like night and day, the greatest part is that when they want to stop Kratom, they don't relapse and they avoid the terrible withdrawal of traditional ?-opioid receptor agonists. Many of the deaths that are cited in the DEA's concerns involve a myriad of other depressants with effects on the medulla oblongata, this causes respiratory depression and when mixed with other heavy depressants, can cause death. It's like if someone overdosed on Heroin and Xanax but they blamed the Advil they had taken earlier in the day. Just because it is in the blood work doesn't mean it plays a factor. All and all, it is our right as Americans to choose what we put in our body! Nobody is getting shot over Kratom and people are not stealing car batteries for it. Calling it a high would be an overstatement and to take this away from people is simply un-American. People came to this country so they could live the life they wanted, even if other people didn't agree, we are not hurting anyone, only helping our own well being.

I discovered Kratom tea through a friend who had struggled previously with opiate addiction. Ever since he found Kratom I found him to be a much happier person who didn't struggle with many of the downfalls of opiate addiction he had struggled with before. He recommended it to me to try. I was weary at first but soon discovered Kratom tea did not over power your senses but simply elevated your mood, I felt happier when I drank Kratom tea but nothing comparable to what opiates have done to the many people I know, who had gotten addicted. I did not feel compelled to do more the next day and it was many weeks till I tried it again. Today I enjoy Kratom occasionally. But it doesn't control me like many legally sold drugs do with many, i.e. Tobacco, Alcohol, and Optiates. It doesn't cure any ailments I have but makes the fact of dealing with them much easier. Don't let fear dictate your decisions, the horror stories that Kratom tea is a dangerous drug that is endangering our children is nothing more than fantasy. The reality is there are many drugs like that today that remain unchecked and that are trully destroying families, heroin, alcohol, pills etc. But Kratom is not comparable to those. It's recreational use is limted to a elevated mood not a complete intoxication like those listed above. So please reconsider your categorizing of Kratom tea to that of illicit drugs that truly can ruin your lives. When used responsibly Kratom tea is nothing more than mild mood enhancer.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17187","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Spencer D.","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I use Kratom for my chronic pain due to ill regeneration of two broken wrist, I was introduced to it from a friend's grandmother who used it to help her take care of her grandkids.

I also have ADHD. In an attempt to treat both of these conditions without prescription medication after deciding my DR's choice of treatment wasn't the right choice for me, I stumbled across Kratom. I had previously tried anything and everything  I could think of or researched to help with these conditions with no success. Kratom has helped tremendously with the anxiety which in turn makes my ADHD more manageable. In reverse, the anxiety that can be caused from the ADHD is also more manageable. These two conditions started to cause extreme frustration resulting in a short temper and angry outbursts. I am much more calm and handle things with a collected and stable emotional state. Its better for me, my family, friends, and coworkers. My life has become much less stressful and more healthy because of this natural substance. It would be absurd to classify Kratom along with Heroin. Heroin destroys and takes lives. Heroin also effects families and employment in a negative way. Kratom has giving me my life back. They are nothing alike in any way shape or form. If you take away the one thing that has helped me, you will in fact be taking my life as well. The life I've finally discovered and now enjoy living after 35 years of mental aggravation and hopelessness. Thank you for your time.

This sudden act is surprising because there has been no, or very few, negative reports on sites where people talk about Kratom. I have never read in a forum where anyone ever had a truly bad experience. That led me to try Kratom.\nI was injured on active duty and put on pain meds without serious follow-up. In time I became physically addicted. After 10 years I could stand it no more and looked for a different way. I read about Kratom and decided to try it. It eased the withdrawal symptoms so well that I never even considered taking a pain medication again. Additionally it has seemed to help my depression and anxiety issues. \nI have never had a frightening experience using Kratom. On occasions when I took too much (variations in strength or strain) I would vomit and that would be it. I do not get \"high\" from it. I just feel better due to lack of pain and improved mood. It has enabled me to function and thrive without pain. I take about 6 grams in the morning and another 6 grams at night. That's it. The day time dose lets me function and the nighttime dose enables me to sleep. If I am no longer able to use Kratom, I would have to find something to temper the pain and I will never use opiates again. Without Kratom, my quality of life will suffer.\nLawrence B.

According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, poison control received 3.1 million calls in 2013 alone. Assuming Poison control received around 3.1 million calls per year between 2010 and 2015, the rate of Kratom-related calls (660 calls) accounts for about 0.00004258% of all Poison Control calls. I do not believe that Federal dollars should be squandered on such an infinitesimal problem; our time and money is far better spent tackling alcohol and opioid abuse.\n\nIf poison control calls are any indication of the potential for abuse, Kratom fails the test miserably. That leaves the criteria of \"no accepted medical use.\" Many readily available substances (some effectively unregulated) are also devoid of (or have very little evidence of) medical use. Nicotine, Goji Berry, Krill Oil,Valerian Root, Green Tea, etc. Accepted medical use is a flawed criterion and always has been. It is certainly insufficient on it's own as a reason to schedule a substance, lest we also add tobacco and nutritional supplements that lack medical evidence to the schedule as well. I urge the DEA to not perpetuate the use of such an asinine criterion--if only to avoid embarrassment.\n\nThere are many solutions that society can apply to a problem, law-enforcement being one of the most expensive and, if misused, one of the most damaging. Given Kratom's role as an alternative for those struggling with opioid abuse, and the fact that it's rate of problematic use is minuscule, it is not worth the time, money, or effort to add to Schedule I.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8879","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Samuel Clark","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom works better for my pain than nsaids, keeps me alert and pain free throughout my day.

Mitragyna Speciosa, aka kratom, a schedule 1 drug. I'm a 39-year old professional with a great job and a spectacular wife and family. I started using kratom about five years ago after reading about it through online support group for anxiety and a website for IBS. I unfortunately suffer from both. I was on a lot of prescription drugs was looking for natural remedies that would help and I subsequently researched kratom. Turns out George W. Bush planted a kratom plant with Germany's Chancellor Merkel during a trade meeting in Malaysia. \nAnyway, after reading the actual papers and studies that have been done on kratom, I decided it was fairly benign and ordered kratom tea leaves from Amazon originally, then eventually I ordered direct from an online vendor. Knowing it's part of the coffee family and how its been used safely for centuries in Southeast Asia, I gave it a try and I'm so glad I did. It has really improved my quality of life and made me a better, more productive person. Kratom to me is like coffee without the jitters. It gives me motivation and a sense of well-being. I was so impressed with it that I recommended it to my friends and family! I would have never done that if thought kratom was in any way dangerous. And never once did I feel kratom was an intoxicant that could impair me. I use it at work and it seems to help me focus better than coffee. It's also helped with my health issues. I'm on less prescription drugs and healthier than I've ever been. I told my doctor about kratom a few years ago during a routine physical and he didn't know what it was, but he ran my blood work and my kidney/liver functions were not only normal, but improved! My cholesterol was even lower. He never once recommended I quit kratom because it wasn't hurting me one bit. Kratom is not a problem for me anymore than coffee and I'm sure the research will prove that true.\nThat's why the DEA should focus on the real drug problem- the heroin and opioid epidemic. Putting government resources to ban a plant that has yet to be proven dangerous is not the solution. I'm not a drug user and never have been. Two of my best friends are in law enforcement. I own my own house in a great neighborhood and I was recently promoted at my job of 15 years. What I'm trying to say is I'm not a criminal, kratom isn't hurting me or my family  and it's ludicrous to ban a plant, essentially making me a felon! Kratom doesn't deserve to be scheduled and is a waste of the DEA's time. You don't hear about people ODing off kratom. It's never killed one person or torn apart a family. Despite the misinformation that both the DEA and FDA purport on kratom, it is not an opiate, nor is it a drug.\nI'm a proud tax-paying American and this is truly personal to me. If the DEA ignores the facts and science behind kratom and goes forward with scheduling kratom, then I've lost faith in the DEA's noble mission to rid this country of the true garbage that is ruining lives. Ask ER doctors, nurses and police if they've had problems with people on kratom. I doubt they even heard of it. On the other hand, I know all of them would give you countless stories about pills and heroin. With that said, I respectfully ask the DEA to reverse its decision to label kratom a schedule 1 drug. My life is so much better since finding kratom. Please don't take that away from me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8245","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Moore","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me with my migraines.

I am fairly new to Kratom, but it has already made a large impact on my life. It was introduced to me by a friend and coworker, and i have thanked him ever since.

Once my friend told me about kratom and gave me some to try, i knew i was looking at the answer to many of my issues. You see, back pain and stress caused me insomnia. That cause severe fatigue. All those combined caused depression i could not shrug off. I am a father of 4 beautiful children, and they needed a father that was always confident and positive. Kratom gave that back to me. Since i started using kratom i no longer have trouble sleeping. My back pain isn't so bad. And best of all, no depression! The boost of energy is quite nice as well. I no longer use energy drinks or workout supplements to keep me moving. I know my reasons are nowhere near as important as some folks that use this miracle plant... for some it is a true life saver... why limit or take away a plant that helps so many people???

I'm not a chronic pain sufferer, not an ex heroin user, not a junkie, or just some kid trying to get \"high\" off of some crazy plant. I own 2 businesses, I'm 34, own my own home and have been creating jobs and working for myself for the better part of a decade. I'm not bringing this up to brag, since quite frankly, my life is nothing to brag about. I'm simply trying to let you know I'm an honest contributing citizen in the US. \n\nI use kratom quite regularly. Kratom has allowed me to function at a higher level when I take it, my minor aches and pains go away, I'm more productive and focused, and my general well being is simply enhanced. This is my personal experience with kratom, it doesn't make you \"hallucinate\", make you crazy, or out of control. \n\nI make my living with kratom. Thousands of others do as well. You know it's over a billion dollar industry. Banning kratom will cost jobs and massive loss of income. Sure the loss of income and employment will hurt if the mistake of banning kratom goes through, but these things mean nothing compared to the real issue at hand. \n\nI've had the absolute pleasure of speaking with easily over a hundred individuals that have shared with me their success stories of kratom. These are people that have had their lives ruined and ripped apart due to pharmaceutical drugs being shoveled in their faces. Being hooked on pain pills for years, not being able to function in their day to day lives, being stuck in a zombie like coma from benzos, and so many other situations. I've had people hug and thank me for kratom saving their lives, saving marriages, jobs, and giving them a reason to live. I'm not exaggerating about any of this. \n\nI'm saddened that in 2016 we are still having to fight for our rights to choose how to medicate. Why can't we make the decision ourselves? We don't want these disgusting pills the doctors are prescribing without even blinking an eye. We're adults. Not 1 single person has ever died from kratom and kratom alone. I've read all the toxicology reports, generally there is numerous other substances in their system and kratom takes the blame. It's ridiculous. We deserve to be able to choose what we put in our bodies. Again, we're adults. If kratom is banned, why not ban cigarettes, alcohol, ALL of the worthless pharma pills with far worse effects and deaths than kratom. It just makes no logical sense, and anyone that doesn't have an alternative agenda can see it. Please make the right decision and allow the people to choose for themselves. \n\nThank you for your time reading this.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3032","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Josh Hackett","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for removing Kratom from Schedule I. \nKratom is a medicinal plant used for millennia in Southeast Asia and currently used by millions in the U.S. \nKratom does not belong in our broken drug scheduling system.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom as a safer alternative, but all promising scientific studies on its role in opioid treatment would have been immediately shut down by a Schedule I designation.\nSchedule I is reserved for substances that have a \"high potential for abuse,\" \"no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States\" and \"no accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision,\" criteria that differ from scientific literature exploring kratom and its constituents. \nThe Schedule I designation would effectively halt scientific investigation into kratom's medicinal benefits, while making it impossible to enact sensible legal regulations, such as quality control measures, product labeling requirements, as well as marketing, branding and retail display restrictions, which are long proven to reduce substance misuse and youth access. \nDecisions about how drugs are classified and regulated should be guided by science -- not by law enforcement.

I have chronic anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Kratom has helped me greatly by attenuating the symptoms of these disorders.  OCD is characterized by insistent, unwanted thoughts and unproductive, time-consuming rumination.  I find that kratom helps me to move past these symptoms, allowing me to focus on living and doing tasks required to live a normal life.   Kratom has thus been very beneficial to me in dealing with my disorders.  To say the least, the DEA's move to ban kratom is extremely disheartening.   \n\nKratom does not produce euphoria or any other debilitating condition; instead, it actually helps me focus on important things - but not obsessively. \n\nTo summarize, I am asking that the DEA halts this move to list kratom as a schedule I drug,  I hope that kratom remains a legal dietary supplement that has helped thousands of people in the United States.

I am writing out of a deep concern for the DEA's plans to regulate an herb I have been using for several years now to help alleviate some health issues that I have.  I have been diagnosed, and it is documented,  with Degenerative Disc disease, sleep apnea, and have had both of my shoulders repaired due to torn rotator cuffs.  I have other issues, mostly age related, such as arthritis, multiple joint and muscle pains, some anxieties, etc. that I have not sought medical help with for several reasons that I will mention shortly.  I would like to thank you for taking the time to hear public comments.  Due to the aforementioned documented health issues I was prescribed various pain relievers including Oxycontin, oxycodone, hydrocodone, darvocet, and other opoids and anti inflammatory drugs for months at a time for several years.  These do work on pain but as the world is beginning to find out there are many adverse side affects for the individual and society.  Not wanting to continue the cycle of use, withdrawal, misuse, etc. I sought a more natural method of alleviating pain and come across kratom on the internet.  I began to order and use it responsibly and have depended on it for several years now.  I have never had any negative effects or withdrawal symptoms from the responsible use of this herb.  I use about 5-6 grams a day and it enables me to manage most, if not all of my pain from my back, shoulders, arthritis, etc. I could go back to the doctor and probably make a case for prescription drugs but do not want to for many reasons, not the least of which it with kratom I do not find it necessary!  Please do not take away the option for responsible adults to utilize this naturally occurring plant that the good Lord has provided us with.  Why make the only options available via huge pharmaceutical companies?  Don't we have enough super strong drugs out there?  Don't we have enough illegal plants out there?  I would support an age limit for sales, use, etc. similar to cigarettes.  Can't we learn from our history with prohibition of alcohol?  It is a much worse plant derived drug and we manage its use for responsible adults.  Thank you for your time to listen to us.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20529","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephen Prophater","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Withdraw Kratom from Schedule 1 consideration.

I have been using kratom to deal with clinical depression and anxiety. I have been prescribed fluoxetine and wellbutrin, but those did not seem to provide the help that I've needed. \n\nI am a college graduate and am fully employed. It's scary to think that the tree leaf that I consume to help with my ailments could become illegal turning me into a criminal. I personally believe that prohibition is not the answer in any case. I think we should try to help people instead of creating millions of criminals. I also understand that we have to protect ourselves from harm. Do I think that this tree leaf is the type of substance that will cause major harm? No, I do not. \n\nI do think that we could stand to benefit from some regulation of kratom. I think we should follow the rules we have places for alcohol, it makes sense to me. Adults should have the choice to make. \n\nI appreciate the DEA allowing public comment on this issue before scheduling the plant along with cocaine and heroin. I truly believe that this plant helps people. Yes there will be some that abuse it, but that it going to happen with anything and those people do not represent the many people that obtain great benefit from kratom.

Upon hearing of the proposed scheduling and ban on kratom I felt it incredibly important to share my story. Kratom has helped me in many ways over the past several years, primarily on two fronts. Approximately 10 years ago I began having severe issues with my teeth. As a result of these issues, my dentist continuously gave me various narcotic pain medicines over an extended period of time. This coupled with pain medication I received from a subsequent knee surgery left me physically dependent on opioids as well as addicted. The first time I withdrew from the opioid pain medication I did not know about kratom and when through horrible withdrawal. I had the aches, vomiting, diarrhea, shakes and restless legs that go along with this withdrawal process and missed work on many occasions while dealing with this. However, the second time that I withdrew, I learned of Kratom and it helped to mitigate so much of the withdrawal and allowed me to maintain a normal lifestyle while stopping my use of opioid pain medication! And I have never found myself feeling like I am addicted or looking to get high from kratom. It simply doesnt work that way! Additionally, I have been diagnosed variously with bi-polar disorder, depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder. These mental health issues have, in the past gotten so bad that I have been unable to pull myself out of bed, shower or generally maintain a healthy and productive life as well as eventually losing my job as a result of not being able to perform my job functions due to my depression and anxiety. While by no means a cure, as a dietary ingredient, kratom has helped to improve my quality of life and helped keep my anxiety to a minimum while allowing me to deal with it holistically and naturally. Kratom has helped give me that little boost I need to get out of bed and get moving, to feel like showering and taking care of myself better and simply helping to give me a better overall sense of well-being. As a dietary ingredient, kratom truly has changed my life for the better in so many ways. I am back to working and fully functioning, and kratom, along with other changes and supplements has played such a huge role in that! I feel like with further research kratom could help even more people and could lead to greater advances in so many areas but even just personally, scheduling kratom would affect me and my quality of life very significantly. As such I request and plead with you to please not schedule kratom and to not make it illegal so that I, and so many like me, can continue to use this supplement to help improve our lives not to mention the research that many reputable researchers are looking to conduct. Please do not make kratom illegal. I thank you for taking the time to read and consider my comments!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15655","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Cogan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not take away my ability to use Kratom.

The health risks are minimal especially when compared to the health risks of opioids like heroin, fentanyl, and prescription pills. Addiction is directly tied to the upsurge in drug related deaths and for many rehab or medication assisted therapy are not accessible either due to location, health care limitations, or financial burden. Any tool that can be used to treat addiction should be at the public's disposal. \n\nPutting Kratom in schedule 1 will result in more people failing to treat their addiction and will halt potential medications that could be developed based on the chemicals in Kratom. This, public health will suffer and as a result the United States will suffer. If the choice is between allowing some people to treat their addiction with an herb and people overdosing and dying while trying to find an accessible solution to their addiction, the choice is clear. Do not place Kratom in schedule 1. The consequence of doing so is suffering and death.\n\nThank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20356","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amber Catron","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 67 and suffer from osteoarthritis.

I am a 27 year old student in the IT field.  Most of my life has been spent in this field, but I have done other work.  Growing up I played football, skateboarded, and had many other activities I enjoyed.  As I've gotten older, the health issues from being active in my formidable years have caught up to me.  When I was young, I strained a muscle in my lower back, and broke my foot.  Both of these issues still haunt me to this day.  Growing up, I also suffered from depression, although I didn't have a name for it for the longest time.  Recently I was put on many different antidepressants (Prozac, Buspirone, Vistaril) and nothing has seemed to help.\n\nHere recently, I stumbled across this plant nicknamed \"kratom\" after hearing about it on news sources over the past weeks.  About 4 weeks ago I decided to give it a try, hearing people say it has helped them with depression, anxiety, and even physical pains.\n\nAfter 3 weeks of light use, and especially that first day.  It made me feel great.  Number one was my back pain, it was just completely gone.  Within 15 minutes of putting the kratom in my tea, the pain had dissipated.  It has been so long since I have not felt restrained by that.  It's starting to help with my anxiety, too.  \n\nI have been a smoker of cigarettes for a long, long time.  This past week, I finally have kicked that habit, 8 days clean from those so far.  This Kratom, has gotten me up and about, working out, cleaning, and overall wanting to be healthier.  I always blamed a lack of motivation for this, but I think it was more than that.  It was a culmination of things that this simple plant has nearly alleviated or outright gotten rid of.  I feel wonderful.  Life is looking good.  I am about to make President's List (4.0 GPA) for this semester and everything just feels right.\n\nI plead my anecdotal experience to you, in hopes you reconsider.  Having something like this I can pick up on my own, ESPECIALLY without having to get a prescription or deal with a doctors visit, since I cannot afford insurance right now, is one of the best things.  I can take care of myself in my own way, and it has done nothing but help me in the past month.

Although I do not use it personally, I have tried it and enjoyed the elevated mood I got from it. It is just too expensive for me at the moment. A close friend of mine was addicted to heroin and went through a rehab, took their medicine(I cannot say which ones he was given because I don't know) and when he got out he relapsed. I introduced him to kratom and he has since been using it to kick the feeling of needing heroin and has since been clean with no relapse. He now has a steady job, an apartment and a car. Prior to this natural supplement called kratom his life was going to be cut short by addiction to heroin. I personally know for a fact that this plant could save thousands of lives and help end this epidemic of addiction in America and beyond our borders. It needs to be researched more and the positive effects need to be made public.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10232","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joel Bennett","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom and the alkaloids it contains have been incredibly beneficial and healthful for me in many ways.\n     I have suffered from depression and severe anxiety based obsessive compulsive disorder for most of my life. The medications I was prescribed were mainly  counterproductive and did not truly help me move past these issues.\n     In an attempt to escape the pain I felt within myself I chose to use other harmful substances just to feel somewhat capable of valuing myself and living life with confidence. This resulted in me becoming heavily addicted to methamphetamine for four years of my life.\n     I successfully overcame my meth addiction by using kratom to alleviate my mental disorders and suppress my intense cravings for destructive man-made psychoactive chemicals.\n     Kratom has not only helped me stop using meth, but also has been the very thing that has made it possible for me to stop smoking cigarettes and abusing prescription medications.\n     The following are additional positive benefits that I have experienced because of my kratom use. Kratom enhances my ability to perform my duties as a construction laborer. Kratom enhances my focus and energy , yet also provides me with deeper better sleep when needed. I have also noticed that since using kratom I have avoided catching almost all of the the cold viruses that my friends, family, and coworkers whom I was in contact with were sick from.\n     Me choosing kratom over anxiety, depression, meth, pills, cigaretts, fatigue, and sickness has truly allowed me to change my life in great ways that I would not have been able to without it.\n     I have not noticed one single negative health effect from kratom. Kratom is natural and actually quite healthful. Kratom in my opinion should not be scheduled as a schedule 1 drug and should remain legal for all whom need it.\n     Thank you for allowing us to comment on this issue.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0129","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Scott Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for taking the time to read my comments. \n\nI'm writing to you today in support of keeping Kratom legal. Kratom is a harmless herb that has been used by people around the world for years. Its popularity in resent years, particularly by unscrupulous hucksters has brought it into the news. Claims that it can cause a \"high\" or other equally false hyperbole have made headlines and caused a bit of a stir. The reality is quite different. Kratom a member of the coffee family has mild, but beneficial effects. It can not get someone high, but it can provide some temporary relief from pain for people who need it. \n\nMy own personal journey started when a compressed disk in my back became more then I could handle. My doctors prescribed increasingly stronger pain killers that worked some, but left me uninterested in many of my passions. A few years back I told my doctor I wanted to find a better way, and that surgery was not an option. I begged him to help me find a natural solution. \n\nHe suggested a few herbs and said only that he has read they may help, but suggested it was unlikely to work for me. Kratom never removed the pain from my back, but it softened the sharpness of it. It made it tolerable. Better still I quickly found that I could skip the prescription pain meds and take them only when the pain was too much for the simple herb. Over time I stopped the prescription pills all together. My doctor has since started raising Kratom as an option with patents and mentioned some find it to be helpful others do not. \n\nFor the people, like me, who do find it helpful it is a better tool then powerful prescription drugs. \n\nI ask that you do not ban, schedule, or otherwise regulate Kratom. All this will do is take away a tool that some people depend on. \n\nShouldn't we be providing more options rather then fewer?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10283","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Paonessa","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Good Morning, I just wanted to say I have multiple diseases  that are associated with a lot of pain.

I started using Kratom in December 2015 when a friend of mine mentioned I may want to try it for my chronic pain.  I am disabled and can not work. I am writing to you to ask you to withdraw making Kratom a schedule 1 drug. Kratom is the only thing that helps my chronic pain i suffer with 27/7 365 days a year. It does not make me unable to function and I can drive my car after taking it. I suffer with quite a few things that cause me to need to use a cane, walker and sometimes a commode because I can not make it up the stairs to use the bathroom. I wake up in crippling pain and unless I have Kratom available to take to reliev the pain I will suffer all day. I have a 15 year old son that I raise alone. If I am pain my son has to do things for me he shouldn't have to. He sees me go to the er by ambulance when my flare ups hit me. Kratom keeps me from going to the er. On August 6th 2016 I went to the er for a severe flare up in my low back and couldn't move. The administered iv drugs to me and the first dose didn't touch the pain. After giving me a second round, I stopped breathing and had to be resuscitated and intubated. I woke up to being questioned what I took before I got there. I didn't take anything. These iv drugs almost costed my life. I don't get sick taking Kratom, I can function after taking it and my son has his mom back again. I don't get withdrawals taking Kratom either. I am also not addicted to Kratom. I only get the pain back when I don't take it. That is all. Please I beg you as a single mom that lives in chronic pain every single day don't ban Kratom from us. This is my story how it helps me. Also I take it for my depression, I have bipolar, anxiety/panic disorder, depression and PTSD. I am only on one prescription for those things compared to 5. I have gone hours crying and when I took a green vein Kratom my mood was lifted and I wasn't depressed again. I started laughing about things with my son and had company over and cooked dinner. This is really a miracle plant and so many people need this in their lives to help them with problems like mine and others. Thank you for your time in reading this and I pray you will carefully make the right decision. \nSincerely, Christina Bridger","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0699","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christina Bridger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a recovering opiod addict I have only been able to reach my goals because of kratom.

Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down if classified as an illegal drug.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids. Show compassion for people who need a safe alternative to opioids and do not classify this medicinal plant as an illegal drug.Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\nOur jails and prisons are sadly over crowded with people who have not harmed others, but who need help, not punishment, for addictions. Don't create another boondoggle that send more people to prison for supposedly harming themselves through illegal drug use. Prisons are for more harmful to the incarcerated and their families/communities than pain relief from a plant.\nThanks for listening to my comments.

I can't smoke weed as it makes me sick and have anxiety .I don't want to get high, I just want to have a life. This ban has raised prices and people have bought it in bulk and will raise it even more on the black market.I please beg the DEA to not ban this plant. its a plant.Ban the extract that is causing the problem not the plant that is not a problem. I believe as do others that a ban will result in many more deaths as people will turn to herion or other black market drugs. I believe that some with the most chronic pain will not want to live and there will be more deaths.The black market will open up a much more uncertain future and we can't afford that.I can't go back to pain killers either legal or not but i can't live in fear that a plant that does not make me high will be banned because the DEA is behind the times.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1370","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"denise caplan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom. There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! \n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. \nMeanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15444","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Price Foster","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should remain legal, unregulated and available for all persons over 21 years old.

I have not found it to be addictive because I have run out of it several times and not suffered any ill effects other than the lack of pain relief.  To put it on a list alongside heroin and LSD seems highly inappropriate for an herbal remedy.  My physician has prescribed hydrocodone, gabapentin, flexeril, and mobic for me and none of them work for pain relief as well as Kratom.  They also have very long lists of side effects that frighten me and I am far more comfortable taking an organic substance rather than a synthetic. My physician is comfortable with this solution as well.

I have never used  it and have no interest in using it in the future. To my knowledge, no one I know has used it either. Nevertheless, I think the proposed ban is a terrible idea, for many reasons.\n\n1. A ban on kratom would constitute an expansion of the war on drugs when the goal should be ending it, as the public overwhelmingly wants.\n2. If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars. There are already far too many people incarcerated in the U.S. for nonviolent crimes, and this number needs to be reduced, not increased.\n3. It is my understanding that kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n4. Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but if kratom is completely banned, all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment would be immediately shut down. Any ban that prevents scientific research is a terrible idea.\n5. I have read that the side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n6. A ban on kratom would worsen the already severe opioid epidemic in the U.S.\n\nThank you for your attention.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8976","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Scheihagen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm  32 years old and currently on disability due to an accident that left me unable to use my right leg.

An estimated 27,000 unintentional drug overdose deaths occurred in 2007, UPI reports.  How is this not an epidemic? How is this not worse than the poliovirus when the government stepped in to find a solution?  Do we really need to make another plant that has possible medical benefits a schedule 1 drug? This plant has testimonials that it is helping people get off of pharmaceutical opiads and opiates and even with alcohol addiction.  We as the people simply want more research done before banning a plant. Especially when it comes to our right to pursue happiness,  which I think includes our well being and wanting to be pain free without the degenerative effects of pharmaceuticals.  \nTestimonials  from users are stating that kratom gives you the same psychoactive effects that you get from cup of coffee, that's it, of which Starbucks is one of the biggest companies in America. It's less of an effect than marijuana gives! And what are all the states fighting to legalize right now? For many people kratom takes away all the pain that they used to need to get from legal heroine (oxycontin) without the addiction. Of course it's habit forming,  who wants to be in pain all the time? Are you not a habitual coffee drinker? Oh and if you have anxiety like me,  testimonials state that it with that too! Which is way better and less suicidal than ssri's. There is even a strain that assists with kicking butt in the gym! 14 of the 15 deaths associated with kratom are all polypharmacy. Which means they were taking several different things other than kratom. If they were taking ssri's and other prescription pills in conjunction with kratom,  kratom should not be to blame until more research has been done.  Kratom on its own has caused zero deaths.  All we want is more research done because this plant may have potential to help people and stop the prescription drug death epidemic.  We believe in our government,  show us you are listening and that you care.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13093","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyle Fear","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Staten Island is at an all time high for opiate addiction kratom can save these pl wake up !!!!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5031","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michelle Klein","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI believe that Kratom should be researched more for medical benefits.

For those 3 years I have been a patient of a local Spine/Pain clinic and a legal user of Vicodin/Norco for that time.  I just recently discovered Kratom and have been trying it for 3 weeks.  In that time I have not needed nor felt like I needed my prescription pain medication.  It has been a Godsend in all honestly.  The pain relief I get from this plant is almost indistinguishable from my prescription pain medication. In fact, I get the pain relief without the overbearing sedation I get from my Norco prescription. I am praying and pleading that you do not remove this as an option for those of us who no longer want to take prescriptions that have such possible harmful side effects to our bodies.  I have felt better in the past 3 weeks than I have in the past 3 years!  I have never filled out one of these commentary forms or felt the need to voice my opinion in the past regarding any other drug.

I view this as very successful self perseverance. \n\nI am a 53 year old woman, a fraud investigator for a large and well known health insurance company.  I have high standing among my peers and make a good salary. I am married, have two grown children, and two grandchildren who I enjoy very healthy and rewarding relationships with.\n\n I have is an extreme disability due to panic attacks and some mild depression. When I was younger I was not a productive member of society because I was constantly living in fear and could not enjoy my life. I did the best I could, but it was a constant struggle to wake up day to day and face the world. I was always scared. Scared of everything. Scared that my children were dying, scared that I was dying, I even thought and felt 100% sure that the world would come to an end any day. These thoughts went through my head continually making it very difficult to concentrate on work and raising my children - not to mention my marriage. This very debilitating panic unfortunately put too much stress on my marriage at the time and it has since ended. I went to multiple doctors and tried multiple pills that only made me sleepy and made things even worse. I tried anxiety pills, depression pills, you name it -  all of them. None of them worked for me!\n\nAs luck would have it (or not) I was given a diagnosis of Endometriosis and was given pain pills such as Vicodin and Norco to fight the pain. I noticed that when I took these not only did they help the pain but somehow they alleviated the panic as well. However, somehow as time went on I needed more than my doctor was willing to prescribe. I then began to seriously consider breaking the law by \"doctor shopping\".\n\nIt was my Dr at the time who refused to give me more pain medicine that suggested I look into Kratom. Lo and behold it worked! I am completely free of painkillers as I am older now and do not experience the pain that I did due to the onset of menopause,  but the panic unfortunately did not go away until I began a Kratom regimen. \n\n\nI have since remarried and feel so fortunate to lead an extremely satisfying life. However, a wrench has been thrown in from the outside and  I am now being told that as a law-abiding citizen, my livelihood will be taken away. Now I will need to try & find the pharmaceutical alternative that might work, but only with a medical doctors assistance. That all sounds well and good except for - been there, done that and it didn't work.\n\nI don't want to lose my job , I don't want to lose my livelihood and I really don't want to lose my life. Please, my United States government do the right thing and allow additional research for this miracle plant and allow those of us who have found refuge continue to do so until such time as it is truly proven unsafe which in all honesty I don't believe would happen.\n\nI truly do appreciate your time in reading my comments and I hope and even anticipate that these comment will strike a chord with those that believe that human beings who must make their way through this life have the right to make ourselves comfortable while not hurting others and not to be told what we can and cannot do to achieve that level of security.\n\nVery sincere regards,\n\nAllyson Day - US CITIZEN - Littleton Colorado.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1537","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Allyson Day","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There is a major difference between being \"high\" and having mood elevated. I have been using kratom for two years. It helps me get through my day which requires hard physical labor. I also workout so my back and joints are really bad. I've had close people in my life lose their lives due to opiate overdose. No one has overdosed from kratom. I understand there have been 15 or so deaths with people who had kratom in their system, but none of them overdosed strictly on kratom. It doesn't cause a person to be high or impaired, it just helps take the edge off by elevating mood, alleviating pain, and lessoning anxiety. It will not totally 100% make mood, pain, and anxiety become perfect, but it helps enough to get through each day without turning to other addicting drugs that lead down a darker road. No one is asking you to keep something legal that is harmful, we are asking you to do research on this plant and find out for yourself. You have the resources and power to determine that. If alcohol, tobacco, and pain killers are legal, kratom is nothing as far as they are concerned. It doesn't even deserve to be considered in the same class. Thank you for your time, I really appreciate you taking time to do proper research to help so many people that steer clear of drugs and alcohol and use a natural plant. Your decision to postpone the ban shows a lot of understanding and proper usage of power on your part. Keep up the great work, and realize, there are so many other substances that put kratom to shame. This plant saves lives and money from hard working Americans that don't want to go out on disability and collect a check from disability or use the pain to get high. Lets do the right thing.

United States Poison Control (CDC) received 660 reports (e.g. phone calls) over 6 years that mentioned 'Kratom'\n\n2. The DEA is aware of 15 Kratom-related deaths between 2014 and 2016.\n\nI would stress that it is crucial these numbers are put in context. \n\nWithout a doubt there are numerous other legal substances that have generated far more reports. Regarding the 15 deaths, in all but one case there were either other substances involved (that were much more dangerous) or preexisting medical conditions. Despite this, when put in context knowing that there are 3-5 million kratom users in the U.S., the 15 deaths suggest that kratom is rather safe.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16160","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using Kratom to control my anxiety and chronic pain from an accident for several years now.

I have suffered from anxiety and depression since I was about 15 years old. As a teenager I first turned to illegal drugs to try and cope. My mother did her best to get me help and I was sent to an out patient rehab center where I received counseling to help my addictions. However the addictions where merely a cause of my efforts to relieve the emotional pain I was dealing with. Over the next few years I saw several counselor and doctors who prescribed different pills in an attempt to help. However the pills where either inaffective or had severe enough side effects I discontinued use. I ended up using marijuana to deal with my issues, which worked far better than the perscibed pills and without the side effects. However given the schedule 1 status of marijuana and the danger that brings I was at risk in other ways. I was arrested as a teenager, I lost a job, I had to hide my use from my family, and had to interact with sometimes dangerous people to get the relief I needed to just get through my day. After I became a father the danger of incarceration and the results to my family was enough for me to seek another way to relive my anxiety. I did some research and came upon Kratom. It is a natural substance, not a synthetic drug like the other options that I had become leery of and I decided to give it a try. And what I found is, it worked. I dose 2-3 grams in the morning and go to work. My anxiety is diminished and I can focus on my job, the irritability that I often have due to my anxiety is gone and I can relax. The only negative consequence I have had with Kratom is a little bit of nausea due to dosing too much, which is far less severe than the side effects of perscriptions I have had. I have also recently have had back problems, a herniated disk. I was prescribed opioid pain killers and Ibprofen, but due to stomach issues I have the ibuprofen is more damaging than helpful. Also my tolerance to the opioid pain killer rose so quickly that within a few days I needed double the dose for the same relief. I found Kratom to be effective to help give me relief from my pain as well as my anxiety. As a former addict I have seen the effects of dangerous drugs first hand and how they destroyed the lives of people around me. Kratom however is not one of those drugs in my opinion.  It does not cause the user to become violent or impair the ability to function in society, or become helplessly addicted. I regularly stop my use of Kratom due to the fact I sometimes simply can't afford it and the only affect it has had on myself  is the return of my anxiety. If Kratom becomes a scheduled drug the impact on myself and many thousands of others will be dramatic. I would like to see regulations on the quality and purity of Kratom in the industry to ensure vendors are supplying what they claim to be, the same way I want a box of tea to actually contain pure tea leaves. But to say Kratom has no value is not only wrong, it is devastating to many many people. Banning a plant that has helped so many people because a few have misused it is like banning  swimming pools because people have drown.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1567","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Travis Staggs","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Stephanie Wise, and I live in Dickinson, Texas. \n\n I'd like to voice my opposition to the DEA's Intent to potentially Schedule the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, which would make Kratom (Mitragynaspeciosa), a Schedule 1 controlled substance with no medicinal value. This would put Kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions, that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin and LSD. It would also prevent further research, which to date has shown Kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression, the main cause of death from opiate overdose. \n\nI personally discovered Kratom about three years ago after nearly losing my life to pneumonia. You see, I needed an extensive course of antibiotics, but the very antibiotics that saved my life also caused long lasting and irreparable side effects, one of which has been chronic pain. Reluctantly, I began taking Vicodin to combat the pain. Unfortunately, the withdrawal symptoms I experienced after I stopped taking the drug were devastating. I then began tirelessly searching for a safe, non-addictive alternative to synthetic pain medication. I had almost given up hope when I read an article about Kratom. After several days of extensive research I decided to try it.  \n\nI have been taking Kratom twice a day since, once in the morning, and once in the late afternoon. That would be about every eight hours. Not once have I experienced any of the side effects that have been provided as 'proof' that Kratom is dangerous. \n\nKratom users (like myself and my sixty-eight-year old mother, who has severe neuropathy, not due to Diabetes, in her legs and feet), are average citizens. We go to work and school every day. We pay bills, our taxes, run errands, spend time with family and friends whenever possible, and take care of our children and grandchildren. All of the things you would expect from someone who is not an addict. \n\nI, along with my mother, are living proof that Kratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs, with important medicinal uses that has changed my life. I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without Kratom. \n\nSincerely, \n\nStephanie Wise \n\n \n\n ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17476","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephanie Wise","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to oppose placing kratom in Schedule 1.

As you are aware by now, it is a plant that grows in Southeast Asia. I am very concerned about the control that your office has over plants and herbal supplements, that would allow you to take away (or make illegal) a part of nature. This plant, in its natural state is not harmful and I myself can attest to this. It is amazing to see all of the hype and false claims regarding kratom, which are exactly that, False!\nNone of this makes sense unless one were to read between the lines. If the FDA or pharmaceutical companies want to make some sort of synthetic drug out of this plant for profit then maybe it all makes sense to them. I personally dont care what they do, or what profits they intend to make but I really do doubt that this plant can ever be duplicated in regards to the benefits it provides in its unadulterated pure form. It does make you feel well, it does give you energy, it does take away mild to moderate pain, it does provide motivation and focus...and I could go on and on but I am positive that you will read many stories of the wonderful benefits it has.\nWe are in a heroin epidemic in this country right now and at least once a year I hear about someone that I know or that knows part of my family that has died from heroin overdose. And daily about hundreds of people dying, whom I dont know.\nPlease, please focus on doing something to keep heroin out of our country. \nThis plant is not your target! This plant is helping people with the very epidemic we are facing at this time. Please consider the deaths from relapse that will surely happen if you were to take this plant in its purest form away. Please consider the loss of productive hardworking individuals, who would rather stay away from synthetic prescription drugs to get up and go to work everyday. Please consider the rise in unemployment and disability benefits. Please consider the suicide rate increasing from those in pain and increasing depression. Please consider the jobs that will be lost due to kratom vendors closing their doors.\nI agree that their should be age restrictions and possibly packaging regulations but not a ban. Thats just insane. \nThank you for your time and considerstion.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18865","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carrie Cogan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please  help our vets and seriously invest further funding towards research regarding kratom","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9442","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Tacherra","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Personally, kratom helps with my PTSD & anxiety.

I estimate that I have taken over 100 doses in the small- to medium-range (and I have a log of every time I've using it, including date/time, strain, and amount).  I have never felt the need to take increase my dosage, nor have I felt any adverse effects of not taking kratom for days or weeks at a time.  Simply, it provides near-instant relief in safe way, and helps me concentrate, experience moderate relief from chronic pain, and to maintain a productive lifestyle.  If there is any issue, it's rare, and usually results in mild, short-lived nausea.  I cannot say that about many other drugs and medications that you consider legal.\n\nI was shocked to learn that the DEA single-handedly determined to put an \"emergency\" ban on kratom sale in the U.S.   The DEA has blocked perfectly safe herbal medications for decades, and even now, you have restated that marijuana - a drug for which there has never been any true risk, and where illegality was based on a century of race-inspired policy, misinformation, myhts, and anecdotal fears.  You must realize that, where marijuana has been legalized, there have been no major problems, and a growing super-majority of the country supports its legalization.  Working against that causes a loss of credibility in your organization, your judgment, and your objectivity.  That will also increase a general mistrust in the objectivity and policies of the DEA, something that might lead to actual, real danger.\n\nNow, more than ever, I implore to take a science-based stand on medications.  You're not only potentially harming the American people and keeping them from risk, but the message you send to other countries in the world will cause them to create criminals out of people that are using a perfectly safe (and affordable) medication.  You will make it nearly impossible to research, benefitting only large drug companies, and doing a major disservice to the many of us that benefit tremendously from kratom.  Please reconsider your actions, based your policy on science, and do what is good and right for Americans and the entire world.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15991","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anil Desai","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I had a 4-year long battle with prescription painkillers.

I only use it as an alternative for my pain but won't substitute my prescription medication that is why I couldn't believe it when I heard about it being banned.  I was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease as well.  Like I said it helps to somewhat to take the edge of pain but I still need me prescribed medication it in no way makes a substitute to treat my pain, although it helps it does not treat my condition nor is a cure.  As far as it being an opiate like substance, it's funny cause I make it into a tea but it doesn't have anyopiate like effects, anyone that thinks it is should really take the time andhave acup ofkraton tea themselves, they will even laugh when they hear someone saying it is.

I have been to the top Dr's in the country and spent money on medications that have never helped. All the pharmaceutical medications on the market do nothing to help and if anything they make it worse. After finding Kratom I was able to quit taking 8 RX Doctor prescribed medications and finally go back to work part time after years of being bed ridden and totally helpless. With Kratom, other organic herbs, organic diet, and Dr's supervision on the changes I have made I am able to be a productive individual. Please take into consideration what Kratom has done for others with autoimmune diseases. Kratom is a natural herb that aids in my daily life and helps me live. \nI have gone to several different doctors in an attempt to treat my pain and they keep sending me home with addictive and dangerous pills. Kratom is a safe alternative that has helped alleviate some of my pain. It doens't treat or cure any of my ailments but it does help with the symptoms. I have been using kratom for pain relief for over two years and have not had a single negative side affect. I am not addicted and have no withdrawals when I stop taking the kratom. There has never been a single death in the hundreds of years of kratom use, as opposed to the thousands of deaths every year from prescription drugs. I am not a drug addict and have never done street drugs of any kind. Kratom is safe, effective, has no side effects or withdrawals. It is a plant that can be used as an herbal supplement and that is a God given right for us to have access to. I choose plants over pills and request that it not be scheduled in ANY schedule as it poses absolutely no risk to anyone. I would like to see it added to the list of supplements covered under the FDA Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. Please listen to science and anecdotal evidence, kratom is not a danger and should not be controlled. Thank you for your consideration!

I ended buying Subxone's from friends, but it gave me awful side effects like urinary retention and would make me nod out.  I was lucky enough to find Kratom online and it absolutely changed my life.  I made sure to check the reviews about which vendors were legit and which one's weren't - it's usually pretty obvious who sources good Kratom vs those who buy it from the cheapest seller possible.  I started w/ 15 grams a day and over the course of a month and half, weaned myself down to 3g a day.  At this point, it felt like a morning cup of coffee - I no longer would get sick if I didn't take it (complete opposite of what happened when I used Suboxone / Oxycodone - the withdraws were something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy). I am opiate free, thanks to Kratom\n\nHere I am in 2016 - I relapsed once in 2014, using Oxycodone again (the buzz this drug gives is so inciting), but I had my trusty Kratom to get me clean again.  With Kratom, I do not get high.  I've seen videos on youtube where little kids w/ zero opiate tolerance have supposedly gotten high off it, but doesn't this mean the drug should be regulated similar to alcohol or nicotine?  Alcohol is the worst drug by far, I can't even count how many people's lives I've seen it destroy.  But as long as the Kratom is pesticide free, again, finding a good vendor isn't hard, it is not dangerous.  It has a ceiling effect around 15g at once and doesn't reduce breathing.  It kills pain better than Oxycodone without getting you high.\n\nIf you do regulate this wonderful plant, make it an age requirement, let us adults decide what we put into our own bodies.  You even have methamphetamine as Schedule II because it's used for ADHD.  To say Kratom has ZERO medical benefits is simply absurd.

I want to thank you for what you are doing to protect the public health of all United States citizens. First off, I want to say that I am very much against drugs (but in favor of medicine). All my life I have spoken out against drug use whenever it would come up with my friends and family (but not the use of medicine). Having said this, I am saddened to see that kratom has somehow been lumped in with other drugs that it does not belong with.\n\n     I struggle with severe social anxiety. To the point where it is hard to go out some days. After trying just about everything possible, the only thing that has significantly helped has been kratom. Shortly after starting to take kratom, I sat down with each member of my family and friends to let them know what I was doing. I expected that I would have to convince them that this was the right thing for me to do but instead, all I got was unconditional support. After talking with them, it turned out that they had already seen the positive change in me and knew that I was doing something different. The great thing about kratom is that it allows me to be myself again. It honestly lets me be me. I finally have my life back and can function as a normal human being.\n\n     I shudder to think about what making kratom illegal would do to me. I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that this would be taking away my life from me if the DEA were to make kratom illegal. Or at the very least this would be devastating to a huge portion of my life. All of this is a drop in the ocean compared to what the DEA would be doing to other people. From what I understand, countless people who are addicted to opiates are using kratom to get off of the opiates. Here we have a great way to actually help the drug problem but we are considering making it illegal to buy and consume kratom. This is incredibly misplaced. Kratom has been used for thousands of years as a medicine. As someone who uses this medicine and knows it is nothing like the Schedule I drugs they are lumping this in with, it almost seems like a joke. But it is not a joke. As you probably know by now, it is impossible to overdose on kratom and no one has ever died from kratom (it is always much harder drugs that are in the person's system when they accuse kratom of being the culprit). If you have not, I strongly encourage you to read the stories of real people who use kratom like these stories heavy.com/news/2016/09/i-am-kratom-ban-twitter-photos-stories-addiction-pharmaceuticals-dea-iamkratom/  I guarantee you that you will be moved to help these people. You will understand what making kratom illegal will be doing. \n\n      You have a very important choice in front of you. Please make the correct choice. Keep kratom legal.\n\n \n\nAll the best,\n\nJason","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12794","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason Jorgensen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Never tried this drug, but it feels like prohibition of something Americans find  non-addictive (unlike alcohol) is not the right answer.

Like so many others my story begins with a prescription to opiate pain medication which quickly turned into an addiction to high dosages of Oxycontin. Coming off of opiates was the hardest thing I have ever had to do and wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. The field of work I am in puts my body in constant pain and I refuse to ever take another opiate again which is why when I found Kratom it was an incredible form of relief for the daily aches and pains I experience. I typically take Kratom in 4 gram dosages and it allows me to get through a day of work and be able to relax a little bit and enjoy time with my family after work. Over the past several years I have never once had any sort of bad reaction to Kratom and my tolerance has never once gone upwards, the small amount I took 6 years ago is still the same amount I take for relief now 6 years later. This plant is by no means a miracle plant but it gives so many people like myself and people in much worse shape than myself the relief that they need to live their life to the fullest. I feel very strongly that this plant needs to be considered as something very positive especially in a time like we are experiencing now in our country with the opiate epidemic taking so many lives from us daily. \n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17773","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a senior who suffers from chronic arthritis pain which prevents me from sleeping.

I was an opiate addict for 10 years. One day I read online about kratom helping withdrawals. I was willing to give anything a try so i purchased 20 capsules from a shop and took the recommended does. I wasn't expecting much but next thing I knew 75 percent or pretty much almost all of my withdrawal was gone. I then dosed twice daily for a week and then stopped. A few months later I went through a period where I took kratom daily for about 2 months I quit and if it is addictive it must not be very much in the physical sense because I experienced nothing in terms of withdrawals. This plant saved my life I've been clean 3 years now. It's saved 2 other friends lives when I introduced them to it while they were in opiate withdrawal. They got clean in a similar fashion then just stopped taking the kratom because after a while it has a ceiling effect so eventually it wont do anything \"high\" wise anyways. When I had no tolerance I didn't really get much of a high but more of a slight lift in mood. It probably helped my post acute withdrawal syndrome as well. I've never heard of anyone overdosing on kratom and the worst that does happen is you throw it up if you take too much and then that's it. People need this plant for other uses as well. Pain management which is much much safer than any opioid or opiate prescription painkiller on the medical market.

Opiate addiction is taking thousands of lives in this country each year.  When I see that there is a claim of only 15 deaths due to Kratom compared to 14000 plus lives a year lost to opiates and thousands more to anxiety and depression, I am dumbfounded to hear that the DEA would even slightly consider making Kratom's use or the use of any other plant illegal.  The only reason I can come up with is that the DEA has no compassion for their fellow citizens that are struggling with addiction and mental health issues or that the DEA is just another government agency corrupted by pharmaceutical and prison lobbyist's influence and money.  For once do the right thing by the people, have some compassion for your fellow human beings, do not make the mistake of banning yet another beneficial plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7329","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-26T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dave Bailey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is not harmful like Opiates are, they have helped many people get back to work and education so they can be good citizens again.

Trigeminal Neuralgia has also been called the suicide disease due to the extreme pain involved. Since then, I have also been diagnosed with Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia, Depression, PTSD and more recently Asthma. I have been strongly encouraged by my friends, family and physician to stop working and go on disability, but this goes against everything I believe in.

Kratom helps me do that.\n I discovered Kratom about a year ago. After doing research and finding it to be safe for over 100 years, I decided to try it. Since then it has help to make my life more productive and enjoyable. Taking Kratom daily as a supplement has reduced many of my symptoms. I have been able to take fewer medications on a daily basis. I no longer need opiates every day, only when symptoms flair up to their worst. I no longer feel the depression that comes with constant pain. Eliminating the need for antidepressants, which cause so many serious side effects. With Kratom I am able to enjoy life without the fog and drowsiness of narcotics and antidepressants. Instead I can be alert and engage in a normal productive life with family and friends. I hope and pray I never need to return to taking so many medications.\n Kratom is a supplemental herb that has been used safely for hundreds of years.

Presently, millions of American citizens use this plant to help with opioid addiction, chronic pain, anxiety/depression, etc., and if it is taken off the market, or is made to be available only on a by-prescription basis, many people will resort to illegal substances, alcohol or prescription pain medications to treat their conditions. Many of the substances that current kratom consumers will resort to are considerably more harmful than kratom, as evidenced not only by the scientific literature surrounding them, but by their respective histories as well. It is important to understand that action against the kratom only affects the \"supply\" of kratom, not the \"demand\" for kratom; the result will be that people will either continue to buy kratom, instead via a black-market, or turn to other drugs. Thus, it is my fear that disallowing consumers to continue to purchase kratom will have severe, irreversible consequences (in the form of the sometimes-deadly side-effects of the substances that kratom is currently being used as a substitute for, in addition to the fact that those caught with kratom, regardless of the legitimacy of their reason for using, will be penalized for doing so), and that the threat to the public safety of the American people introduced by such an action would drastically outweigh the supposed threat that kratom itself poses. And, I mean, come on, do we REALLY need to make the NATIONAL OPIOID EPIDEMIC any worse than it already is?\n\nI think the DEA must have been seriously misinformed in their initial decision about kratom. To call kratom \"an imminent hazard to public safety \" is ridiculous. In my personal experience, and as much of the kratom community will attest to, kratom is hardly any stronger than caffeine, and even then, only certain varieties are actually stronger than caffeine, while others are far more mild than caffeine. As a matter of fact, I regularly consume white-vein kratom as a substitute for caffeine since caffeine, unlike white-vein kratom, gives me headaches and has a comedown that leaves me so tired I can barely continue to function throughout the day. As for red-vein varieties, I have used them to aid with anxiety-related sleep problems, and although I will concede that there is greater potential for addiction with these strains, and that they are definitely stronger than other varieties, they are still incredibly mild substances with barely-noticeable effects. But kratom is not a hazard to public safety. While it is true that kratom does act on the opioid receptors in the brain, comparing kratom to opioids is like saying that jumping off of the rooftop of your house is tantamount to jumping off of the top of the Empire State building. Furthermore, it is impossible, or at least overwhelmingly difficult to overdose on kratom, not only because kratom, like cannabis, has a significantly lower active dose than its lethal dose, but also because it tastes absolutely horrendous (try drinking any more than a few grams of this stuff without vomiting, I dare you). The same cannot be said of heroin or other opioids. It's just not a fair comparison, and the DEA should know that given that they supposedly researched it extensively over a period of several years.\n\nA more logical solution to this issue, I believe, would be to introduce a system of regulation, so as to ensure the honesty and quality of kratom products, as well as the dissemination of information regarding safe usage of the plant. This would prevent the creation of a black-market, and make kratom readily available as an alternative to more harmful substances.\n\nAnyway, I just hope that you show us, the American people, some compassion, and take a stand to ensure that those who choose to consume kratom do not just become yet another segment of our hysterically massive prison population, or even worse, dead. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read my comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20116","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I use kratom as a supplement for my pain management under the care of a doctor.

Here is a great blog with tons of people who suffer from Colitis and Crohns disease testifying to the therapeutic effects and lifechanging experience Kratom has provided for them.\n\nhttp://blogs.naturalnews.com/reversing-ulcerative-colitis-crohns-disease-herbally/","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23003","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shawn Horne","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"When is it going to be peoples health BEFORE mega companies end of year totals?

I work for a contractor to NASA and am not a drug addict. I tried Krakow and found it to be simulating or relaxing. It actually works better than a ibuprofen and a aspirin for my chronic lower back pain that bothers me after standing longer then 2 hours or more. I also have some partial gout on my foot my Dr. Has never seen. Asprin, ibuprofen seem to do nothing and even make my head feel funny. My Dr. Gave me prescription aleve. These seem only to tear up my stomach with acid and heartburn. Kratom seems to work and taste like tree bark with nothing else bothersome. Can't help to wonder if the big drug companies have something to do with this. I don't see how it could be addictive. It's safer then alcohol,  and seems to be more effective then over the counter pain relief but lesser the opioid s. I don't want to go to a pain clinic and become an addict nor do I want to go under a knife. Kratom is a great option that's all natural and any overdose just makes a person nauseous. With that said i think the people would be better served with a FDA recommendation rather then a DEA one.\n\nThanks,\nJacques","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4562","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a harmless leaf that you can make tea out of.

I am a 31 year old citizen of upstate N.Y.  I have been taking Kratom for about 5 years now. I have been using kratom to help relieve some symptoms of anxiety and depression that I have struggled with. I have discussed this with my doctor and have done blood work to make sure it is not harmful to me. My doctor has said that it has not been harmful to me. It has truly helped relieve my symptoms of depression and anxiety. Prior to discovering kratom I had a very difficult time leaving my house and going to work. I have been trying different anti depressants and anti anxiety medication through my doctor over the years with mixed results. I was affected by several side effects over the course of trying to find the right antidepressant. When I started drinking kratom tea many of my symtoms were relieved a great deal. With in the course of 5 years I was able to meet my wife and start a family. We have a 1 year old daughter and another on the way. I was able to start a job I enjoy very much. I work in a treatment facility for youth with mental health diagnosis.  Being that I have struggled with my own mental health issues I feel I can relate well with the youth. I would have never thought that I could of found the relief possible to be able to be a social worker. I learned about kratom by reading for natural ways to relive symptoms of depression and anxiety. I never would of thought that this tea that help me and so many other people could be taken away for being an illegal drug. I drink three cups of kratom tea a day. After i drink a cup my mood is uplited and some of my anxiety is gone. I also experience relief from the lack of energy caused by depression . I dont fell high or out of control at all. I fell it would be devastating to me and so many other people if kratom were taken from us. After reading other people's stories that drink kratom tea I have learned how it help a variety of people.  I fear that many people who struggle with heroin and opiate addiction may be at an even greater risk. I have learned that kratom can also help people who are going through withdraw from these dangerous drugs. It would seem that taking kratom from people suffering from these addictions would be bad for our country. Especially when our nation is in the middle of a heroin epidemic. It seems that it is being used as a natural pain reliever for many people who do not want to be stuck taking dangerous pain killer due to chronic pain.

I am a chronic pain patient, 4 years have been sever, requiring opiate medication.  I am a \nmother of 2, I am not a recreational drug user, I don't drink, I have always worked for a living which resulted in my injuries.   \nI recently received genetic test results, for a test I had to beg for, which shows in science that my body does not handle alternatives to opiates well.  Some examples of\nof medications I have tried with no success and much harm to my body, are motrin, naproxen sodium, meloxicam, Diclofenac, Gabapentin, Topimax, lyrica, steroid packs \nas well as being forced to take steroid injections.  All of these were in effective, most caused unbearable side effects, including mood disruptions, obsessive thinking, vision \nproblems, extreme dizziness, worsening of my symptoms to name a few off the top of my head.  I learned of Kratom on my own in August while looking for a natural alternative\nto my prescribed pain medication, something that would be safer and more effective and less harmful over all.  My opiate pain medication actually causes me fewer\nside effects over all.  My experience with Kratom was very positive.  I didn't take my pain med at all the day I started Kratom, and with in 30 min of taking it my pain eased very\nnoticeably.  I had no drowsiness or foggy thinking with Kratom.  Simply relief to my pain.  Additionally I felt no withdrawal symptoms from not taking my long used opiate pain\nmedication.  I have read so many success stories of people regaining quality of life by using kratom, people who were bed ridden prior who are able to get out of bed and preform\nnormal daily activities.  I have read peoples stories that they over came addiction using kratom, with the addiction issue we have in our country this sounds like a blessing in \nits self.  I would love to see continued studies of Kratom.  Please keep this herb legal for all who have had their lives changed so much for the better.  If kept legal it is a \ngreat option to persons suffering chronic pain who may not have ability to see a doctor regularly, or to afford prescription medications.  It is also a great option for people like\nmy self who have a intolerance to many approved medications.  I would also like to see all doctors educated on genetic testing, and understanding of how this can effect\ntheir patients treatment.  I live between, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh, in a small community no doctor, or pain management specialist I have seen or called in this area\nhas had any idea what this testing is.  When I presented my results to my family doctor he admitted not understanding it at all, \nand said I needed a specialist, but he had no idea what kind.  This lack of education is effecting thousands of lives with ineffective and harmful treatments, its wasting our money\nas well as that of our insurance companies.

As the US and the world has seen over the past 40 years, the war on drugs does not work.  By assigning Kratom to a specific schedule, and therefore assigning illegality to it, we as a nation are continuing to promote a failed system that has only hurt us.  If the government is concerned about the well being of it's citizens, help those who are in need.  People turn to these drugs because there is something wrong, whether that be a physical or mental illness or a rocky portion of their life.  The people who use these drugs should not have to worry about facing some sort of legal consequence, usually jail and restriction of many constitutional rights, on top of the situation they are currently experiencing.  Instead of using tax payer dollars to send our family, friends and neighbors to jail, use that money to create an institution that will help them constructively.  As the world has seen with nations like Portugal, Switzerland and Australia, government run rehabilitation programs work wonders.  Drug use and drug related deaths decline while quality of life increases, not only for the ex-drug users but for everyone.  As with Colorado, tax money collected from the sale of cannabis is being used to better improve education, address homelessness and work towards helping treat addiction.  Everyone benefits from legalization/decriminalization.  The war on drugs is only something that sounds good, it does not actually work in the real world.  It is the same as saying, \"We are going to ensure world peace by locking up everyone who has ever done anything bad.\"  It is not practical and does not solve the issue.  All the war on drugs has done for the world is create dangerous drug cartels, negative stereotypes, social hierarchies, and wasted money that could have been spent on advancing the human race.\nIf Kratom and it's psychoactive chemical compounds are placed under a schedule, we are only slowing our advancement and only hurting ourselves.  End the war on drugs.  Start understanding addiction.  Start caring.  Start helping.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2675","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Josh Amery","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Rick.

I live in Pittsburg, Kansas and I am 42 years old.  I am a disabled wife, mother of 7 boys, and grandmother of 6, (four granddaughters and 2 grandsons).  Also, I am a responsible kratom user.  Due to my having many sensitivity issues , I cannot take most of the standard prescription medications I would need to treat my many physical and mental illnesses. (The negative side effects far outweigh any benefit I receive from taking the medication).  Instead I use a variety of herbs and supplements to support my well being and help me learn to live with with my long list of medical problems.  One of those supplements is kratom.\n\nWith the help of kratom, I have gone from being a helpless bed ridden woman who wanted to die rather then continue to be a burden to my family, to being able attend church, play with my grandchildren, and be the wife and mother that my family needs me to be.\n\nI have never had any type of negative effects from using kratom.  I also have never had any major withdrawals when I have had to stop taking it for a while.  The few issues I do have I would compare in severity to if  I have to go a few days without caffeine. (annoying but tolerable and temporary). I also have not had a single person who I have introduced kratom to, have anything negative to say to me about it.\n\nSupplements are a very important part of millions of Americans' lives.  It should be our God given right to take something that is natural, not harmful, and betters our lives.  For me, Kratom is one of those things.\n\nI believe kratom should remain as it is: unscheduled as a natrual supplement and available to anyone who it would be of benefit to.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nMrs Susan Mapes\nPittsburg, KS 66762\nsusanmapes36@yahoo.com","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0328","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Susan Mapes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 60yr old man I've had 9 surgerys also have a degenerative muscle disease kratom has help me totally with out it I would be dependent on opioids laying around doing nothing please keep this plant legal thank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6999","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steve Hattoy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There seems to be enough information on Kratom to at least warrant further research.

I fell eleven feet and landed on my back on a concrete basement floor.  I broke 6 ribs, shattered my scapula, tore my rotator & labrum, herniated 6 discs and broke 11 (yes eleven) vertebrae.  I'm the guy that doctors are calling the \"miracle man.\"   With out a doubt I should be dead or at the very least paralyzed from the neck down. \n\nUp until this accident I was an ultra endurance athlete.  I competed in everything from Ironman Triathlons to 100 mile ultra marathons.  I even ran the entire Erie Canal  non-stop for 7 days straight (363 miles) with Chris Roman who set the world record.\n\nFor over 20 years I was a barber and had the pleasure of working along side my father every day.  My accident forced me to stop working at the young age of 39.  I applied for disability but of course was denied.  I was told I would have to hire an attorney in order to receive my disability.  \n\nMonths after my accident I tried returning to work.  I was in agonizing pain but still had a wife and 2 children to support.  Living the rest of my life on SS Disability wasn't something I wanted or intended to do.  I was given every prescription pain medication possible.  Unfortunately my body does not metabolize opiates the way most do so I was forced to take a higher than average.  Yet all this did was quickly start to destroy my kidneys and liver.  What's worse is that even at high doses of prescription pain killers I was still in agonizing pain.  After attempting to return to work after my I accident I had no choice but to leave my job for good.\n\nUnemployed, unable to work and in constant pain 24/7, I didn't know what I was going to do.  At that point, with as much pain as I was in I didn't feel that life was worth living.  It wasn't until my best friend stopped by to visit that changed everything for me.  My best friend is a police officer for our city.  He recommended that I give kratom a try.  He explained how it had helped him after he sustained a work related injury which led to surgery.  He handed me a partially used bottle and  insisted I try it..  In just 45 minutes I was standing up walking around my house.  Within a day I knew that I would once again be able to work so I could support my family.  While I wasn't able to return to being a barber, but at least I was able to once again work.  \n\nAs an endurance athlete I was always cautious of what I put into my body.   I didn't believe in taking vitamins, supplements, etc.  I believed in eating right and exercising....period.  Now there's some concern over kratom.  Why?  In my opinion t's all about money but because of kratom I am once again able to lead a somewhat \"normal\" life and most important, I am there for my wife and children.  \n\nDue to the injuries I sustained in my accident I have to use 5-6 grams of kratom 4-5 times per day.  Some will say that  you don't know what the long term side effects are.  Well, It's been 3 years now.  I get routine blood work and never, I repeat... never have had any negative side effects from kratom.\n\nThis wonderful plant has been around for centuries.  I ask you to please consider how many people's lives this plant has saved.  There's no need to regulate this plant in anyway, shape or form.  Let the people choose how they wish to use it.  After all... If you allow cigarettes to be sold in stores to anybody over 18yrs old...  how can you honestly say that I don't have the right to use kratom?\n\nI appreciate your time and consideration regarding this matter.  Should you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2482","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Samuel Pasceri","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am concerned about all the people who have been regular users of Kratom to manage their pain and other ailments.

I am a 40 year old gainfully employed father who works in the Medical industry and has been using Kratom for about 2 years.  Kratom helps me get through the day and deal with chronic pain from injuries, severe depression, and anxiety.  In the past I have had problems arising from the use of alcohol to self-medicate for these issues, but am now living a healthy lifestyle that doesn't include alcohol or prescription drugs, which are far more dangerous than Kratom and have led countless people to death and addiction.  On the other hand, there is NO evidence of this in Kratom users.  The handful of reported deaths involving Kratom ALL include mixing dangerous pharmaceuticals and/or street drugs with Kratom.  Let me repeat that - there is not a SINGLE death linked to Kratom use alone.  Kratom users are mothers and fathers and responsible law abiding adults from all walks of life.  There is no evidence to support the need for scheduling Kratom as a Schedule I drug, and any attempt to do so reeks of uninformed decision making and is a broad over-reach of DEA authority.  Please take into account the thousands of comments here on behalf of the millions of responsible Kratom users in this country, look at the evidence, and make the right decision.\n\nKratom has helped me to live a normal life and to overcome the crippling pain and anxiety that almost destroyed my life.  It has done the same for many others.  It is not harmful, and certainly doesn't represent an 'imminent hazard to the public safety'.  Thank you for your consideration and please take these comments and those of others into account in regard to the proposed scheduling of Kratom.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTD","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18853","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"T D","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To members of the DEA,\nI have been taking Kratom every so often for the past two years for pain reduction. During this time I have gone long periods in between without Kratom and have never once felt even the slightest hint of addiction. The supplements have greatly alleviated my pain that I sustained in a car wreck last year. As for potential harm, when I first discovered Kratom, I was unsure of the necessary dosage and accidentally took way too much. Within an hour, I felt sick and vomited. After vomiting, I felt right as rain and went to work. This happened twice when I was in the trial stages. If Kratom could have been poisonous, or deadly, I am quite sure It would have killed me. In my experience, (and my observation of my roomate, who had a similar experience) when too much is taken, the body simply rejects it and vomiting occurs. After vomiting, you feel as you would have if you had taken the correct dose to begin with. Also my brother, who was a former opiate addict and been clean for 5 years takes Kratom supplements when he gets cravings. I think this plant has definitely helped him to not relapse. This plant has been very beneficial to me and every other person I know who has taken it. Even friends who are generally anti-drug and skeptical do not see it as a threat. Please do not ban this drug without due process of research and laboratory experimentation.\nRespectfully,\nBrandon Crow","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8839","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon Crow","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, My name is Linc Reinalda and i belive that Kratom should be legal because like any drug or tool (such as coffee or ginsing)  when used correctly it helps me be more productive and helps with the stresses of life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17337","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Reinalda Reinalda","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The person on here posting multiple times that Vivazen is \"ruining her son's life\" is either confused or a liar.

In 2010 I  had an automobile accident that after 3 months of recovery, left me with bulging and herniated disks.  The residual symptoms left me with pain, depression and insomnia. At the end of September, I had a devastating diagnosis of Inflammatory Breast Cancer; it is unfortunately a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer.  My treatment plan consists of aggressive treatments of chemotherapy, steroids, not to mention other types of pharmaceuticals that suppress my immune system. If my cancer was not so advanced I would think of approaching it in a alternative form; however, I cannot because I have no choice in the matter. I have developed a new symptom besides the other history I mentioned, and it is extreme fatigue, which is about 75% of my energy level, Mitragyna Speciosa assisted me with making me functional again. \nHaving the choice to alleviate my pain, depression, insomnia, as well as extreme fatigue, I am able to work and function as a Registered Nurse, and still be able to be a functional member of society.  I feel it is important to have the choice to alleviate my symptoms without the use pharmaceuticals. If the choice is taken away from me my quality of life will be much harder to deal with, as well as many Americans like myself that depend on alleviation of devastating symptoms.

I am a 38 years old  business owner in the state of N.C., where I was born and raised. I am strongly opposed to banning the plant Mitragyna Speciosa (Kratom). There is no scientific evidence that it is dangerous. In fact, there is much evidence that supports the opposite. I am in support of regulating Kratom, perhaps an age restriction and proper labeling.   The public has now realized that he war on drugs is a failure. People have woken up to the fact that filling prisons with non violent offenders because of their use or sale of plants is unjust and immoral.  Kratom is a plant. A plant that has been here way before we were and will be here way after we're gone. To make a plant 'illegal' is absurd. To assume control over nature is the most egoic thing one could do. Adult humans should have the right to decide for themselves what they choose to put in their own body. A government that tries to dominate and control the masses to the point of taking away a plant that is safe as a cup of coffee will surely be met with strong resistance the likes of which will not be easily subdued.

I feel that governmental restriction of adults to utilize plant medicine is a gross miscarriage of justice and flies in the face of a core American value.  Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is guaranteed to all citizens, yet freedom continues to be denied, and billions of dollars of tax revenue are WASTED by the failed war on drugs. Instead of putting people in cages for these \"crimes\" committed by individuals that caused no harm to anyone else, why not allow them to choose what they want to put in their bodies?  I have not used kratom, but have heard multiple accounts of it being successfully used to treat addiction to opiates and alcoholism.  Considering the current epidemic of abuse of pharmaceutical of pain killers and subsequent boom in heroin use, research is in order.  Demonizing a plant and taking away possible solutions to major problems does not make sense.  I believe other substances that are currently illegal also fall in this category, from cannabis to psilocybin, MDMA and more.  Protecting the profits of corporations at the cost of an individuals freedom is wrong.  People should not and will not be told what they can or can not use by the powers that be.  Failed policies of the past must change.

Even further concerning is that this is being done with no scientific evidence in place . I am against this action.\n\nI am a forty-one  year old college graduate, senior level professional, married, mother of two.   I suffer  from several debilitating illnesses including degenerative disc disease, endometriosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, chronic lyme, and depression and anxiety as a result.  I have had over 10 failed surgeries in the past few years.  I have struggled significantly with these illnesses, finding it difficult to function day to day.  Missing many days of work and having  to rely on State disability during these times . I have struggled to perform my responsibilities as a mother and a wife as well.   I have been to numerous doctors and been on and off numerous mmedications.   Most of which have not helped and left me with side effects  that added to my difficulty to function day to day.  \n\nI began researching all natural botanical solutions for many of my symptoms.  I also made significant life style changes including diet.  I found this plant, that is part of the coffee family, called Kratom almost 2 years ago.  After thorough research, I gave this all natural botanical a try by drinking it as a tea instead of my normal coffee.   Immediately I began to feel better than I had in years.  Immediately, I was able to function better daily, I was more alert, calm and clear headed than I have been in years.    And my pain level was significantly reduced, something that I have not felt in over 10 years.\n\nSince drinking Kratom tea over the past 2 years, I have been able to eliminate most medications  I was being prescribed to alleviate symptoms.  I no longer need anxiety or depression meds . I no longer need pain medication  and my blood pressure, which was significantly higher due to anxiety and pain, is now in normal levels .  I am now active again, something I  beleived was lost to me, and all this has happened with no side effects.\n\nIn addition, I am working at my high level professional job every day now, no longer needing to rely on state assistance.  I am a wife to my husband of 22 years and a mother to my two children again in ways I have been unable to prior to finding Kratom.\n\nThis is a natural plant, again that is in the coffee family, and it should not be scheduled and banned.  I should have the right to choose an all natural option to help me lead a productive life.  \n\nAlso, a ban now would prevent research into this plant that is helping so many people daily, literally giving people their lives back from the symptoms of chronic illnesses.  An all natural option is something we should all have a right to in this Country.\n\n   I do want to go on record to dispute some issues raised regarding Kratom with this bill.   First and foremost, Kratom does not produce a high and is not dangerous in my experience and based on my research.  Also, I have never experienced withdraws when I do not take Kratom and I do not feel a need to drink Kratom tea on a regular basis .  Straight, unadulterated, plain leaf Kratom is safe in my experience.\n\nAs a follow up, I am adamantly against moving this ban forward . The result would be to either turn this married mother of two into a criminal for drinking tea or force me back on numerous medications that did not help nearly as well and were creating their own side effects. This is not an option at all when it comes down to it.   The ban would require me to go on disability permanently because I could not function on all the meds required because of these side effects.  This ban would take me from a highly functioning member of society, earning a senior level salary, active mother and reduce me to being permanently disabled.  In addition, my quality of life would be severely reduced, affecting me, my children that need me and my family.  \n\nAllow this plant to be studied so it can offer the same benefits to so many other people suffering with diseases, pain, and mental health disorders.\n\nPreserve our right as an American to choose to utilize an all natural alternative to help with symptoms when available and when it works better for them.  \n\nThank you\n\nKristi Tallone","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4160","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kristi Tallone","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please research before schedule I classified.

I am writing this as a plea to not make kratom a scheduled drug and to please keep it totally legal due to all the benefits that it provides. I have been using kratom for around three years now and it has helped me immensely with multiple issues.\n\nI have a herniated disk that presses on a nerve root causing a horrible feeling that makes my arms almost completely numb and creates a burning sensation. The doctor prescribed me opiate based pain medicine and that helped somewhat but after a while it looses it's helpful effects and more is needed. Once I discovered kratom I no longer need the opiate based pain medicine. It completely alleviates the pain and doesn't cause any undesirable side effects. Not only did it help me with that pain but I also have ADHD and discovered it completely helps me control that as well. I no longer have to take powerful stimulants to treat the ADHD that was also prescribed to me. \n\nAfter almost three years of using kratom pretty regularly I have not had any side effects transpire and am able to quite using it without any withdrawal symptoms! It is a natural safe remedy that is not harmful or toxic to me. I believe this to be true because I go to the doctor regularly and I get healthier results every time. \n\nPlease keep kratom legal. People are sharing their testimonies more and more everyday on the benefits they get from kratom. It is a joy to see someone who has been battling drug addictions, feeling hopeless and lost be able to quit completely with the help of kratom as a tool. I am sure being the DEA that this is great news to you. I am a believer in God and feel that he doesn't make mistakes and what is provided in nature has use. Not sure your take on God or beliefs but if you do believe, why would we want to take and destroy something that He has given us for our use? I hope that those people are sharing their stories with you. If you hear and see the results you would not want this to be taken away. It isn't a drug, doesn't get me buzzed or alter my perception anymore than a cup of coffee in the morning does.\n\nThank you for your consideration and keeping an open mind on a very important issue.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn\nNetwork Technician \nSioux Falls, SD 57103","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5723","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have an a-social mental health issue, I'm am constantly irritated and full of anger.

This was about 5 years ago, and for the most part, i have not stopped taken it since. I put 2 tablespoons in OJ every or every other evening and within 45 mins I am playing with my family. You have no idea what this has done for me. I heard rumors about it being addicting so about 6 months ago i stopped taking it for 30 days. Within 5 days the anger and anxiety was back which caused a little sadness to occur but other than that, I had no withdrawal symptoms, no inherent need to take Kratom, no desire to stop my 30 day trial before the 30 days were up. For me, this is a no-brainer, this plant has allowed me to address social issues properly and keep my family in one piece. Do not schedule this plant. Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0834","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Richardson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\n\n       To who it may concern,\n\n       I grew-up on a cattle ranch in northwest Colorado 25 miles from town.  My dad put me to work on the ranch at the age of six fixing fence and feeding the cows in winter and herding cows.  Working has never been a problem even in pain.  but after an accident it became too much so went to the doctor who put me on opiates, which I didn't like.  If you forget to take your meds before bed you will wake up going through withdraws you need to experience that personally too really appreciate how bad it really is.  In recent  years it has become increasingly hard to get the meds.  No doctor will see me in the small town in Wyoming that I how live, I have to drive over two hours over a mountain pass that is often closed in winter to see a doctor so I can give urine (old cowboys do not urine test well) and get a pice of paper to get the meds which I do not particularly care for (the withdraw bullshit comes to mine).  Then like a gift from God of some kind a friend told me about kratom it does not get me high, it makes the constant pain bearable and the withdraws are doable.  You can believe me when I tell you that when you go through withdraws from opiates you will want to self-terminate.  Kratom has saved my life I know you do not care about some old cowboy in some little town in Wyoming, but please do not make me an outlaw.  This is the way it is Kratom,Outlaw or Death.  The constant pain is just too much and the opiate withdraws are even worse.   \n\n                                                   Please Help\n                                              John Dollarhide\n                                        Lazy Dollar Ranch Wyoming\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0418","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Dollarhide","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am blessed to have never struggled with addiction.

Have had all this since 1990. Also have depression and PTSD for many more years than that. I would not take any of the prescribed drugs for pain or the emotional problems because of all the side effects which only cause more problems requiring more meds. They are also very addictive and thousands of deaths are attributed to them every year. I was told about kratom in a pain group on social media. I was skeptical at first,but after speaking to many people who used it I agreed to try it. I was astonished. My pain level,which on the chart,had been a steady 8-10 for over 20 years was now at a remarkably appreciated 3-4. I could now again do the simple everyday tasks I had lost the ability to do. I did my own laundry,went grocery shopping,could go for a walk,and most importantly to me I could do things with my grandchildren. I felt alive again. As an added bonus I discovered I could also socialize by going to church and being around people without stress and anxiety from my depression and PTSD.  Kratom DOES NOT get me high,is no more addictive than coffee(which this plant is in the family of), there are no withdrawals during times I do without due to finances,and there are NO DEATHS attributed to kratom when used alone. The pharmaceutical drugs cannot make any of these claims. I do not want to face losing this plant and going back to the personal hell I endured all those years. I feel useful once again. Banning this plant would hurt thousands of people like myself. We are people looking for a high,just the ability to no longer suffer and feel useless to society. We don't want to lose our dignity.

I'm writing in with my comments on the proposed DEA scheduling of alkaloids in the plant kratom. I believe scheduling is a mistake for several reasons. First, I would like to point out that I have been using kratom on a casual basis for over a year. It serves as a mild stimulant (weaker than coffee) and tonic after lunch that helps me focus and lowers my social anxiety when dealing with the clients my small business serves. It is the only supplement I have ever used that is effective, gentle, and non-habit-forming. Caffeine makes me very paranoid and jittery, and other substances are much more taxing on my body and mind. I was amazed that the DEA wanted to schedule it without doing a modicum of real, balanced research (I thoroughly read their emergency brief, which shows kratom is safer than most household OTCs, prescription drugs, and legal dietary supplements by far). I am personally familiar with people who have used it to wean themselves of hard drugs and are doing so much better and are now functioning members of society. Kratom simply cannot get people high like opioids and has less abuse potential due to that alone, and it has been used safely for centuries. DEA schedule 1 substances cannot be researched easily, which limits the potential treatments that could be derived from the plant in the future. I would like for you to think about why you would remove a safe, life-saving plant from the US market that is beneficial to so many people. Drug policy affects millions of real lives, and it is a shame the removal of a substance that can help people overcome addiction, depression, anxiety, and other issues is being considered. Government agencies should represent the public they serve, and there is no substantial evidence supporting the scheduling of kratom alkaloids based on the information the DEA released. For the good of the American people, please reconsider this decision based on scientific rationale and not some new form of reefer madness. We must all work together to create a better society where people can work together productively, and scheduling kratom is a barrier to that in that it adds unnecessary hardship and suffering to a world where people already have a hard-enough time as it is.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2461","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Quit making plants illegal!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15809","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew hein","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think kratom should stay legal because I have seen it make people clean and sober..it is a great thing..please reconsider banning it..I think it would make some people turn back to illegal drugs..","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8088","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Briggs","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a recovering opiate user, I beg you not to ban the use of kratom!\n\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.

There are forums populated by thousands who ban together to help beat their addiction. 12 step meetings, more secular meetings and clinics are filling up with Kratom addicts. \n\nWithdrawal can be protracted severe (dose and duration dependant, as are most drugs) and mimics that of classic opioids, complete with suicidal ideology. More and more reports are appearing in the literature, how many more do you need?\n\nAlmost all of these groups have something in common, that is with extended use they will escalate their dose and/or dosing frequency.  They will have to, as this particular pathway is ripe with oppositional tolerance, something the medical field has dealt with for thousands of years.  At some point, their tolerance will build to a level where they need Kratom just to feel normal.  Push further and \"off target\" effects will manifest after the therapeutic ceiling has been passed and some of these effects are life threatening.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it is because if you substitute any classic opioid name with the word kratom in the majority of the descriptions you read from the forums, literature, etc.. you will hear the same story.\n\nThat Kratom does not appear to be associated with respiratory depression is no more interesting that situations where an opioid is coadministered with a stimulant, or perhaps an opioid antagonist.  This is playing with fire.  \n\nThere are large batch and lot to lot differences. Quality control is non existent, there is a paucity of safety data in the literature.  Kratom vendors are making millions, they are selling lies that the plant is a panacea, that the plant is benign and \"as safe as coffee.\"  Shame on them, they are pathetic.  Certainly, the plant has medicinal value, but to cast aside the risk part of the risk benefit analysis is irresponsible and truly disturbing.\n\nHow many pesticides or adulterants are users ingesting?  No one knows at this point.  Is Kratom genotoxic?  Has anyone passed its molecules through an Ames or Micronucleus assay?  Does kratom affect hERG channels?  I've seen data to suggest it may.  Does it affect any phosphodiesterases that are important for normal cardiovascular function?  It is neurotoxic?  How does regular use affect male or female endocrine systems?  Is it a teratogen, is it safe for pregnant women to imbibe? \n\nThe fact that there is even a delay in scheduling this drug is a travesty, incited largely by the people getting rich selling Kratom, who have fooled the masses into thinking the drug is something it is not.  Make no mistake, they are getting very, very rich and they are scared.\n\nStudy it for sure, make it available for research absolutely, safety studies, then clinical trials, the works.  But over the counter at this point?  What?  At the very least you should realize that over the counter opioids has been tried ad naseum through history, for anxiety, depression, social functioning, insomnia, etc. etc... and failed.  There is a reason why every pharmaceutical company on planet is searching for non-opioid pain medicines.....\n\nPlease do your job DEA, don't back down from these bullies, these drug dealers. They populate the forums with bogus accounts to accentuate the good, they troll and attack those who have bad experiences.  You have rooms full of very smart scientists and policy makers, you know darn well the masses are ignorant, particularly when narcotics are involved.  \n\nThe last think the United States needs is another addictive opioid on the streets.  \n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0337","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 37 year old California resident who has been using kratom for about 1 year, to support my overall well-being and health. I am a full time homemaker with a BA in Sociology and a JD from a highly-ranked law school. My past employment has been in the areas of education administration and child advocacy, and I would love to become involved with dependency law when I return to work.  As many anecdotal accounts shared across social media over these past few months have shown, I am your average kratom user in the US. I'm not a teenager looking for a legal high or a child headed down a dangerous path. I'm not a drug abuser, settling for kratom until I can get my hands on a harder drug. I'm a middle-aged professional, with a family, contributing to my community and seeking to find natural ways to help find mental and physical well-being.  \n\nSeveral years ago, I reached a crossroads in my life. I was getting older and my chronic pain and anxiety were getting more difficult to manage. I had the intelligence and motivation to accomplish my goals, but my health was beginning to interfere. That is a depressing moment, when you realize that your body could potentially fail you. I turned to some wonderful doctors and plans to deal with my issues were set into place. The surgeries and medicines work, undoubtedly, but I knew that they could only do so much. I started researching vitamin and herbal supplementation, and added several things to my regimen, with the support of my doctor. I discovered that Vitamin D3, Magnesium, Turmeric, Vitamin B6, Melatonin, and Kratom could support my current medication regimen and lessen the chance of needing higher doses or additional medications. Kratom belongs in that list of well-known supplements, because that is what it is, simply a supplement. It is counter-productive to deny that kratom does change the way you feel. It does, but it is self-limiting. I find it difficult to believe it is prone to abuse, as taking too much kratom does not increase euphoria, it increases nausea. It can also cause a mild withdrawal, as does the sudden discontinuation of coffee, Melatonin, nicotine or alcohol. It is difficult to understand using this withdrawal as the basis of scheduling. Alcohol withdrawals can kill people, yet alcohol remains available (as it should), to adults who are informed of the risks. Alcohol remains available to adults with the understanding that some persons will abuse it and need professional help to stop their use. We, as a culture, have allowed adults to make the choice whether or not to indulge in alcohol, responsibly or otherwise, a substance that has almost no health benefits and a multitude of risks. Why should a natural substance, that has many reported health benefits, be any different?\n\nMy heart breaks for those who have lost the fifteen loved ones that the DEA has described, but after reading the few materials the DEA has made available, it is impossible to conclude that kratom was the cause of these deaths. Undoubtedly, when mixed with other chemicals, especially dangerous research chemicals, there can be adverse interactions with kratom. Certainly this is true for every medication and supplement on the market. If I take two of my prescribed medications at the same time, I am at risk for seizure and other neurological issues. Taking an advil with another of my prescribed medications may cause serious stomach bleeding. Taking an extra dose of the Tylenol can cause severe liver failure. Ive been prohibited from drinking grapefruit juice with my prescriptions and I'm always warned about avoiding alcohol, either by my doctor or through printed consumer alerts. Many over-the-counter drugs and supplements can cause adverse health interactions and death, as does alcohol and tobacco. While guidance and age restrictions may be a welcome addition to the industry, this can be accomplished by the recognition of kratom as a dietary supplement.\n\nAlthough it is not my story, it is impossible to ignore that kraton is helping those addicted to illicit drugs. We live in a time where a single town reports hundreds deaths over a matter of days and toddlers are found screaming next to their overdosed parents, all due to opiates. While treatment and sobriety is a noble goal, it is simply not working for too many people suffering from addiction. Drug replacement therapies are not working well enough and incarceration is not working at all. Simply spending a few minutes in online chat rooms devoted to kratom will reveal many anecdotal reports of addicts who have been able to stop using heroin or other drugs after starting kratom use. Many will proudly tell you that they are out of institutions and holding jobs for the first times in their lives. It defies logic to make this substance unavailable when it will cause so many to return to dangerous and deadly addictions. \n\nI urge the DEA not to schedule kratom and to allow its availability to continue in some context. Thank you.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10855","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"R L","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This emergency scheduling is about MONEY, not about \"saving lives and protecting public safety\". \n\nI urge other commenters to read this comment as well, because it is very important. Let me start by saying this: If Kratom becomes schedule 1, there will be blood on the hands of whoever takes part in making this happen. Kratom saves lives, and has the potential to save many more if given the chance to be studied and researched properly. If Kratom becomes illegal, research on it will cease. This can be, and I believe actually is, one of the most effective medicines humanity has ever come across. It could by itself cut the opiate epidemic statistics by a large margin. \n\nIf this ban is truly about saving lives and protecting public safety, if the DEA's JOB is truly about saving lives and protecting public safety, then why would they take away something that is proven to be beneficial to thousands of people?\n\nThis smells just like a fentanyl producer paying large sums of money to anti marijuana campaigns. This ban is about MONEY, and it is a sad day when political fear mongering and media propaganda put out by institutions that have conflicting motives and are clearly unbiased take away the liberties of the American people- liberties that protect them from addiction, anxiety, and provide safe alternatives for people who would otherwise turn to synthetic opiates and alcohol (the big money making drugs of big pharma and marketing: corporate entities that control the political spectrum.\n\nI urge you to reconsider this Scheduling. Restriction is fine, but schedule 1? Get real. Allow medical studies, let this medicine save lives, and stop trying to take away this substance that is proven to benefit thousands. Let science and clinical studies prove it even more. Prohibition has never worked, and never will.\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0216","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom saved my life.

Kratom is not dangerous or harmful, like heroin or prescription painkillers. Kratom is a leaf that comes from east Asia, and has been known for thousands of years. In eastern Asia, they use it as an energy booster, and a pain regulator.\nIt has recently gained popularity in the USA. You are aware of this, as the DEA proposed to ban it as a Schedule 1 substance, and all the wonderful people in the community stood up for what they believed in.\nWhat I, and many others who use kratom believe in, is living a healthy, joyous life. We are not nefarious drug users, waiting for the next fix. We are your everyday people. We are your veterans, your co-workers, your family members, and your friends. We are everyday people, hoping that our freedom to choose how to live our lives is not inhibited upon.\nKratom is no miracle cure, and you must use it responsibly. But I think each person must understand how to use it responsibly. For me, it gives me an energy boost, puts me in a relaxed state of mind, and helps me get through the day with my chronic spine and muscular issues. I do not only rely on kratom, for the most part, I do yoga to regulate my pain; but, there are some days that are significantly more difficult than others. On these days, I brew up some kratom tea, to assist me in moving about and getting out of bed.\nBefore I started drinking kratom, I had no motivation to do anything, even yoga. I had nothing to help with the pain. Kratom brought me to a place where I felt good enough to start doing yoga. It was a stepping stone for me, a stepping stone to a healthier life, as I'm sure is the same with many other people who use kratom.\nI have also spoken to many in the community that stopped using drugs because they found kratom. It has also aided me in this. Before I started drinking kratom, I drank a bit more alcohol than I'd like to admit, and occasionally dabbled in other substances. Nowadays, I don't even really like to drink alcohol! It makes me feel lazy and unproductive. And I don't touch anything else at all anymore.\nKratom is like a vitamin supplement to me. Some days, i just dont need it, I feel fine! Other days, I need a little bit of help, and kratom always helps me.\nI would like you to consider leaving kratom alone. Our country is struggling in the present. We have a few issues, and one of those would be our heroin epidemic. I believe that many of us are not taught how to sincerely take care of our bodies, and as a result, we experience pain as adults; so, we go to doctors, and they hand us a prescription to take away our pain. But as were slowly learning, these prescriptions can have some very serious and sometimes deadly side effects. I have seen friends lose their friends, their family, their job, their home, and their significant other due to their prescription addiction.\nKratom has very few side effects, one of the most common being nausea. I have never seen anybody do anything reckless while on kratom. I have never seen anybody try to harm others, or go through psychosis, on kratom.\nKratom could potentially be an alternative for those who experience pain, and could potentially help our country heal from this heroin epidemic, but not if it's taken away.\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4174","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ashley Day","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"December 1, 2016\n\nGood Day,  \n\nI am Ramona Albanese-Allen, a 56 year old Licensed Social Worker from Ohio. \n\nPlease hear my voice in opposition to the DEA's consideration to schedule the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, which would make Kratom (Mitragynaspeciosa) a schedule 1 controlled substance with no medicinal value.  This will put Kratom, a plant that helps myself and millions of other people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions, on the same level as illegal drugs like Heroin.  It would also make us criminals for using a safe alternative to prescription drugs!  Further, as research, to date, shows Kratom is easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally by providing an effective alternative that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose. \n\nI have been using Kratom to ease my chronic arthritis pain, back pain and leg pain.  I do not experience any side effects from Kratom, only pain relief.   Before using Kratom, I found myself seeking out painkillers from my doctor and began experiencing multiple side effects in addition to pain relief.  These pharmaceutical medications caused me to experience problems such as stomach discomfort, constipation, dizziness, jaw clenching, and low sexual libido.   \n\nCurrently, my pain is minimal with the use of Kratom, allowing me to engage in more physical things and get back into life. My quality of life has improved wonderfully with this natural plant Kratom.

I'm 34 years old. I work as an electrical design engineer. I have a PhD in analytical chemistry. I would very much like to keep kratom legal and unscheduled. I got addicted to prescription pain killers about 10 years ago. I had a knee injury that resulted in chronic pain. After being prescribed hydrocodone for a few months, I because physically and psychologically addicted. I was barely functional in my every day life as a result and almost got dismissed from graduate school and I got divorced. When my injury was fixed with surgery, I tried weaning off with very little success and eventually tried two different suboxone treatment organizations. Not only were they too expensive to continue as long as I needed, but the suboxone was just as addictive as the pain killers and even more expensive than buying pills off of the street. As a result, I stayed preoccupied with pain pills and how to obtain more. I also drank alcohol 3-4 nights a week to stave off withdrawals and try to numb my depression. I do extensive online research in the field of chemistry and natural products for interest. One day, about 14 months ago, I came across talk of kratom and ordered some to test the effects myself. I can honestly say, since I did, my life changed extensively for the better. I not only stopped searching for pills and using them, but I also stopped drinking and joined the gym. I get a little energy boost from kratom but I also got a \"clean feeling\" mood elevation without feeling like I took a drug to simulate the effect. I go a couple of days at a time without taking kratom sometime and it doesn't seem to bother me with withdrawals. Also, since I stopped spending so much on booze and pills and stopped looking for them, I met a wonderful woman and got married to her. I am genuinely afraid of what my cravings will do if I am cut completely off of kratom. This substance can have some dependence associated with it but so can coffee or any pharmaceutical development.

He said kratom was the only thing that stopped the crippling withdrawals besides more heroin or others opiate narcotics.  I didn't hear of it again until I had my own problem with opiate narcotics. I had got myself in a bad snowboarding accident and was prescribed Percocet.  It's funny how people around you start talking about painkillers when you are injured because shortly after the accident I had a steady supply of painkillers that weren't coming from a doctor. It didn't take long and I was out of money from buying narcotics off the street. My friend saw me in bad shape and kratom was introduced.  The kratom didn't make me feel as high as the painkillers, but I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms anymore. My pain was now under control and I wasn't falling asleep standing up anymore with drool poring down my face. \n\nI have lost many friends I went to school with to opiate addiction. I moved a thousand miles away from home just to get away from it.

I was more addicted to suboxone than anything else because it was supposed to be the cure. \n\nWhen someone takes kratom recreationally they are disappointed. When they take it because they need help, it seems to work very well. \n\nIf it's ok for people to take opiate painkillers made in labs that potentially kill people.

I have used kratom for the last 2 years for back pain reduction, energy, focus, and creativity. As a scholar and professor, I developed over the years some minor but disturbing back pain after sitting innumerable hours in front of a computer writing, reading, and grading students' papers. The use of kratom (even less than 1g works) has successfully alleviated/eliminated that pain, allowing me to work more effectively and serve better my students. In addition, I have also used it to increase energy and focus when meeting challenging writing or publication deadlines (or beat debilitating jet lags when traveling to speak at international conferences). I don't drink coffee and don't like the feeling of being under the effect of caffeine (e.g., it makes irritable, affects negatively my sleep, and I feel it creates addiction) and so finding kratom was literally God-sent. I have never experienced any negative side effect or addictive tendency towards the substance (in contrast to say sleep pills, I can at any point stop using it with zero withdrawal or rebound effects). In my experience, kratom is not only immensely benign but also less strong than coffee so I was shocked when I learnt about the DEA's original pursuit to schedule this substance. I have no doubt in my mind that any objective research (beyond important but still anecdotal personal reports such as the present one) will provide ample scientific evidence against the case for scheduling kratom. In any event, I appreciate the DEA's reconsideration of its original pursuit and the present request to American citizens to share their experientially informed opinions.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4249","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Legalize it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9799","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paul Wilcox","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban kratom.

There are many benefits that get drowned out by the negative hype.   Let people learn without fear or judgement or the urge to rebel against those who would control us.   People want their lives to work.  Don't make us criminals. Whether someone wants to use substances for fun (god-forbid, call the fun police!), or needs them for serious reasons, the only way things are going to work long-term is when people have the freedom to figure out what really works for themself.   \n\nThank you for your service, and for listening to your fellow Americans' honest, heartfelt testimonials.

I have been a regular consumer of kratom, along with several friends of mine, for the past year. Not only is this tea not addictive whatsoever, I have not experienced or witnessed ANY negative side effects of kratom consumption. Any regular kratom consumer can testify that kratom does NOT get any consumer \"high\"; it is consumed solely for healthful benefits and taste. What are the incredible benefits of kratom experienced by consumers? Personally, it relieves my stress and anxiety, and consuming several cups of certain strains may enhance a \"pep in one's step\", on a level no higher than a cup of coffee would. Kratom has proven essential to my friends and many others in need of chronic pain relief and the easing of withdrawal symptoms experienced by those withdrawing from heroin and other hard drugs. I'm sure by now you have received countless other testimonials explaining how crucially kratom aids victims of drug abuse who are attempting to leave illegal substance abuse behind for good. Again, I must reiterate that kratom provides no high at all, nor any negative side effects to one's health, yet is considered a \"God-sent\" herb by many in need of it's aforementioned benefits. It's appalling to think that Americans may have one more freedom taken away just so greedy pharmaceutical companies can cut out any competition to their synthetic drugs. I urge you to please do the right thing, look at independent studies done on the benefits of kratom before condemning this harmless, health-benefitting plant to an illegal status. The wellbeing and relief of a great many people depends on your logic and ethics. Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter.\n\nSincerely,\nLindsay K.

I was on Vicodin for about 3 years due to a lower back injury, but when the pills got cut off by a new doctor, I nearly died. I was introduced to Kratom by a good friend of mine who uses it to control the symptoms of depression, but also mentioned it had some analgesic properties if the correct strain was acquired.  I found \"Bed Borneo\" Kratom, and took I it to wean myself off of opiates with ease over the course of about a month and a half. \n\nYears later, a second injury occurred; this one happened just over a year ago, and resulted in reconstruction surgery on my right hand (my dominant hand).  I am a senior at Tarleton State University, TRYING to finish a bachelor's degree in biochemistry.  My current GPA is 3.85 and classes are going well, with the help of Kratom, as I have chronic pain in my hand due to the reconstruction and I simply can not write without the help of Kratom to numb the pain. As you can imagine, I have to do a great deal of writing for all my classes, and Kratom kills the pain without giving me a drugged up feel like opiate pain killers do, and it's natural, not synthetic. \n\nMy injury happened at the beginning of last summer so I chose to stay with my parents, though I was 29 years old at the time (unmarried, no kids, no roommate at my home).  I couldn't use my right hand; I had 3 sliced finger tendons and one wrist tendon hanging on by a thread repaired, I was in all kinds of crazy splints to position my fingers and wrist in stretched out directions (which was a ton of pain in itself) and a ton of physical therapy to do all day every day. \n\nI was prescribed Vicodin again and for three months I took the medication as prescribed, and then again the doctor cut me off right as school started.  I immediately went into withdrawals.  I felt like I was going to die, but luckily I had some Kratom that I acquired to treat a sprained ankle, and I was able to keep myself out of withdrawal for classes.  Those were two 4.0 semesters.  My full ride in scholarships... let's just say had it not been for Kratom, my academic career (which was and still is going great, no thanks to prescription opiate pain killers) would have bit the dust.\n\nWeaning off of opiates with Kratom leaf has really saved my future and helped me to live out my dream to be somebody better, smarter, healthier, and do great things with my life.  In contrast, the physical and psychological warfare that is true opiate painkiller withdrawal is brutally depressing hellbent torture of the soul and the body. I would rather be lashed with a spiked whip 100 times in a row than go through prescription opiate withdrawals without such a helpful aid like Kratom.  Kratom withdrawal is existent, but it's a walk in the park compared to true opiates, with half the side effects and 1/4 as bad, and I can still even do my school work if I don't have Kratom!  Without pills I would be crying out in agony.\n\nKratom is not for everyone, but for those that find some solace and some peace of mind from pain or depression or whatever else it may be, I do not believe it's your right to take that away from us.  The war on drugs is a failure from the perspective of creating a country mentally healthy citizens, which is what I believe its original purpose was.  Now that we have facts and evidence proving otherwise, It is truly just a war on sick people now.  \n\nActually, I would call for education and rehabilitation to immediately replace prison and jail for all non-violent drug users.  These people are most often times sick and need help, not to be thrown in prison and indoctrinated into the Arian Brotherhood, or the Bloods, or the Cryps, or [insert violent criminal enterprise here]...  Just look at the statistics in Portugal.  Violent crime is down drastically.  Heroin use has roughly been cut in half because people aren't scared they're going to go to prison when they go get help!  \n\nAs an American and as a logical human being, this is how I see the enforcement of the drug laws: They have created a whole new society where people are filled with contempt for the police, the DEA, and the federal government in general, as families are torn apart by the thousands in the name of the prohibition of an individual's free will!  Is the War on Drugs a success in your eyes?  The numbers show an abysmal failure... I urge whoever reads this to please search your conscience, and understand that controlling how people medicate should be none of the government's business so long as it doesn't harm another person.\n\nAlcohol prohibition didn't work. Drug prohibition hasn't worked. Kratom prohibition won't work.  The medicinal benefits of Kratom far outweigh any risks, unless of course you figure in 10 years in prison as a risk.  After all, no one has died from Kratom alone, only in combination with other drugs- often prescription painkillers or benzodiazepines.

I have reviewed what documentation is available on these two substances and find their is no sound basis for the DEA determination that the substances are \"a drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse\". I have found no indication that these substances or their natural form kratom have any potential for abuse. These substances do not meet any of the definitions for any category of Scheduled drugs and should not be classified as dangerous or having any abuse potential. \n\nIt would be in the best interest to reduce the Schedule I and II drugs, to ones that actually are doing society harm more than alcohol and cigarettes. The hypocrisy that is inherent in the system where alcohol and cigarettes, both with a huge potential for abuse and harmful effects on the public, are not scheduled, but somehow kratom could be. \n\nI request DEA release their analysis of kratom and its active substances, showing scientific data for the 1) harmful effects at normal usage and 2) high potential for abuse. \n\nAs a tax payer, I feel the DEA better serves society by dealing with dangerous drugs like heroin which is near epidemic levels, and leave substances alone which are not killing people or causing crime, hurting society.

I can say as a 36yr old, upper middle class engineer, that i LOATHED taking prescription opiods. Kratom has freed me of that burden.\nI have had 2 back surgeries. Kratom. Works. I don't know how you would \"get high\" off of it either. Overdose????? More people died from lighting strikes, no kidding.\nHow about those Tide laundry pods? Why not make them schedule 1?\n\nStop working for the pharmaceutical company and work for the people of the United States.\nWe all know that after the ban, IF it happens, that Kratom will be available through prescription and an insanely increased price. Same drug, same effects, MASSIVE price hike.\nWe are not \"junkies\", we are not \"addicts\", we are your neighbors. We are your sons, daughters, fathers, mothers and so on. \nSo, in closing, banning Kratom will push a lot of people like myself into the miserable downward spiral that is pain management, aka: taking prescription heroin to \"feel better\".\nNo thanks. I'll take the natural remedy any day of the week.\n\nI have already contributed 100 dollars to this fight against the iron fist of the DEA. Please do the right thing.\n\nI don't even need to touch on the stats dealing with mass incarceration in this country for non violent drug offenders. Your ban will ensure that the number only grows, ruining average, hard working people's lives in the process.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9309","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Nance","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"}],"totalNumRecords":23226}
