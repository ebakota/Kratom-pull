You can read more about my career via\nmy web (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Reyes).\n\nThe reason I'm telling you all this is not to brag about my accomplishments but to tell you that I couldn't \nhave done any of this without the aid of kratom. In 1997, When I was 12 years old I was chopping wood on a camping trip\nand put an axe in my knee which ruined my posture and walk for life. Eight years later, I was robbed and dropped on my\nhead on the concrete which throughout my spin. In both instances, I was prescribed heavily-addictive painkillers\nwhich caused me to have significant withdrawals and depression. \n\nKratom was a lifesaver as I can only take a little of it in tea form and the pain would go away. In addition, \nwhen I didn't take it, there were no withdrawals and it was the same feeling as if I just hadn't have drunken\ngreen tea in awhile. \n\nI'm currently speaking on behalf of around 75 kratom users within our community. We've come together\nto ask you not to ban this tea, this plant that is a natural, risk-free way of helping us out there who\nlive with pain. It is not dangerous, not hazardous.  \n\nWe in the community have had heard stories of those who had gotten sick and those you have died but \nwe need to tell you that it is not because of Kratom, it's because they took too many painkillers, specifically\nTramadol, and they just happened to be drinking Kratom at the same time. This is the error of the youth and\nif anything we would support more education on how to use Kratom or at the most a age limit on who can purchase it\n(over 18). \n\nPlease take this comment into consideration when evaluating whether or not to schedule Kratom.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nEmiliano Reyes \n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0158","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Emiliano Reyes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA,\n     I have heard and seen evidence of Kratom saving millions of peoples lives.  People who were addicted to dangerous hardcore drugs.  I have seen people go from near death, addicted to opiates, stealing from their friends and family to being completely normal, not high, but functioning clearly mentally and physically competent.  The seriousness in this decision will result in prior addicts continuing to be happy and healthy, or millions of addicts returning to their vices, overdosing and poisoning society in the numerous ways people lost to addiction do.  To be honest, I would consider Kratom to be more of a coffee than anything, but it is a coffee that saves people from the demons they will battle for their entire lifetime.  Be sensible, all the other options for dealing with hard drug withdrawal- i.e.- Methadone and Suboxone are dangerous to society and can kill a user upon cessation of administration of the drug.  They keep users hooked on the pharmaceutical company and the drug that the pharmeceutical companies are selling the populations.  Please use good judgement when making the decision on this specific plant.  Kratom is a god-send and without it I am sure we would see soemthign comparable to the opiate epidemic of the early 2000's.   Being raised in Charlotte, I have lost many friends to the dark side of drug abuse.  It steered me clear of it but I still felt compassion seeing my friends lose their lives and families because of addiction.  This plant gives people the power to move through life without the use of dangerous drugs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16564","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Saunders","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir/madam,i am a 51 year old cab driver,father of two in the u.k.I am trying to support American kratom users as I truly believe its use makes a positive affect on users'(and the people around them)lives.Four years ago I started using codeine for dental pain,which was taking some time to be treated.During this period,which spanned 6months,i used codiene fot the pain and became addicted to its calming affects.This carried on for about 2years and to be honest with you,i was becoming concernd as I didn't know where this would end.Quite by chance I found a statement regarding kratom as a substitute for codeine.I did some research and ordered some kratom even though I was sceptical it would work.I experience panic disorder and depression and my prescription medication wasn't doing the job but codeine was helping a great deal although this was a dangerous route;so a lot was hanging in the balance of the expectancy of kratom's affectiveness.To my utter amazement kratom not only helped/helps me deal with my condition but took away my craving and need for codeine.It has been 2years since I used codeine as kratom has safely and more affectively dealt with my condition.It scares me to think of the consequences of kratom not being available as it is now;i honestly believe it would be a bad move to make kratom illegal.Thankyou,Steve Adams","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9082","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"steve adams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We should have the freedom to decide for ourselves what we put in our bodies.

Please do not force people who need this NATURAL GROWING PLANT WITH NO HUMAN ADDITIVES to be taken away from people who would otherwise be using opiates without doing research to PROVE that it is absolutely dangerous.\n\nClearly, by using processed sugar, man made drugs, and keeping people away from natural supplements/food we are causing more problems to our society than keeping things natural. I believe increased diabetes and the opiate drug epidemic are enough to support this claim without me having to cite references and sources. The death tolls created by man made substances GROSSLY outweighs the (zero?) deaths from natural substances.

I do not believe that kratom should be scheduled at all. This kratom plant is not dangerous and certainly not a public health threat. Any deaths that are trying to be pinned on kratom are not kratom fault. Those deaths had other illicit drugs involved and/or powerful prescription drugs. \n\nKratom has been used for thousands of years and has shown many benefits to its users. I have personal experience with the plant but have also witnessed some of my friends use it as well. Kratom has never once given me a \"high\" feeling or even intoxicated feeling. Kratom was extremely helpful me dealing with my anxiety and depression. I neve once felt drawn or addicted to kratom, not have my friends. It's almost reminds me of taking a vitamin in the morning, you take it and just forget about it until the next day. Neither me nor my have experienced negative side effects from kratom use. We have only benefited from our use. \n\nSo I urge to please reconsider scheduling kratom has it is not harmful at all. It has helped many people get off harder drugs like prescription painkillers and deal with other ailments. It would be a real disgrace to add another natural plant to the pointless drug war that does more harm than the outlawed drugs themselves. If anything, limit the age of people who can buy the kratom plant. But please leave it in the open market for those who need without making only available through prescription. \n\nThank you for your time and I hope you consider my opinion.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20532","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do believe that there sould be a lot more reserch done before it is made a schedule 1 drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17947","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Larsen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Opiate addiction is killing people.

At first it was to help with depression.  I was self medicating.  I have no history of substance abuse.  However, I could not stop taking kratom even when I desperately wanted to quit.  Kratom turned me into a different person.  All I thought about was dosing.  I skipped meals.  I lost weight.  I neglected my spouse which ultimately ended in divorce.  When I couldn't get my kratom in the mail I would drive for hours to a nearby vendor to score my powdered leaf.  I was an addict in every way, shape and form.  My life was taken over by this addiction.  \n\nAfter literally dozens of failed attempts to get clean I was finally able to quit this year.  It was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life, but also the most rewarding.  I am now 100+ days clean from kratom.  It is hard to believe.  I thought I would never break free.  This plant is insidious, addictive and dangerous.  \n\nThe people who claim it helps with pain are lying to themselves.  I suffer from chronic pain and kratom did NOTHING to relieve my symptoms.  As my tolerance grew, I had to take more and more to get any effects.  Again, I was self medicating for depression.  And in the midst of my using, I actually felt worse than before I started with the kratom.  The guilt, the self loathing, the utter darkness that opioid addiction brings on were all present.\n\nI was in a very dark place using this powder every day.  In fact so dark that suicide crossed my mind on more than one occasion.  Like most addictions, kratom brought on hopelessness and desperation.  I actually prayed for divine help in order to quit and I am not a religious person.  I think of the thousands of people that are currently in this state of mind and I am fearful that they may never be able to quit without a ban or at the very least some form of regulation.  Kratom on the internet is virtually like the Wild West.  That is scary.\n\nI have to believe that the people against the ban are most likely profiting from the sale, or addicted and in denial.  Please do not back down from scheduling this plant.  Lives are at stake here.  This is not hyperbole.\n\nI hope the DEA follows through with controlling the sale and distribution of Kratom.\n\nSincerely,\nA former kratom addict","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0783","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is an all natural  alternative to opiate medications.

Several years ago (in 2009), I injured myself wherein I severely damaged my L5/S1 disc in my lower spine, severing part of the disc.  Living life with this injury has created an element of chronic pain, even with the help of physical therapy, occasional epidural spinal injections, and additional treatments.  I have met with several Orthopedic and Pain Specialists, all of who say that Surgery may not fix the problem, and at such a young age is not a recommended long term strategy.\n\nAs most Doctor's do while trying to help their patients, they began to proscribe powerful Opiod painkillers (Hydrocodone / Oxycodone) to help with increased periods of pain.  Unfortunately, these came with numerous side effects, and additional addictive and dependent tendencies.  Here is where Kratom comes in - as of January of this year, I began looking for a more effective, less debilitating, less risky & less inebriating option to help with the day to day pain. I stumbled across this substance called Kratom.  A leaf of a tree from Southeast Asia that when ground up and consumed in either Powdered form or in a Tea, had substantial user anecdotal reports of if being a very helpful pain reliever.  I decided to try this \"natural supplement\" and see if I may be fortunate to experience the same benefits.  Safe to say, this plant absolutely does help and has helped me to completely stop all prescription Opiod painkillers, assisted me with better energy and focus throughout the day, and has dramatically increased my sense of well being (two BENEFICIAL \"Side Effects\" !).  In addition, with the elimination of Hydrocodone from my system, the more sedentary lifestyle has gone the wayside and I have lost 30 (healthy) pounds since beginning my consumption of this leaf Kratom. (Another Beneficial \"Side Effect\" !)\n\nNow fast forward to September of this year, and I discover that a branch of the Federal Government has decided that this leaf is an impending \"health crisis\" and therefore needs to be immediately banned.  A substance that, in my eyes and through my experience, has dramatically IMPROVED my life, helped me to abstain from more powerful (but \"Allowed\") and addictive narcotics, and is very mellow but effective in its use.  How is this such a dangerous substance that it needs to be outright banned?  What is the benefit behind this?  I approached half a dozen ER and Anesthesiologist friends of mine and asked them if they have seen any concern of people coming in, experiencing severe harm or death from the plant called Kratom?  None of them had ever heard of this substance, let alone seen it be any issue or harm to society as a whole.\n\nI am sincerely appreciative of the Drug Enforcement Administration taking a step back on this substance, giving it the review that it deserves and to not proceed with the emergency \"ban\" which, in my opinion, would create much more harm to society then benefit.  It is my firm belief that this substance can be very beneficial to our society as a whole, and should remain as an unscheduled substance for the safe consumption and availability for all.  I would additionally support regulations of this substance (similar to the natural botanical \"Kava\"), that helps to govern the safe use, production & distribution of the product.\n\nI appreciate you all allowing this comment period and for giving me the opportunity to voice my opinion on the matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15843","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Rowe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Susan Carpenter.

Were kratom added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and imprisoned, a service to the drug enforcement industry and private prisons only at the cost of intentionally disservicing US citizens in order to attack and imprison people with drug dependencies.\n\nFurther, kratom has seen medical benefit as a potential pain reliever and less-harmful opioid substitute. Opioid addicts have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit. By stupidly reclassifying kratom further promising scientific studies in opioid treatment would be immediately shut down in favor of guaranteed ignorance.\n\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14482","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steven Bard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The possibilities of kratom are out of this world yes it helps with pain but in my experience and others I have shown, it is not addictive.

My new doctor would not give me the sleep meds anymore.  She didn't think I needed to be on them.  \n\nThen I began drinking, heavily, so I could go to sleep at night.  Over a period of about 1 year, I went from drinking a couple of glasses of wine at night, to drinking a full bottle of Vodka every night, just so I could go to sleep.  I actually was not going to sleep, but passing out.   \n\nMy parents were both alcoholics, and when I first started drinking the wine, my husband was concerned  that I was going to become one too.  I told him that was ridiculous, I'm 46 years old (at the time) and if I was going to be an alcoholic, I would have been one by now.\n\nWell, that's exactly what happened, I had become an alcoholic.  I lost my job, and almost lost my husband, who I had been married to since the age of 18.  I had been to rehab a few times, it would last for a little while, and then I was right back drinking.  \n\nI found out about Kratom, from a family member, over a year ago. She had been on pain medication for several years, for chronic pain.  While the pain medications stopped her pain, she was unable to function in her daily life. She was searching for an alternative to alieviate her pain, and allow her to function.  After much research, she discovered Kratom. She successfully was able to stop taking the pain meds. The Kratom helped her with the withdrawals and alleviate her pain.  While she still has pain, she is able to function in her daily life, working and taking care of her children. I was very skeptical when she first suggested I try it to assist me with being able to stop drinking.  \n\nWell, I tried it, and I can now say that after drinking for 10+ years, I was able to stop drinking.  It was hard work, but the Kratom helped to alleviate the withdrawal. It also helps me to relax and my brain to shut down at night, so I can get a good nights sleep. I have been able to maintain sobriety, for over a year now. \n\nI am extremely concerned that if Kratom does become a schedule 1 drug, I will no longer be able to maintain my sobriety.  Since taking Kratom, I have been able to live a happy, normal, and productive, life.  I have started my own business, and saved my marriage of 38 years. \n\nI believe the benefits of this supplement, outweighs any of the negative effects that have been speculated about Kratom.  It needs to remain available to people who it helps to maintain a normal, happy, and healthy life.  \n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1800","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sheri Quillen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I started using Kratom when my doctor could not prescribe pain meds anymore.

People in pain can't help but feel like this is an attack on us you're banning a plant that grows naturally and has multitudes of medical properties from pain to even helping people get offree Nasty drugs like heroin. This ban is not right...this plant should be researched because it has the ability to help people I know this because it has been a godsend to me.

I went to a good school in a good neighborhood with upper middle class upbringing.  I did well in school and graduated from college.  I started using after being prescribed narcotic cough medication.  I found that I enjoyed the medication and called the pharmacy for more.\n\nThe pharmacy was able to send an electronic request to my drs office where likely an unqualified office/worker sent over 6 refills for the medication.  The rest is history.\n\nYou should focus on issues like these.  Since then that prescription would now need a hard copy and a Dr's signature.  That was a smart and reasonable move.  \n\nAdding a central narcotic registry check like in other states would be a more useful law to in-state.  While I didn't MD shop myself, I know some of my sources did.  Minimizing that would be a start.  Most users don't start with heroin.  The goal should be to prevent the users from starting with pharmaceuticals.

It greatly improved my quality of life. The effects are similar to coffee mixed with an ibuprofen, but without the jittery effects of caffeine. It also has some minor mood-boosting properties. It provides a focused, clear-headed feel, and I never felt any negative side effects. The comparisons to heroin and prescription painkillers are absurd. \n\nI no longer use it, and quitting was not particularly difficult. I felt a little grouchy for a couple days, similar to a coffee drinker without their coffee.\n\nI also have two friends who say it has helped save their lives. one friend was addicted to prescription painkillers after two botched surgeries, and found relief with kratom. Another was a severe alcoholic, and used kratom to help him kick the habit and keep him stable.\n\nDespite knowing many who have used kratom, I've not heard of a single person who has overdosed on it. Not a single person has resorted to robbery to support their habit. Compare this to heroin or prescription drugs, which are the cause of an epidemic of overdoses and theft. Kratom is part of the solution to the opioid crisis, not part of the problem.\n\nA great many citizens are horrified at the prospect of the DEA's proposed action to illegalize kratom. It will harm many lives and take the focus away from the real drugs, like heroin and prescription painkillers, which are actually legitimate threats to public health.\n\nThe DEA needs to realign its priorities with this reality.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8631","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nathan Farland","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom needs to stay legal.

It has changed life for many many people. There are thousands of success stories from people who have quit drugs such as heroin, methadone, and prescription opiate pain killers along with deadly benzodiazepines. It does not get you high but what it does do is amazing! So many benifits from this wonderful plant. Anyone who wants to ban this needs to log into these\nKratom groups on Facebook and see all the wonderful people who have gotten their life back because of this magical plant. The community is so kind and helpful. They help each other and give amazing advice which really saves people's life. Without kratom, these people might have to resort back to harmful, dangerous, pain killers to be able to function from their long term illnesses and diseases. No one should be hooked on these terrible opiates. It is much safer for a person to take a spoonful of kratom than it is to shoot up heroin, take pharmaceutical pain killers, or anything of the sort. Let these people keep their plant. It is just like coffee. Do what is right. Think with your heart. These people need kratom. Without it, their lives are ruined. Please do logical research on it.

Tried all the, by my doctor suggested, medications without any improvements, so started going for a natural approach as suggested by my physician.  Going for acupuncture, changed my diet, taking vitamins and supplements.  One of my supplements is Kratom, which I am so grateful, I found, a few months after my new approach.  It has made such a difference in improving my way of life, that I am not bedridden 24/7 anymore.  I have more good days now, than ever before.  I know there is no actual treatment and no cure for my illnesses, but the relief I'm am getting from my life changes before and after taking Kratom as an additional support are unbelievable.  I can be a grandmother again and enjoy my grandsons.  My life partner and caregiver has suddenly passed away, but I am trying to take care of myself and not be a burden to my sons.  That idea would have been impossible before my support from Kratom.  I would hate for one of my important supplements to be taken away, and be put back in bed on strong pain medication and antidepressants, which would be the only option I would have, if Kratom would be taken away from me.  It is a natural plant, given to us from nature to improve our health.  It is not an opioid, I know how I feel while taking them, or in any way makes me feel high or addicted.  It just helps me feel better.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

Based on personal experience, I do not believe that kratom conveys a high potential for misuse or abuse.\n\nI am a 42-year old husband and father of two. I have suffered from ankylosing spondylitis since 2010 and am under the care of a rheumatologist. Over the course of my disease, I have constantly battled the toxic effects of my medications (anti-TNF, DMARD, NSAIDS, OTC analgesics and RX analgesics) on my liver.\n\nI have been taking kratom in the form of tea brewed from plain, ground leaf since November 2015 to support my health and wellness. Since drinking kratom tea, I have been able to reduce and/or eliminate my use of analgesics (both OTC and controlled) reversing poor AST/ALT levels. My routine blood labs ordered by my rheumatologist have returned to within normal range. \n\nAlthough kratom has been identified by the DEA as a drug of abuse, my personal experience contradicts the DEA's claims. Since starting to drink kratom tea, I have experienced a marked increase in my ability to be more active in the lives of my family members. I actually have the energy to throw a football with my son. I can get on the floor and play with my daughter. I lead an active life again.\n\nI have experienced no compulsion to take ever-increasing amounts of kratom, nor have I experienced any tolerance issues. I am drinking less kratom tea than I did when I started, and have been taking a stable amount for months on end.\n\nI have experienced only minor withdrawal issues. I have stopped drinking kratom tea on occasion and experienced a discontinuation syndrome that was a little worse than stopping coffee. The symptoms are minor irritability and headache. The worst part was increased joint and tendon pain due to underlying chronic disease.\n\nI urge the DEA to take a measured approach to kratom, one that errs on the side of chronically ill Americans, and maintain kratom's current regulatory classification as non-controlled. This will allow research into this promising herbal dietary supplement to continue, which would otherwise evaporate if kratom is moved to Schedule I.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22725","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Thomas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 58 year old female.

Two of my friends had developed their prescription opioid habits into life-crippling Heroin addictions. They are alive and clean today thanks to the help of Kratom. All of us have moved on to better things in life than cheap, addictive highs that come from dangerous drugs like oxycodone and heroin. None of us continue to use kratom, nor do we show any ill effects from long-term use of it. This is very useful herbal substance, that saves lives and gives an alternative to addictive substances that lead to jail and death. It self-regulates as well - if you take too much, like you are trying to chase a high, you'll feel pretty terrible instead, and you certainly won't overdose and die. I'd say that's a pretty damn good Therapeutic Index, compared to the other options out there. Taking this away will cost lives. If you're in doubt, I have several grave sites of friends you can visit, that never found their way out of heroin addiction, never found kratom, and traditional medical help failed them.

When I was 20 I seriously injured my lower back doing work and was put on vicodin for the pain. Well taking the medication at work allowed me to take my injury even deeper and now at 30 I have a chronic repetitive stress injury that I just can't seem to heal. It's been even harder to function the past 5 years since I've decided to stop taking pills. Due to my immobility and stress from pain I've also had issues with depression and anxiety, but refuse to go back on medication. Yoga and meditation have been a huge help for me, but sometimes I'm in too much pain to even engage yoga. This is where kratom is very helpful. Like a cup of coffee I can have some in the morning and it helps with physical and mental stress. If I'm hurting too bad to do yoga with a little bit of kratom I can find myself on the mat getting through a 30 minute yoga session without great affliction. I've been using kratom on and off for the past 4 years and have noticed no negative side effects from it. I could write a very long list from the negative side effects of vicodin pills so I will: constipation, aggravation, temper, anger, nausea, addiction, sexual impotence, dizziness, inability to urinate, stomach sharpness, headaches, cold sweat, and not to mention having no money left over from buying my pills. Please don't take kratom away from us. I'm terrified of the future if you do. I can't and won't go back to medication. Thank you for listening to my story.

I would really hate to have to go painkillers as I always prefer a more holistic approach to pain management and healing. With all the evidence that has been brought to light, I can't imagine why the DEA would want to ban kratom as it has immense benefits to society at large. \n\nPlease leave kratom as is, unregulated and free to consume.

Throughout the course of 5 years my addiction escalated to heroin and other opiates. Since my sobriety I've been using Kratom primarily to stave off craving and initial withdrawal symptoms. I didn't want to use any actual opiate drugs such as suboxone because I found that stuff to be more dangerous than heroin itself.  I've successfully stayed  sober for 8 months thanks to Kratom (and myself of course). \n\nMy personal concern with the Kratom ban is how it will become unavailable to me either through legality or if it would become controlled by the state causing it to become too expensive or difficult to obtain. I also wouldn't want to be at risk of being a felon for possessing it. It's hard to comprehend the fact that I would be considered a criminal for using this plant to keep me away from criminal behavior and destructive lifestyle. Seeing how it's worked so well for me and other people makes the matter of Kratoms legality even more prominent.  Considering how our nation is in the middle of a severe opioid epidemic makes it even more vital to stay available to the public, and even utilized more by doctors. The limited research and alledged \"opiate high\" is enough for people to want it banned but that would be impulsive and catastrophic if it is generally harmless. Of course excessive Kratom use is bad but that goes for everything, it's just common sense not to take excessive amounts. \n\nWhen I first sobered up from heroin I was taking Kratom daily but has slowed down to maybe twice a week, and with time it became easier to live without a crutch. If Kratom is banned, and put in the controlled substance schedule then I believe it should be exclusive to drug addicts because of how many success stories of recovering addicts have surfaced. I feel Kratom should be utilized more instead of opiate drugs in terms of pain management because unlike opiates it doesn't cause the powerful, mind numbing, and extremely habit forming high and still will work at killing pain. \n\nIn conclusion I believe the DEA should completely reconsider the ban and leave it free for people to use and sell. Instead of outright banning Kratom the public should be educated on what it is and how it works. I know for a fact Kratom is never mentioned in highschool health classes and that is the first problem, leaving it out of sight from the public when people need to see how positive this stuff could be, especially when 14 year olds are being administered morphine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0999","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zak Manolis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Brandon Achten and I'm 37 years old from Louisiana.

Kratom is what I use now to fight my opiate addiction. Kratom has given me the opportunity to get rid of the medications I was taking Norco, Percocet, Zaniflex, and Busiprone.

While I cannot speak to the scientific aspects of Mitragynine and related compounds, there are several obvious considerations the DEA needs to take into account.\n\n1)  Priority - if the DEA is truly interested in protecting the public and savings lives or reducing ill health effects, shouldn't we focus our limited resources elsewhere?  Of ALL the substances we could ban or regulate, certainly there are others that deserve more immediate attention.  Ban cigarettes for example, or any other number of dangerous, addictive, harmful substances.\n\n2)  Consider the unintended consequences of your actions.  Surely you must realize that such a ban would certainly drive SOME current users to more dangerous, illicit, or already illegal substances.  Just like murder isn't legal, banning it doesn't prevent all murders from happening.  Banning products containing Mitragynine will probably reduce consumption, but will also force some people to consider likely less safe alternatives.\n\n3) Take into account the will of the people, even if the science leads you elsewhere.  People clearly have a STRONG preference for keeping this substance off the DEA's scheduling.  While testing and research may show one thing, if the public is finding benefit and there are still many other areas that need our attention, please consider the public comments, those advocating NOT to take regulatory action at this time.  Maybe more research is warranted, maybe not.\n\nAt this time, an outright ban, especially an \"emergency\" ban seems extremely premature and likely to cause as many or more harmful side effects than benefits.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20392","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I first became aware of Kratom approximately a year ago, when I read an article in the NY Times about how some ex-addicts had found that it successfully had kept them away from using opioids.

Fortunately, I found that there was a distributor of Kratom at a nearby \"smoke\" shop, and I began to use it by making an herbal tea.  I am very pleased to say that, a year later, I have no desire to illegally seek out Oxy's and am quite content with semi-regular use of Kratom.  It has no side effects and I am not tempted to increase my dosage.  It is really perfect for me and my health.

I understand why limiting drug use across the board would seem like a good idea, but it is often counterproductive. It would be even more counterproductive than usual with regards to kratom. Numerous people in my life have succumbed to the horrors of opiate addiction and many of them have gotten their lives back on the right track with kratom. For whatever reason, the kratom seems to keep their opiate withdrawal symptoms away and it does so without intoxicating them. They are able to have jobs, maintain relationships with their families and generally be productive members of society. I do not think this would be possible without kratom. \n\nMaking kratom a Schedule 1 substance will make it impossible for opiate addicts to obtain it and derive benefits from it. It will make it harder for scientists to get a better understanding of why it is so helpful for opiate addicts. At a time when opiate addiction rates continue to grow, removing this essential tool from the arsenal is the exact opposite of what needs to be done. The DEA would find itself squarely on the wrong side of history and the wrong side of medicine if it were to go through with a kratom ban.

She found one herself,two counties away,and was discharged from her primary immediately. Primary doctor would not release all of her records .She was scheduled immediately for a total hip replacement,which could have been avoided had she seen a specialist sooner.A year and a half later,almost same senario,her other hip was replaced.She started taking Kratom shortley after the second surgery. After four years,and no prescribed narcotics,she is as close to a healthy woman,with autoimmune. diseases can be. Her last blood work was excellent,said the doctor,reguarding her lupus.Her orthopedic surgeon rallied behind her to use Kratom. Her USE of Kratom is not abuse!

Once I started taking Kratom i quit taking my highly addictive Xanax and Adderall for generalized anxiety disorder and ADHD. I also quit drinking alcohol which caused more problems than any other substance I have ever used. It has been 2 years and I have been anxiety free with no depression and I am physically and mentally in the best shape of my life. There are so many benefits i have seen from taking this supplement and there is so little known about it. I can say people arent overdosing or dying from this supplement so please do not make it illegal. We should research it more and uncover the benefits that people like me have experienced from Kratom. I truly believe that if more people just tried it, there would be less addiction and drug abuse in America. This supplement has saved my life so dont make it illegal. Im afraid I might end up at a doctors office and have to get back on my prescriptions. Let us as Americans do our research and learn more about Kratom. Theres no harm in letting it be, no one's life is in danger.

The leaves of the mitragyna speciosa tree can be used to suppress pain and induce a mild relaxation, both without the crippling side-effects of common FDA-approved painkillers that I have had the misfortune of experiencing personally. \n\nMany other comments have already spoken to the positive aspects of kratom as a whole, and rightfully lambasted the conduct of the DEA in its effort to ram through an emergency ban by a short notice scheduling of the tree.\n\nI wish instead to comment on the most fundamental error being made by the DEA and its agents: if the DEA were to declare a ban on kratom and begin enforcement by arresting and prosecuting Americans, such actions on the part of DEA agents would constitute criminal acts of assault with deadly weapons, kidnapping, felony violations of 18 USC 241, and false imprisonment, among many others.\n\nThe only legitimate authority the DEA has is given to it by Congress (just as with all creations derived from the US Constitution), which in turn gets its authority from the Constitution, which ultimately has authority only by delegation from individual Americans. Delegated authority does not increase in scope regardless of an increase in delegate numbers: a kidnapping gang of one, or one million, is still a gang of criminal kidnappers. (Mutual consent does not require an action to have authority, but consent can be withdrawn at any time for any reason.) Likewise, if I have no authority to conduct an armed kidnapping of my neighbor over his possession of any given foliage, neither then can I delegate authority to the DEA via Congress to do the same thing on my behalf. Any enforcement of foliage bans by DEA or other law enforcement agents would therefore be literally criminal.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7273","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Wolosin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA,\n\nI'm a 44 year old tech professional and part-time musician in Seattle. I have to say I absolutely oppose the DEA putting kratom on the schedule 1 list. To my considerable experience with kratom, a decision to ban it would be a logical fallacy and will harm and not protect.\n\nI was introduced to kratom by a friend who explained to me that it was a mild pain reliever and stimulant in small doses, and that it was related to the coffee plant. I started drinking it as tea, and lo and behold - the chronic ache in my neck and shoulders I've had since a childhood injury stopped bothering me enough to quit taking doctor-prescribed pain killers. This was a big win to me, as the narcotics even in small doses made it extremely hard for me to think straight to do my job as a programmer. The injury didn't go away, mind you, but when I drink a teaspoon of white-vein kratom tea in the morning, my neck/shoulders stop screaming at me, I wake up a bit, and my ability to focus is improved greatly. Kratom is ridiculously helpful in facilitating me to be a productive, functional human being without side-effect inducing medication. \n\nCould I get along without kratom? Yes, I could - but why should I have to? It is not a drug, and I haven't found it to be any more addictive than coffee. It has done nothing but improve my life for the last five years since I discovered it. The one time I took too much (because I had forgotten I already had some), I simply felt sick and threw up - no other side effect, and certainly nothing akin to an \"overdose\". if I had oops done the same with what the doctor prescribed me, I might have had to call an ambulance...or worse. \n\nPlease regulate kratom as any other health supplement - do not ban it. Regulating kratom will actually serve the public, and I might add - protect the public from unscrupulous vendors altering the pure, natural kratom leaf with other substances and still trying to sell it as kratom.\n\nThanks for opening up a comment period and for reading.\n\nBest,\n\nIra Merrill\nSeattle, WA\n\nPS: An article of note for you to consider:\n\"Kratom and the Impact to Florida\"\nspeciosa.org/official-statewide-intelligence-drug-report-kratom-and-the-impact-to-florida/","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13909","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ira Merrill","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If this is made Schedule 1 more people will turn to Opiates.

I did my own research before purchasing it elsewhere.\n    As I figured out dosages I realized I was more comfortable than when I took the prescription medication I had wanted to be off of for years. The withdrawal process from the antidepressants scared me. The kratom helped me finally get off the sedating antidepressant which I had been on for decades and was able to make a smooth transition. I use the kratom daily and have an amount I am comfortable with. \n    It was a great accomplishment to get off the medication and onto something I feel is safer and not a chemical necessity.

Various teas have properties that may include being a stimulant or a calming sleep aid and have been used for centuries by people all over the world.  Because of certain properties, Kratom is highly beneficial for those suffering from chronic pain and depression as I know first-hand.  I have a very difficult time functioning in daily life because of chronic pain even though I have had many treatments attempting to control it over the years.  I have been experiencing pain for nearly 20 years and have luckily found that Kratom can ease the pain and treat the depression resulting from living with chronic pain.  If you do not live with chronic pain, it is hard to understand how every waking minute is a struggle.  I small dose of Kratom once or twice a day allows me to enjoy time spent with my young and energetic son, makes household chores bearable, and improves my mood so I can lead a healthy life.  I have never had any side effects from the tea and it has also helped me experience the sleep I would otherwise lose because of the constant physical pain that would otherwise be present in my life.  I implore the DEA to reject any scheduling of Kratom or its contained compounds as a drug.  Most Americans disagree with the war on drugs and scheduling this substance would turn millions of law-abiding citizens into criminals overnight just for simple possession of this unprocessed plant leaf used to make tea.  I have also become aware of the use of this plant to help individuals suffering from opioid addictions.  It seems with such an epidemic of opioid users in trouble, allowing a simple yet effective plant-based treatment to aid them makes more sense than criminalizing kratom as a dangerous drug which it is arguably not.

I had always planned on getting better, not realizing then the permanency of my spinal damage.  I have degenerative disk disease, arthritis, bone spurs, Adhesive Arachnoiditis, Cauda Equina Syndrome, and peripheral neuropathy of my legs and feet.  I've had two spinal fusions, one in my neck and one in my low back.\n\nI recently started using kratom, just 2 weeks ago.  I decided I needed to see if it worked for me and how well.  I am one of several million Chronic Pain Patients being affected and afflicted by the skewed statistics of the so-called opioid epidemic, which completely ignores the chronic pain PANDEMIC.  Fearing that my opioid pain medication will eventually be taken from me (as the current US surgeon general is promoting eventual complete prohibition of opioid medication), I was driven to find a replacement.\n\nI was amazed at the results.  Not only did it reduce my pain, I was more alert and had more energy than I do when on oxycodone.  Kratom needs to remain an option to chronic pain patients, especially as we see our rights to proper and compassionate care stripped away from us by the DEA and CDC, even though fewer than 2% of all chronic patients become addicted to their prescribed medications.  Because of this terrible discrimination, alternatives must be available, and kratom is one of these alternatives.  Like cannabis, kratom may not work for everyone, just as opioids do not work for everyone, but both have helped so many, andthey should be available to all, WITHOUT SCHEDULING.\n\nPlease to not schedule the components of kratom AT ALL.  There is absolutely no need for that, and even less need to consider it for a schedule I status.  Please to do not schedule them AT ALL.  You might as well try to schedule coffee.  Speaking of coffee (which kratom is related to), please study the following:\n\nHere we have the calculated the data by dividing the total number of Kratom calls per year with the total number of all poison related calls in the NPDS per year.\n\nEach Year\tTotal Number of Kratom Related Poison Calls*\tTotal Number of Poison Related Calls\tPercentage of Kratom Related Poison Calls\n2010\t26\t2 384 825\t0.001%\n2011\t15\t2 334 004\t0.0006%\n2012\t98\t2 275 141\t0.004%\n2013\t108\t2 188 013\t0.005%\n2014\t155\t2 165 142\t0.007%\n*Total Number of Kratom Related Poison Calls is an approximation of the CDC graph seen above.\n\nThe percentage of calls to poison centers from 2010-2014 regarding Kratom was only 0.004% of total calls (rounded from 0.0035%). \n\nCOMPARE TO CALLS FOR COFFEE/ENERGY DRINK OVERDOSE CALLS:\n\nEnergy drinks[i]  from 2009-2011 there were 16 deaths related to energy drinks like Monster, 5-hour Energy and Rockstar alone. There have been zero reported deaths from Kratom itself.\nE-Cigarettes[ii]  In the state of Winsconsin alone, Poison Control Center reports that from 2010-2015, E-Cigarettes accounted for 98 total calls. Annual calls grew from 2 to 35. This increase is much greater than Kratom, and E-cigarettes do not even have the medicinal value that Kratom has.\nCoffee[iii]  a study spanning 13 years reported that in that period, 48,177 caffeine related calls were recorded in the National Poison Data System (NPDS), which comes to 3,706 caffeine calls annually. Given that since 2000, there have been approximately 2.5 million total poison center calls per year, that means:\nCaffeine related calls are only 0.2% of all poison center related calls.\n\n[i] Caffeine Toxicity, David Yew, MD Assistant Clinical Professor, Department of Surgery, University of Hawaii, John A Burns School of Medicine, March 31, 2015\n\n[ii] Chatham-Stephens, Kevin et al.

I have never, consciously nor unconsciously, broken a law. I was addicted to heavy duty prescribed opiate narcotics (mainly from Duke University pain management affiliated clinics) for over 10 years due to extreme pain from over 14 reconstructive orthopedic surgeries, including 2 failed joint replacements and have severe osteoarthritis. Due to the above, my life was for all intents and purposes over, and I suffered from suicidal depression in addition to the above. I started taking kratom 6 years ago --2 to 3 spoonfuls a day---at the recommendation of an osteopathic physician.I was completely freed from the prescribed opiate addiction within 5 weeks, with NO potentially lethal withdrawal syndromes, and I have not taken ANY opiate narcotics since that time.Moreover, the kratom not only is effective as non-psychoactive pain management, I also eliminated SSRI anti-depressants that ad an endless list of horrific side effects, not to mention their unknown neurologically toxic effects.My osteopathic physcian had read a German double blind study on the incredible efficacy of kratom related to it's use as an antidepressant, it's benefits and track record for opiate withdrawal/overcoming addiction, as well as non-psychoactive, non addictive chronic pain management. I am a living example to all the above, and for the past 6 years, I have a life again. It is a miracle simply put. I still take 2 spoonfuls a day ( on very rare occasions when in extreme pain, I will take a third in the afternoon) as I did when I started. There is no 'tolerance' build up as with opiates and the only psychoactive effect I could only describe as being similar to about 1 and a half cups of strong coffee. From the above--- the obvious benefits of kratom merit much further study as well as common usage to alleviate myriad horrific and tragic symptoms. I hope you will do the right thing and be prudent and judicious in your investigations. If not-- and if kratom is made illegal--- then I will be forced to either be a felon (not an option!) or again be an opiate narcotics addict, and my life will be over. Simply put, my very life is in your hands.

I'm 31 years old and I'm a yoga teacher. I'm also going to school for Ayurveda medicine. My passion is to help the world find natural solutions to their health problems. I disagree with the DEA trying to put kratom on the list of scheduled 1 controlled substance. First off it is a natural plant in it's natural form that cannot be considered a controlled substance. Secondly it has helped many find relief away from pharmaceutical pills and other harmful drugs. I injured my back when I was younger doing physical labor and I became highly addicted to a wide array of pills that I would eat everyday for almost 10 years. When I discovered kratom almost 5 years ago I was able to completely walk away from pharmaceutical pills and haven't touched them since. Kratom has allowed me to find quality of life with everyday activities like work and spending time with my family. When I was on pills I was extremely angry and rude to everyone around me. Since I've stopped pills I've been the loving natural self that I was meant to be. I'm afraid making kratom illegal will push me back to pills and a life of suffering which I have moved away from completely. I enjoy life again and don't feel that the DEA should have anything to do with that.

THis individual was highly addicted to opiates, and I dealt with this person weekly. For about a month, I did not have any contact with this person and feared the worst. I happened to bump into this individual on my beat, and they looked like a new person. Their color had returned, their hair was done, and their hygiene looked good. I asked this person how they had been, and they responded that they had been staying out of trouble and had stopped abusing prescription pills. I asked how they accomplished this and they told me they found an herb called kratom that they had began taking in the morning and at night before bed, and that they had lost the desire to abuse opiates when this herb was used in its place. I don't know much about kratom, but I can tell you I saw a person who was a non contributing member to society get his life together based on this herb. We have a huge epidemic of opiate abuse in my area, and if this herb helps people who abuse opiates get clean, I'd recommend making it legal, and figuring out a way to regulate it like tobacco or alcohol.

It has been used in traditional medicine in Southeast Asia since the 1800's.  The relatively recent introduction of this plant product to the U.S. should not lead to knee-jerk banning or overreaction.  Such actions might have long and irreversible negative consequences.  Listing Kratom as Schedule 1 would guarantee that research into its effects, side-effects, potential uses and development of pharmacological analogs and derivatives would be completely blocked.  Once listed as Schedule 1, it will remain with that designation for decades if not longer.  For example, marijuana which has never caused an overdose death is STILL listed as Schedule 1 even though many states have legalized it.\n   Further, the damage of scheduling a novel plant product goes far beyond blocking any further research.  It automatically criminalizes large numbers of casual users including those dealing with opioid addiction.  These people are subject to court and long term incarceration.

My friend recommended it to me and it quickly became my saving grace for a few other reasons. \n\nDuring this time I was a stay-at- home mom with my low-functioning autistic two year old daughter. Everyday when my husband left for work I would often feel stress and anxiety because of all the daunting work that desperately needed to be done with my daughter. The Kratom I noticed was providing me with a very natural and clean feeling, positive energy to move forward and work with my daughter on all the numerous therapies and skills that she was behind on. At the time she was completely non-verbal and did not acknowledge toys or dolls; literally all she wanted to do was scoop and pour dry beans. \n\nThe Kratom gave me the strength, energy and creativity to come up with different games, ideas, tasks, etc to work with her. It was a very lonely and difficult time but I truly feel like it was the Kratom that helped turn me into super mom. I could maintain a level of patience that is almost physically impossible. I could smile when I wanted to cry. I could pick her up when my wrist told me not to which I simply had to do sometimes. I could chase her when she would randomly run towards the street. I could go on but it seemed like every step of every day, it was helping me to keep it all together. \n\nNow I can proudly report that my daughter is communicating on a much higher level of functionality and enjoying school with the possibility of being in a mainstream classroom next year; a dream that almost felt impossible a few years ago. Though my daughter and I worked extremely hard, I truly believe it was that simple Asian plant, Kratom, that made all the difference because without it I would not have been able to work and push as hard as I did. Thank you for reading my humble story.

Coming from KY,  an especially useful case for Kratom can be made as a substitute for addicts trying to get off of heroin as many are dying because of tainted drugs or fentanyl and it's horrifying to see the effects of heroin around this state. Kratom has been growing as a coping method for users who then are able to successfully quit along  with support without getting a secondary addiction to the drug suboxone.

The pain started to decrease in week two and i was really starting to get confidence back... Its been two months now and i still continue to take Kratom... I dont have any side effects..

Small tasks are big challenges and big challenges are nearly impossible.  If you met me, you wouldn't know I was hiding a daily level 7 pain.  You wouldn't know I own an assortment of knee/back/wrist/hand/etc. braces and compressions.  You wouldn't know my husband has to help me in and out of bed every morning/evening.  You wouldn't know I put on extra concealer and makeup so you don't see the dark circles under my eyes or how botchy my skin is from crying because my body hurts.  \n\nIt might surprise you to hear every time I move, my joints pop and crack.  You might not think getting up and getting to work on time was a major accomplishment for me.  You might be surprised to know it takes me a long time to get ready for the day because taking a shower wears me out and I can barely hold the makeup brushes or that I drop everything I touch.  I would never let you see the panic attacks I have before work.  Or how afraid I am that I'm going to black out because my pain is so bad it makes me dizzy. You wouldn't know because I put all the energy and effort I have into trying to convince you I don't have endometriosis, Elhers Danlos, and Chiari Malformation.  \n\nMany Americans who are in chronic pain choose Kratom to avoid other medications with far more severe side effects and ar Kratom does something for me that no medication can, manage my pain.  Kratom is important to me and I wholeheartedly believe it should remain accessible and LEGAL.  I prayed for an answer and God gave me Kratom.  With Kratom, I am able to truly live the life I love.  With Kratom, my pain and the symptoms of my conditions are managed in a way that is healthy and safe.  With Kratom, my pain is treated without the \"foggy\" effects of pain medication.  Kratom is not something I'm afraid to become addicted to nor does it alter my personality to make me unkind or irresponsible.  e far more addictive than Kratom.  Prescription pain medications are super addictive and cause a change in personality. \n\nIf 18 years old, I can choose to smoke cigarettes that has been proven to cause cancer, lung disease, COPD, and ultimately death, I should be able to choose Kratom.  If at 21 years old, I can choose to drink alcohol that has been proven to cause health problems, poisoning, addiction, violence, car accidents, and additional deaths (not only the person drinking but others involved in collateral damage), I should be able to choose Kratom.  If substances such as alcohol and cigarettes, which have been proven over and over again to be detrimental to our health (and quite honestly the health of others), how can the DEA ban Kratom, which has proven to be more helpful than hurtful? I believe being pain free is a right just as much (or even more so) than someone's right to enjoy a beer and a cigarette after a long work shift.  Kratom gave me back what my illnesses took away.  \n\nKratom has many benefits and I'm respectfully requesting Kratom to continue to be legal and accessible to continue to help people.  I understand guidelines, such as age, might be considered.  Kratom should also have the opportunity to be properly researched.  I greatly appreciate you talking the time to read my comments.  \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19923","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amanda Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Without writing a dissertation regarding all of my physical ailments, I'll simply say I am a 57 year old college educated and career oriented female, who has been suffering from severe chronic pain in my lumbar region, as well as severe nerve damage that effects my entire lower left body, for over fifteen years. The pain has had me on the verge of starting the process to acquire disability payments, with encouragement from all of my specialists and primary care doctor to do so. \n\nPrior to using Kratom tea, I had been prescribed opiates to help control the pain. Over many years, the dosage had to be constantly increased, due to my body building up a dependency to it.

This case had went undiagnosed for several years, and because it was all contained within my left tibia bone, became extremely painful. I had been taking, up to 1000mg of Ibuprofen, per day to ward off the pain. When the cancer was first diagnosed (using MRI) I was immediately given a prescription for Oxycodone, for \"breakthrough pain\", and Morphine, for \"long-term pain\". These opiates worked, and I continued to take them, in several forms (including; Fentinal patches, Oxycontin, morphine sulfate.\nThe use of opiates for pain lasted for over two years. I received chemotherapy and radiation treatments, that proved successful, after a few months of treatments. Following the treatments, I was still experiencing some pain, but now it was due to nerve damage.\nI was encouraged to remain on these drugs for over a year, to combat this pain.\nWhen I asked if there were any drugs, that could help me with the pain, besides opiates, I was told, flat out, No. And so, I found myself at a big decision - to stop taking opiates.\nIt just happened that I heard about kratom, and I immediately purchased some at a local \"head shop\" type store. Upon taking the plant for the first time, my pain was gone.\nI quickly decided to go \"cold turkey\" from the opiates, and so I began taking kratom as a regular supplement, in order to help myself with this.\nI went \"cold-turkey\", off of 90 mg Morphine, adn 120mg of oxycodone, per day. It worked, very well. I had little problem kicking the addiction (very few, if any, side effects).

I believe that putting Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances would be a mistake and be harmful to many citizens that the DEA is in charge of protecting. \n\nI first tried Kratom as novelty when I first was starting school at the University of Michigan. I remember it made me very motivated to do work for a while but I really didn't like the taste so I stopped using it.  Earlier this year, after finishing school I was reminded of Kratom by a friend and I decided to give it another chance.  My current responsibilities give me a stressful lifestyle that requires me to deal with irregular sleep schedules and long hours.  I work as an engineer during the week and play at/host concerts and DIY events to support the Midwest music scene on my weekends.  Kratom has allowed me to stay motivated and productive at work as well as helped keep me awake and motivated for late night drives to out of town shows.  Coffee makes me jittery and anxious so I prefer to avoid it at work during meetings when anxious body language can be a detriment to the way my coworkers view my presentation or discussion points.  Without Kratom I would not be able to be a participant at my job on the nights where I was only able to get a few hours of sleep and I would not be able to go home and continue to contribute the music and arts community in my area.  I also used it for pain management when I had my wisdom teeth pulled earlier this year to great effect.\n\nThere is a lot of potential for this substance to be beneficial. If there are negatives, we should do the research so that we can inform people about what they are choosing to do and be able to help those that have already been taking the substance. I believe that Kratom has a huge potential as a painkiller for those looking to avoid the dangers of synthetic opiates and I know from personal experience that it can be a huge boost to those that are caffeine sensitive but can't always get as much sleep as they'd like.  At the very least, this substance should be heavily researched before being placed on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11451","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nate Erickson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi,\n\n My name is Frank McElduff.

I have been to many Doctors over the years and had been put on several pain killers and other items.

I hated myself for letting this happen which caused other issues. I went looking for something that would help me get off of the opiates. I found kratom online. It saved me from being an addict and has improved my life in so many other ways. I have been using kratom for about 18 months. \n  I also drank pretty heavy.

I am a 43-year-old disabled armed forces veteran (ARMY) who is dealing with chronic anxiety, insomnia, depression, anger issues, as well as severe back pain due to multiple injuries, most of which is rated and service connected.\n\nI would like to voice my concern and displeasure in regards to the pending \"emergency\" Scheduled ban the DEA has intense for two alkaloids (Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine) contained in Mitragyna speciosa otherwise known as kratom. This ban would, by default, make this plant illegal.\n\nThe claim of no possible medical benefits is directly contradictory of studies being conducted by the USDA and NIH as well as anecdotal evidence of myself and thousands of testimonials from other current kratom users. Also why would these same, banned alkaloids currently have several patent filings with the FDA for treatment? Maybe because they work.\n\nAs far as the potential for abuse, kratom is not a recreational herb. One cannot get \"high\" from kratom, nor can one overdose and die from kratom. It does NOT cause hallucinations or many other symptoms the media seems to be spinning. If an excessive dose is ingested, the user reflexively vomits the substance from their body. That is a fact.\n\nThere have been statements made that this simple tea is also addictive. True, while some users may claim physical dependency upon kratom, the effects of withdrawal are on par with coffee/caffeine withdrawal (coincidentally both members of the same botanical family).\n\nThe DEA has also claimed that there have been 15 deaths related to kratom use. Further research would show that those deaths were attributed to other legal pharmaceutical substances and that kratom just happened to be in their system. That claim is as logical as saying someone drinks a Sprite then gets into a fatal car accident, would that be a soda related death? Kratom has been used in its indigenous region of Southeast Asia for hundreds and thousands a year with no reported kratom induced deaths. Thailand did have a ban on kratom, for the sole reason that it hurt the opium trade costing the government a lot of money. I fear we are seeing this happen in our country for the same reason.\n\nThe resistance to the ban is not being led by a bunch of junkies who will go through agonizing withdrawal without this tea leaf. The majority of kratom users are responsible, registered, adult voters who have been abused and neglected by our flawed pharmaceutical industry. Most will be forced to return to ineffective medicines with a list of side effects greater than their potential for relief. Others will return to illegal drugs which will result in a massive spike of opiate and other drug related overdose deaths.\n\nAfter transitioning off of active duty I was employed as a correctional officer for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I have witnessed the effects of commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals on the lives and families of those that have to take them to function as part of society.\n\nSince discovering Kratom I have been supplementing my currently prescribed medications (with my doctor's blessing) and have actually been able to stop taking multiple while reducing dosages of all remaining. He is great and has been extremely supportive with my supplementation and is all for reducing his patient's dependence on prescription medications. As I have previously stated, we all know these can have a multitude of side effects that impact the quality of life, some causing more damage than possible benefits.\n\nMy mother experiences chronic hip and knee pain due to debilitating arthritis, I have her on a low daily dose for pain relief. Until taking kratom, no medications or surgeries prescribed by her doctors and specialists have been effective. This is the first time she has experienced any relief from her symptoms.\n\nNeither she nor I are experiencing any signs of dependence or addiction that many fear or allude to.\n\nI realize that this herb cannot and should not be considered medicine by legal definition at this point. With its potential for good and lack of real evidence of harm, it is a safe alternative treatment that demands further study. If scheduled, there is no hope of that research continuing. \n\nThank you for your time,\nCharles N Fink","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17140","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Charles Fink","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've been a heroin addict for about 6 years now.

Nearly two years ago i decided to research botanical alternatives for anxiety relief. Upon tedious amounts of research i discovered Kratom.  After about a month or so i decided to order. To my suprise, kratom really didn't help me with anxiety relief, it did however ease my pain from degenerative disc disease and herniated disc. At a previous time i was prescribed multiple medications to treat my ailments, all of which left me with a low quality of life. Between the pain medications and anxiety medications, i could not function normally. I made the decision to suffer through my days unmedicated because though i was in pain and dealing with an extreme amount of anxiety, unmedicated was some what better.  While i still choose to suffer through my anxiety, kratom has provided me with a better quality of life. I wake up in pain everyday, after a cup of Kratom tea and i feel better and can go about my daily activities with little to no discomfort. If this botanical were to become illegal, i would no doubt begin to struggle to get through my work day, normal activity would become much harder to deal with. I beg you to reconsider this legal action, as the results would be detrimental to so many lives. Kratom can provide a better quality of life to so many suffering from chronic pain and opiod addiction. Please do not prohibit something so very helpful to so very many people.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and to hear others perspective on Kratom. I hope you acknowledge the many voices that are coming forward about this plant and it's many benefits. My story is that I was addicted to alcohol. I didn't know it, I was a social drinker but over the span of 4 years it became a mental and physical crutch. I wasn't drinking handles of vodka a night like some serious addicts but a beer a night was standard, and sometimes it would multiply into a couple more before the night was through. A very legal substance, pardon me for stating the obvious. It wasn't until it eventually gave me crippling depression that I knew I had to stop. I began meditation and yoga and with that found the strength to go through a detox. I did not know how bad I was addicted to alcohol until I went through this detox. I had all the full blown symptoms, if I had been a heavier drinker I'm sure I would have needed to be hospitalized. It was during this detox that I relied on Kratom. It helped immensely with the incredibly overwhelming body aches, delirium and paranoia. I was in bed, nauseous for 7 days and didn't think taking advil or any of the other pain relievers would be a wise choice. It would only upset my stomach further and get in the way of a full detox. Honestly, I don't think I could have gotten through those 7 days without it. After I started feeling better and could get out of bed and slowing return to my life, I would use Kratom occasionally for some of the emotional mood swings that accompanied the next few weeks of quitting drinking. It's truly changed my life. I pray and beg that you re-consider making this illegal. I've known so many friends and young kids to have died of opiate addiction or even methodone! Others that are addicted to drinking and see no way out. Substances that were legally available or prescribed by their doctors or just found in their homes. Please please PLEASE have a heart. Do not make this plant illegal. Do not do this. Listen and respect the people, myself included that it has helped. That do not abuse it's use and have used it to get through very hard, if not impossible addictions.\nI hope you will do what is right for the American people.\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17531","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chelsey Curtin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban Kratom.

I am 34 and work as a handyman, mechanic, and farm hand. I oppose the DEA putting kratom on the list of Schedule I controlled substances.  I feel the ban is unwarranted because Schedule I drugs like heroin, and cocaine are narcotics with serious side effects while kratom has a very mild effect and no negative effects that I have found in three years of taking it.\n\nMy experience pre-kratom: \n\nI suffered severe chronic pain due to muscle injuries that wouldn't heal, as well as back and head injuries due to a couple of serious vehicle accidents.  My doctor said I also had advanced arthritis and that my joints looked like those of a 70-year-old man.  I had been dealing with these problems since I was 18.  I went to many doctors and spent tens of thousands of dollars but they could not figure out what was wrong.  I was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's, an autoimmune disorder, as the cause of the healing problems.  But now these problems are so bad they cannot be fixed.\n\nOver this thirteen year period, doctors prescribed these drugs for me:\n\nFor pain: Opiates (Oxycodone, Methadone, Morphine).  These drugs took away my energy and made me sleepy, worthless, and lethargic.  I was too impaired to drive or work. I had to keep increasing the dose to get relief from the pain.  They were extremely addictive.  Detoxing off them was horrible.\n\nFor depression: I tried three or four common anti-depressants.  I felt like I had no emotions.  I was numb, had no energy, and felt dead inside.\n\nFor anxiety: (Diazepam and others).  They worked, but I always had an impaired feeling.  I couldn't function.\n\nFor insomnia: (Trazedone, Seraquil, Ambien). I woke up feeling horrible, angry, tense, worked up.\n\nFor side effects: I took a variety of medications to combat the side effects of the other drugs I was taking.\n\nTransitioning from medications to kratom: \n\nThree years ago I detoxed off oxycodone. It took two weeks of heavy-duty detoxing.  I had to get off all pain meds to decrease my tolerance for opiates so that kratom would work.  Please note that kratom is not an opiate but it affects the same opiod receptors in the brain that they do.  Coffee and chocolate also affect these receptors and obviously are not opiates.\n\nThe kratom I take: \n\nI take straight kratom - the pure, dried, powdered leaf of the kratom tree, not mixed with any other substance, always the same type of leaf and always from a reputable supplier.  I take the minimum I need to based on the amount of pain I have that day. \n\nMy experience with kratom and that of relatives and friends:\n\nI do not experience euphoria or any negative side effects.  Kratom does not take away the pain completely, but enough that I can function.  It also provides relief from anxiety, depression, low energy, and insomnia.  Mentally it changes me back to a pre-illness state.  I no longer need to take any prescription medications.\n\nEach individual may have a different experience - especially depending on what type of leaf they consume.  Some people say it doesn't do anything.\n\nThe following list of kratom's effects is from DEA's \"Drugs of Abuse\" (page 84).\n\nI have not experienced these symptoms:\nItching, constipation, increased urination, anorexia.\n\nI have not experienced these symptoms or heard of anyone else experiencing them:\nPsychotic symptoms, including hallucinations, delusion, and confusion.\n\nI have not experienced these symptoms, but I might if the kratom was too potent or I took too much:\nNausea and sweating.\n\nI have experienced the opposite of these symptoms:\nLoss of appetite.  Weight loss.  Insomnia. \n\nI have experienced these symptoms or a variation of them:\nDry mouth - Yes.\nImproved physical energy - Yes, definitely.\nStimulant effects and increased alertness - Improves my mood rather than being a stimulant.\nIncreased talkativeness - Maybe a little, due to better mood.\nSedative effects - It is calming and reduces anxiety.\nPsychological addiction - No worse than coffee.\n\nIn conclusion, kratom gave me my life back after eight years of taking prescription pain killers.  I had lost everything - my family, my house, and all my possessions.  My cousin suggested getting off prescription medications and trying kratom.  Three years later I am a new father who is able to help support his family.  I am in the process of rebuilding my life.  I do not want to go back to my old life.  That is what will happen if this ban goes into effect.\n\nFor more information please refer to the American Kratom Association website which contains links to the latest scientific studies on kratom - www.AmericanKratom.org/science.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16258","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If it works and no one is hurt don't ban it, regulate its quality and dosage accuracy.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21978","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tom Walsh","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I really think that this substance as well as marijuana and other similar substances that are not opiates should not be schedule 1.

Many of my high school friends and people around me are battling and dying from opiates, they deserve to have the option to use a natural supplement to change their lives and keep them alive. I have not seen any substantial evidence to prove that Kratom alone has caused a death, only when mixed when other dangerous substances such as Fentanyl or Tramadol which alone can easily cause an overdose. The claims and propaganda from certain organizations that state that this herb is deadly is ridiculous and non factual. I am not exactly certain why there is such a fuss and war against this plant but I'm sure there are many other more worrisome things that the DEA should focus on instead, for the \"good of the people.\" Enough is enough and the American people are starting to realize that they have had enough with these bullying organizations that truly have only their own interests or another friendly big organization's interest at heart. Keep Kratom legal for the good of the American people whom you are supposed to be protecting. There will be many deaths on your hands should this ban go through.

In 2005 i herniated a disk in my lower back. At first it didnt bother me much but then a few years later it was like i just did it all over again i felt this every day and worse at night it seemed. I went to my first doctor had xrays mri's injections exc exc.  approx a year later i was taking 4 norco 10mg a day to start then 4 at a time. Long story short i soon moved up the narcotic pain med list very fast. When i took myself off i was taking 80mg of oxycontin six times a day on top of anything else in between. I was an addict bad abusing my meds like crazy and buying up all the pain meds i could find on the street. Then i heard about kratom did all the research i could find and finally tried it. I was so amazed of the relief it gave me pain wise and just being normal headed for the first time in years. Kratom not only got me off all the narcotics but it kept me off unlike the three rehabs before. I myself and thousands of other people like me have a great respect for this all natural leaf. It is by far a way better treatment than any pain management center can provide. Kratom is not dangerous on its own. I have been taking it now for 2+ years and have yet to depend on it like pills. Myself and many others will probablly go back to chasing the streets for actual dangerous drugs that will kill us and we will relie on and turn right back into addicts. I guess im just saying please hear our side and how this miracle leaf has helped not only save our lives but also saved us from overdosing and dieing from real actual dangerous drugs.

Background in sales. Responsible adult. \n\n\nThank you for giving the U.S. Kratom Community as a whole, an outlet to voice their thoughts and experiences related to the matter at hand. In a combined, collective attempt to bring a beautiful and overdue end to kratom being considered anything other than what it truly is; a natural herb that citizens should have the free will to use to their advantage or not use at all.\n\nTo put things as bluntly and respectfully as possible, given my experience and knowledge concerning kratom; I completely oppose the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. \n\nI started using kratom roughly two years ago. \nEach time I have decided to stop taking kratom, I have done so without issue. I normally take a break from it from time to time, to ensure tolerance does not stray too out of bounds. Withdrawal effects have been minimal; consisting of a runny nose and faint fog in the mind.\n\nI personally use kratom for anti-anxiety, pro-social behavior. I can function effectively in life without kratom, it is a choice for me to use it as a small boost in life; much like one would use coffee.  I additionally introduced kratom to friends of mine, roughly ~20 individuals, over the past couple of years. (No, I was not selling anyone kratom) I have yet to see kratom have anything but a positive effect on others, essentially immediately upon use. Only one of my friends have used kratom to taper off of strong drugs; the rest of my friends used kratom to temporarily have measurably reduced anxiety in their lives and also some had chronic pain that needed relief due to weight lifting stresses and other injuries.  Throughout time I witnessed my friends enjoy themselves more in social situations whether it was a recreational situation; or situations in which they performed better within their career or when doing something creative in their own right such as drawing, dancing, etc.  \n\nKratom has done nothing except improve my life, and also the lives of others that I have introduced kratom to. This hits on all levels. Mentally, physically, and spiritually. \n\nI believe kratom should not be prohibited in any manner.\n\nThank you for your time and the value you have placed upon hearing out everyone's voice on this very important nationwide concern.\nRegards,\n\nChris \"KK\" L.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22368","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris L","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban Kratom.

I have seen the lengths that they go to to acquire their substance of choice. My half brother stole my grandmother's wedding ring to sell for drugs. He became his addiction, and never wanted to be around him. He has been in and out of rehabs and jail for as long as I can remember and is now serving a long prison sentence because of his addiction. He caused a car accident that destroyed one family's lives. A woman was killed and her young daughter was permanently injured. This was as a result of an addiction to a legal substance--pain pills. It began as a result of an injury, and spiraled out of control.\n\nAt present, I know someone close to me who has struggled with chronic pain, depression, and anxiety. It has affected every aspect of his life. He was unhappy all the time, and he did not like the side effects of the medication that was prescribed by his physician (including hydrocodone). When he found kratom, it was like someone flipped a switch in his brain. He became motivated because he wasn't in constant pain. Functionally, he could do everything he wanted to. He never appeared high, giddy, or otherwise altered. He simply was relaxed, present, and happy. \n\nBanning this substance will only cause people to become more reliant on opioids, which are tremendously addictive and dangerous.

I have a severe case of PTSD, with one of my symptoms being occasional suicidality. \n\nSuicidality is a difficult condition to treat, especially when it is prompted by extreme circumstances. Anti-depressants can be used to lessen depression, but they aren't great at dealing with extreme, occasional emotions.  And when a person is raped, not for the first time, emotions are quite extreme. Like 65% of transgender rape survivors, I have attempted suicide after being sexually assaulted. An additional problem is, because many of them have sedating effects anti-depressants can be used themselves to attempt suicide.\n\nMy solution to suicidality in extreme moments was opiates, including heroin. These of course, came with their own downsides. Heroin like anti-depressants can be used to attempt suicide. And as you are no doubt aware, opiates are extremely habit forming. But in the face of the extreme trauma I was dealing with, I needed something.\n\nWhen I found Kratom, it was the perfect solution. Kratom cannot easily be used to attempt suicide, high doses trigger nausea. Kratom is significantly less habit forming than opiates, I have never once suffered withdrawal symptoms. And unlike anti-depressants, the effects are quick. On days where I face severe violence and discrimination I can take a few to tide me over until I can make sense of things again. As an added bonus, it is effective at treating withdrawal symptoms of opiate addiction. I was able to quit heroin thanks to Kratom.\n\nAnd, additionally, because Kratom was legal, I was able to access it without using illegal channels, meaning I could acquire it safely without the temptation to relapse onto drugs I had used in the past.\n\nWhen I was addicted to opiates, I was sure I was going to die by the end of the year. Kratom, quite simply, saved my life.\n\nIt is by no means a complete solution. I have been in therapy with a trauma specialist for four years, and naturally that has been helpful as well. But at bottom, talking simply can't remove the pain of being raped. Nothing can, especially when for me, as a trans-woman, I know I am at a high risk of it happening again. In that moment, in the past when it has happened, the only thing that has prevented me from killing myself to make sure I would never be raped again has been Kratom.\n\nIt's not something I use every day by any means. Most days I don't touch it. But it is something to be there for extreme circumstances. And unfortunately, as a transgender woman, I have no way to ensure that I will not land in extreme circumstances again.\n\nI fear this hasty action will kill more people than it will save, because if the DEA had done this years ago, I likely would not have survived myself. As is, it may set my recovery back significantly, since I have found no other medication as effective for treating my PTSD, and I have tried everything I could think of, including anti-depressants, anxiolytics, and anti-psychotics. Only Kratom worked the way I needed it to, enabling me not just able to survive, but able to volunteer and help other members of my community survive as well. \n\nAt the least, Kratom should not be schedule I. It has documented medical uses. It can treat depression, suicidality, anxiety, and opiate addiction. If there is concern about recreational use and abuse, make it only available via prescription. There are people, like me, who truly need it.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0592","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I will keep this short and to the point.

I do not say drug here because in my opinion it is not a drug but a healthy supplement and an alternative to addictive medication or street drugs for many people. I take kratom to aid in fighting chronic migraine, generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder. I found out about kratom in April of 2016 after yet another hospitalization for migraine. I had a 3 day migraine and was forced to the hospital by my family. I was given a prescription again for fioricet, a common but heavy duty migraine medicine. It did the job but unfortunately made me useless. I am a mom of two young children with a full time job. I can't be bedridden because of pain or strong medicine. So I researched natural remedies and found kratom. I bought some and am happy to report that I have gotten the migraines under control and my anxiety and depression are much more manageable. My psychiatrist even remarked on the change in my demeanor. This supplement is helping me function as a mom, employee and wife. At 41, I  am finally able to manage these debilitating headaches that have been a constant in my life since age 15. I am not a drug user or drinker and do not like anything that makes me feel \"off\". Kratom does not do that, so I do not understand or accept why you would want to classify it as such. I am.asking you toPLEASE not take away this wonderful herb. At my age health can only get worse. I am fortunate that I came across this and am able to do more things instead of lying in bed begging everyone to be quiet because the slightest sound is like a knife through my head. I do not want the pain back. I do not want to be forced to take medication that makes me unable to drive, makes me have to call in sick constantly, makes my family have to have takeout instead of a home cooked meal because Mommy's medicine has put her to sleep.

This will lead to increased criminal justice and incarceration costs that are more harmful to individuals and communities than kratom use in and of itself.   \n-Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n-Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but banning kratom will mean that all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n-Side effects of kratom are minimal and its withdrawal symptoms tend to be mild and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n-Prohibiting kratom may worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose by arbitrarily banning a viable, safer alternative for pain management and other clinical applications. \nThank you for your consideration.\n-Amanda Bent, MSW, LSW\nDenver, CO","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13861","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amanda Bent","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nPlease don't make the same mistake that was made with marijuana.

I have been drinking Kratom Tea for just under two years now and it has immensely helped me in many areas of my life since then. For me, it is similar to coffee but without the negative side effects of caffeine and I have been learning of countless stories from people from all walks of life in our community in which it has even saved the lives of many. Yes, it is true that there are people who have had negative effects from it just like anything else but it seems few and far between. This is not a drug for us. Respectable vendors take great pride in making only the best and safest Kratom available to their many loyal customers and we do not condone in any way, people misrepresenting their products and distributing dangerous substances that are something else entirely and labeling it as Kratom. There is so much passion in our community because of what Kratom has done for these wonderful people who now live a better life. All I ask is that you take into consideration what I have told you here and the many other comments people like myself are sending to you.

I have had lesions in my mouth continuously for nearly six years. Kratom seems to ease that pain though it does not eliminate it but makes possible for me to eat foods I would not be able to eat otherwise. As for my fibromyalgia pain, drinking kratom tea has reduced the amount of pain. Even though it may not eliminate the pain, the pain is lessened which allows me to participate in family and social activities, to exercise regularly and to perform my own household chores. My spirits are so much better since I am in less pain and that would elevate anyone's mood, believe me. I do not become high, euphoric or disoriented or even silly. Kratom is an herbal supplement, not a drug to get high on. If it was, there would be hundreds of people using it . I have no side effects to this leaf. It is not addictive nor is it fatal when people don't combine it with respiratory depressants, the majority of which are synthetic pharmaceuticals, narcotics which have very unpleasant side effects, high risk for overdose and death if used improperly. That is not the case with kratom. Let's face it. We all know that the war on drugs is an abysmal failure. Prison population numbers have skyrocketed and banning kratom would force those numbers even higher. A ban on kratom would also increase the number of people turning to illegal or black markets substances for pain relief, suicide rates would increase as people see no way to ease their suffering. Kratom can ease some of the issues with withdrawal which can be fatal. As a Critical Care RN I took care of many patients in severe withdrawal to put them on life support and keep them sedated with ? more narcotics or benzodiazepines because otherwise they would die. I never once took care of a kratom overdose or withdrawals from kratom. I loved being an ICU RN but was unable to continue. Chronic pain caused many limitations in my life; since drinking kratom tea many of those limitations have reduced and I have a better quality of life. If kratom is the danger that DEA purports it to be why is there a patent that was filed in 2009?  That doesn't make any sense to me that there is a patent on an herbal supplement that is supposed to be an imminent danger to society. Would this be so pharmaceutical companies can take a natural leaf and make a synthetic drug with potential side effects like so many other drugs and charge a high price to \" cover the cost of 'discovering' a new drug\" when there is already a natural leaf in existence that has no side effects?  Kratom does not cause respiratory depression and an \"overdose\" would cause nausea, drowsiness and at the very worst, vomiting. As for 660 calls to Poison Control, I made more calls than that re: Tylenol overdoses by myself!  Not all calls to Poison Control are about overdoses. Some people have called for things as simple as having taken/given a second dose in error and what should they do. So not every call made is regarding an overdose; some calls are made for information only.  I feel that a lot of misinformation/misrepresentation regarding kratom has been been put out there in the public eye. That is sad for this is a natural leaf related to the coffee bean that can help so many people with chronic pain, PTSD (20 vets with PTSD and chronic pain are committing suicide every day on average), drug and alcohol withdrawal and so many other things. Alcohol, coffee and cigarettes are known health hazards and potential for addiction yet how many of us had a drink last evening maybe with a cigarette and got going in the morning with a jolt of coffee?  These do not have a ban on them. As a matter of fact, I can walk into my grocery store and buy all three! Yet a ban is proposed for kratom. Does that not seem ludicrous?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3322","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joyce Shannon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I am a 34 year old man from Littleton Colorado.

I was only getting a couple of hours of sleep every night because of the extreme discomfort in my lower back. After many many visits to the Dr and trying all kinds of prescription drugs I finally got a CAT scan and discovered I had lower multilevel degenerative disk disease. This was a big suprise, i was only 30 years old and never had any health problems! The only choices I had was controversial back surgery or prescription pain killers. The surgery that might or might not work was out of the question for me so they gave me pain pills. They worked and I got some sleep but not without the side effects! I had most of the common side effects associated with hydrocodone and I knew the addiction was growing fast. As I struggled with the thought of having this drug ruining my life I turned to the internet for help and I learned about KRATOM. I struggled to find a company to ship to me but finally I found one and my life has been forever changed! No more pain, plenty of sleep, extra energy, and absolutely no side affects! This is a miracle herb that could without a doubt save lives! Why, with TN being the 2nd highest opioid abuser in the nation, is this herb banned? Is prescribing and making money off of prescription drugs more important than saving lives? This herb could single handedly lower drug abuse significantly.

I guess I am just going to tell you my story. I am a 36 year old mother of four and a wife. I was born with a disease that causes my knee caps to  dislocate on a daily basis. I have had 7 knee surgeries starting in 2004. With every surgery the problem got worse and I was told there was nothing else they could do, I would have to live with the pain for the rest of my life. I was in pain medication for years but I just couldn't take it anymore and against my Drs advice I stopped taking all the medication. The side affects of the medication  were to much to bare. I was so tired and depressed so Drs prescribed me antidepressants to help with that issue. The antidepressants caused me to develops serotonin syndrome and now I cannot take any medications that could possibly trigger seizures. I just wanted to find a safe natural way to treat my daily pain that wouldn't cause all the horrible side affects of prescription medication. Then came Kratom, I found this wonderful plant through extensive research. I was hesitant at first but I just  wanted my life back. I wanted to be able to play with my children again and be able to do normal activities that I use to love like hiking, going to the gym and play with my children. Painkillers took all of that away from me. When I took my first small dose of kratom I noticed a difference in my energy levels as well as some moderate pain relief. But most of all I noticed that I was starting to enjoy my life again. I couldn't imagine going back to the way my life was before, I never want to suffer like that again. I have been taking kratom for a year and a half now and I have never suffered any side affects from this amazing plant. If I run out the only noticeable change is my energy levels are a little lower and I feel my pain more. Please keep kratom legal for adults. Please allow myself and other kratom supporters/users continue to thrive and be healthy, allow us to keep LIVING. Because kratom has saved lives and it has helped so many people to become happy, healthy, productive members of society. \n\nSincerely, \n\nChauni Culver","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4919","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chauni Culver","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, my name is Lucinda Dukate.

I feel very little symptoms of withdrawal and the pain noticeably comes back. It works. Plain and simple.

This is America, we should be free to make our own decisions and live with the consequences of those decisions. By making kratom (or any drug) illegal you will not do anything to deter Americans from using the substance, take prohibition for example. I think an argument could be made that people may be more driven to try a substance that  has been deemed \"taboo\" or \"restricted.\" Don't we have enough non-violent drug offenders filling our prisons as it is? \n\n By making kratom illegal, people who use the substance will have to buy it illegally, and have no idea what is actually in the powder they are ingesting. Keep it legal, research it, educate our citizens about the products pros and cons, regulate it, and tax it- I thought this was a free market economy, let the consumers decide what they want and what they do not with their purchasing power.  I don't think this is a moral issue, I think it is an issue of individual sovereignty, and I don't want or need the government \"protecting me from myself.\" \n\nIt seems completely arbitrary to this average citizen how the DEA goes about making its decisions as to what drugs are legal and what drugs are deemed illegal.  Prescription drugs that have been proven to make addicts out injured folks are legal, but plants that grow out of the ground are illegal, despite the mounting evidence that synthetic prescriptions drugs are far more dangerous for our health than plant based treatments like kratom. \n\nI understand that after the Citizens United supreme court decision that corporations are people and they have a voice and rights, but their voices and rights should not drown out the voices and rights of people who are flesh and blood, that get sick, and need medications that work. Let's not take options off the table for people who are ill in order to protect the financial interests of the big pharma \"people.\" \n\nThank you taking the time to read this. For the record, I have never used kratom, but my father has been addicted to prescription pain killers (due to a back injury) for many, many years. If kratom (or any natural substance) has the potential to help other American's like my father break the chains of addiction it must remain legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16613","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paulo Fonseca","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not schedule kratom.

I found out about kratom after becoming unable to get medical treatment for my dental abscess after loosing my insurance after being discharged from work due to my illnesses.

I had begun researching natural pain relief for my mouth issues and among the other natural antibiotics to clear the infection, kratom was mentioned as a strong pain herbal reliever. Something I desperately needed to help me just not run screaming from the extreme pain from the abscess. \n\nIt helped me off and on through the 3 years of virtually being homeless sleeping on a friends sofa trying to function awaiting a decision towards disability. During this time kratom helped me be able to gain some mobility back in my severely damaged joints from RA. It eased my insomnia and most of all just helped me have hope that my life wouldn't be a living hell of pain inside my own body. The thought that this miracle could be taken away put out of reach like all the other \"prescription\" medicines scare me. I don't know what would have happened to me had kratom not been available to me before when I had no other options.\n\nA natural affordable way to be able to function when the pain was so overwhelming was what kratom has given me.

I have worked since I was 17 in high school, through 5 years of college to get my bachelors degree in business from Stephen F. Austin State university and up until now mainly in manual labor. I currently work as a solar module system installer on residential homes where I am on the roof the majority of my day which takes its toll on my ankle pain.\n\nMy Problem:\n\nFor the past 4 years I have been on narcotic pain medication to be able to 1. not be in pain and 2. be able to go to work so I can survive and not be on disability.\n\nDuring this process I have had good days and bad days of pain. I can only manage pain as well as a doctor prescribes pain medication. I imagine a scenerio where I have to buy pain pills on the street in order to manage my pain because a doctor doesn't prescribe enough medicine for me. Ive heard of Mexican cartels making fake pain pills laced with Fentanyl to make them stronger causing overdose deaths when people take an amount they are used to taking of the real medicine.  If I need to take more than is prescribed I will run out of meds and be in loads of pain, then I will start going through withdrawals. Both problems kept me from working which put me on the brink of getting fired multiple times. I take Kratom about one week out of a month when I run out of pain medication. Kratom is disgusting in taste and I don't like taking it at all, but the benefits are too great not to take it. I don't know if it is possible to overdose from it but I would definitely throw it up if I took a lot of it because it does upset my stomach sometimes.\n\nWhen I tried KRATOM, it had amazing results. It took away my pain and withdrawals symptoms from narcotics! I was no longer constipated or had sexual dysfunction when taking Kratom instead of pain pills. It was a beautiful thing that I could order this amazing medicine on the internet without having to see a doctor and them a pharmacist. Having to take pain pills means I couldn't travel anywhere for more than a month because thats all doctors prescribe at a time. Kratom is a miracle to those who want to get off narcotics or heroin, taking away pain and releasing withdrawal symptoms. Making this a Schedule 1 is a catastrophic mistake! Please don't let this happen. I don't see a logical reason for this action. It would take away a safe route for people who want to stop taking hard drugs. People who are taking Kratom now who are using it to kick a habit will have to go back to taking drugs to not be sick which will lead to MANY OVERDOSE DEATHS, and that blood will be on the DEA's hands! \n\nSincerely,\nJames Wharton\nKratom user","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2008","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"JAMES Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Making Kratom illegal will only help heroin dealers and distilleries.

I was born with spina bifida occulta in which I only had slight hip and leg problems and it was manageable. Then after a back injury it got extremely worse and unbearable along with spinal stenosis, sciatica and fibromyalgia. I was suffering from chronic pain and just getting out of bed felt like I had an elephant on my back. My legs and feet have shooting shock like pains. I have to constantly shake my arms and legs. I was missing out on my babies life. I couldn't even go to Disney with them because of the pain. I was prescribe painkiller and muscle relaxer which do help but I wanted a natural alternative so I was not relying solely on my medication to resume a normal life.\n\nI work in a hotel and while a work an Indian women heard me in the back room crying in pain (I do not like to take a full dose of my painkillers while working and driving). Anyways she told me about the natural pain relief of Kratom and in her culture they live off the land and use medicine that mother earth provides. I never would have believed that this would work for me and blew it off. A few months later I started having issues with my lower intestine and was very ill. I could not keep my pain medication down. So I did some research and found Kratom online. Best thing I could have ever done for myself and my family. I don't have to rely on my prescribe medications in fact I hardly use them anymore. \n\nWhy would anyone want to take away Kratom. This is an amazing earth made medication. I tell everyone about it and even my mother who suffers from 3 failed back surgeries. I have never had a bad side effect an only noticed slight headache if I don't drink enough water. \n\nPlease leave Kratom alone. I want to keep enjoying my family in this short life we live.   \n\nSincerely, \n\nNicole Marie","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2864","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nicole Marie","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a working professional in my late 30's.

Kratom has not caused the problems that schedule 1 substances have caused like heroin or cocaine. Here are my reasons: \n1)\tIts a case of mistaken identity that its even being considered for prohibition. Unfortunately kratom got mixed up with the synthIetic marijuana products that made their way to the head shops and online sellers. Mitrigyna speciosa is a natural plant that is closely related to the coffee plant. Its effects are as mild as caffeine in my experience, and no more addictive.\n2)\tI suffered for 7 years with severe alcoholism which nearly killed me. Alcohol is the legal government-sanctioned substance throughout the land. It causes untold deaths and violence in our society, aside from the sheer physically addictive power of it. It was when I found kratom that I was able to wean myself off of alcohol, and get my life back on track. It would be so pitifully unfair if others couldnt get the benefit of this plant as I did. Ive been alcohol free for many years now, and its directly because of kratom. God put kratom on earth for our own good. I know of many people who were able to kick their opiate addiction because of kratom. In fact kratom has a history of being used for treatment of substance abuse in other countries. I use the powdered leaves to great benefit. I dont need a concentrate or extract to gain the benefits.\n3)\tProhibition has a long history of causing worse problems than the original problem it was to cure. We found that out dramatically with alcohol. There is absolutely no need to create the same problem with the mild, benign herb, kratom. Why dont you leave us with our freedom? Why does freedom have to be confiscated from our lives because some individual somewhere thinks we dont have the ability to make good decisions on our own? The problem here, as I said before is mistaken identity. Kratom is not the deadly scourge its been made out to be by people who dont understand it, or its beneficial properties. This herb should be studied, and kept legal in the USA. \n\nThank you for listening. \n\nGlenn Woolum","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9438","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Glenn Woolum","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not make a perfectly safe, useful plant scheduled.

EVERYTHING I initially found was only more pills.... I am an individual who has met with unfortunate misfortunes and physical trauma the last 5 years of my life. I've had my leg pulled into a running boat motor and 2 motor vehicle accidents which have resulted in permanent damage. Regardless, I've endured and pushed through trying to continue to live my life. Unfortunately, that comes with managing the chronic and debilitating pain that has been bestowed upon me from all those accidents I endured. I am tired of taking these medications and tired of all the never ending side effects. It has become a torment having to take these pills knowing that with it comes horrific nausea, dizziness, stomach pain, sleepless nights... the list goes on. The side effects are approached with even more pills when it's discussed with my doctors. There are no real ears wiling to listen when your a patient who takes pain killers. No one takes you seriously; regardless of who you may be outside of that office. I am a nurse. I am an individual who once took care of helpless and sick souls... And now existing as both a Nurse and a Patient has TRULY opened my eyes to the level of negligence our society has for any whom may be inflicted, debilated with illness or pain. But I digress..\nNow to the present moment. I am currently new to KRATOM. I came upon it randomly one evening about 2 months ago. With the attitude, \"I have nothing to lose\" I decided to order it. I read review after review; story after story and it gave me hope. Hope that I found an answer I've been searching for the last 4-5 months. Hope that I could have a normal life again like 100's and I'm positive 1000's of other individuals who have also found this miracle plant. I have been implementing the kratom the last 6 weeks or so and for the first time I feel that I no longer have to rely on pills to be the only solution for my chronic pain. It manages my daily pain and I do not suffer from any side effects. Most importantly, it is widely available and I do not have to see a doctor to take it. I have just turned 34yo... I have my whole life ahead of me and I finally see that having children is no longer a dream. With the help of KRATOM I can get off my medications and now have the chance to be healthy & strong enough to start a family. Taking this plant away takes everything from me now. There is NOTHING that comes remotely close to this miracle plant and banning it will be taking so much more for hundreds of thousands of individuals. It does not cause harm, it is not addictive.. It is not a narcotic and does not induce such effects whatsoever. Here is a solution being lifted into the air for the government to share with the rest of the population...

I got stomach ulcers from the narcotics I was taking and decided to find a natural alternative to relieve my pain.\n\n-I have chronic migraines, anxiety, depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, carpal tunnel, hip dysplasia, PTSD and weight issues. I was taking 10 different prescriptions to \"manage\" these symptoms. Hydrocodone, clonazepam, depakote, flexaril, lyrica, gabapentin, busbar, topamax and valium (as needed.) Not only did these medications cause me more physical pain, I lost 15 pounds due to the use of topamax. I have been taking kratom to manage my pain, anxiety, depression, energy levels for two years.\n\n-i am a wife to a united states soldier, we have three daughters. If it weren't for kratom, I wouldn't be able to be the mom that I am today. I am able to wake up and get all three of them ready, mind you my oldest is autistic, and get them off to school. I'm able to keep up our home, our animals and our yard work. My husband is gone a lot for training and for his civilian job, so I am pretty much a single mom. I need kratom to be able to be clear headed enough to take my kids to their activities.\n\n-Kratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life, so I'm asking that you do not classify kratom as a schedule 1 drug.\n\nThank you so much,\nAnna Gregg","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0741","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anna Gregg","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Evan Shipley. I am 42 years old, I am a former vineyard manager and winemaker. I now home school my daughter while my wife works as a trauma therapist. I began taking kratom about a year ago to help with chronic back pain. I still have back pain, which has been diagnosed as caused by  spinal stenosis, but kratom minimizes the pain with no symptoms of addiction and no euphoria. My understanding of schedule one drug classification is that a schedule one drug causes negative side effects without providing any medical benefits. I feel no symptoms of addiction from kratom. If I have a day without pain, I do not take kratom, and I feel no withdrawal symptoms. Kratom, in my experience, has made a very positive impact on my everyday life. It eases the pain I feel almost daily. I believe that without kratom, my pain would lead to unnecessary use of opiate drugs and, very likely, addiction. My hope is that more research will be done to realize the potential benefits of kratom before it is dismissed as a harmful and addictive drug.

It is a rare, incurable bladder disease that caused ulcers to form on my bladder wall and pinning. Its ruined my life, I have a constant urge to urinate and severe pain down there from the inflammation. I have contemplated  suicide many times. When I started taking Kratom, my life changed. I could function more, went to the bathroom less frequently and the pain was finally manageable. I believe that Kratom should be in the same categorie as med marijuana. They both help chronic pain patients and they both are impossible to overdose and die from!!! Just like with med marijuana, Kratom vendors pay taxes to the U.S. government. In addition to helping with pain, this plant has antiviral, antiparasitic and antimalarial properties that should be studied. In conclusion, this plant that's a member of the coffee family has given me my life back. Please have some compassion and leave it legal, just like medical marijuana is.  And the government can sit back, collect taxes from vendors and go after some real hardcore nasty drugs that are actually killing people.

My wife left me and I was just in a bad place, it affected my work, my finances, and my health. I was very down, and I didn't know how to deal with it. Every day was bleak and hopeless, and I felt as thought it had always been that way and would always be that way. A friend of mine told me there was kratom at a store he goes to, and I thought maybe that would be a hangover killer. Originally, when I tried out a stimulating blend, it did exactly that, it killed my hangover, but my evenings were still spent drinking in order to get to sleep. I didn't know what kratom really was, I had sort of equated it with K2 or spice or some other man made drug designed to mimic the natural effects of a plant. Another friend came to me after he had stopped taking his prescribed painkiller Norco, and told me that there are different strains and explained the reds helped him kick his need for the pills, pain free and easily.\nThere have been a few occasions where I was prescribed those same pills for long enough to experience withdrawal afterwards, it was very unpleasant and the idea that this kratom stuff could do that seemed too good to he true, yet it was true. I tried one of these red blends, a red Sumatra that night instead of my usual bottle of whiskey, and I found the sedation to be positively complete. I wasn't intoxicated, yet I was comfortable, warm, happy, and tired. In the next few weeks I realized I greatly prefer this feeling to alcohol and I recognize it's similarity to the norco pills. Since adding kratom to my life on a daily basis, I've been able to escape the natural depression that seemed to have a hold on me for so long. I feel like kratom acts like an antidepressant, stimulant, sleep aid, and painkiller, and it's made my life trajectory do a 180 degree turn. \nI've tried anxiety and depression medication. I've tried recreational drugs, I've tried counseling, and so far the only thing that has ever made me feel comfortable and happy in my own skin is the substance the DEA was intending to ban just a few months ago. I was prepared to submit to them and be a good citizen, I petitioned, I gave my story, but I stopped kratom use, and once again my lifelong depression and anxiety came back to me. \nTo anyone reading this in a position of power, please allow all of us, those who benefit greatly from Kratom, to continue doing what we do. We're regular people, we're not druggies or criminals, we're far less likely to be criminals if we have our kratom.\nPlease, for the sake of my own happiness, this plant is a gift from God and it helps me in ways that no pill ever has.\nThank you for your time\n-Jason","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13483","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason M.","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban kratom.

Many opportunities have passed me by because I shut-down emotionally and can't function. I have lost jobs and even lost a few friends due to stress overloading me. My life has not been easy. I would sometimes feel like I'm only a few degrees away from considering suicide. A tragedy like the death of a close family member, might have pushed me over the edge. \n\nAlmost two years ago, a friend recommended that I try kratom after telling him how all of the many prescriptions Doctors have given me don't seem to help much. After trying it a few times, I noticed that my depression lifted and I was more motivated to participate in life.\nI've also had nerve pain in my thighs for awhile now, and that lessened as well!\n(The pain in my thighs originates from a pinched nerve in my spine, and the surgery options for it are too scary for me to consider.)\n\nTo understand why kratom was the answer for me, you have to know that I've tried most of the possibly helpful prescription medicines available for depression and anxiety over the past 23 years. I can't even begin to count how many (in addition to unhelpful talk therapy). They barely helped, if  at all. AND, WORST OF ALL the last Rx medicine I was given by a Dr. PERMANENTLY IMPAIRED MY SPEECH!  I took that prescription about 3 years ago, and still have stuttering fits to this day. \nGetting hit with the speech problem compounded my anxiety and depression. \nSo, you can now see why I'm afraid of trying anymore meds for depression after being disabled like that. \n\nKratom, on the other hand, WORKS, and with very minimal side effects. And by saying \"minimal side effects\", I'm including not feeling intoxicated. In fact, my mind feels even clearer with the fog of depression lifted. Contrary to some hyped up reports, it doesn't feel like a \"high\", and is more on par with a relaxing cup of coffee or two (without the jitters) ; calming, yet motivating. \n\nWith the help of kratom, I have some hope in life now.  My outlook isn't so dreary.\nSome things I've been able to do lately after finding kratom:\n*Clean my home and do normal chores around the house\n*Spend more time with loved ones\n*Exercise and eat better\n*Stop smoking\n*Sleep more regularly\n*Enjoy new productive hobbies\n*Begin the process of going back to college and completing my education\n*And here's a big one; stop drinking alcohol -at the rate I was going, I'm sure I would've been dead well before 50. \n\nNOTE: I am not saying kratom is a \"cure-all\" or panacea, which it is not. I'm just listing what the many ways my life has improved without the dark, heavy presence of crippling depression and anxiety. The dulling of my thigh pain is just a bonus.\n\nI think it's wrong and ironic to put this mild plant into the same category as hard drugs when, in fact, it has helped so many people get off of  hard drugs (including alcohol).\nIt would harm untold thousands of people to make this plant Schedule 1, where it can't even be researched properly.  It would even KILL people, yes, quickly KILL some of the people who utilize kratom to stay away from opiates if this ban goes through and they resorted back to opiates (and slowly kill those who would go back to alcohol).  It would also harm others who can't function well for other reasons and have found no relief from currently available medicines.  \n\nMost of the people who utilize kratom are responsible older adults who have tried everything else available, from medications to therapy, and were at their wit's end when they finally found kratom to ease their suffering. While there are some younger people who have tried it, they tend to go away after discovering that they were misinformed about it's effects, and that it won't get them \"stoned\" or \"high\" and lose interest. Kratom mainly does it's thing for people who are in some sort of pain, whether it be physical or emotional.\n\nPlease look at all the facts when weighing your decision, there are numerous papers on kratom's efficacy and relative safety. I won't list the many links scientific links because I know many others already have.

Patients who suffered from anxiety and depression and those who suffered from long term pain issues with no beneficial actions. Not only has this plant helped may people i came into contact with, it has helped myself as well. I have a very light anxiety issue. It is not as worse as some of the cases i have heard, but from personal experience it physically helps to control and anxiety attack. i have been using kratom to control the anxiety for at least two years. I have also learned, this plant has helped in other issues, muscle cramps, menstural cramps and also headaches.

Within 3 months, the pain was spreading all over my body.  It took 12 years before I was validated with a diagnosis but still wasn't getting narcotic pain treatment.  When I got up to 4,000 of tylenol a day, my doctor finally put me on vicodin and then percocet.  What a relief!  As a single mom, I could keep working and not lose everything.  That was in 2000.  As time went on, I became as dependent on the narcotic as I am on coffee (don't touch my coffee! LOL)  but my tolerance began to build.  By 2011 I was up to 80 mg of oxycodone a day and 2400 mg of tylenol as well as a fentenyl patch when I had a particular bad stretch.  Then he put me on methadone WHICH I HATED!  I couldn't function on that .  By then he had lost his ability to prescribe pain medicine.  I was in distress until I found a pain doctor I could afford.  He has me on 60 mg of oxycodone per day.  To keep my tolerance level in check, I use Kratom in between doses.   It helps tremendously.  There is no \"head high\".  In fact it acts as an analgesic.  The pain in my body just releases.  I cannot take aspirin, NSAIDS, or any other anti inflammatory due to an ulcer.  I am working on replacing all the narcotics totally with Kratom.  Please, please, please, don't take this promising botanical away from the common person.  Thanks for considering.

It is highly beneficial to pain management and helps break addiction.  I personally use it for my anxiety as well as lower back pain that I suffer with.  I choose not to take pain medicine because pain medicine kills people every day and i choose not to get on anxiety medicine because anxiety medicine changes the person using it mentally.  I choose kratom to help me because it does not change my personality and I can manage my issues without being overly sedated and remain healthy.  I know so many who benefit from this plant and pray that you just allow the american people to deal with their struggles the way they see fit for their bodies.  Kratom has an opiate agonist in it which basically makes people sick to their stomachs if they do take to much. this is a built in safety mechanism preventing people from overdosing! It is important to really understand what you are taking away from people before you do. many people have used kratom to get off prescription pain pills.  When kratom is removed from the market those people will have to get back on their opiate prescriptions again and they could overdose from them because their tolerance for opiates have dropped.  for example if somebody was taking oxy 80 before kratom and kratom allowed them to quit taking their oxy prescription and they may think that once kratom is unavailable they need their oxy 80's again. They may even have left over medicine and start back where they left off. Well an Oxycontin 80 could kill them because they have no tolerance for prescriptions any more.  Kratom is extremely safe even though some may have died but this is due to other contributing factors.  If for example somebody was taking medicine that speeds up their heart and they decided to drink some energy drinks and had a heart attack. Does this mean we ban all energy drinks?  Well that would be silly wouldn't it?  Kratom by itself has never killed anybody ever.  If you decide to restrict it then at least consider the option for only allowing so many venders to order it in and that way it can be pure and tested.  You could allow these venders to have a specific license to import. Then those vendors pay their taxes on the product and provide a safe product to the united states citizens.  Just please don't take this plant away entirely because this plant truly fights and beats the opiate epidemic America faces every day.  Last of all consider this. If kratom is taken away and people cant get it may go back to using heroin off the streets.  They could overdose and they would not have if kratom was still available!

As a future social worker, I know that the individuals who have turned to kratom to stop their substance use will likely relapse if kratom is illegal. Substance abuse is a progressive disease. When individuals relapse after being in recovery, the likelihood of death increases. When the ban was announced, I immediately thought of all my future clients that would no longer have kratom as an option for recovery. I thought of all the people who will die after succumbing to the grips of their addiction. I cried for all the hope that was lost. \n\nPersonally, the ban would affect me negatively as well. I am a college-aged student with chronic back pain who has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. A year ago I was put on multiple medications for my mental illness that made me horribly sick. I decided to struggle with my mental health without medication instead of spending every day throwing up. After expressing my frustration to an elderly friend of mine, he recommended that I try kratom. My experiences with the use of kratom of a supplement have been overwhelmingly positive. I have never experienced any drug-like \"high.\" Instead, I get pain relief similar to what naproxen sodium used to give me before I developed a tolerance for it. I also have more stable moods and less anxiety. For once, I was able to feel excited for the upcoming school semesters because with I finally felt that I could overcome the barrier of my pain and mental illness by having kratom in my life. I used kratom almost daily for two months and stopped once the ban was announced. I did not experience any withdrawal symptoms even though I stopped using kratom cold turkey. The symptoms I did experience were my crippling back pain returned and I have been struggling with my mental illness as well. If kratom becomes illegal, I do not know how I will continue to function. I am afraid of becoming another person chemically dependent on opiates. Kratom allows me to be a fully functional, productive member of society. Kratom allows me to get up in the morning and know that I can do whatever is needed of me without my back pain and mental illness stoping me. I am afraid of a life without kratom.

This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n \nThree years ago I discovered kratom in an online support group for chronic pain sufferers.\n \nI USED TO suffer from migraines, fibromyalgia, chronic myofascial pain syndrome, severe menstrual cramps, degenerative disc disease, bulging/herniated discs, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and yes, after trying pain management clinics, addiction and alcoholism. I have dealt with most of these conditions since childhood, and I have tried pharmaceutical medications, physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and alcohol when it became more difficult to get the pain medication in Florida. I could not function with my illnesses. I could not function in a pill/alcohol stupor. I am grateful that my children do not remember those times, but they were absolutely a factor in my divorce. Twice, the use of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications led to Grand Mal seizures.

I could not perform daily activities of living. Some days I could not walk, or could not get out of bed. Since I discovered kratom, I have held a respectable position in a Fortune 500 company.

Not even on the same level.  The problem comes when idiots go out and try to isolate this or that.  Those things,  extracts, should be ilegal. Not herbal kratom tea/powder. \nThank you so much for your time. \nTammy","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8717","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"tammy tajeddine","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not criminalize the plant kratom!

As a pre-med student, I have been closely following the growing opioid epidemic across the US. In the context of that scourge, kratom appears to be a great help to many recovering opiate users: it provides many of the benefits of methadone or suboxone maintenance therapy to patients too remote or too poor to afford going to more traditional clinics. Additionally, the risk of deadly respiratory depression from overdose seems virtually nonexistent (a rare quality in opioid analgesics), and subjective withdrawal syndromes seem less severe than those associated with traditional maintenance drugs like buprenorphine.\n\nMoreover, scheduling mitragynine and associated alkaloids poses a significant threat to clinical research. These compounds represent a promising frontier in pharmaceutical research. In the next few decades, kratom-based drug discovery research has serious potential to yield a less harmful alternative to disastrously addictive and diversion-prone drugs like Vicodin and Oxycontin.\n\nFor these reasons, and for the relative scarcity of cases of drastic harm due to kratom use, I urge the DEA to refrain from scheduling kratom, mitragynine, and the related alkaloids.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5585","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Drew Kravinski","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jared, I grew up in suburban Maryland. At age 16 I became addicted to heroin. It controlled my life. I tried time and time to get clean with suboxone or cold turkey and it never stuck. In February of this year I gave it another shot. At 20 years old, 4 years deep into my addiction cold turkey had become too painful for me to suffer through. Suboxone was just as bad and always led me back to heroin or a coke problem being stuck in that opiate fog. Instead, I decided to try kratom. I ordered some online, and took it 24 hours after my last dose of heroin. I was able to work the next day. I was not high, I was not in a fog, I was just not sick anymore. While I didn't feel perfect, I was able to work and abstain from opiates using kratom. After I ran out I stopped using it. No withdrawals from the kratom. I was opiate free. I have been clean for 10 months now, the longest I ever have been. If it weren't from kratom I would probably still be using or dead. Keeping kratom illegal is ruining a chance for other addicts like me to escape the grasps of addiction without becoming dependent on another drug. This plant saved my life, and saves thousands of others lives as well. \n\nSincerely,\n\nJared Crerie","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3461","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jared Crerie","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used kratom for just over a year.

She claimed it helped her with her social anxiety. I wouldn't consider myself as someone who has social anxiety, but as an avid coffee drinker myself, she sold me on its membership in the coffee family and its similar effects. \n\nI am not a doctor nor do I have any medical training, but I researched the plant and determined there was little risk in trying it. It was a Sunday morning, and I brewed a glass of tea from its leaves and indeed, it reminded me of the effects of caffeine, either from coffee or tea. What I pleasantly remarked was that while it cetainly had stimulating effects akin to caffeine, I was not feeling at all jittery or nervous in the same way as I did when I consumed caffeine. It was a smooth, pleasant experience and I was able to be very productive and focused while I worked on a freelance project.\n\nWhen news of the DEA ban traveled to my ears here in Silicon Valley, I was geniunely surprised and disappointed by our government. Here is an innocuous plant akin to coffee or green tea that people have been using responsibly for thousands of year for legitimate purposes, and without amassing comprehensive data and doing due diligence of investigating the myriad uses and roles of this plant in society, the DEA decrees it will issue a blanket ban on this plant. Where is the medical justification? The FDA approval process for a drug takes many, many years before a decision on a drug is made. How can there not be a similar process in place for the DEA to issue such a ban on a substance that has been safely and quietly used for thousands of years? I sincerely ask you to stop stealing the freedom of choice from the American people. Give us knowledge, give us education, but reserve your laws for only what is truly necessary.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13121","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Schofield","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my name is Diana Marquez I am a 45 year old single mother and I'm on disability. I am opposed to the DEA putting Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. I found out about Kratom from a friend I met in a Chronic pain group on line...I've been drinking Kratom for the past 10 months on a daily basis for relief from degenerative disc disease and chronic arthritis. I have had 4 back surgeries including 2 cervical fusions and the bottom 4 discs of my lumbar spine are completely disintegrated. I had my first surgery almost 20 years ago at age 27 and was put on lethal doses of prescription pain medication by a DOCTOR! Over the years my body became addicted to the medication and I started to suffer from depression and anxiety and was placed on benzos and antidepressants. I was not able to function, I was dozing off and even had suppressed breathing at times. Kratom DOES NOT affect or suppress an individuals breathing!! I have had TWO hernia surgeries due to chronic constipation. The opiates completely messed up my bowels. I can proudly say that I have not taken any of those medications in 10 months and it's because of being able to drink Kratom to help my pain and my mood. My life had become unmanageable and I was severely depressed and in pain all the time. Now I am an active member of society. My son has told me that he is SO grateful that I found Kratom and that I have been a totally different parent since I stopped taking the medications. He is literally frightened about what might happen if I have to go back to opiates!! The idea that the DEA is trying to take away a PLANT... that is helping people stay off of these medications and actually have a quality of life is ludicrous. I personally can't imagine not being able to drink kratom for my symptoms and quite honestly, I'm terrified of ever going back to the medications. We're in a terrible epidemic of opiate abuse and opioid overdoses and this is a plant that can help people stay away from those medications and manage their pain and their symptoms naturally. Kratom should be ENCOURAGED, not prohibited. \n\nOverdose deaths involving prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999, and so have sales of these prescription drugs. From 1999 to 2014, more than 165,000 people have died in the U.S. from overdoses related to prescription opioids. Opioid prescribing continues to fuel the epidemic. Today, at least half of all U.S. opioid overdose deaths involve a prescription opioid. In 2014, more than 14,000 people died from overdoses involving prescription opioids. I received this information from the CDC website.\n\nThere have been articles written in Forbes Magazine, The Washington Post and The Huffington Post that give very accurate information and also share stories of many who are getting relief by drinking Kratom. There are veterans, grandparents, parents, seniors, that are getting relief from this plant. The majority of people drinking Kratom are responsible adults whom Kratom is helping with pain and other conditions. \n\nI don't see people standing up for their rights to use Heroin, LSD or bath salts. These are well educated, intelligent people who are taking the time to fight for this plant to remain legal. If we were drug users, I don't think we could write such eloquent emails and make phone calls if we were \"high\" or \"drugged up!!!\"\n\nIn summation...we are in the midst of the WORST opiod epidemic in HISTORY!!! The DEA is saying that they had 15 related Kratom deaths and each and every one of those deaths also had a different drug along with it. There are people dying every 20 minutes from opiate overdoses and yet they would rather take this plant away from us and have people's lives on their hands? Look at the amount of deaths from energy drinks...yet they are legal. \nI ask that you please realize that banning this plant will cause people to go back to the drugs, alcohol, medications and there will be LIVES LOST!!! I wasn't living anymore when I was addicted to the medication, I finally have my life back...PLEASE don't take it away?\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely, \nDiana Marquez \n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2694","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Diana Marquez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is cori bitner,I would like to say that at one time I was seriously  addicted to pharmaceutical pain killers,with a habit of 60 to 90 milligrams of oxicodone a day..life was misarable,I was constantly stealig from family and freinds for pills.with the help of kratom I was able to stick out withdrawals,and kick the habit completely.ive also beenable to helpseveral fellow addicts by introducing them to kratom.it saddens me to see this herb takin away from athers who could definitely benifit from it.there are more overdoses every year from pharmaceutical pain medication than all illist drugs combined.kratom can help dwindle,if not put an end to the epidemic than opioids have become","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4498","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"cori bitner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Seems like Kratom might be a safe alternative to opoids.

I did, however, consume Kratom 1-2 times a day as a coffee substitute (along with green tea). I found it to be an excellent energy and mood boost.

Kratom is a relatively mild substance that has been safely used by millions of people for pain relief and as an aid in overcoming opioid or other addictions. Only a very few deaths have been associated with kratom, and nearly all of them have occurred in combination with other substances. On the other hand, deaths due to opiate and opioid overdoses have exploded in recent years, and continued access to kratom may very well prove essential in helping to bring this terrible death toll down again. At this point it would definitely be reasonable to require age identification for kratom purchase, inspect shipments for contamination and warn purchasers of potentially harmful drug interactions. An outright ban on kratom is very likely to cause far more damage than it would ever prevent, and have an adverse effect on public perception of current drug policy in this country.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11228","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Clark","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please just mind your own business.

There is no \"high\" associated with the use of this substance.  It simply stops the craving for opioids.

I am 31 years old and I have endometriosis and fibromyalgia.  My doctor had me on Norco for pain and it wasn't working so they did some DNA test and determined that my body doesn't metabolize most opiates very well which is why it helps with certain pain but not my stabbing pelvic pain due to the endometriosis.  I have tried all the treatments and had surgery.  The only thing, and I mean only thing that helps manage the chronic stabbing pelvic pain is mitragyna speciosa, aka kratom.  I have been taking it for over two years with the blessing of my doctor who said she was glad I found something that worked.  I don't feel high from it, it just makes me feel like a normal functioning responsible adult.  \n\nBecause of this plant I get to play with my daughter, give her piggyback rides, chase her, take her to the park and enjoy my life with her.  Before I found kratom I was depressed and suicidal because I was curled up in a ball in pain all day and felt like I did not deserve my daughter for it.  She deserves a mother who can be there for her 100%.  Who isn't in bed crying all day, but helping her to grow, teaching her, engaging her in all the interactions babies need to thrive.  I finally feel like I deserve her and that she has a wonderful mother.  \n\nIt took me 3 years to conceive her because of fertility problems due to endometriosis.  I probably can't have any more kids so I am trying to enjoy her young years and when she gets in school I wish to get certified to become a yoga instructor.  All of this is only possible if I can safely and effectively manage my pain, which only kratom helps with.  I don't want to get hooked on dangerous prescription medications that really don't even help with my pelvic pain just make me feel high and not all there.  I don't want that at all.  I want to feel clear headed with little to no pain, like kratom makes me feel.  \n\nThis plant should be researched by unbiased people, and regulated so that only adults can legally purchase it.  It should not be made into a schedule 1.  That is unfair to the thousands of responsible chronically ill adults whose lives have been made livable again due to this wonderful and mild plant.   All that does is turn responsible law abiding citizens into criminals overnight, citizens who aren't trying to get high but trying to feel normal and we all deserve the chance at a normal low-pain life.  \n\n\nMy dream in life is to watch my daughter grow into a beautiful young woman, to teach her yoga, to teach yoga classes and bring  love and light into the world.  That is all I want.  I don't want to be bedridden or forced to take prescription pain medications that do not work on my pain.  I don't want to become suicidal because I feel like I'm a burden on my daughter and husband.  I want to contribute to society, not be holed up in my bedroom crying all day. \n\nI appeal to your empathy for us as fellow human beings.  Please don't take this mild plant away from chronically ill people.  I want to be able to feel normal by taking a natural plant, not synthetic chemicals thrown together in a lab.  The plant has dozens of helpful alkaloids not just for pain but help people with PTSD, anxiety and depression.  It helps make our lives manageable. If you take away the plant from us in its natural form, while pharmaceutical companies just yank one or two alkaloids from it and synthesize it in labs and we are forced to take that concoction, we are not getting the plant in it's natural form the way it was created and not benefiting from all of its numerous helpful alkaloids.  \n\nPlease let us continue to have the freedom to procure this plant.

I have asked my doctor if there is anything non-narcotic that she could prescribe and she said there wasn't.  I still have days when I take the Vicodin, but mostly I take the Kratom when needed.  I give myself a week or so with no medications at all about every 6 weeks just to be sure there is no addiction issue.\n\nPlease do not take Kratom off the market.

My interaction with Kratom is that of a semi average user.  I am active in the community and can see the positive effects this plant has on people's lives.  I personally use it for severe anxiety and some depression manifested by PTSD from my childhood.  Is it perfect?  No, but it's a safer alternative to the cocktail of medication my doctor tries to push on me.\n\nI have seen people with severe disabilities able to function and lead productive lives while using Kratom.  The alternative is being dosed with heavy pain killers, anti-depressants, or both.  All which seems to only benefit one industry, the pharmaceutical.  This is the only explanation that many americans are now forming, it is a dangerous and careless one sanctioned by our government.\n\nIn an effort to not derail this comment, I will say the benefits of this plant far outweigh the negatives.  As with anything in life, there are always pros and cons.  Kratom should not be banned because a couple people mixed it with other substances and had an overdose.  You will always have people who are too far gone, take something to the extreme and die.  Its unfortunate, but if it wasn't Kratom it would have been another substance.  What if the substance was Alcohol or an Espresso?  Would these also get schedule 1?  No, because generally speaking they are safe.  And a sufficient amount of data exists on its long term use.\n\nWith Kratom we do not have this luxury.  I suggest we take this time to study and learn the benefits of this plant.  This is the best stance the DEA can take.  It would show the American people that this government entity is logical, honest, and fair.\n\nThank you for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21952","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Murray","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm thirty-five years old and the manager of my family owned auto parts business. I'm very active physically, including biking, hiking, running, and cross country skiing. I started using Kratom as an endurance workout supplement recommended by a friend. I used it a couple times a week and it worked wonders for energy, muscle fatigue, and pain associated with exercising. I stopped using it because I heard it had some withdrawal potential. I personally didn't experience anything of the sort, but was only using it a few times a week. Then about a year later I contracted Lyme disease. Fatigue, joint and muscle aches, depression, and gastrointestinal issues were some of the issues I was facing. I decided to try Kratom again since some of the symptoms I was having could be potentially relieved with it. Again, it worked very well. Overall fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and even the depression were alleviated. I was taking it more this time, about twice a day. Once in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon, and right before bed. After a few months I decided to stop to make sure I wouldn't have the withdrawal I had heard about, since I was taking it more often. I had a runny nose, and some slight diarrhea for about two days, but nothing like what I had heard. All of the Lyme symptoms came back so I started taking it again. I was told how to take it from the friend who recommended it, so I didn't have any issues with taking too much that I've also heard about. My Lyme wasn't treated early so it's being very stubborn. I've had several courses of antibiotics, none of which have been able to rid me of the bacteria as of yet. Hopefully soon. Without Kratom, I'm not sure what I would have done to deal with Lyme. I just feel lucky to have it as an option. Also, I haven't had a cold or a flu in the two years since I have been taking it, which is odd for me, I typically get colds that turn into sinus infections two or three times a year. Not sure if it has anything to do with the Kratom, but it sure seems like it. Please keep Kratom legal. It has the potential to help so many people at a fraction of the cost of the medicine it would take to do the same thing, and it's all natural.

While the opposition may argue that Kratom is a drug that should be banned, as someone who has witnessed regular Kratom usage in people around me, I believe it should be kept legal and open for consumption. Admittedly, research needs to be done on Kratom to determine exactly what the long term effects are. As it stands now, no known deaths have occurred from Kratom. On the contrary, this supplement aids people with anxiety, pain relief, sleep, depression, and much more. It is an incredibly useful supplement that has high benefit for both medical and commercial use.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14220","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Cannella","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do your due diligence and research the benefits of Kratom, before implementing this ban.

Everything. Is that really what the government wants? Finding more overdosed, dead people on the streets due to herion meth an PRESCRIPTION drugs. It is already being taxed and sold under the same regulation as alcohal. And should remain that way. In my opinion, alchohalism is an undercover problem. There are many posts on how it has saved lives. It has saved more than ever known. It's a matter of control, I do not feel any different (withdrawal) I can take 4 to 6 or 20 to 40 depending on how many flashbacks I get watching both take their last breath..

Since I was introduced to kratom by a good friend four or five years ago, I have stopped relying on drugs. My mind is calmer and I feel healthier and more functional. Opiates have little or no effect on me while taking kratom, so I have given them up altogether with no regrets. Admittedly, I am terrified of reverting back to the person I used to be should kratom be scheduled, and I am certain that thousands like me will turn to hard drugs without it, whether it's for addiction, anxiety, or chronic pain. This plant and its alkaloids can be studied without instituting a ban. I have never once suffered ill effects while using it as a supplement, and I have yet to encounter another who has.

I have suffered from depression from a young age along with anxiety disorder and panic attacks that rendered me disabled and caused me to drop out of college temporarily. I have been in several bad accidents leaving me in the emergency room with broken bones in my arms, wrists, thumb, and stitches in my head and ear. Despite several surgeries, the damage has still be done and the result is that I deal with chronic pain and restless leg syndrome. All of these conditions make my life unmanageable without the support of my church and kratom. I have been through years of therapy and saw psychiatrists who put me on lots of medications that were physically addictive, had lots of side effects, and ultimately did not help my conditions. Years ago when I discovered kratom I felt my symptoms subside and felt like I had found the solution to my problems. I was able to go back to school and complete my degree, move out of my parents home to financial independence, and get into a career track in my field of interest. In my years of kratom use I have experienced many benefits with few side effects aside from occasional constipation. I have not taken rx drugs for years now and have never looked back. Kratom has been a blessing to myself and many others I know who suffer from similar backgrounds. I am strongly opposed to the ban on this benign plant and feel that it is a blatant overreach by the authorities that the public trusts to help keep them safe.

With Kratom, I have no allergy/adverse reaction. Since using Kratom I have been able to stop the opiates my doctors had me on for pain, all of which I suffered some kind of side effect and had to take other medication to combat those side effects.

If you take Kratom away from me and others, you will have not prevented something that according to the FDA is preventable. \n\nIn my 9 years in the medical field, I have never seen one person experience anything bad from Kratom. \n\nI do not think Kratom should be scheduled or banned. People should be allowed to have natural options available to them. One option may work for one person but not for another. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my story.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17635","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christina Gunderson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Any Natural Treatment For the withdraw symptoms of heroin or alcohol addiction should NOT be Classified as a schedule 1 drug.

I am married and my wife Mariah is 32 years old and we have a 2 year old daughter together.\n\nMy wife has dealt with chronic pain in her lower back, legs and also deals with severe, debilitating migraines that put her out for 7 days at a time ever since I've known her over a period of 4 years.  We have been to specialists at Duke University in Rheuomotolgy, Neurology, Hematology and her Primary Care Physician... all of these have not been able to prescribe any treatment that gave her any relief from her chronic pain, in fact most of them have had side effects that were worse to her symptoms and gave little to no alleviation. \n\nAbout a year after we were married she was researching alternative pain relief and came across Kratom that many people were saying was helping them with their chronic pain issues. After reading extensively we ordered some to try it out.  I personally do not have chronic pain and it did little or nothing for me when I tried it.  But, for my wife, after trying it a few times it reduced her pain drastically. She has been taking it now over the last year with amazing results! She has had no harmful side effects from it and it continues to be her primary source of daily relief from her chronic pain. She has tried many other pharmaceutical options that have been prescribed to her but all of them have had harmful side effects. \n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider your proposed ban of Kratom. This is not a plant that is a dangerous synthetic drug, or in need of such a degree of harmful restriction that would result in criminalizing people looking for natural pain relief. \n\nI appreciate your concern and the job that you have of protecting Americans from harmful substances and am thankful that you have our best interests at heart. Please understand what devastating effects this would have on people like my wife who deal with chronic, debilitating pain.\n\nThank you so much for your consideration in this matter. Have an amazing day and again, please reconsider this proposed ban.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2771","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Freeman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jennifer Anderson, I am a married mother of 4, 43 years old, and also a Realtor.  I greatly oppose the DEAs scheduling of Kratom as a schedule 1 drug. Kratom could not be farther from the description of a schedule 1 drug. I discovered Kratom about a year ago, I wish I had discovered it several years before. I believe it has saved my life. Brought a mother back to my kids, and a wife to my husband. My mother no longer worries that she will have to bury me. About 12 years ago, I ended an extremely abusive relationship. After that, I was diagnosed with  depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I also had a herniated L5 with extensive sciatica pain from an injury received during that time. I was put on 220 pain pills per month (Percocet, norco, lortab, methadone) in addition to anxiety and depression medication. For many years this was my cycle. I stopped my real estate, and either did not work or I worked part time waiting tables. I have 2 college degrees so this was very odd for me. Then one day I looked myself in the mirror, and told myself it had to stop that the person in front of me was not who I am. I began to research the best way to get through and help with the withdrawal symptoms. It was in an Internet forum that I discovered Kratom. I then furiously began to research it. I found a vendor, and placed an order. I now have been off all pills for 472 days. I have my life back. I have my career back. Not only that, I make dinner for my family whenever possible, my house is clean, and I'm back to being a children's advocacy volunteer. I owe my life to this wonderful herb. \nScheduling Kratom would not only hurt me, it would hurt my family, and my second husband who has stood by my side during this ordeal.

Of the 15 recorded deaths, not one toxicology report has demonstrated that any of the deceased had only Kratom in their systems: rather, they were all listed as polypharma, or having multiple drugs in their systems, including prescription opiates, anti-anxiety and anti-psychotics. Having known many who have suffered from and are still struggling with opiate addiction, I believe more research, and more funding for the research is needed to conduct trials on all its effects, both long term and short term. This could be the key to solving the opiate epidemic, and possibly saving many lives, both of the addicted, the families their addiction affects, as well as the common people who see mass death and incarnation. We need more information and addicts who are benefiting from Kratom need continued, legal access while this issue is being debated.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14631","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jesse Gustin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I can go to the gas station right now & choose to purchase cigarettes & alcohol- both of which have taken millions of lives, both directly & as a consequence of things like second hand smoke & drunk driving.

Lets study this substance, not ban it when it's helping so many people out there using this plant to effectively transition off (far worse) opioid addictions. \n\nI listened to Joe Rogans podcast that's how I know about this issue.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18823","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rye Boyd","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps my husband who has ptsd.

Lattin, and i am commenting in regards to the concern of the ban on mitragyna speciosa (kratom). I first was introduced to this plant about a year ago, due to the fact I was addicted to opiates. My addiction started after many surgeries (23) for a rare brain and nasal tumor disease that I was diagnosed with at the age of ten. with these surgeries, I was obviously prescribed many pain pills throughout the recovery processes. Which ended up becoming a full blown addiction. I couldn't get out bed nor get to sleep without having them. this condition (JNA) also caused me to have seizures which I could have up to twenty a day. I dealt with this addiction for years. Until I came across a post about kratom, and I decided to give it a try. This day completely changed my life for the better. It not only got my through the all so dreaded withdrawals, but took my pain I dealt with completely. Also, in a unexpected miracle, it stopped my seizures from happening. which also helped me to not have to take my seizure medication, which gave me horrible side effects. such as bad thoughts i had, and mood swings.  It makes me feel like a normal person again. My relationship with my fiance of five years, was on the brink of being over.  I also got that back now and better than ever. I plan to never go back to the life the opiates caused me to live, but am afraid if this miracle plant does get banned I may have to as I can not deal with the pain. I ask you on the behalf of myself, my family, and many others across the country to please not place this plant on the schedule 1 list. as again, my normal life i fought so hard to get back may be taken away again. Also in closing, I want to thank you for holding this public comment period. I ask that you take these amazing stories of triumph into consideration before making the final choice. Thank you for your time.    \nSincerely,\n   Eric Scott Lattin","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15093","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Lattin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nAs a medical and pharmacology-student, I have often recommended Kratom to patients (outside of the workplace) as it relieves their pain in a way many Schedule II and III drugs are unable to do so. Due to its availability over the counter, I recommend that they try this perfectly legal herbal supplement. \n\nI have had many patients comment that the pain relief they receive from taking various Kratom leaf and tinctures is superior to that of high dose morphine or 75mcg/hr Fentanyl patches. I have had many reports of considerably less drowsiness and fatigue. I have also been told that nausea, a common side-effect of chemotherapy, is not a contributing factor.\n\nThis legal and over the counter substance has many, many great uses. Whether an individual takes small doses to assist with their GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) or severe pain (due to cancer treatment) all I have heard is positive reviews. Truly the only negative review I have heard is that the taste is foul.\n\nI believe that many patients will be harmed by scheduling this substance. This is not the same type of substance as \"bath salts\" that cause hallucinations and strange behavior. Kratom binds to similar sites in the brain that block pain and increase dopamine production; additionally, this herb is used by many native tribes across the glove and has been used for hundreds of years. Certain tribes of Native Americans/United States (First Nations/Canada) are permitted the used of Peyote and other hallucinogenic drugs.\n\nThus far, no evidence has been shown that Kratom has any carcinogenic effect nor does it harm the body. At the first worst, taking too much Kratom may induce nausea. \n\nPlease head my warning that Kratom is a very useful substance that will not lead to some form of pandemic of addiction. The users and researches of Kratom that I know quite well and follow have not show nor found any of the typical behavior of a drug addict.\n\nFinally, many individuals have used this substance in order to desist the use of harder and more dangerous drugs such as diamorphine (Heroin), Oxycodone (Oxycontin, Diludid (Hydromorphone), etc. To remove this avenue of recovery would only increase the usage of these substances while creating a whole new means of arresting and incarcerating individuals that merely wish to relieve their pain, anxiety, and addiction.\n\nA study has shown that even Marijuana itself, now legal for recreational use in several States within the U.S.A., is more addictive.\n\nPlease contact me at 505-514-0062. I am able to provide considerably more information on this substance. It would truly be a crime in itself to schedule this substance as it does not fit any of the criteria of a Schedule I drug.\n\nAdditionally, as someone who has assisted professionally with disabled, infirm, and individuals otherwise unable to care for themselves, I believe I am in a position to provide accurate information. This is not a substance that 99% of the users ingest to get \"high\" from, the overwhelming majority are seeking relief from a mental or physiological ailment that they are otherwise unable to treat via stand medical care within this country.\n\n\nE-mail Contact: KB3MGR@Gmail.com \n\nPhone #: 505-514-0062\n\n(If calling from a non (202) area code, please make a second call)\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJameson Glenn Williams","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9859","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jameson Williams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My life before I discovered kratom was much, much different. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety when I was only 16 years old. That's when I became the dr's lab rat and I have been prescribed just about every depression and anxiety medication under the sun. Some of them helped, some made me feel worse. All of them came with negative side effects. The most common side effect with prescription antidepressants is weight gain. Well, one of the biggest roots to my  depression and anxiety is the fact that I was overweight! So even if the medicine helped me feel better at first in the long run I still felt horrible because I would either gain more weight or it would be a lot of dieting and exercise just to stay at the same weight. \n\nIf you've ever had depression, you know how hard it is to function on a day to day basis. Some days simply getting out of bed takes every bit of energy and strength you've got. This makes is extremely difficult to keep jobs and advance in your career. School was also very difficult for me. I almost didn't graduate high school  because my depression and anxiety were like a huge black cloud over my head. Hiding my self worth and true identity from everyone around me. This also makes relationships and friendships extremely difficult. People who've never had depression or anxiety have absolutely no understanding of how difficult day to day life is. How lonely it is. How scary it is. \n\nFast forward a few years after high school and I was finally doing pretty good in life. I had finished college thanks to online classes I could do from home. I had a good job. I was married and had just given birth to my beautiful baby boy. I had finally found the right combo of prescription medication to manage my depression and anxiety and function like a \"normal\" person. Then the unthinkable happens. I get woken up in the middle of the night the day after Christmas to the news that my brother had passed away overnight. My world crashed and burned. I grieved obviously, but when that time for grieving was over and everyone else seemed to return to their lives, I just couldn't. I couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't enjoy time spent with my son, my marriage was failing. Life was dark. \n\nI lived this dark life for 2 years. I honestly don't even remember most of that time. It's all a dark blur of events. Sick and tired of living this dark and lonely life I decided one day I was going to do something. I researched several different natural remedies for treating my illness since I had only ever tried pharmaceutical treatments with little luck. I figured it was worth a shot. What was the worst that could happen? \n\nThe first day I tried kratom, I knew I had found something incredible. For the first time in 2 years, I was able to wake up one morning and just start getting ready for work. I didn't have to sit there and mentally challenge and trick myself into getting up and facing the world. I woke up, put a teaspoon of kratom in my coffee and as soon as I was done drinking that cup of coffee I was ready to face the world. My demeaner changed so dramatically that one of my coworkers who knows me pretty well made a comment that morning \"well you're in a good mood!\" How bizarre to feel such a difference on the first day, I was so used to waiting 2-4 weeks for the effects to kick in. \n\nFast forward another year and life is amazing. My job is going great with a new promotion I got recently. It's amazing how much better you do at work when you aren't constantly calling out sick and coming in with a bad attitude every day! My relationship with my son has never been better. My marriage came to an end, but that doesn't even bother me because we both knew it was time to put an end to it. Going through a divorce would've made me bed ridden if I didn't have kratom. I've even been able to lose some weight! Just a teaspoon of powder in my coffee every morning and I'm ready to face the world. I feel happy, energetic, and more social thanks to kratom. \n\nIf it were to become illegal, I would be devastated. I would be forced to go back to prescription medications that never gave me relief from my symptoms the way that kratom has. I'm a hard working, tax paying citizen of this amazing country and I deeply want to believe the DEA is smart enough to realize this \"drug\" is a powerful and wonderful medicine that needs to be further researched, not just thrown on this stupid list and forgotten about! I'm willing to fight for kratom because it has made my life so much better in such a short amount of time. I am kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1750","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah McGrory","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"So far as I have seen this natural substance has helped many individuals in becoming the best they can be.

I understand that the current regulation states that Kratom is NOT to be used for human consumption, but if anecdotal evidence is clearly recorded to not be dangerous, perhaps we need more research to justify the use of the plant. If people can safely medicate with a plant against regulations, can't we consider different regulations and studies to show people should be allowed to consume it?\n\nTruthfully, it will be a blow to freedom to take this plant away from the American public. Adults should have the right to put in their bodies' what they choose, please keep this plant legal. Keeping this plant legal will also prevent the use of even harder drugs like full opioid agonists.\n\nIf an FDA approved pharmaceutical (fentanyl, morphine, oxycontin) is legal and has medically accepted value, then a plant which is not even a full opioid should also have accepted value since it's not as dangerous, and can be proven to be so.\n\nHowever, the anecdotal evidence shows great promise for medically accepted value, so I'm sure it wouldn't be hard for Kratom to also be scientifically proven to be beneficial for the sick.\n\nWe need to not let this go unheard, and the sick should be able to choose which medicine they want to use.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14542","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've recently become aware of the plant known as kratom and it's potential health benefits to hundreds of thousands of suffering people. Shortly thereafter I heard that the DEA was considering making it a Schedule 1 drug. Obviously by definition alone it is illogical to make this a Schedule 1 when so many people have voiced the health benefit they received from it. From the credible sources that I've read and listened to, there is very little that we know about this drug both clinically and socially. What we do know if that an overwhelming amount of people say it helped them to curb their opiate addiction, it has been around for at least 2,000 years, and the people of industries that have some investment in opiate trade of sorts seem to oppose it. It's not hard to connect the dots there and reach for the skepticism that exists. I for one have no experience or vested interested in this plant or in opiates. But I do have an interest and felt level of responsibility in supporting the health of my friends, family, and country. With heroin becoming an increasing epidemic in the area I live, I am extremely concerned and see that this plant may be a strong benefit to many of those individual ls.\n\nPlease do not schedule this plant, but rather push for more clinical research so we can learn of all the benefits and any possible dangers.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18176","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon Brown","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Anything that might be a solution to help end the Herion epidemic shouldn't be put on the schedule 1 DEA list.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18555","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Dirksen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was an RN for 20 years. I am cancer survivor. As great as that is I have been left with residual pain and ptsd.  Years of high doses of fentanyl and morphine became deabilitating for me.  It slowly started ruling my life. I was encouraged to take these meds by my doctors. I followed their recommendations. Very long story short I became exhausted with the scenario. Then Katrina hit New Orleans and I was not able to get my medicine. As we relocated not only was I in pain but the horrid withdrawals were so bad my whole family thought it was going to kill me. I went for help at a hospital as my doctor instructed me. They didn't help me, wouldn't listen and treated me like trash. It was humiliating. I am a cancer survivor!  I am not accustomed to being treated like \" a drug seeker\".  \nI decided to stop all opiates a few years later.  I chose to quit.  I did.  It was hard. The pain continued and I was left with horrid insomnia. I discover Kratom from a trusted friend. I tried it after suffering for a good 6 months. I had doubts about it. I researched. I read everything I could find on it. I read about how it eased anxiety, pain and insomnia. My chemotherapy left me with heart failure. I read that Kratom can help lower high blood pressure. My testimony is this, it helped me sleep for the first time since discontinuing opiates. It made me feel ok again. Didn't knock my socks off but it made getting through the day tolerable.  My whole family and my friends see the life in me again. Sleeping well and being pain free has helped my anxiety and this I believe has brought down my blood pressure! \nMy life would not be worth living if Kratom wasn't available. Knowing a plant is out there that has helped me so much would be horrible if it was taken away. I do NOT want to go back on pain meds.

I don't suffer from unwanted, unnecessary side effects, I'm never cognitively impaired and my quality of life is exponentially better. \n   The only 'negative' thing I can attribute to kratom, is the threat of my own Government making its access restricted or prohibited by scheduling it at some level; making it unavailable as the natural, whole leaf that it is. \n   Judging from my own experiences and those of countless others, I believe isolating a plant's compounds and creating a synthetic drug is rarely as beneficial or effective as consuming it in its natural state. \n   The cycle of testing and approving pharmaceutical drugs, yet not foreseeing many of the severe negative outcomes, has unfortunately proven itself the 'norm' of modern medicine. It's apparent to me that synthetic drugs are contradictory to our Creator's design for healing and wellbeing. Educated and wise self treatment, utilizing what we've been endowed with, is the eternal saga of humankind. \n   By all my deductive reasoning, this 'kratom', (Mitragyna speciosa), leaf appears to have helped me achieve a good physical, mental and spiritual homeostasis. Rather than being trapped in a cycle of endless degradation of my health, M. speciosa has been the catalyst to rebuilding my path to overall wellbeing. \n   In my eyes, this is a truly sacred leaf and it is all of mankind's Divine right to have unfettered access to it. Denial of this right would be a denial of the intelligence, capability and authority of the Creator of All. \n   *Keep kratom legal. Maintain our accessibility.

I am a 65 year old man and veteran with a failed spine surgery and associated problems such as sciatica in both legs, neuropathy and severe lumbar back pain. I have been seeing a pain management physician for well over a decade. After a period of trying neuro-stimulation (tenz unit), and Steroidal injections these methods lost their effectiveness. My board certified pain management physician then prescribed opiate medication i.e. Hydrocodone 10 mg. (5X per day) and Hydromorphone 2 mg (2X per day). These medications initially worked but then lost effectiveness and punished me with pain ad withdrawal discomfort when I tried to cut back. Over time opiates made me unproductive and disinterested in life. This summer I decided to stop taking the opiates so I tapered off of the pills and finally quit. Unfortunately the withdrawal symptoms did not stop. I had terrible pain and the runny nose and pot nasal drip continued for four months. The drainage got into my lungs and I was diagnosed with pneumonia. I felt that I had no drug cravings and did not want to go back on opiates but wanted to stop the watering eyes, runny nose, post nasal drip and resulting cough. I saw my Primary care doctor, an Ear, nose, throat physician, and a pulmonologist, all board certified - and none of them had ever seen anything like this. They all prescribed medications to control the symptoms but could not stop them. There is some thing called PAWS (Post Addiction Withdrawal Syndrome) which has been well documented and usually ends in a 1 month and at most a 3 month period. Mine did not and will not go away. As mentioned, I had been looking at some way to stop the PAWS symptoms e.g. antihistimines, decongestants, Cough suppressants, etc. along with Acupuncture, Tylenol and NSAIDS for pain. Nothing worked very well and I continued to have severe symptoms. No doctor I contacted had the answer to extended PAWS symptoms. Not even low dose Naltrexone treatment worked. I thought I would have to go back on opiates to get rid of the symptoms. Then I began looking at opiate agonists. That is when I discovered Kratom. Kratom has been used by Asians for hundreds of years and is known to kill pain and provide energy. Energy was something I did not experience with opiates. I decided to try Kratom since it is legal in my State and does not have the history of overdose deaths that opiates do. I have found that it is more of a blessing for me as it immediately stopped the PAWS symptoms, relieved the pain in the back and legs and virtually cured existing prostate problems. I am strongly in favor of keeping Kratom legal and for the government and independent labs to study this plant as a viable non-deadly alternative to opiates. I feel the DEA should back off and let this research occur. If the DEA moves forward with banning Kratom, many people in pain will have to begin to use opiates again, myself included. Please let Kratom continue to be legal it is the only real alternative to deadly opiate drugs. By the way, I have been a highly paid and highly productive member of society until fairly recently.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10319","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello all let's support the future kratom I really hope kratom is a legal, because kratom very help we, especially disease and economic problems, I hope the government's decision well, how many people have assisted by kratom \nMuhammad Yunus","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21811","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Muhammad Yunus","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been diagnosed with 2 autoimmune diseases that cause incredible pain.

It does not belong there. It is a very mild stimulant and mild sedative but a very helpful plant, with many uses. We need to conduct clinical trials and studies before making any kind of decision. After years of study, who knows what wonderful things we could find? It could be even more important than what the community believes it to be. However, we will never find out if it becomes a Schedule I drug. We should base all our decisions on hard scientific evidence before making rash decisions. The leaves have been used in South-East Asia for 100's of years. It is used as a mild stimulant, mild sedative, pain killer, and helps ease opiate withdrawal. Many people report that Kratom helps them with arthritis, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and fibromyalgia.\n\nI am Steven Isaac Carroll, I am currently a hard working Sophomore at Weber State University majoring in Botany and Minoring in Chemistry. Throughout my college career I have been taking Kratom regularly and I average between a 3.5-4.0 GPA every semester which demonstrates that Kratom is not affecting my memory, thinking or judgement.  I am 22 years of age. I have used Kratom for 4 years now, starting when I was 18 after I had a surgery to remove an osteocyte that was pinching my nerve cord in my elbow which was causing chronic pain and discomfort. It is an injury I received when playing Lacrosse in High School. The removal of that piece of bone just made the pain and discomfort worse as now the nerve cord in my arm easily slides over where that bone used to be and causes pain, on top of it being constantly strained. Because of this I don't have full movement with my left hand fingers, especially my small finger and a lot of the time my finger feels numb. This constantly causes pain and discomfort and I had an important choice to make after the surgery; take prescription opiates every day with adverse health effects but feel no pain OR find a healthier alternative that will help enough to alleviate at least some degree of the chronic pain and discomfort that I have without the negative health effects. I chose the latter and I am SO happy I did. Kratom has changed my life and the lives of many others for the better. Many veterans, the people who we should treat with the utmost respect use Kratom for various reasons and need it. Kratom does not ruin lives, it saves them. Without Kratom I would have to live with that chronic pain and discomfort daily or I would have to use prescription painkillers, which I do not have any desire to do. \n\nKratom is safe, you cannot OD on it, although there are reports of people dying with Kratom in their system along with other drugs, ultimately Kratom was not the cause of death, to say as much is like saying those people had caffeine in their system so the caffeine must be the cause of death. It is safer than alcohol and tobacco, which are both legal. The worst that can happen with Kratom is to throw up if you take too much, just as you would if you ate too much food for dinner. There are very few negative side effects, I only experience one on occasion and that is nausea. Other than that one negative side effect, everything else is positive. \n\nWays that I benefit from Kratom are the following: pain relief, anti-oxidant, anxiolytic, anti-depressant, weak sedative properties which helps me sleep, and more. While I realize that prescription opiates have their place in medicine, Kratom offers a much milder, safer option for people who do not wish to gamble with the risks that are often inherent in using prescription opiates. According to the CDC 1,000 people are treated for prescription opiate overdoses and abuse every day. Opiates do ruin lives, let there be a healthy alternative, keep Kratom legal. Kratom is known to be useful for recovering opiate addicts to get off of opiates, and stay off of opiates. While I have never been addicted to opiates and am careful of what I put in my body, I personally know recovering addicts that have used Kratom to help them with their addiction, let me tell you, it helps. We are in an opiate epidemic, a serious drug abuse issue in the United States, we need to do something about that. Kratom can help.\n\nIn conclusion, we need to study and regulate the use of the plant, not outright ban it. Banning it will hurt millions of Kratom users including honest hardworking Americans just like me and veterans of our armed forces. Please do not progress the war on drugs, it has been going on long enough and has caused a lot of damage.  Prohibition does not work, we witnessed that in the 1920's with alcohol. Thank you for lifting the ban and allowing a comment period. You have no idea how important that was for you to do. I appreciate the work you guys do, and I hope that someone reads this and it helps them change their mind. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19997","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steven Carroll","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi.

I am a 40 year old male from Missouri. I have my A.S. Degree from Keiser University in Computer Network Engineering and a B.S. in IT Management. I have been using the Kratom supplement for 3 years now. Before Kratom, I was dealing with horrible life crippling anxiety, panic attacks and depression. The only prescribed medications that helped provide relief from the anxiety was Xanax and Klonopin. After using the Xanax and Klonopin I noticed that I was beginning to have issues with my short term memory.  After that I started to research alternatives that might help in place of the Benzodiazepines that have ruined my short term memory.  I found out that Kratom had positive effects with individuals for a multitude of issues including Anxiety. The kratom has helped me so much that I no longer take anymore Benzodiazepines. During these last few years of using Kratom, I have never had any narcotic effects, illness, or feelings of addiction to the Kratom. In conclusion, I still work as an IT Analyst with the same employer since January of 2006. I love to work, go to church and hang out with my wife and friends.

I suffer from depression and anxiety. I have tried almost every pharmaceutical product there is with no success or short lived. I haven't found an anti-depressant that doesn't have horrible side effects so I could never continue to use them and was suffering daily until I found Kratom. I also use it to help with my social anxiety, the prescriptions I was on made me forgetful, uncoordinated, and very careless to the point where I actually got into legal issues from a blackout. I've also used Kratom after a few surgeries for pain instead of taking the opiates that were given to me which I had an addiction to a few years ago. Kratom has saved my life on so many different levels and I know without a question banning this herb would be a huge mistake.

I'm staying optimistic, when the ban was lifted I was shocked and I just pray that I don't ever have to go back on those pills because Kratom is such a better substitute for many of what the pharmacy has. Please listen to the people, this herb has never made me miss work, made me sick, made me steal to pay for it, or made me doing anything out of character.

I feel that this dietary supplement should be left alone and protected as it is more beneficial to so many people, than it is harmful.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1174","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Erin Mader","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please stop filling prisons with innocents people that have addictions and diseases.\n\nKeep Kratom and mmj legal there are no deaths with these medicinal plants.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15407","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Wendy Chang","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There has not been enough research done to schedule this plant. A point i would like to make about kratom.. being addictive..I had been on opiates for Years and then I switched to kratom as I received better pain control and I was tired of the opiates effecting my ability to function. After about 3 months of using lratom I ran out of it and yes I started to have horrible withdrawals symptoms. I thought it was due to stopping the kratom but in fact I was withdrawing from the opiates that were still on the receptors in my brain and the kratom was protecting me from that...It can take up to 2 years for the receptors to be fully free of the opiates.Fast forward to now..2 years later ..if I stop taking kratom I do still experience some discomfort but it is more akin to caffeine or nicotine withdrawal. Just like me im sure there are others who feel like kratom can cause severe withdrawal when in reality it isnt the kratom causing it but the remaining opiates...I also find it not only interesting but telling that the pro banning  kratom comments are almost all anonymous.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22738","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jen Malenfant","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This product greatly improves my quality of life and should never be treated as anything other than an herbal tea that's all it is.but it is a great product and should be left alone for the individual to decide to use it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2852","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Mullins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, my name is Benjamin Webber.

I Have been prescribed both Gabapentin and Lyrica to help manage the pain caused by these two conditions. I took each medication for 6 months and 8 months respectively , with neither one being successful in managing the pain. Alas, through an online message forum about diabetic nerve pain, I learned about Kratom. This plant has not only kept me from experiencing any of the pain associated with Diabetic Neuropathy OR Fibromyalgia, but has also proven invaluable to health overall. My quality of life has improved 10 fold at least, I am able to live like a person my age should, running and playing with my son at the park, playing basketball and the like. These moments are precious to both he and I. Without Kratom, this would not be possible. I implore you to PLEASE keep Kratom available to people like myself, and so many others in my exact position.

Kratom's benefit of pain relief help him get the rest he \nneeds and he is able to go to work at his job, clear minded and do daily what he needs.\n \nAnother with chronic pain, buys kratom because he saves much money over prescription pain medicine.

I had broken my arm years ago and being on prescription pain medicine all I could do \nwas sleep and lay in a recliner or bed for days. Working, driving a car, or even doing everyday chores was not possible. I \ncouldn't think because my brain was in a fog because of the pain medication  It is no wonder so many have chosen kratom so \nthey can still function in life despite their health conditions. Kratom does not have negative side effects and it's \nmore beneficial to use than prescription medicine and the price is more cost effective.  \n\nKratom is a beneficial product, it helps them in more than one way, it saves money, alleviates pain, no negative side effects like\nprescription pain killers, it helps individuals and families, since the bread winners can function well to be able to earn wages \nto support their families.  I ask that you don't make it a class 1 drug.  It is not used as a drug like those who only do drugs to \nget high.  Those I have met, are responsible adults and use it to help in everyday living, functioning as productive individuals \nnot as a drain on society.  \n\n\nI believe more time should be given for public input because this website was difficult and not user friendly at first.

As a result of her disability she has been prescribed many potent painkillers throughout the years and has suffered addiction and general malaise. When I showed her kratom could be a substitute for her painkillers as it has analgesic properties she was very eager to try but she was terrified of opiate withdrawals. Her fear of overdosing on painkillers lead her to try kratom. Within two weeks she went from having to take 135 mg of Oxycontin down to 35 mg. This is a huge reduction that would be very hard for most long term opiate users. Now my mom only uses painkillers when necessary and uses the natural and safe kratom as her go to medicine. She has seen big improvements in her emotional life and physical health. I hope kratom remains in our hands to use. I have seen the affects of kratom on my mom for 5 years and can say that it has helped in ways that pain killers never could.\n\nPlease keep kratom accessible and legal. This wonderful plant deserves to be researched by universities and scheduling it in a prohibitory manner would greatly diminish the possibilities of discovering how this plant affects the brain and body. In the opiate epidemic our country finds itself in, please do not take away the one plant that can wean addicts off narcotics.

I was on Tramadol and Vicodin for the pain related to the vulvadinia which is a chronic pain issue specific to the pelvic floor and vaginal cannel. The Tramadol would work but the amount I was taking took me into an addiction. I wouldnt have enough of it to last the entire month so inevitably I would withdraw one week out of the month. My life revolved around the pills. When do I get a refill, how do I get more, its not working where do I go for vicodine. I couldnt maintain a job because once a month I would be in bed dealing not only with the withdrawal but also the pain both physical and emotional. \nI found kratom because I was sick of being sick. Its a legal alternative to tramdol. I just wanted to stop withdrawing. I wasnt expecting much but what I found was something unanticipated. Not only does it work better then the pain medication to relieve the pain of the vulvadinia, it does not interfere with my life. My depression has lifted and suicide is no longer a question of when, my anxiety doesnt prevent me from meeting new people or going into a store by myself, I dont avoid situations any more, Im not bedridden with inconsolable pain in my female region, Im finally able to where a pair of jeans without sharp spikes going through my reproductive area, I have energy and I am completely focused. I am able to drive, hold conversations, work complex problems, I read and talk without slurring my words and if we met in person you wouldnt know that I had anything in me. While on kratom I found that I havent had a cold in over a year, Im genuinely more happy, more able and ready to cope with situations that arise in life, Im more creative, I have more energy, Im easier to be with, I havent missed a day of work because of the vulvdinia or the withdrawal so my work ethic has shot through the roof. \nYou need to understand that the vast majority of kratom users have real issues that they have tried to address with pharmaceuticals. Chronic issues of pain and mental suffering. These issues will not go away just because you take kratom away from us. For instance depression is chronic and the medication available is a joke and in some cases it is the final bullet. My vulviadinia will still be there if you ban kratom, I cannot not live with that pain, I was so desperate to get that pain to stop that I accepted a treatment where an OBGYN took a needle to the  inner part of my vaginal cannel to inject me with a steroid. I tried every possible option available for it. It didnt work. That will come back, my depression is an everyday fight but kratom allows me to think clearly and you want to take that away?! \nHeres something you probably dont know but you have to have an empty stomach to feel the effects at a recreational level. Meaning after you eat you must wait at least 3-4 hours for the food to empty into your digestive track because you will not feel any effect however mild or extreme. Heroin, cocaine, meth, PCP ext. dont have conditions like that. I havent had a single drink, smoked weed or popped a pill in over 2 years. I do however use kratom everyday.  A month ago I had a ct scan on my digestive and pelvic region and everything is immaculate. \nMy biggest fear with a ban on kratom is&\n 1 I will start using; youre going to leave me no choice. Ill be back on the pain medication. I do not trust antidepressant/anxieties so I will have to suffer that alone. Im an insomniac but I wont take that medication either. \n2. Pharmaceutical companies will get their hands on this and add acetamitiphane to it and call it safe. Or they will disturb the natural element of the plant in some way that the integrity of the PLANT will be ruined. \n3. Im a grown up. Ive taken kratom for 2 years, I know what I need i.e. dosage. I do not want this to go into a prescription because then Ill be back to the same spot as I was with the Tramadol. I will be buying it on the street or other alternatives.  I dont need a doctor to babysit my usage. I know what Im taking it for, I know when enough is enough and I know the dosage level required for me to relieve the pain. The quality of kratom should be regulated but not how or when people can use it. It makes sense to regulate the usage of opiates because there is a high addiction rate with it and a high death toll. If you do honest research you will find kratom does not hold that same risk. Do not put this in the hands of doctors and the government. You will not be saving the people youll add to the existing epidemic and increase incarceration rates.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16941","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jessica ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me in many many ways.

I have had nothing but positive results by using kratom.  My brother is an ex-addict and has been on methadone for years.  Even though he has not used since he's been on methadone, he has had major issues coming off the methadone and is still just as much addicted as ever.  Kratom has given him a lot more freedom regarding this issue.  Where methadone keeps him addicted and lethargic, kratom offers him more energy . After using kratom for about a month, he is able to not use methadone nor kratom for the whole day.  We can both tell that he is much more clear minded not being on methadone.  He can work and go to school.  Methadone made it difficult for him to do these things; it made it difficult for him to even plan.  I do not know exactly why kratom is going to be banned.  It is related to the coffee plant, its benefits are high and numerous, and it's less dangerous than cigarettes and alcohol.  Any death ever associated with kratom has had other drugs in their system.  I would much rather see people on kratom than methadone or any other drugs, obviously.  I hope that the people's voices get heard!  This plant is a God-sent, saving people from addictions, pains, and even death (in the long run).  I will keep this short and sweet.

I am a sales associate at Smokers Haven Inc. In New Hampshire. I came across kratom when I started working there and to be honest I was skeptical at first, but as time went on more and more customers came into my store specifically for this product. They tell me their amazing stories about their success with overcoming addiction using kratom. I've heard stories of people with dibilitating medical conditions and they turn to kratom for support. I am now one of those consumers. I did my research and headed the reviews and I can personally say kratom HAS HELPED ME. I suffer from depression and anxiety. Most days it's hard to leave my bed. I have been working at Smokers Haven for almost a year now taking it just about every day I work. It tremendously helps with my energy and my mood! You have to be able to stay positive at my job and with kratom I can do that easier. Not to mention the lack of side effects I have experienced since taking kratom. I want you to realize that people need this product and if your intentions are to continue to flood the only world we havd with heroine and dangerous prescription drugs so major pharmaceutical companies can make their money, then continue to do what you are doing. I hope you'll listen to our plea. I sincerely hope you'll take this all just as seriously as we do.

Aside from how little he was able to function while taking his prescribed medicine it was also highly addictive. \nA guy he served with introduced him to kratom when he heard about how much we were struggling. We honestly didn't expect kratom to be the godsend it was. My husband stopped taking prescription pain pills & anti-anxiety medication about 3 years ago & has never been better. Kratom alleviates the pain & anxiety enough to be helpful while still leaving him mentally alert & fully functional.

He did not start taking kratom to try & \"get high\". His old medication did that just fine. He started taking kratom so he could get his quality of life back. Kratom did that for him. Kratom helped give me my husband back & our kids their dad back. \nJust from veterans alone I know so many have benefited from kratom.

It did help, and it didn't impress me as a drug.  It is on par with many other botanical herbs as a natural alleviator of problems not severe enough to be covered by insurances or requiring a doctor.  Such as ginger for indigestion, or valerain for insomnia.  I understand that you are losing your persecuting marijuana business to medical marijuana and legal marijuana.  Your Kratom ideas reek of desperation for business and profit, first by outlawing and needlessly policing yet another useful plant, and second forcing people to use pharmaceutical monopolies products, or to suffer.  I do not believe Kratom should be regulated at all.  It is just another herbal folk remedy with centuries of use, and no history of harm.  That opioid users will accept it in lieu of opioids thereby saving thousands from overdose deaths should be acknowledged for the obvious good that it is.  Taking Kratom away from them and easing some of them into an early  grave is the crime, not the Kratom.  The idea of prohibition for profit that fuels your agency and its predecessors comes from a dark period in our history, similar to slavery, and should not be encouraged.

Being physically active is a key element of my life, but unfortunately injuries do occur. I've injured my knee and foot and after each injury, I worked through the rehabilitation process, and continue to do all the things I can to strengthen my body to avoid reaggravating them. Even with all that, there are some injuries which cause ongoing pain and discomfort.  OTC pain products are supposed to manage this type of discomfort, but they don't work for every one, including me. I've found that regular use of OTC pain products such as ibuprofen and other NSAID's all cause me stomach pain, issues with my GI tract, and other side effects. Acetaminophen is very hard on the liver and I wouldn't consider it for regular use.\n\nSo I researched the internet and learned about kratom. I found an on-line supplier and tried it for the first time several years ago. Kratom addressed my discomfort without upsetting my stomach. I've been using it as needed for several years without any signs of side effects. I've always gone to my doctor for an annual physical and my results have been unaffected (my physical health is excellent) which I consider a reasonable indicator that kratom is not causing unforeseen health issues. \n\nKratom doesn't eliminate the need for opiate pain medication for severe pain. I recently cracked a rib and was prescribed painkillers that I used for a few days. So I don't see kratom as a magic bullet for all situations, but for me kratom is perfect for the level of discomfort in my knee and foot (and occasionally back pain from just getting older). I use it in concert with other supplements (such as curcuminoids, omega-3 & -6, and hyaluronic acid) and it has allowed me to stay active and enjoy the benefits I get from physical activity. \n\nFor me, here are the main keys to successful use of kratom:\n1. I only use the amount necessary for the discomfort I am experiencing.\n2. I only purchase it from one online supplier that I've found to be reputable and the product consistent. I'm not saying there is only one reputable supplier, I'm sure there are several, but I've built up a level of trust with one in particular.\n3. I put it into capsules to make it easy to tailor and control my dosage. \n\nSo, to summarize, kratom has been uniquely effective for my needs. \n\nHere are a few comments about kratom, outside of how effective I've found it for my needs.\n\n1. I personally don't think kratom should be sold in \"head shops\", convenience stores, or gas stations. The sale of kratom in shiny packaging isn't proper. Kratom is a useful tool when used responsibly, not something to just try on a whim while getting gas. I know there is a huge trend in marketing \"miracle\" supplements in this manner, but I wouldn't have a problem if this trend didn't extend to kratom.\n\n2. I think it is reasonable to put an age restriction on the sale of kratom as long as it won't eliminate on-line suppliers (my prefered method of purchasing it)  and can be enforced in a manner that will not be overly burdensome to the supplier or the consumer. For example, I would have no problem providing proof of age to an on-line supplier via drivers license (or something like that) in order to establish an account and do business with them. \n\n3. I suspect the reported issues that involve kratom increased when it started showing up in shiny packages at \"head shops\", convenience stores, and gas stations. There is a possibility the careless actions of uninformed people with too easy access to a plant with psychoactive qualities is on the verge of dramatically affecting the lives of the people that have used kratom responsibly for years. That would be very unfortunate and should be ruled.\n\n4. I would find it outrageous if action is taken to temporarily or permanently schedule kratom such that the sale or possession carried prison sentences. What in the world are we doing filling our prisons in this manner? It has to stop because it is ruining lives and families. There are chemical compounds that do warrant scheduling or restrictions because they are damaging entire communities (methamphetamine, etc). I have yet to read any statistic or study that shows kratom is even capable of causing anything approaching significant societal damage. It doesn't suppress the respiratory system, it doesn't cause people to stay awake for days, it isn't used intravenously so the spread of disease isn't a factor, it doesn't impair judgement or reaction times (or if it does it can't be any worse than alcohol and then age restrictions come into play)... kratom just isn't that powerful. \n\n5. And finally, it does have unique medical uses. I can attest to that. \n\nThank you for allowing me to comment on this issue.  \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0103","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe this plant should be studied for it's obvious medicinal values.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18162","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps me with my carpal tunnel!

I for one appreciate you allowing the public to speak on this topic before making a final decision. I am a 37 year old mother of 2 who has been using kratom since 2009. In 2008, I was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, a painful auto-immune disease that affects the joints in my hips, neck and back. My father so wonderfully bestowed this condition upon me through his DNA (he was diagnosed when I was 17 years old). For the first year of my diagnosis, I was taking 3-4 vicodin a day just to try to manage the constant pain. The addictive nature of this medication started to get a hold of me, and I wanted off of painkillers right away. So I started doing research and heard about kratom. I was extremely nervous to try it, but I was willing to do anything to not have to take narcotics. Kratom changed my life and probably saved it as well. I have been taking the same dosage of Kratom since I first started it...I have never had to increase dosage due to tolerance build up. I have never been \"high\" on kratom. It provides me better pain relief than man-made narcotics, just without the \"high\", \"groggy feeling\" or addiction. While I am sure there are some idiots who try to take large amounts of kratom to get some sort of high, I personally cannot fathom how that can even happen. But again you will have those same idiots take obscene amounts of Tylenol to try and get high off of that as well. Please do not let the actions of a few affect the millions of us who use kratom in a responsible manner for legitimate reasons.

However, because of his chronic ailments he had to leave the force. While kraton is not a cure-all, it is able to help my cousin be a little less pain free. Why take that away from him when substances like tobacco or alcohol are perfectly legal and yet perfectly deadly?\n\nI appreciate the time taken to read my comment. \n\nSincerely, \nViolet Reed","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2196","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Violet Reed","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to request that kratom stays legal and not put on the banned substance list.

I can not speak for other vendors but to try to make kratom a schedule 1 substance is absurd. Just to use as an example/comparison, caffeine is \"a natural occuring chemical\" in many items but is not scheduled. There are many calls and deaths from caffeine and there is still no confirmed deaths from pure kratom in the thousands of years this plant has been around. The only reason kratom has been getting negative reviews is because of those people whom like to abuse everything like alcohol, prescription drugs, etc. Kratom is a very good supplement that helps with many different situations. If anything is to be done, kratom should stay a dietary supplement and there should be regulations like age purchasing limit, etc. Kratom is NOT A DRUG.

As a 56 y/o male suffering from an autoimmune disease, as well as the side effects of immunosuppressants to treat it, and a sleep disorder, kratom has made it possible to function on a daily basis without adverse reactions. It provides pain relief, as well as energy and focus, without impairment or feeling wired or jittery. Many others also benefit from this herb, and having it out of reach would cause all who responsibly use it to lose the ability to maintain a healthy, pleasant and active lifestyle. I fully understand that there is still some to learn about the alkaloids and their properties, banning it would hinder any further research to something that could be a much safer alternative to pharmaceuticals on the market. While in my experience I would find it difficult to believe that it could cause harm even in long-term use, and I feel that it was not the main culprit in cases where it was cited as being present during adverse reactions, and only a cohort to other much more dangerous substances. Any substance, OTC or prescribed drug, even food can be abused if used in a reckless or overabundant way. Pray on has gained an unjust reputation based on a relatively small number of cases and even then not positively substantiated as having caused any damage, but only being present in someone who suffered from the abuse of other known dangerous substances.

You are asking commenters to be scientific and to provide adequately sourced information [cf. item #10 on \"Tips for Submitting Effective Comments\"] so that the DEA can make a substantive and intelligently reasoned determination as to whether or not kratom is a genuine threat to public safety and thus worthy of creating a regulation that could, theoretically, put thousands of non-violent users of kratom in a Federal prison and cost taxpayers billions of dollars.  \n\nBut has the DEA done due diligence in making sure that kratom is significantly dangerous enough to warrant such heavy handed action?  No, of course not.  They put kratom on Schedule 1 by executive fiat, without any input from the public whatsoever last August, and more importantly, without any scientific testing to buttress such an extreme and potentially costly action.\n\nThus we can reasonably determine that the placing of kratom on Schedule 1 is most likely politically motivated, coming as it did right before Congress was getting ready to determine budget allocations for the DEA.  Also, it is worth noting that several states had initiatives on the ballot that would make cannabis either legal for recreational use, or for medical use, and it is likely that the DEA knew these would pass and was thus afraid that their budget allocations for 2017 would be decreased significantly.\n\nHere I could launch into a very long and sad story about what a complete and utter failure the \"War on Drugs\" that the DEA has inflicted on the American public has been over the last 40 years of my lifetime.  Hundreds of thousands of lives rendered impotent or severely damaged, virtual centuries of incarceration cumulatively, at a cost to the taxpayer which has offered extremely little return on the public good.  And for what?  To prevent citizens from using a plant that God has provided, and which, after years of testing, has been determined to be enormously useful for many sufferers of various ailments as an effective and inexpensive medicine, and which will most likely be legal within the entire U.S. within a generation.\n\nSo let us begin by suggesting that the motivation for making kratom a new \"boogeyman\" for the DEA is entirely political, and once again, they are making a grievous error as they did with cannabis.  How can any other conclusion be drawn when it was only sustained public outrage at the DEA's imperious and non-scientically rigorous scheduling of kratom as a Schedule 1 \"drug\" that forced them to open up this comment period?  Institutional power in the swamp known as Washington, D.C. is almost entirely determined by how much money said institution receives from the taxpayers, and if those budgets don't go up every year, that institution is in danger of eventually being eradicated altogether.  \n\nThat the DEA and the FDA are working \"hand in glove\" on this destructive policy making is shameful.  They are willing to sacrifice even more lives on the altar of their institutional survival, and to sustain their ridiculous and nonsensical \"War on Drugs\" ad inifintum, all over a plant that, like cannabis, is safe, non addictive, cost effective, and medically useful.  They have not learned from their mistakes, and so I daresay the loss of public trust they will suffer if they continue in such a foolhardy manner will actually bring about the very thing they fear the most: institutional fecklessness.\n\nII.\n\n (continued on attachment)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9968","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"n/a","postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gregory Hohnholt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I shot heroine for 4 years into my arms after smoking opana and snorting percocette for a year or two before that.

I started using kratom in July of 2016, and it has changed my life.  I discovered kratom while searching online for herbal remedies to help with insomnia and depression.  After reading countless posts from people who have benefited from kratom, I decided to try it myself.  The effects were subtle, but turned out to be just what I needed.  I was finally able to sleep normally, which resulted in having more energy during the day.  Kratom also helped to alleviate my depression.  Soon thereafter, I was able to find employment, move out of my father's basement, and begin my own life.  Without kratom, none of that would have happened.  I would still be living at home, doing nothing with my life, with no hope for a better future.  From my own experience, I know that kratom should not be considered a dangerous substance.  The effects are mild, and do not produce any sort of \"high\" that could lead to abuse.  Making kratom a controlled substance would not have any benefit, and would only hurt all the people that use it to help make their lives better.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21036","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Fye","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It's just a plant!!!

I also have had a lifelong battle with treatment resistant depression and anxiety.  \nOver the years, I have tried all the Big Pharma options as well as therapy to help my disorders.  Antidepressants didn't work at all for me and the side effects were intolerable. Opiate pain medication, while effective short-term, for pain, also brought me eventual intolerable side effects including severe constipation, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction and dependence.  Six months ago, desperate for anything different and safe to relieve my symptoms, a chronic pain site recommended I try Kratom.  it was a godsend for me.   Allowed me to easily transition off most of my Rx medication, including opioids.  Its pain relief was on par with most mild to medium strength opioids yet without all the negatives that \ncome with using them, including NO respiratory depression. Surprisingly, my anxiety and depression as well as constipation problem improved as well with almost no side effects.  I use a moderate to low dose daily of a slow strain and have never felt better.  I DO NOT get any euphoria or craving to use more than necessary with Kratom which I appreciate immensely.  My quality of life is much improved and I am able to be more productive during the day now.  I cannot emphasize enough how much a scheduling or banning of this substance ( Kratom),  would adversely affect my health.  Frankly, I would be forced back on dangerous Rx medications with problematic side effects.\nIn conclusion, I ask that you DO NOT schedule Kratom as a schedule 1 controlled substance as it would directly impact my health.  I do not partake in anything illegal and of course, would be forced to stop using this plant that has helped me in so many ways. It would also force be back to using dangerous pharmaceuticals for my conditions that have a side effect history of causing me longterm problems, and thwart further research into Kratom's many benefits.  I would, however,  support some regulation to assure that the consumer gets exactly what they are promised by Kratom vendors and of course, to keep unscrupulous profiteers away from marketing this herbal supplement in a deceitful way to attract young people and the marketing of it wrongfully in quick-stop convenience stores and worse, 'head' shops.  I have extensively researched vendors and have found trustworthy homeopathic/herbal sources but I realize there are some out there that are just in it to make a buck and may prey on niave people. \nI hope my comments help you to make a fair and sensible decision going forward.  I know that I am one of millions that have benefited from this herbal supplement and ask that you do the right thing by keeping it legal for those that truly need it for quality of life going forward.  In the end, isn't that what its all really about?\nThanks so much for your understanding...","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12414","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Don't place Kratom as a schedule 1 Drug.

It's not used recreationally  (you CANNOT get 'high' on it) and these are many people who count on it for pain relief and to keep them off of heroine. You guys want to help people?

First of I want to say thank you very much for giving us the people a chance to comment on Kratom, and lifting the emergency ban.\n   I have be a using kratom as a supplement to enhance my health for 10 years.  It is like my coffee in the morning,    \nit raises my immune system, helps me focus clearly, gives me energy and help reduce any pain that I might be in from martial arts and working out.  My body heals 2 times faster that a body without Kratom.\n  To say that this plant is like heroin is completely false.  I have a 20 hr job as a robot programmer, I am a martial artist and compete in mixed martial arts events, have three children, a beautiful wife that I love dearly.  Kratom has helped my quit drinking and smoking cigarettes.  I have been sober for 4 years now because of Kratom.  I am a christian and go to church every sunday.  Heroin addicts don't do those things,  Heroin takes peoples lives, both killing people, and killing peoples live styles and breaking apart families.  Kratom has made my life better by leaps and bounds.  When I was in college I would take Kratom and do my homework because it helps me focus and think better, melting away and stesses that I may have had.  Heroin makes you fall asleep and drool on yourself.\nIn 10 years that I have taken Kratom I haven't been sick!  I look 10 years younger.  Kratom is life, and gives life.   Please keep this plant from God legal!  I beg of you!   There is nothing like it in the world and God put it here to help the human race to heal themselves,  take pain away, to help think clearly, to take away stress, to kill diseases, and to help us love better.  Kratom is the cure for the Heroin and Opioid pill epidemic.  If we have kratom treatment centers we could fix the problem in one year I promise you this because Kratom takes away the withdrawals completely 100 % allowing the Heroin addict to function and not get sick so they can live their daily lives and focus on making their lives better. Please Please keep kratom a plant of God legal.  3 million people will love you forever for it!! \n\nSincerely ,\n\nMichael Niemojuski\nFather, Husband, Athlete,  Productive Citizen of the United States","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1943","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Niemojuski","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, \n\nMy is Nicole.  I am a 38 year old single mommy to a 9 year old sweet, \"gifted\", amazing little girl named Lily.  She is my reason for waking up every day and continuing to do everything in my power to continue my journey towards a happy, sober, productive member of society.  Her biological father has never laid eyes on her, by his choice.  I have severe alcoholism and other addictions (mostly in the form of narcotic pharmaceuticals) on both sides of my family.  Both sets of grandparents, both parents, most of my aunts and uncles, and now my generation including myself and many cousins have discovered, we too, suffer from the disease.  On top of the alcoholism and addiction, many of us suffer from anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorders.  We tend to use the alcohol and pills to self medicated the mental health issues.\n\nUnfortunately, my disease was waiting for me right after giving birth to my daughter.  Addiction doesn't care if you have a baby or the fact that you love that child more than life itself.  It's also progressive and was getting worse by the day.  For the first 4 years of her life, I was a very sick woman.  I knew I needed help, and started going to AA meetings.  That was about the time I traded in the alcohol for opiates, not knowing the hell that would lie ahead with an opiate addiction.  I tried getting sober and clean for years.  I had numerous near-death experiences, almost lost custody of my daughter, was arrested a couple times, couldn't hold a job for any length of time, jumped out of a moving car and broke my face, started having grand Mal seizures,  had to ware up to a drink to stop the shakes, the list goes on and on.  I was a SEVERE case.\n\nI wanted more than anything to be sober, but I just couldn't get it.  I was going to meetings and a 6 week rehab.  There's nothing worse than being stuck with a sick brain that you have no control over the obsessive thoughts.  It's a livingood hell.  FINALLY, I made the best decision of my life\nand went to a year long, \"therapeutic community\" for addicted women and was able to learn skills tools to live \"life on life's terms\".  When I got out, the anxiety and depression were still there (despite being prescribed to every anti-depressant known to man since I was 15-nothing worked) and that old behavior of wanting to \"be normal\" was always there.  I started going to my local herbal shop where I discovered Kratom.  Kratom has not only helped with my depression, anxiety, fatigue, obsession for opiates (I was shooting heroin in the end), it has given me my life back and my daughter the mommy she deserves.\n\nIf the DEA schedules a harmless plant, I know for a fact that SO many recovering addicts are going to relapse and end up in EXTREMELY dangerous, deadly situations.  This plant is NOTHING like the drugs you are trying to classify it with (except Marijuana).  It is a VERY mild mood boost that takes away addictive thoughts.  I was on suboxone at one point too, to get off the opiates and that crap took me down worse than the opiates itself.  There is NO way to od on kratom.  If kids are going to the hospital od-ing blaming it on kratom, they are lying and don't want to admit they took something stronger.  If you take more than a teaspoon or so, you get nauseous immediately.  It is not meant to get \"high\" off of, nor can you get \"high\" on it.  Trust ME.  I have had problems with every REAL drug known to man, and kratom isn't even close.  I hold down a full time job as the manager of a restaurant, I've never missed a day of work in a year, and I'm an active and awesome mommy to my little girl.  Kratom gave me life back.  PLEASE don't take it away again.  I've worked too hard to get to where I'm at.\n\nThank you for giving us the opportunity to hear our stories.  I hope you make the right decision.  This affects A LOT of decent, hardworking people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7729","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nicole Kidd","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"10 years ago, I hurt my shoulder in an industrial accident.

Kratom has many uses, including helping treat panic attacks without strong medications, having an anti-depressant effect without the problems associated with common antidepressants, and helping with the nausea, vomiting and other symptoms encountered during opiate or other narcotic withdrawal.\n\nOpiate and narcotic addicts can and do use Kratom to assist with many symptoms when detoxifying from an addiction. These drugs are notoriously difficult to stop taking and anything that can help an addict kick their habit could be nothing but good.  Given the damage that opiate addictions cause to both individuals and the general public, the scheduling of Kratom would seem to actually be against the public interest.\n\nKratom has other benefits as well.  Some people find it very useful in controlling panic disorders.  Some find it effective enough that they are no longer required to take the dangerous benzodiazapenes, which the CDC has determined to be a substance of abuse, especially when combined with opiates or narcotics (please see preceding paragraph).  Reducing the use of these powerful drugs in the general population will lead to reduced exposure and reliance on these drugs.  Scheduling Kratom would be against this public interest.\n\nMany people find that Kratom increases their pain tolerance, many times to the point where other, more powerful medications become less needed, or even unnecessary.  Reducing reliance on powerful pain relievers, including narcotics and opiates, would seem to be strongly in the public interest.  Scheduling Kratom would prevent this reduction and therefore not be in the public interest.\n\nPersonally knowing sufferers of both severe chronic pain and a panic disorders, the new CDC guidelines on benzodiazapenes has forced them to make a choice between proper treatment for their pain and proper treatment for their panic disorders.  As a result, they must go untreated for one or the other, making their futures uncertain.  Knowing that a herbal supplement is available to them, should they wish to take advantage of it, which might well help them contain their panic disorders and possibly help them reduce their levels of pain, I would be very disappointed that they would not have Kratom available should they wish to use it.  In fact, I think they should be taking advantage of it now.  For this reason I would like Kratom to remain available to my friends should they desire to make use of it.  Scheduling Kratom is not in my friends' interest.\n\nWe as a nation have learned from the War On Drugs that prohibition doesn't work to control consumption and has many severe unintended consequences.  Kratom is not a dangerous drug of abuse that requires scheduling, in fact it has a number of uses that make it a valuable supplement to have available on the open market.\n\nDue to all these reasons, I believe that scheduling Kratom is not only unnecessary, but would be actively against the public interest.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2584","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ray Otwell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I like many others have struggles with pain medications for many years, medications that where perscirbed by a doctor. One day i had a problem with my insurance and i couldnt get my perscription anymore. I felt like a deadman walking. I never in a million years thought that i would have withdrawal symptons from a medication perscribed to me by a doctor, the same doctor that assured me that this was a miracle medication(hydrocodone) and that as long as i followed his directions i would be pain free and happy.I was wrong and niaeve.When i wasnt able to get my perscription filled I needed something for the pain and to fill the void left by the perscription pain killers. I truly felt like an addict with only one thing on my mind. I turned to heroin, which gave me the SAME EXACT feeling that the perscription pain killers did. That didnt last long becasue i couldnt tolerate being someone who took heroin on a daily basis regardless if it helped me with my pain or not. I decided to get off and started buying Suboxone off the streets. Like the substances that came before the Suboxone had me hooked within weeks. Again, the cycle repeated itself. I was out of options and was ready to give up and die. One day i was doing research and came across kratom. I didnt believe that something natural and herbal could releive me of my pain, but i was wrong. I used kratom to get off the vicious Suboxone i was taking everyday and with in a week i was feeling cleaner and sharper, like my old self. And i wasnt in pain. Kratom doesnt give me any of the side effects that i was used to with the pain medications. I truly felt normal again. Kratom truly saved my life and many others like me. I only wish i would have found it sooner. I lost precious time because of the medications perscribed to me by a doctor, with out kratom i dont know where i would be.PLEASE hear me when i say Kratom helped me get my life back and that after using i have yet to see any negative effects.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18513","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"yuriy grabovenko","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 25-year-old Caseworker. I strongly oppose the DEA's attempts to place the active compounds in kratom, Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, into Schedule I. \n\nWithout a serious scientific investigation the DEA intends to subject anyone caught with kratom to long prison terms and mandatory sentencing. This DEA action threatens to halt all scientific investigations into kratoms medicinal benefits in part because it will become illegal to import the kratom needed for research purposes. \n\nI started using kratom over a year ago. At the time, I was at a Mayo Clinic hoping to get answers to the painful neuropathy I had endured for 6 years. They didn't have any suggestions that I had not tried already. For  6 years my doctors had given me SSRIs, dopamine agonists, anti-convulsants. The fact that none of these medicines helped but rather gave me horrible side effects made life worse. There were two times in those six years in which I seriously considered suicide. Neuropathy almost took my college scholarship as well as my job due to the pain and inability to walk for more than a few minutes. Through online chronic pain support groups, I heard about kratom. The first time I tried kratom, it worked. I did not feel intoxicated or loopy, no hallucinations or euphoria. It simply took away my pain. \n\nBecause of kratom, I can work full-time helping people with disabilties. I can exercise and spend time with my family. I can give back to my community because of this wonderful herb. While my husband drinks coffee to start his day, I take some kratom on the days that try to beat me down and find that I get to feel normal again. Kratom should remain legal, accessible, and available because I cannot be a useful member of society without it. There are many similar to me. If banned, many of us would be forced to leave our jobs, apply for disability, become \"criminals\" even though we are law-abiding citizens who seek a life that gives us occasional relief from our horrendous medical conditions. \n\nKratom and its active compounds must be kept legal and available for the purposes of research and utilization as an herb.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4999","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Good Morning,\n\nI have been taking kratom for approximately six months.

Especially during the worst opioid crisis our country has ever seen.

It should be regulated the same as Kava Kava, Valerian root, or St. Johns Wort.\n\nThank you for opening the comment period and hearing your fellow Americans.

I am opposed to the DEA putting Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. I found out about Kratom from a friend I met in a Chronic pain group on line...I've been drinking Kratom for the past 10 months on a daily basis for relief from degenerative disc disease and chronic arthritis. I have had 4 back surgeries including 2 cervical fusions and the bottom 4 discs of my lumbar spine are completely disintegrated. I had my first surgery almost 20 years ago at age 27and was put on lethal doses of prescription pain medication by a DOCTOR! Over the years my body became addicted to the medication and I started to suffer from depression and anxiety and was placed on benzos and antidepressants. I was not able to function, I was dozing off and even had suppressed breathing at times. Kratom DOES NOT affect or suppress an individuals breathing!! I have had TWO hernia surgeries due to chronic constipation. The opiates completely messed up my bowels. I can proudlysay that I have not taken any of those medications in 10 months and it's because of being able to drink Kratom to help my pain and my mood. My life had become unmanageable and I was severely depressed and in pain all the time. Now I am an active member of society. My son has told me that he is SO grateful that I found Kratom and that I have been a totally different parent since I stopped taking the medications. He is literally frightened about what might happen if I have to go back to opiates!! The idea that the DEA is trying to take away a PLANT... that is helping people stay off of these medications and actually have a quality of life is ludicrous. I personally can't imagine not being able to drink kratom for my symptoms and quite honestly I'm terrified of ever going back to the medications. We're in a terrible epidemic of opiate abuse and opioid overdoses and this is a plant that can help people stay away from those medications and manage their pain and their symptoms naturally. Kratom should be ENCOURAGED, not prohibited. \n\nOverdose deaths involving prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999, and so have sales of these prescription drugs. From 1999 to 2014, more than 165,000 people have died in the U.S. from overdoses related to prescription opioids. Opioid prescribing continues to fuel the epidemic. Today, at least half of all U.S. opioid overdose deaths involve a prescription opioid. In 2014, more than 14,000 people died from overdoses involving prescription opioids. I received this information directly from the CDC website.\n\nThere have been articles written in Forbes Magazine, The Washington Post and The Huffington Post that give very accurate information and also share stories of many who are getting relief by drinking Kratom. There are veterans, grandparents, parents, seniors, that are getting relief from this plant. The majority of people drinking Kratom are responsible adults whom Kratom is helping with pain and other conditions. \n\nI don't see people standing up for their rights to use Heroin, LSD or bath salts. These are well educated, intelligent people who are taking the time to fight for this plant to remain legal. If we were drug users, I don't think we could write such eloquent emails and make phone calls if we were \"high\" or \"drugged up!!!\"\n\nIn summation...we are in the midst of the WORST opiod epidemic in HISTORY!!! The DEA is saying that they had 15 related Kratom deaths and each and every one of those deaths also had a different drug along with it. There are people dying every 20 minutes from opiate overdoses and yet they would rather take this plant away from us and have people's lives on their hands? Look at the amount of deaths from energy drinks...yet they are legal. \nI ask that you please realize that banning this plant will cause people to go back to the drugs, alcohol and medications sadly, there will be LIVES LOST!!! I wasn't living anymore when I was addicted to the medication, I finally have my life back...PLEASE don't take it away?\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely, \nDiana Marquez","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2684","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Diana Marquez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello. My name is Adrian Wood. I would like to respectfully ask on behalf of not just myself, but the whole Kratom using community to reconsider banning Kratom. I know it scares a lot of people and there is some hype about it lately. But there is a huge community of responsible adults who use Kratom responsibly. For many of us, like myself, use it to stay off hard drugs and relive pain and stress. I've known people who successfully use it to relieve horrible withdrawal symptoms when they had nowhere else to turn. It's saved many people from killing themselves with hard drugs and keeps them off of it. It truly is helping people and saving lives. I would understand an age restriction. I would even find it reasonable. Some people are irresponsible and give it a bad reputation, most being younger people. Please understand this is not the behavior we condone, but more so the responsible use of a mild herb that helps a huge variety of people. Please understand the risk that comes with taking this away from people. It could create a very unnecessary black market for one more thing. Kratom doesn't deserve the bad reputation it's been getting lately and I hope it stays safe and legal. I hope you consider our wellbeing and choices for such. Many of us are willing to work for safe Kratom handling and usage, and that it doesn't have to be scary or banned for that to happen.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15586","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adrian Wood","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

The evidence the DEA has used to support this ban as being a public health emergency is largely overblown and in some cases outright propaganda. This substance has helped numerous people overcome addictions to much more serious opiate drugs and has little if any side effects both in medically reported literature and from thousands of anecdotally reported user experiences. Banning this substance is going to create the very public health hazard that the DEA is trying to avoid and incorrectly stating kratom is causing. Overdoses on opiate drugs will spike and many people who have successfully quit opiate drugs using kratom will return to them causing a worsening of the very real public health crisis that exists now regarding opiate drugs. Those deaths will be on the hands of the government and the DEA if they do outright reschedule and ban this substance based on fear and propaganda. The American public deserves the right to not only be heard on this matter but also the right to choose to use this harmless plant if they personally decide to. The DEA should not only reconsider it's scheduling as it has done once already due to public outcry, they should hold it off indefinitely until such time as multi year based scientific studies are conducted on the uses of kratom in the help of alleviating or replacing opiate addiction such as ongoing research is already studying.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14810","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Will Frascone","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Erik.

I have been using the plant on and off for 4 years, and it has yet to cause me any trouble. I am opposed to the scheduling of kratom, and its active alkaloids. \n\nI use kratom primarily during the spring to help with allergies, and the associated symptoms caused by them. I'll use it regularly for about a month or so, during which symptoms will be drastically reduced, and then stop. I do not crave the plant, or wish to continue once I no longer need it, but it does help me get through work and household tasks on those allergy ridden spring day. It works far better than any OTC remedy I have tried, and it would be rash to ban it without a full review of the plant, and its benefits.\n\nPlease take my opinion into consideration while considering the can on kratom. It not only represents me, but thousands of Americans who sit silently, other unaware that their government is taking away their right to consume a mildly pain relieving plant, or concerned they will end up on some sort of list for making a comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15689","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amanda Hadel","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am an Emergency Physician at a leading health care institute. I have been practicing EM for 32 years and have witnessed the devastation of opiate addiction. I have researched the available literature on Kratom and have read hundreds of testimonials of people who have benefited from this herbal supplement. I have also reviewed the literature concerning dangers and deaths that may have involved Kratom.  Most cited complications involve multi drug use or adulterated products without any clear causation that Kratom alone caused morbidity or mortality. \nOn a personal note, I have a family member who has been devastating by opioid addiction, multiple inpatient addiction programs, suboxone, near fatal overdoses. She has been clean for 3 years, makes Kratom tea for use 2 times per day without any high, somnolence or withdrawal. She does not want the misery of relapsing with opioids and does not want the side effects and complication of suboxone or methadone.\nAs a medical professional, I find it difficult to understand the push to criminalize this herbal supplement that has shown benefit to so many. I strongly believe that if this supplement is banned, there will be an increase in opiate related deaths.\nIf there is to be regulation, it should be to insure Kratom sellers document purity, content, lack of adulterants of an herbal product, not criminalizing it.\nThere should be ongoing research and trials so that informed decisions can be made\n\nThank you\nThomas D Meloy MD\nMayo Clinic 200 1st St SW, Rochester, MN 55905\nMeloy.thomas@mayo.edu","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5641","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thomas Meloy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm writing this to urge you to not ban kratom.

In the few years we've taken it neither of us have had any type of complications or issues- is basically like a strong cup of coffee, without the jitters. \nWe both work full-time- he's a supervisor at an oil company & I'm a trainer at a credit union. Taking kratom has in no way caused any issues regarding our professional or home life. \nAs well as kratom we also usually take St Johns Wort, a B complex vitamin, & Valerian Root at night. It makes no sense to ban kratom when so many people have had great results using it & there have been zero deaths caused by kratom alone. 5 Hour Energy & other energy drinks are more threatening than kratom! \nI believe most kratom users would be fine with some regulation to ensure quality & who it gets to. We would suggest an age requirement of either 18+ or 21+. Considering cigarettes kill millions & are available to anyone at age 18 would lead me to believe 18 would be a reasonable age requirement. \nIt is ludicrous that you're considering banning kratom when alcohol & cigarettes are legal. Keatom does NOT cause respiratory depression, it is not an opiate, it has never caused organ.failure- there is no logical reason to ban it or require a prescription for it. If other adults have the right to smoke/drink we should certainly have the right to drink a tea made from something safe & natural! \n\nThank you, \nHeather","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4787","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Heather Patrick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I personally know several people who have been able to wean themselves off of addictive pain killers using kratom, which is not addictive.

That is extremely frightening to me and causes great anxiety to even consider. I also suffer from depression and the combination of living with depression and pain is not something I ever want to go through again.

I was injured in a work accident and was given prescription pain killers before and after surgery, a process which took over a year. In that length of time I became addicted to the pain killers I was given, even taking them as prescribed.  \n\nSince finding Kratom I've refused to take pain killers because Kratom is a clearly better alternative for me. I don't experience and mind altering affects, I don't depend on it the way I depended on opiates and mostly, it improves my quality of life.\n\nI've also shared Kratom with my girlfriend, whom uses it for anxiety. Some days she is unable to get out of bed without shaking uncontrollably, her solution used to be Xanax. She is now able to take a small dose of Kratom and live her life without the symptoms of anxiety.\n\nThat kratom is potentially becoming a schedule 1 substance is beyond understanding to me. Without firm, irrefutable evidence that it causes harm, this debate shouldn't even exist. This is a matter of the well being of thousands of Americans, and their liberty to choose how to better their life. \n\nI question the legitimacy of any proposed threat Kratom is to society. And although my story, and many others are simply anecdotal, legitimate, scientific studies should take place to understand what, if any, regulations need to be in place, and how this plant could potentially help or harm people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17586","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ken Wilson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA 442-W\n\nMy name is Chris, I am in my early 30s and I am a functioning responsible member of society, my idea of a good time is to stay in with a good book, instead of craving mind altering substances, I like tools and practices to keep me clear headed and functional. Chamomile tea, Kratom tea, Spirulina, Moringa, Coffee, Mint, they all are tools that I have found help me be the best I can be. I detest the foggy, fuzzy, dizzy, loopy, droopy, hazy, feelings and embrace foods and teas with the clean outcomes. \nThank you for taking a growth mindset approach to this issue.  I know this is a growing phase and I trust that the DEA will not ban this plant. This growth mindset has been a tool that is helped us all through this and I think it will help you (DEA) to act with the people. \nWhen I was 5 1/2 years old I was ran over by a pick up truck, right across my stomach ;the tires went right over my hips and ribs. I thank the doctors that went in and stitched me up best they could with the blood veins that were disconnected and much of the damage that was caused to my liver,  it is still a miracle and I feel like I'm living on borrowed time.\nI have always noticed that when I have taken my vitamins my nutrients and plant-based tools, I feel better, my body repairs faster heals quicker and works normally.  Sometimes in the morning I drink coffee and I mix in a little bit of MCT oil. \n The first time kratom ever worked for me was about five years ago when I put out a fire behind my house that some kids had started. I put out the fire that was putting many homes in danger and afterwards realized that my hands were blistered up really bad.  \nI had just moved into my new home and I did not have any Neosporin or any type of burn cream or aspirin or ibuprofen.. I had a Kratom sample and after some study on this tree leaf I decided to try some myself. I quickly realized (2-3 grams of the crushed leaf) that while the blisters on my hands were still there, much, if not all of the pain was completely gone.  I do feel Kratom gives my body the tools to work with the pain in ways that I do not yet understand. \nIt has been 5 years since my discovery of Kratom's benefits. I use it rarely, maybe three times a month. Usually after a very hard day at work to ease the stress of pain from my hands and feet. \nRight now I am shedding tears. I cry for the good people who have found hope when I think of this plant being abandoned, banned and disrespected. \nThese are people regaining control of their lives, with the message from their hearts to others that  \"IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO BECOME WHO YOU HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE!! \"\nThank you DEA, for not taking this personal, the battles people fight with the help of this Kratom plant are far worse than any litigation or action you may be considering. \n My own personal experience it is one years of feedback from close friends, family members, people in the community.\nI hear feedback from many other people, now an excellent stream of feedback comes my way, never does get old.\nPeople tell me how they get relief from the stress of Pain, how they can function better doing things that they were not able to do before with an energy and vitality. I have stopped seeking and asking for this feedback, it now seeks me out all day, this is why my heart cries at the possibility of this plant being banned.\nI cry for those who have expressed to me serious implications of suicide before they tried and found this plant, The stories of family who claim that this has saved their lives. \n\nI understand you (The DEA) must be facing enormous pressure to take this plant from the people and I want each and everyone of you reading this to look within your hearts to find the strength needed to do the right thing. \nBefore politics gets involved, Help us in helping humanity.\nBy reversing your intentions to Ban you may be known for the war on drugs instead of the war on health. We are praying that you decide with your heart and not your pocketbooks. \n\nWe stand together protecting trees, water and each other. We remember our power, are ready to defend this plant for those who benefit from it and from threats. \nWe are Kratom, and the Nerds, the Biohackers, the Oathekeepers, the nootropics lovers, we are moms and dads, we are your school teachers and we are your neighbors. We are midnight janitors, servers and cooks at the local diner, we are congressmen and campaign managers.\nWe are Kratom and we are also the Shilajit community, the Moringa Community. We are the Coffee drinkers, the taxi drivers and we are doctors, lawyers, nurses, psychologists and rehab workers. We are for Kratom today, because we have regained control of our lives.\nRight now we would rather work with you help create a safe environment rather than working against you to do the same thing.

I am a senior citizen. I am 85 years of age. I have lived to see, learn and experience progress and disappointments in the use of pain medications in many areas. \n\n     My husband is a practicing doctor and I have worked in the local public school system, in the special education department, for more than 20 years.\n\n     My daughter was diagnosed with chronic leukemia (CML) 5 years ago. She has to take chemotherapy every single day for the rest of her life. Without it, she would die in a very short time. The side effects of the chemotherapy make life unbearable. It is a struggle from morning until night, every single day for the rest of her life. No day is a good day. I often feel as though she only chooses the chemotherapy over death because of us, her family.\n\n     I can relate to her because I was diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer recently. No cure for that either. We walk the same road and live in hope that doors will open to us. Millions of dollars are spent in research for a cure. Hopefully someday that will happen, but in the meantime many people suffer and die. We pray to God that he hears us and helps in our dilemma. \n\n     Unlike the fact that there is little help for cancer, there is help for other life altering medical issues. Kratom is known to help so many people, in so many ways. My grandaughter was struck by a motor vehicle while walking on the sidewalk 15 years ago. She spent the better part of the following 7 years in the hospital fighting a chronic staph infection and fighting to keep her limbs from being amputated. Unfortunately, although she was able to keep her limbs, she lives in agony. No day is a good day for her. She has some amazing doctors that have done their best to make her comfortable over the years since her accident. Unfortunately all the pain medications have done little to help her pain and have unbearable side effects. I've often been afraid that I would lose my granddaughter. I've often been afraid that the pain and resulting isolation and depression would become too much for her to bear. Then she discovered Kratom. What a lifesaver! I have my granddaughter back! She is smiling again. She is an active participant in her own life for the first time since her accident in 2001. I cannot imagine that she could ever go back to just barely surviving every day. \n\n     Used responsibly, Kratom can be beneficial to those that suffer from chronic pain and it does not have all the horrible side effects that most prescription pain medications have. It is a natural supplement that has the ability to aid people with many issues. It can be taken safely and is immediately available to those who benefit from it. It is beyond my comprehension why anyone would ever consider making something so beneficial, illegal. The true crime would be to taking this leaf away from the people that benefit from it so much. It is beyond cruel to even consider denying those that live in the agony of chronic pain, access to this leaf that helps them so drastically. \n\n     In closing I'd like to respectfully request that we take the masses into consideration. Kratom is a supplement that is available now and helps so much. Taking it away would be an incredible injustice to the many that have already done so much suffering. Please, allow Kratom to remain a legal supplement. By taking it away, you would be condemning the already condemned. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration on this very important issue. I appreciate your anticipated wise and life saving decision to keep Kratom available to those that benefit from it most. \n\n     \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20131","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Vivian DiGregorio","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I just want to tell you, our family lost a sweet sister/daughter to pain killer addiction. Specifically Percocet. It is legal, right? She found a Dr to prescribe her 180 tablets per month for endometriosis (I guess it's like having bad menstrual cramps). She quickly spiraled into a path of addiction. Soon needing more than 2 tablets every 6-8 hours or whatever her dosing was. So when 180 pills wasn't enough anymore, she found a boyfriend that would supplement her addiction with HIS pain killers. When even that wasn't enough, she started adding alcohol to he mix. Sadly, she just quit breathing one night and died. Before being introduced to Percocet, this was a girl that loved animals, painted, loved cooking for people, the type of girl who would dance in the rain with a big smile on her face. A legal prescription drug took her away from us. If she had known about Kratom, she would probably be alive today. Due to her death, I opted to find a natural way to deal with my chronic pain and I found Kratom, which has safely and without incidence, gave me a quality of life back. So my question to you, is WHY would you allow legal proven KILLERS like alcohol and Percocet, that kill many people everyday by overdose or long term use effects, to be easily obtained, while scheduling Kratom illegal? (A plant that has never, on it's own killed anyone) Scheduling this would result in making Kratom impossible to obtain and users that do find a way to get it would incur the consequence of jail? Kratom is a natural plant, in unadulterated form, it will not kill anyone. You cannot overdose, you would vomit first. In my experience, it does not cause a \"high\", just takes the edge off the pain to make it bearable. I do not feel addicted at all. I can go several days without it, with no withdrawal type symptoms. I have benefited from this plant for almost 2 years now. Anyone who thinks they could take this for pleasure would certainly find a better way, as it tastes horrible, which is the worst thing about this miracle plant. Please use common sense in your decision. WHY take away something that keeps thousand of people OFF deadly painkillers? It helps people addicted GET OFF opiates and it helps people NOT using opiates avoid the dangerous path of opiate addiction by providing a safe path to curbing the pain that would otherwise be intolerable. What about Public Safety, you say? Let's Compare: Kratom in the system of 16 people who died (although NOT the sole cause of death, there WERE other significant contributing factors) OR Opiate Overdose (From 1999 to 2014, more than 165,000 people have died in the U.S. from overdoses related to prescription opioids, and it's only increased since 2014) OR Alcohol: (Excessive alcohol use led to approximately 88,000 deaths and 2.5 million years of potential life lost (YPLL) each year in the United States from 2006 - 2010, shortening the lives of those who died by an average of 30 years.) Assuming you have the Public's best interest at heart, What will your decision be?

Limiting consumption to adults at least eighteen years of age would be reasonable, as we should have the freedom to make our own decisions.

The effects are quite subtle and overdosing would be quite difficult since, at worst, people may vomit or experience nausea upon ingesting high doses. As with anything, while addictive potential exists, it is easily overshadowed by substances like alcohol, tobacco, and caffeineas well as legal medicines like amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and opiateswhich is why, if anything, instead of banning first and asking questions later or never, we should be encouraging more research to be done like great states such as Florida and my own, North Carolina!\n\nWhether someone uses kratom for a medical condition or recreationally after work, I ask that you please respect my autonomy in exchange for my respect of yours.

Nowadays, we know better.\n\nCannabis cures cancer; promotes the healing of many other medical conditions and alleviates pain and suffering afflicting millions of patients, yet this too, is considered to be a dangerous drug, irrespective of the ample medical and research  documentation and records proving this to be false and erroneous.

The perpetrators are now dead and gone, past the point of answering for their egregious sins, but history shall record their names for the record.\n\nMost likely, this plant, just like organic produce and cannabis, ought to remain unclassified as a dangerous drug until a problem actually develops or future research counters all of the current research and documentation supporting this plant remaining legal and available to the general public.

Between the pressure of working part time and studying at a state university, I experienced a great amount of stress, resulting in severe depression and anxiety. I had sought out help from psychologists in the past, but found that, while it helped, I still found myself slumping into depressions on a regular basis. I feared I would have to resort to SSRIs, which, while helpful for many, carry a wide-range of side effects, and eventually make the user totally dependent upon them for relief.\n\nIn my search for a treatment, I read about Kratom, and was excited by it's potential as an anxiolytic and motivation booster. I found Kratom to be incredibly effective at attenuating acute depression, and it wiped out my anxiety. I found it also significantly helped me in my studies, allowing me to stay motivated and focused.\n\nAbout two years later, I use Kratom much less frequently. As I became more successful, my self-esteem was improved, and I could weather the storm much better than I could before. However, I still like to have it around as an availble option to treat any acute depression or anxiety if it comes up. I never found myself craving Kratom, nor did I ever experience a withdrawal symptom. In addition, I never noticed a strong build-up of tolerance, like one finds with coffee, or many other drugs. The same dose remained effective for me on a regular basis for years, and I never needed to increase my dose.\n\nIn addition to its possible uses in psychology, Kratom is an incredibly useful tool to wean addicts off of opiates. The country is undergoing a major opiod crisis, and Kratom has been vital for many former addicts who were able to quit with its help. \n\nYes, Kratom should be investigated, studied, and regulated. However, it absolutely should NOT be banned wholesale, nor should it be restricted to the large pharmaceutical companies, who would repackage and sell it at inflated prices to addicts who have no other options, as we have seen with Epi-Pens, AIDS medications, and numerous. Kratom is best left in the hands of licensed, regulated growers who pay taxes, and meet strong health standards.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3150","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stefan Lyon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I write to you today to ask you keep the herbal remedy Kratom freely available.

This plant (and the alkaloids it contains) should be left unscheduled. It should be available as a botanical, and the United States government should help ensure that it and other botanicals are regulated for quality and potency.\n\nI had never heard of kratom until the DEA first threatened to schedule it earlier this year. Because my daughter is disabled with a severely painful and incurable disease and cannot take opioids because of their deleterious side effects, I immediately began to research this plant. After reading many scientific studies and hundreds of positive (mostly glowing) anecdotal accounts, I bought some kratom for her. No pharmaceutical medication has helped her in the 20 years she has suffered from her debilitating disease. I am stunned to report that five milligrams of kratom relieves her pain and bladder pressure for five hours and treats her co-morbid anxiety disorder more effectively than any benzodiazepine she has ever been prescribed.\n\nLast September, I had a four-hour surgery that involved multiple spinal fusions, and I was in the hospital for eight nights. I came home with fentanyl patches, which left me light-headed and dazed and which I stopped using after about a week, and tablets of oxycodone. I am thankful that the doctor provided the post-surgical pain relief that I needed. Concerned, however, about using the opioids with another CNS depressant I am prescribed, I decided to take 4 milligrams of kratom in the evening so that I wouldnt stop breathing at night.\n\nFour mg. of kratom controlled my pain much better than 10 mg. of oxycodone.\n\nBy attempting to schedule kratom, the DEA is acting as if nothing has been learned by the decades-long War on Drugs that has ruined the lives of millions. Making the plant illegal will not stop people from using it any more than the illegality of any number of substances has prevented people from using those drugs. We cant even prevent prisoners, people watched day and night, from using illegal drugs.\n\nBut kratom is not a drug; it is a plant that has been used for centuries to help people be more productive and to control their pain. We are a free country, and our government should not control what adults put into their own bodies, unless that action has severe social consequences, equally or more severe than alcohol. \n\nYes, we must try as best we can to regulate kratoms quality and purity. Yes, we must study its effects and consequences so that if it is harmful in some ways, we can treat those harms medically rather than criminally. Most importantly, we must study this plant because it could lead to breakthroughs in pain management that are far less addictive and lethal than opioids. \n\nDesignating kratom Schedule 1 will make such breakthroughs almost impossible. Scheduling kratom at all will prevent tens of thousands of law-abiding American citizens from treating their pain, controlling their anxiety, enhancing their sense of well being, and weaning themselves from the scourge of opioid addiction. Scheduling this herb or its alkaloids will not stop people from using it; it will make criminals of huge numbers of those citizens who will continue to use the plant, illegally, because they find it safer and more efficacious than anything that can be prescribed.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3531","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Freed","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has only helped me.

I learned of kratom from my husband who is a environmental scientist about 2 years ago. I use kratom after a long day at work, about two to three days a week. Kratom is a pretty benign natural substance that gives me mild pain relief from chronic shoulder and back pain associated with working in the dental field as a dental hygienist for over ten years. In the past, I occasionally took muscle relaxers and large doses of ibuprofen for work related pain. As a professional educated women, the use of those prescription drugs is not a long term solution and I am not a fan of the side effects. On the other hand, kratom gives a great pain relieving analgesic effect, without the side effects and mental fog of muscle relaxers. Kratom also is a great alternative to a glass of wine or alcohol when in need of relaxation and stress relief. It also gets rid of mild anxiety and gives the user a sense of well being. From my experience, kratom is safe as a cup of coffee, and much safer than the use of alcohol or prescription drug use. Users of kratom know that their is a small amount needed for its effects, the body does not build a tolerance to it, and if taken too much or too high of a dose, the user only feels nauseated and tired. It is all natural, and from my research, a very benign natural substance that has been used for centuries. My life would be greatly altered it it was banned. I feel it has helped me stay healthy, be a wonderful wife and mom, and gives short term relief for mild back and shoulder pain. \n\nSincerely, \nSarah Lee","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19090","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Lee","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello.

I am a happy healthy husband and father to a beautiful 16 month old daughter.  People look at Kratom as an illicit drug, it's not.  If Kratom were the public danger that it's made out to be I would not be leading the life I am.  Drugs destroy families, they destroy lives and childhoods and Kratom does not do that.  I have a bad back with spurring between my vertebrae and I suffer from extreme social anxiety.  I drink Kratom to help me with those conditions.  Thanks to Kratom I've been able to not take any painkillers for my pain.  Opiates terrify me and Kratom allows me to now have to risk my health and family on drugs that have ruined families and lives (Opiates).  I also have far less anxiety with Kratom.  It allows me to lead a happier life and be far more productive.  I have never had a single side effect or issue from using Kratom in seven years.  \n\nI understand that the DEA wants to do what it has to to protect the people of America from dangerous drugs.  I support that.  The problem is that by banning Kratom you're banning the wrong drugs.  Kratom is a drug that can help people fight against Americas real drug problem (Opiate Addiction.  I support if the DEA wants to put age limits or FDA regulations on Kratom, but please do not ban it or force me to buy it from a pharmaceutical company.  It's a safe herbal remedy and I beg you to not overstep the needs of Americans.  How I care for my body and health is my right that should not be infringed upon unless people are dying.  Kratom has killed no one.  Opiates have killed millions.  Kratom is NOT an opiate.

I hated to see her walking around in pain, so I asked her if she would like to try what I use.  I would not give anything to my mother that I did not feel was safe for her.  The kratom took care of the pain and it makes it much easier for her to get a good night's rest.

It doesn't get you high. \"High\" is a strong word for what kratom actually offers. This plant is just one of a list of age-old plants and herbal extracts that make people feel a bit peppier, a bit happier, a bit more relaxed. A list that includes St John's Wort, ginseng, wild lettuce, coffee (yes, coffee), kava, lavender, valerian, betel nut - the list goes on and on. The word \"medicinal\" is sometimes used. But \"high\"? That would be stretching it. Kratom is not an opiate. The molecule isn't even vaguely related to morphine or heroin. It's just an herb. It's impossible to overdose on kratom. You're likely to get a headache if you take too much. The roughly 20 deaths attributed to kratom in recent history are thought to be caused by other drugs. And considering the 88,000 deaths per year linked to alcohol and the 28,000 overdose deaths from opiates (heroin and painkillers) in the US alone, it seems someone isn't doing their math. Is kratom addictive? Maybe a little. But not as much as coffee and cigarettes - or Q-tips, tattoos, and Pokemon Go. And if you take it daily, guess what? It loses its effect. So this is basically a no brainer.  Many people report being helped by it. Some of the most interesting health benefits of kratom leaves include their ability to lower blood pressure, relieve pain, boost metabolism, increase sexual energy, improve the immune system, prevent diabetes, ease anxiety, help with addiction, eliminate stress, and induce healthy sleep. So do really need input on this? I mean come you guys. You went to collage. You are intelligent. Other wise you wouldn't have the job that you have. I'm sure that you will come the conclusion that kratom doesn't need to be banned.

Kratom is fairly benign and no deaths have been directly linked to its use. It represents no national health crisis or emergency and warrants no federal restrictions. It should in no way imaginable be grouped with drugs such as heroin, drugs that have no clinical use, whatsoever. Kratom, however, is a tremendous benefit to persons such as I, who suffer from general anxiety disorder. Aside from meditation et al., shown only to be 20% effective at best, the course of therapy for sufferers of GAD and etc. is typically Xanax plus an adjunct (often an SSRI). I my case, I have Serotonin Syndrome and cannot take SSRIs. Every other adjunct has had little to no effect on my condition with the exception of Kratom.\n\nKratom has a very low profile for abuse and has no adverse health consequences. The few cases of illness associated with Kratom have had nothing to do with the medicinal per se, but with the much harsher (and truly illegal) drugs having been consumed in conjunction with Kratom. The suggestion that Kratom has no health benefits is very misinformed. I am a case in point. I use Kratom, carefully and in studied doses, and it has been of great benefit in remediation of my GAD. I have no desire to be labelled a criminal of the first degree by using this medicinal. Further, regulation will merely result in Big Pharma(tm) profiteering whereas normal market forces decree its cost at this time. What benefit can result in putting Kratom in the same category as herion, cocaine, etc.? It will make criminals out of ordinary citizens, or deprive them of a medicinal that is mild and efficacious. If allowed to migrate to a prescription-only paradigm, the cost will escalate as Big Pharma provides a distilled variant, not to mention the cost of doctors' appointments. Will scheduling of M/7-H prevent abuse and death across the country? Kratom is not particularly ripe for abuse and no deaths have ever been attributed to its sole use.\n\nIn short, scheduling of M/7-H (aka Kratom) is entirely misguided, unnecessary, and abhorrently unsympathetic. Thank you for your time. Now, please devote your time and attention to true health crises such as drugs crossing our borders, the national crack and heroin epidemic, and the hyperbolic rise in prescriptions and health care.

My husband and I have a demanding small business focused on international healthcare. \n\nI was diagnosed with Hashimotos (hypothyroidism, immune system disorder) more than 10 years ago. Standard medications (Synthroid, Cytomel) have helped to correct some of the imbalance. I have also experienced incremental improvement through extreme changes to my diet, exercise, and a series of supplements. The rest is a tremendous, daily struggle. There are many symptoms but the most persistent and debilitating is extreme fatigue. I also live with chronic depression. \n\nIt is hard to explain the fatigue to someone who has not experienced it. Basically it is extreme exhaustion (like after the longest, most mentally draining day) but at 9am after youve had a perfectly great night of rest. And it doesnt get better. Caffeine provides a short term boost but in the long run exacerbates the problem. \n\nI was introduced to Kratom about six months ago. It provides periods of relief from depression without euphoria or other mind altering feelings. And, more importantly, has given me an opportunity to know it is possible not to be depressed. Knowing the feeling helps me to implement supportive cognitive strategies. The effect on fatigue is similar. The change is subtle (more subtle than caffeine) but enough so I can go about my day without having exhaustion always the first thing on my mind. I cant describe the relief.\n\nAfter years of searching, I feel hope and like I have some of my life back.

I'm very much involved in my community and I am a board member of one of our local health care clinics and I very much oppose the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.  I face the same challenges many American business owners do.  I wake up every day responsible for the well-being of my clients and the futures of my employees and I do all that I can to remove any obstacle that I can for them and for myself.\n\nI have used kratom occasionally for nearly three years.  I started using it because I was a heavy coffee and Red Bull drinker and I found myself approaching dangerous levels of caffeine consumption to make it through the day.  I was also uncomfortable with the chemicals most energy drinks include, so I began to search for other healthy alternatives and found that kratom was a solid answer to my question.  I no longer needed the high amount of caffeine and I went from drinking 2-3 Red Bulls per day to 1 every other week or so.\n\nI've never had a problem shelving kratom for an extended period of time.  I've seen no evidence to indicate that this is an addictive substance.  I've paid particularly close attention to any negative publicity that it's received in terms of being a harmful substance, but I've never seen a report showing kratom as the sole substance in any negative case involving it - there have always been actual drugs found in the system in addition to kratom.\n\nBased on this information, I do not think it's prudent to list kratom as a schedule 1 substance as there is absolutely no evidence that it is one.

So I began to research for natural insomnia aides and came across Kratom.  This wonderful herb has made such an amazing difference in my life.  \n\nI now sleep throughout the night and I feel rested when rising in the mornings.  I can now enjoy my life with a whole new meaning.  I am not drowsy and tired and miserable anymore.  And this all due to finding Kratom.  \n\nI have never suffered one ill affect from Kratom in the three years since I discovered it.  In fact it has inspired me to live more healthy.

This is a wonderful plant, related to the coffee family, that has helped many from their pains and depressions and addictions to pharmecutical drugs.  Kratom has been used safely for hundreds and hundreds of years.  It has helped me to finally sleep without any side affects.

Please do not make criminals of those of us who have found a benefit to our health from this plant.\n\nI have never become intoxicated or high or what have you from Kratom.  This is simply not the truth if it is stated otherwise.  It is no different then having a cup of coffee except for the fact that it does seem to benefit you in a healthful way.\n\nI respectfully plead that you take into consideration what the consumers are hoping to explain about Kratom.  \n\nPlease allow us to keep this choice in our healthy lives.\n\nSincerely,\nLaurie Szabo","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5470","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laurie Szabo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'll start by saying I first tried this plant several years ago, but had little interest as I was using hard drugs including alcohol.

I believe this was realized by the various letters, calls, and responses to the White House Petition that came about because of your negligent actions. It is in the best interest of the people to whom you serve that you do not proceed with your intended scheduling, and consider realigning your priorities to focus on the known issues within your regulating authority to find solutions for the abuse of over prescribed medications and the inflated costs to senior citizens, veterans and anyone whom have been subjected to the price gouging of the pharmaceutical companies on the public. I have researched many natural botanical and their health benefits and can say from firsthand experience that the kratom leaf does benefit me in relieving stress and anxiety with no side effects or dependencies. I have never been diagnosed nor medicated for any mental or physical ailments outside of minor surgeries and can contest that kratom in my opinion is less of a harm than currently legal and habit forming products such as alcohol and tobacco. I do not smoke but have family members and friends who do smoke and or drink and their addiction to these products clearly shows me kratom is not how you have portrayed it.

Mr Melvin Patterson who was so helpful in\nour phone calls and dialogs,thank you all DEA for listening to the American people and having a heart.\nMy story with Kratom begins almost 4 years ago,Ive been a laborer for 30+ and my body is \"worn out\" struggling with chronic\npain is part of life for me,and the sober tolerance of it is part of the reason my family is provided for.I had been prescribed heavy \nnarcotics for about 15 yrs. and because of the opiate crisis in our my doctors and surgeon changed me to a pain medication that \ndoesn't work,Darvocet,Tylenol #3,Oxycodone,Hydrocodone were my medicines at various times and doses and so when my medical \nteam lowered me to Tramadol I was terrified because it didn't work (for me) and the pain came back with a vengeance,what was\nmanageable before now became unbearable,thats when I discovered Kratom online and I decided to add it to my diet,\nnot to treat my pain,or cure it but that I would use it along with a good eating plan (I lost 59 lbs) What was once unbearable was now \nnegligible,and my energy level sky rocketed.And whats better I didn't feel \"loopy\" I was more alert sharper,Like I had a big coffee\nI \"felt\" 20 yrs younger painwise/energywise and I was able to work again.Before with the Tramodol I couldn't work,my family was\ngoing to go without my providing for it and they lost their Daddy because If you've ever been in chronic pain that's all you can \nthink about let alone work.Kratom literally saved my physical life enabling me to work again and I am so very thankful that the Lord \nhas provided it for me/us,thats why I will fight (peacefully) with all my being,with every breath that Kratom stays legal! You see \nMy story doesn't end their in the process in all my researching to find a safe plant for me to take for my pain I discovered that there \nare multitudes of Heroin and opiate addicts that have recovered completely by quietly self medicating (so to speak) with Kratom and are \ncompletely free now,no more Heroin,Suboxone etc,.Theres some talk out there that the pharmaceutical industry is doing all they \ncan to keep Kratom illegal because the addiction recovery industry is lucrative to the tune of hundred's of billions of dollars\nand the corruption from that is paying the people off to make Kratom scheduled and therefore inaccessible to the public that desperately needs it.\nThis is not what I believe,nevertheless I hear it everywhere and I pray it's not true,I really care about this because my heart is broken,my Nephew Paul\ndied last week from Heroin and I believe,no I know If he had access to Kratom,He would be alive today,so with that said,\nStudies will show how Kratom saves lives and consequently the reverse is true if it is banned and innocent people like Paul will never have a chance\nat life and sadly may die,Im praying to my Lord Jesus Christ to keep Kratom accessible to all,and Sirs,I beg you in the name\nof humanity,as you cancelled the ban on Kratom,so you will not only keep it legal but encourage its widespread use for all adults with any health needs.again thank you for your time \nmay God bless you as you fight to keep American safe from drugs and protect its citizens and continue to respect its citizens wishes and well being that we may continue to have a happy\nand safe America Sincerely Brian Bousquet ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1061","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"brian bousquet","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Ben.

And really no matter what stance you take in life, if you believe in evolution or if you believe in God. It doesn't matter if you think the world is made of goat cheese. Before man decided to take off with all his inventions, this world all worked in harmony, sustainably. Everything worked really well, and either a creator created them to be at peace, or they evolved to be in the most evolved position, and accomplished longevity. So no matter what, these plants are natural, and clearly they belong on this earth. By outlawing a plant you are essentially commuting genocide for the species. So when people preserve the plants and an eventual, and grossly predictable, war breaks out and violence occurs over something simple like growing a plant, can you really blame the soul that preserved it.

I suffer from depression, anxiety, pstd, chronic pain and RLS. I was introduced to kratom approximately a months ago by a friend who was successfully over coming her addiction with opioids . I find kratom has given me relief significantly from my depression, anxiety and helped so much at night with my RSL. Once I started taking kratom I also noticed my appetite for eat to deal with my depression has been curved greatly needless to say my weight is slowly lowering.. major plus being Im 4'10 and 190.\nBefore I started using kratom I conducted research, including scientific articles and testimonials of other using kratom. My findings of users testifying that kratom helped them with anxiety and depression, panic attacks, multiple sources of chronic pain, restless leg syndrome, PTSD, the discomfort of Lyme disease, arthritis, and finally that kratom has been used to treat diabetes in Indonesia for many decades.\n\nIt is true that kratom produces a mild stimulating effect, and also some mild euphoria. These characteristics, I freely admit, make it slightly prone to recreational use. Although kratom may be slightly addictive, physiologically so, anecdotal evidence indicates it is NOT nearly as addictive as traditional opioids now prescribed to millions of Americans. Despite assertions by the DEA, that there have been several deaths here and abroad due to kratom, almost all of these deaths involve a drug cocktail, where kratom was consumed along with other potentially dangerous drugs, or kratom which has had synthetic chemicals added to it.. Additionally, those who have experienced withdrawal symptoms from kratom report those symptoms as very mild compared to traditional opioid withdrawal symptoms. In fact, many are using kratom to 'kick' a narcotics addiction!\nI hope you hear and take the time to read and research this further before stopping so many people from being able to live a more productive life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19901","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Keep it legal you have no right to make it illegal it's helping people","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10364","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Miles Swammi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After years of struggling with arthritis in both my knees, telling my kids I hurt too much to play, going the rounds with the LEGAL addiction a doctor in a lab coat tried to hand me and refusing to become what my OWN GOVERNMENT labeled as a \"prescription addict\", I found Kratom and it's LITERALLY SAVED MY LIFE AND QUALITY OF LIFE.

I am a 26 year old man and I am chronic pain sufferer since the age of 15. For years I have gone to doctors for everything from pain killers to ptsd and everything in between. I've been on so many different kinds of pills from insomina, pain, anxiety, depression,  adhd, nerve damage, seizures, and ptsd, I'm surprised sometimes that I even make it through a day. What's my condition for all the visits and use of doctor prescribed pills? Child Abuse. Something I can't reverse. I have 3 bulging disks, pinched spinal nerve that causes phantom pains in my legs and feet and complete numbness of my lower half, hernia nerve damage that causes constant pain I'm my thighs and groin area, small fractures all throughout my spine, and I suffer anxiety, depression, and insomnia so horrendously that I'm agoraphobic. Psychiatrists, surgerons, doctors, and pain specialists have not bettered my life in anyway. What they have given me is more problems. Years and years of being prescribed hydrocodone and oxycodone I had developed an addiction that doctors kept calling a dependence. It wasn't going through withdrawal every month for 2weeks is not dependence its addiction. I overdosed a number of by accident, I've had so many reactions to certain pills, and I feel like a zombie all year long. It wasn't until one day through withdrawal and wanting to kick all my habits that I found Kratom. It was a prayer answered. Kratom took me out of withdrawal and into sobriety. It made me feel a happiness I hadn't known. The pain had finally become tolerable. And to my surprise it helped my depression, it lessened my anxiety, and it even helped with my insomnia. I get out of the house more. I can leave an our out of town. I can actually walk my dogs instead of being inside everyday. I feel like I can function where as prescibed pills nearly brought me to a path of illegal drugs, staying secluded, and near death. \n\nIf Kratom is taken from me, if I am forced back to that old life I was living for 11years, I will as so many others also will, I will helpless and hopeless. I will probably die from that life style again. A lifestyle of doctor visits every couple weeks, the looming fear of overdose, and relapsing into addiction. Keep Kratom Legal.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nKratom Advocate","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8679","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kratom Advocate","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \n\n     My name is Joel I was born in Ohio in 76 I'm from Lorain Ohio but lived lost my life in south Florida backnin 2007 I had an injury due to exercising in the gym , was looked at by a doctor who later said I had a herniated disc , I was prescribed opiates for injury and was on them for seven years because I was addicted spent all my money in them and when could not get from doctor went to streets for it it was bad times in my life , while in central Florida I met a guy and told him my situation he had told me about kratom since I've been using kratom I've been off pharmacy drugs for 4 years I only take it in morning and at night it saved my life and I can promise you it will save others , please listen to the people who were on the narcotics and now taking kratom they know what's going on , this stuff is saving lives I don't even think about pharmacy drugs anymore ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22679","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Pa botanicals","postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joel Diaz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We need to do more to help save these young peoples lives, for the sake of their families, friends and communities!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17819","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As one struggling with depression anxiety and insomnia, life can certainly have it's difficulties.

I got prescribed Vicodin 10/325 and took them as prescribed for about 3 years as well as tramadol 50mg for 2 years.

I was researching ways to make the withdraw process easier so I could still function and take care of my kids. I came across a bunch of forums speaking about Kratom and how it made the withdraw process less severe. I purchased some kratom from a local shop and took some. I was really skeptical, thinking theres no way the answer to my prayers has been right in front of me this whole time! I have been taking kratom since November 2015 and have had 0 prescription meds. Had it not been for kratom I would still be a prisoner to prescription meds and lost everything I care about most in my life! Kratom has given me my life back and has also given my children their clear headed mother they deserve! This plant has been around for centuries and has caused 0 deaths as well as 0 side effects.

Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

My intention of this comment is to give some background information of my life and experiences first, and also mention how kratom has helped me as a tool, since I have been over 2 years sober currently. \n\nI grew up with every opportunity granted to me to succeed from the love and compassion of both of my parents. I was taught at an early age to avoid drugs and alcohol and I did that throughout high school. I have a family member that passed away from alcoholism but I never understood addiction fully until I started experiencing it myself over time. I went away to college and was granted with a freedom that I had never experienced before. I am originally from a suburb town and once I got to college, I remember my first drink. Instantly, all social anxiety dissipated and I felt the need to \"fit in\".  I received my first 2 minor in possessions  alcohol my freshman and sophomore year. I was put on probation and had to breathalyze randomly. I stayed away from drinking but this is when my story took a scary turn. I was introduced to prescription drugs (opiates and benzodiazepines) around this time (sophomore/junior year in college). I felt like this was the perfect replacement for drinking and no one could smell anything on me and it was easier to do and get away with. This became of what seemed an endless cycle of progressive addiction. I didn't just use because I liked the feeling, I also used to cover up emotions and dealing with the stress of everyday life. This is when people close to me started seeing a change in my behaviors and attitudes. I would like to mention that at this time (2010-2013), I had never heard of or tried kratom in my life.  I went to many treatment centers during this time but nothing helped because I didn't want to change myself. I lost everything I had material wise and was losing my family as well in the process. \n\nIn August of 2014 I received my 2nd DUI in a span of 4 months and overdosed. I remember this day vividly. This is when I was introduced to kratom by a close friend. I dismissed it at first as just another plant but little did I know, this natural plant was essential in saving my life. I have been sober since September of 2014. I want to also mention that kratom is a tool for me, not a cure. I need to focus and do the work in my recovery and utilize kratom to help with that process. It is not a dangerous plant in my opinion, and quite honestly, played a part I'm saving my life. I still utilize kratom today but it alone does not keep me sober. In the past 2 years, I have made amends with my family, work 2 jobs, and attend school full time and am planning on graduating in April of 2017. I urge the DEA to keep this natural/safe substance legal because I know that I am not even close to all the people it has helped and saved. \n\nThank you for your consideration,\nJoseph","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4794","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please DEA, please stop.

I have been taking kratom since I broke my foot a few years ago, and kratom has made the experience of my foot healing far more comfortable. I have foot pain that can make it very unpleasant to walk or climb a ladder, which are two things I must do for my very active job. I manage a warehouse with over $6 million dollars of inventory, and I need to be on my feet all day long in order to help my coworkers and myself flourish. Kratom allows me to work with no pain, and no intoxicating effect. It is not a drug in the traditional sense of the word, it is more akin to a cup of coffee. I have taken kratom every day at my highly competitive and public workplace and if I seemed intoxicated I would have been fired long ago. I operate forklifts and other heavy machinery while on Kratom and I am in complete control of my actions while doing so.\n\nWhen I go on vacation I typically leave my kratom at home, and I suffer no withdrawal effect even though I am taking kratom at least 5 days a week at my job.

My story is one of alcohol and prescription pill abuse.  My life was in ruins until I discovered Kratom about 3 years ago.  I no longer felt the need to drink and abuse prescription drugs.  I was happier and more productive.  It gave me energy and mental peace.  I was no longer angry and depressed.  To this day, I continue to use Kratom almost every day, and the positive effects have reverberated through my professional and personal life.  I feel like I am a functional human being for the first time in my life.  Every few months I get a full physical, included lab testing of my major organ analytes, and I am perfectly healthy.  In fact, my blood pressure is back to normal!\n\nAs additional evidence for the efficacy of this plant, I gave Kratom to my best friend who had returned from a year-long deployment in Iraq.  He had been suffering from PTSD: night terrors, general anxiety, and fits of rage.  These symptoms of PTSD all went away when he began using Kratom.  It was a miracle.\n\nI will be in trouble if the DEA decides to make Kratom a Schedule I drug.  I do not want to go back to the way I was before I found Kratom.\n\nLet's move towards a more conscientious and tolerant America.

I had no energy for work and was suffering depression, but I didn't have health insurance to go to a doctor and find out what was wrong, and get prescription medications. A coworker offered me some Kratom one day, saying that he didn't really like it but thought that it might help me. I tried it. It tasted terrible. Within half an hour I found myself feeling happy for no reason and a had a burst of energy that I had not felt in a long time. I have been using Kratom regularly since. \n\nI have introduced Kratom to many friends and it has helped them with depression, energy, and pain. Several friends of mine often thank me for it and say that it is a miracle plant. One good friend was addicted to oxycodon which helped her pain, but made her not able to function and live normally. She was not able to work and drive. Now she lives a normal life, has a full-time job, and is quite active.\n\nMy best and most closest friend has many issues that she deals with, most which lead her to feel depression and thoughts (even acts) of suicide. She was an alcoholic, smoked pot regularly, and was addicted to pills. It was hard to have a conversation with her most times. She had extremely high anxiety and could rarely leave her house. She no longer drinks alcohol, she prefers Kratom over marijuana, and her anxiety is being controlled. I am so thankful to have my friend back.\n\nI work full-time, I am a full-time Business student at Georgia Southwestern State University, graduating in May 2017 with a Bachelors degree. I have 2 teenage daughters, a husband, I have a life. I enjoy my life so much more. I am able to accomplish so much more. I am more social, my house stays clean, and I am content. I can go days without Kratom and have yet to suffer any withdrawal symptoms. I DO NOT approve of drugs that are harmful and destroy lives like crack, cocaine, heroin, meth, etc. I have family history of drug abuse and I know what illegal drugs like those can do. Kratom is NOTHING like those drugs. I cannot understand how it can even be compared to them. If Kratom is going to be banned, then coffee, nicotine, alcohol, and chocolate should be banned right along with it. \n\nI ask you to please reconsider your intent and gather more research and comments before banning Kratom and hurting many good people and their families. Banning Kratom would cause former drug addicts to relapse, many to live an unhappy, unfulfilled life, and could lead many people to their death. \n\nThank you for temporarily withdrawing your intent to ban Kratom.

Ever since then I continued to struggle with unbearable post gallbladder removal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss from 140 pounds down to 86 pounds. Doctors are not sure why I continue to have these complications and can only suggest exploratory surgery. I currently have no health care coverage. Kratom completely alleviates the pain, stops the nausea and vomiting and allows me to eat with my weight back up to 124 pounds thanks to kratom. I became physically dependent on opiates for pain control and would experience debilitating withdrawal when I could not get another RX for pain meds. Kratom helps so much more then the pain. It increases my appetite as well and no withdrawal is felt if you stop taking it. In addition it alleviates my depression and anxiety and has no side effects. My husband uses it also for pain control of his 3 herniated discs. I know that big pharma is threatened by kratom but please know there will never be a shortage of people who will switch from their hardcore narcotics for a harmless coffee plant. Trust me I have tried. They say \"yeah it helps pain but you don't get high\". So you will always have plenty of drug addicts to fill those prescriptions.

My name is Miles and I am a 27 year old computer programmer. I am very much against the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. I started using kratom approximately 2 years ago. I have had problems with chronic knee pain for many years and about 6 months before I found out about kratom I began having chronic back pain as well. I have been to numerous physicians ever since my back pain started and none of them have been able to identify the cause of the pain. I have spent large sums of money on tests and attempted treatments. I have had MRIs, x-rays, a plethora of blood tests and have been prescribed countless medications. None of them have worked. The doctors are unable to find the cause. Because of this and the fact that I otherwise look and am healthy, they are unwilling to prescribe many medications. Approximately 6 months into my ordeal with chronic back pain I was researching methods to help control the amount of pain that I was in so that I could continue to work and support my family. It was at this time that I read about kratom and decided to give it a shot. Kratom has helped significantly in allowing me to regain my normal life. It has allowed me to continue working and providing for my family. Prior to finding kratom I was unable to stay in any position (sitting, standing, etc) for more than 5-10 minutes without causing myself increasing amounts of pain. This made any part of normal life incredibly difficult. Since discovering kratom, I have regained control of my life. My pain is not gone, but with kratom it is reduced to a tolerable level. \n\nThe small amount of research that has been performed on kratom and the compounds it contains has so far produced promising results. Scientists are using some of the compounds to create next-generation drugs that don't have the negative side effects of the opioid painkillers which they would replace. One of the experimental drugs is called TRV130 and it is in clinical trials now. It does not cause respiratory depression, there is little to no tolerance increase to TRV130 (an increase in tolerance is what leads to ever increasing dosages of opioid pain killers), there are few withdrawal symptoms, and the early research shows that it is nonaddictive. By classifying kratom as a schedule 1 substance, researching kratom and the substances it contains would become incredibly difficult and burdensome. The promise that the current research shows would allow the country to combat the opioid epidemic that it has faced in recent years.

This is an issue of profound importance to the well being of millions of us citizens, and open public discourse on the matter is essential to the proper functioning of a free society.\n   I am 59 yrs old, a self-employed craftsman. In early 2013, I began using unadulterated Kratom, powdered leaf, to treat chronic depression, anxiety, and also for nerve pain from herniated discs in my back. At the time, I had no health insurance, and no other recourse for relief from my troubles. But the Kratom had a tremendously positive effect; not only dispelling my nearly disabling depression, but also stopping the awful pain in my back. \n   I continued using Kratom, very successfully, until it was banned without public discourse or ANY study by the Alabama legislature in May 2016. I must say, I felt cheated and betrayed by this unconscionable action.\n   I never noticed any side effects from using Kratom; no brain fog, or impairment, or pathology of any kind. Just profound and lasting relief from my various issues. \n   When Kratom was banned here, of course I could no longer continue with it. I never had any withdrawal symptoms. However, the depression and the frequent flare-ups of nerve pain came roaring back with a vengeance. \n   I had also become involved in the huge and continually growing community of other Kratom users, and found that they also had similar, profoundly positive experiences, almost without exception.\n   When I heard about the immanent scheduling of Kratom's active ingredients by the DEA a couple of months ago, I decided to add my voice to the outcry. It may be too late for me as a citizen of Alabama, but I believe it would be tragic and unfair if this safe, gentle, incredibly effective herb was made illegal, and taken away from hundreds of thousands of other people who were far worse off than me, before they got their lives back with the help of Kratom. The evidence of Kratom's benefits is huge and unequivocal. Listen to the people, PLEASE!\n   I absolutely believe that as law-abiding, responsible adults, we ought to have the uninfringed right to use Kratom at our discretion. It does no harm, and only helps- and God knows, there are a great many other things that are legal, and yet do great harm. Prescription opiates and alcohol, for instance. \n   Again, I am deeply grateful for your consideration and your interest in tranparency and fairness. I, and millions of other Americans, are counting on you to do the right thing, and keep Kratom legal for adult use; with sensible regulation, as with any other herbal medicine.\nThank You very much!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17606","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephen Sheriff","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not want Kratom or its active ingredients (Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine) placed into Schedule One.

After about a year of taking these medications daily I started to feel bad....all of the time, I assumed it was from the medications.  I even noticed the whites of my eyes turning Greyish with a tint of yellow, this was no good.  I then researched natural alternatives and found kratom.  Out of curiosity I purchased some and decided to try it for a week, without the other OTC medications.  A few time I took to much and felt nauseous, but this did not deter me from this research, after a few days I was able to dial in the dose that worked for me.  Since then I have used kratom 4 to 5 times a week, the days where I don't have much pain I lower my dose and seem to still have the same effects. Nothing about this herb is even close to \"feeling high\", I know that has been a misconception that has been circulating. I can even go a couple days without taking with very little side effect, nothing more than not having my daily coffee in the morning, \n\nSince I have been off the OTC medications my general healthy and well being have improved greatly, me eyes look like very healthy.  \n\nIt would be a mistake to schedule this as 1, I can see some sort of regulations, but it should remain a supplemental herb, not a prescription medication. \n\nCory McManus","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10774","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cory Mcmanus","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a happily married father of two.

I have suffered from migraines for over thirty years. During this time,  I have been prescribed Imitrex, several Tricyclic series AD medicines, narcotic pain relievers, caffergot, bufonoreprenephrines, and several other medications, as well as non pharmacological treatments, including bio-feedback, meditation, dietary and exercise regimens.\n\nAll of the above treatments have clear challenges, including concomitant side effects, potential physical dependency, diminishing efficacy over time, and a host of other problems. Kratom, which I have been using to legally, and safely treat my migraine symptoms, has had none of the problems listed above, while providing substantial relief from the symptoms of migraines. In fact, I can honestly state that kratome (containing the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine), has treated my migraine symptoms better than any of the other treatments.\n\nThe DEA scheduling would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown the primary alkaloids in kratom to be beneficial without causing respiratory depression, dependency or any of the aforementioned problems associated in one way or another, with every other treatment I have tried.\n\nI have used kratom to treat my migraine condition for over two years. In that time I have experienced the greatest level of efficacy for alleviating migraine symptoms than any of the dozens of treatments I've tried, with exactly zero negative side effects.

I first starting using Kratom about two years ago. It was then that I was diagnosed with chronic prostatitis (which is inflammation of the prostate gland) I developed prostatitis after a cystoscopy was done to look for abnormalities in my bladder due to some pain I was having in my flank area. After being diagnosed with chronic prostatitis I was treated with an antibiotic called Ciprofloxacin which did nothing but, give me horrible side effects like tendonitis, dizziness, diarrhoea and sever fatigue. After going back to a urologist several times and being prescribed more antibiotics and  non steroidal anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen, the urologist finally told me that some men are just stuck with this disease for their entire life and that they don't really have a \"magic bullet\" or cure for it. Well this disease is very painful to say the least and has drastically affected my quality of life. To be told that there is no cure for it is serloudly disheartening and it has caused me anxiety and depression along with the chronic pain that plagues me daily. I heard about Kratom from a friend and heard it was very effective for chronic pain, so I decided I would give it a try since I was desperate to find any relief possible for the physical pain and depression I've been experiencing. I went and bought some kratom powder from a local vendor and mixed some powder with some orange juice and drank it. The pain relief I experienced from kratom was amazing, it helped with my pain much more than any  pain medication I had ever been prescribed. I began using Kratom to relieve my pain and noticed it also helped with my anxiety and depression, it was like a miracle. This natural plant was so much more affective at relieving my prostatitis pain than anything else I had tried. I'm asking to please keep Kratom legal so people can use this natural plant for medicinal purposes and as a safe alternative to more dangerous and addictive narcotic pain relievers.  Also to allow for scientists and doctors to do more research on the potential benefits of this miracle plant. I feel like it would be dangerous to ban Kratom and leave hundreds of thousands of people with chronic pain, anxiety , depression and Post traumatic stress disorders with nowhere to turn but back to other more harmful drugs. Leaving them feeling desperate and hopeless. Kratom has helped me live a more enjoyable life, without being burdend by pain depression and anxiety. Kratom has allowed me to manage my chronic pain without using pills and made it possible for me to get back to work and feel like I can function and live a more complete life.  Thank you for taking the time to read my comments and listen to My story and all  the other people across the country with their stories and comments.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21565","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Levi Scovern","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear human beings at the Drug Enforcement Administration,\n\nYou are human beings, correct?  A species living on Earth, a beautiful Earth, which has existed millions of years before humans began to spread throughout the lands.  No matter how cruel we humans often are to Earth, and no matter how cruel we often are to each other, Earth provides us everything we possibly could need.  \n\nEarth has provided us magnificent trees, seeds which grow into them, and nuts, vegetables, and fruit which grow from them naturally and provide us sustenance.  So many herbs provide us natural remedies to live long and prosperous lives as humans.  The plant which we call Kratom is one of these NATURAL herbs.\n\nIn your published intent (81 FR 59929), to schedule the opioids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which are the main active constituents of the plant kratom, into schedule I based on the Controlled Substance Act, you refer consistently to abusers and the abuse of this plant.  This is highly curious, a bit aggressive, and quite mis-informed to me.  This isn't a substance that can be recklessly abused, at least no more than how you may consider someone to abuse coffee, to abuse hamburgers, or the abuse of power of those in government agencies. \n\nAs a very knowledgeable observer of ACTUAL Schedule 1 drug abuse in hubs such as West Virginia, Philadelphia, and Florida, the effects of Kratom are so different from these substances it is almost laughable.  \n\nPersonally,  I have used various small dosages of Kratom as a substitute to coffee or caffeine-related beverages, to provide that burst that many hard-working professionals often seek to establish mental clarity in tedious work hours.  It provides a natural, nice mental focus with zero side effects.  \n\nI have seen Kratom be combined with other natural herbs to create nice, relaxing teas.  It is sold in herbal shops at reasonable costs, by very knowledgeable individuals who seek to spread awareness and beneficial health products.  These are incentives behind good, natural things.  They are not being driven by money, or by the desire for power, or as a method of control.  \n\nI suppose if you are going to choose the side of power and control, you have already made that decision, and these comments mean little.  \n\nHowever, if you are actually trying to do what you believe is right and promote public safety, I join others in informing you that placing Kratom as a Schedule 1 substance is NOT the right thing to do.  The world actually will be a safer, more peaceful place if it was utilized by more people, and I firmly believe that. \n\nThank you deeply and sincerely for your time viewing this comment.

I was in a bad car accident back in 2006 where i was flown out the passenger window 30 feet and landed on my butt.  After a few years the pain in my lower back was getting really bad.  After getting an x-ray my doctor asked if I had broken my back before.  I said no but told him about my wreck.  He said that I have compression fractures in my lower three vertebrae.  That there is bone rubbing on bone in essence.  He said basically I'm going to have arthritis in my back for life.  I have done physical therapy and been prescribed pain medications in the past.  The pain meds are very addictive and I hate the way they make me feel.  I found Kratom a few years ago and it does more for my pain than any pain medication and its not addictive and I dont have to increase the dose.  I am now in a job that I cant even take prescribed pain meds.  I am a contractor that gets scheduled and random drug tests to go into chemical plant or oil refinery.  I work on the HVAC systems.  So this is something I can take and am in unbelief that this is trying to be banned.  It is not dangerous and not addictive.  Its a completely natural plant that just helps with pain.  Ive also used it for a bad tooth ache before and it wiped out the pain and fever from it.  To say that there is no medicinal value for it is completely ludicrous.  It directly effects arthritis in my back and makes not want other pain medication/opioids at all.  If alcohol and caffeine are legal there is no reason this should be banned.  Especially alcohol and all its negative effects.  There have been a lot of others who have described it having anti anxiety effects.  Mood enhancing effects. People have used it to get off opioids/heroine and alcohol addiction.  I used to be a cigarette smoker and have personally not had cravings for them whenever using kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15719","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Scott Draper","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This plant medicine is extremely beneficial for not only safe pain management purposes, but recreation use as well.

Just another American citizen attempting to understand why individual integrity is eroding so quickly? Why must we continually endure these infringements upon our individual rights and abilities to put in to our bodies that which we choose. Potentially, for the silent majority of responsible, rational, hard-working people of this country, Kratom is a safe and simple plant-based method for relieving the affects of chronic pain stemming from any of a number of chronic conditions. Can we say the same for alcohol? I choose to avoid drinking alcohol, and the consumption of OTC anti-inflammatory/pain-relieving \"medicines\" because of their clinically proven side affects, and clear and present danger. The nefarious  nature of these substances are largely accepted, pushed, promoted, sold en mass for enormous profit, and all together ignored because of the preponderate nature of the complexity involved with the creation of such substances, their economic impact, and the overall ubiquitous mechanism of control they create over the majority of the population. Clearly, the moment the integral, conscious, intelligent individual discovers something better than that being pushed en mass by massive social-engineering, mega-corporate, oligarchical, technocratically paradigmatic entities, both the individual and the discovery of the individual are virtually crushed, dissolved, disintegrated, obfuscated, discredited, and manipulated in such a way that there is simply no alternative available, and anything with any semblance to that will be touted as delusional and a construct of mental illness in and of itself. Thus indicating that, despite there being no widespread indications suggesting that Kratom is in any way harmful when applied with rational care(that means when it does not fall in to the hands of fools, as all good and bad things eventually and inevitably do), it will potentially be banned because of pockets or quanta of isolated reports of bad experiences. Again, it is worth reiterating here, alcohol and several OTC drugs are proven to be more poisoness than good in many ways. But with these substances all it takes is a correlative study, or acceptable cost-benefit analysis, or total ignorance across the board by all the rain makers, these substances are supported, marketed, and spread like poison indiscriminately. Please, leave the sapient beings in this country some shroud of dignity and integrity. Ban things that make sense to ban. Each time one of these authoritative bodies has a temper tantrum they ruin something for the majority of we clear-headed, free-thinking people. Please help stop the madness. Keep Kratom safe. Support the proper research in understanding its benefits. Understand it's affects when misused; or, used improperly by morons when they clearly knew not to use it in such a way. What happened to rational decision making? Why the perpetual hair-trigger reactivity. Thank you for hearing my plea.

I became disabled in May of 2010 and I was on every kind of Pain and Anti-Anxiety Medication you can think of. Also I was prescribed as many Depression Meds that made me so completely out of a normal mental state is being generous. After years of these so called FDA approved Prescribed Meds legitimately from Doctors, they all took a toll on my mental health and no longer worked for pain as I became very Opiate Dependent and the tolerance level was so high they did not help anymore. \nMy dosage was increased over the years but I had had enough. I tried Cold Turkey off of Oxycodone 15mg 4x daily, Xanax 1mg 4x daily and Lyrica 150mg 2x daily. A horrific mistake.\n I was beyond frustrated and hated the way I felt as a human being. Over time it just got worse and I felt like a Zombie with absolutely No desire or ambition anymore to do Absolutely Anything. I had made a decision to end my life. I was not living a life worth living for. I even bought the supplies to end my life the way I was going to.\nSo before I did anything I did a lot of research online because never in million years did I think I would find anything to help me in the condition I was in other than to just end it all.\nI started reading about people in my same situation who discovered an Herbal Supplement called Kratom that many people had said it literally saved their lives! I never thought Herbal anything worked. I was never a drug user, pill popper person in any way until I got sick from a surgery gone very wrong in my case back from a surgery date of December of 2007 and just never recovered and got worse. \nSo I did a few weeks of research online about Kratom, where to buy it, how to use it, dosage, etc& I have been using Kratom now for almost 2+ years and Never, Ever had any ill effects whatsoever. You cannot get High off of Kratom like prescribed Opiates that Kill people.\nI purchased it from online after reading excellent reviews from a certain vendor who had a very good rating with quality, purity and price. So I made a small purchase of several different strains to give this stuff a try as people has said It is a Miracle Herb. All I have to say is WOW, this stuff changed my life completely (and 2 others now as well with 1 being an Iraq War Vet) to feeling like a human being again and getting completely off the Opiates and Lyrica. \nI get complete Pain Relief from Kratom and Absolutely No High Feeling, just absolute Pain Relief and a feeling of normalcy back to my life. I am now helping others with their chronic pain issues and anxiety problems through online forums spreading my story and how Kratom Saved My Life!\nI am begging you to Not Ban Kratom. You will see a very high rise is Opiate overdose deaths if this happens.

I am a 37 year old mother to a 9 year old boy and I live in a nice neighborhood in CT. This plant, Kratom, has allowed me to safely wean off of 50 mg of oxycodone per day, which I was prescribed for my chronic pain. I'm happy to say that I am no longer taking pain medication and can function better with Kratom. Oxycodone made me numb and I couldn't be the mom to my son that I can be now. I use Kratom a few times a week, as opposed to taking oxycodone 5x or more a day. I couldn't control my oxycodone intake and at times I was up to 100 mg a day or more. Kratom is not addictive and it doesn't make me nod off like the pills did. I consider Kratom a staple in my home, very much like coffee and it would be terrible for me and so many others if this ban takes place.  Please reconsider the ban on this harmless plant.

I am a 47 year old wife and mother of four. I have also been employed as Kindergarten teacher for 25 years. I am a hardworking, compassionate and highly skilled teacher, highly regarded by administration and the community I serve. I found Kratom about 8 years ago. My husband, Joe, had been prescribed Vicodin and later, Oxycodone, to deal with severe back injuries due to a work related accident. He, understandably, as a father of four, wanted to be sure to use this medication sparingly, carefully, and to avoid addiction related to its use as much as possible. I began to research other effective ways to manage pain without using controlled substances. Joe has always been careful to NOT drive while under the influence of his medication. Kratom has allowed him to minimize use of prescribed, highly addictive drugs, and still be a responsible father and caregiver to our children while I am at work. Low doses of Kratom effectively minimize pain, without causing drowsiness and the other negative influences of the controlled substances. I have also used Kratom when doctors wanted to prescribe me painkillers following surgeries. Personally, I have found that using a small dose in the mornings when I need to get up ridiculously early, has provided an energy boost and feeling of well being that enables me to have a positive, nurturing impact in the classroom, and maintain the high energy levels needed to manage a classroom full of five year olds all day, and a family of six at home. It has in NO WAY become addictive, I take it occasionally, and have found it only beneficial. Please DO NOT take this helpful herbal supplement away from people. It can actually help to prevent more tragedies such as the drug addiction we hear about on the news so often! Please listen to our voices, and keep Kratom legal and available for people who benefit from its use. Sincerely, Patricia DeCicco","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15477","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been a frequent consumer of kratom for over 6 years.

I am a 49-year-old mathematics professor. I currently teach in a Catholic high school.    I am opposed to the inclusion of Kratom  on the list of schedule one substances. \n\n I have been using kratom  for approximately five years,  and initially I began using this herb  to deal with diabetic neuropathic pain.    I had been prescribed gabapentin, which, while it helped some, had the side effect of making me lethargic, and on able to concentrate fully.   I have a physically demanding job, and I'm on my feet most of the day. It was becoming difficult to perform my job on gabapentin. However, gabapentin did help me with my pain. I found myself in a catch 22.   A friend of mine who has fibromyalgia told me about Kratom,  and what it has done for him. He was very impressed, telling me that he had gotten off of all pain medication due to using it.    I did some research, and started taking the herb myself. \n\n I can honestly say it has been a life-changer for me.  I no longer have to take gabapentin, and I have no side effects to speak of, except for a little nausea now and again. All in all, it's been a godsend. \n\nIPS ABOUT YOUR COMMENTS TO THE DEA\n\nBe honest. Stick to what you know. Be courteous.\n\nYour comment is an opportunity to oppose the DEAs proposal to make the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, two constituents of the kratom plant, schedule 1 controlled substances. This would put kratom -- a plant consumed safely in the U.S for decades and world-wide for millennia, and one that helps millions of people -- on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. The DEA scheduling would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown the primary alkaloids in kratom to be beneficial without causing respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\n I am also aware of researchers wishes to study the herb. There is talk in the metal community of newer, less addictive, and more useful pain medication  being born of Kratom.   It is my hope that this happens. \n\n I thank you for taking the time to read my comment.

I am currently a 45 yr old professional male. I won my own successful company. When I was going through my divorce, I began to have panic attacks and anxiety. I was placed on Lexapro (an anti-anxiety and anti-depressive SSRI) by my doctor. After a year, I realized I have not cried since I began taking this medicine. I also noticed I was like a zombie, going through life like a robot.  no feelings, emotions, etc. I began to search for an alternative and came across Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa).  Did my due diligence and began experimenting with dosage. I found the exact amount I needed and was off getting my life back!\n\nKratom has taken away the anxiety and depression, not to mention the aches and pains I have from chronic back  pain. I have rediscovered my emotions. I am able to see and experience life as I once did before the Lexapro. I am happy, a well rounded and productive part of society again. Everyone around me has noticed the difference. And, some people have even started using kratom because of my positive experience. They have told me how much it has helped them too!\n\nI gave it to my elderly (80yr old) father for his arthritic back.  It was a debilitating disease for him. It spun him down a rabbit hole of depression since he can no longer be active.  After years of steroid shots, physical therapy and surgery, I recommended he try kratom.  Once he did, he could not believe how instantly it helped!  His pain diminished significantly. His depression got swept away and he was able to be active again.  He continues to be active and an integral part of his community.\n\nWithout kratom, I do not know where I would be right now.  but, i can tell you, I would not be where I am now. A successful business man with a happy family (4 children). Same with my father. I was worried he would not have made it much longer, but kratom has turned his life around. He can  now enjoy the last Golden Years of his life.\n\nPlease do NOT schedule kratom in any way or form. It is a harmless, all natural plant that helps millions of people world wide.\n\nSincerely,\nJoseph Sapo","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12530","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Sapo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Yvonne Beard I'm 46 yes old, wife and mother of 4.

I hated being on tramdol, I was moody and miserable.  I wanted to be free from taking a drug that can be addicting and made me miserable I have never abused drugs, nor been in trouble with the law. I love my life and family and would never take anything that would jeopardize that.

I just want to start with thank you for taking the time to read this. I became very concerned when learning about this ban. I'm 34 years old and a father of 2 amazing little boys. I have spent my adult life struggling with alcohol. when I was 21 my ex wife became pregnant. After our honeymoon I found she was cheating. My world was turned upside down and I turned to alcohol. The past 14 years I've felt an urge to escape. I drank alone constantly and hated every sip. It wasn't a high I was looking for it was numbness. I've taken almost every antidepressant and antianxiety medication but that need to numb and escape was always present. A coworker introduced kratom to me and said it helped him tremendously. Skeptical I gave it a shot. I haven't drank since March 8th 2016. Now this next part is very important and why I'm writing you. Since my sober date I HAVEN'T had a single urge. I'M not only talking about alcohol. I HAVEN'T had a single urge to escape my feelings. Im a manager at Home Depot so that is huge with the amount of stress I deal with. I usually take five grams with breakfast. I've never suffered withdrawal or felt I couldn't function without it. I've also never got a high from it. After starting Kratom I have been fully committed solving problems not avoiding them, at home and work. I'm happy, outgoing, and offer help to everyone I pass if I feel they could use it. Those three things are who I am. Alcohol took those traits from me, Kratom helped me get them back. Again thank you for giving me a chance to share this. Please reconsider. Thank you.\n\n\nThank you,\n\nPhilip M.

I have a BS in Chemistry and I work full time in my field.\nI injured my spine on Jan 3rd 2011. I will never forget that day because that is the day my life changed. I live in pain everyday.  Not only is my pain physical but my injury has caused anxiety and depression/stress. I will not have an operation because I have seen what back surgery can do to a person. My only option is to manage my pain.\n\nNo disrespect but I hate western medicine. Every doctor wants to give me a Vicadin Rx. I politely reject them because I don't want to go down that road and become a statistic of the opioid epidemic. I have used Rx opioids on two occasions, when I got my wisdom tooth pulled and when I had a debilitating cough. There is a good use for opioids but in my opinion not for everyday pain management. That is a guaranteed road to addiction. \n\nThe over prescription of opiods in this country is a joke. I received 30 pills for a wisdom tooth operation. I used 6 and threw away the rest. If I used 30 I'd probably be hooked on them. \n\nOne of my friends who suffers from a similar condition recommended that I try Kratom. I cannot thank him enough. Kratom to me , is a very mild alternative that I have no problem using. I brew a cup of tea and in about 20 min it takes the edge off. Just enough to let me do the things I love without pain. I don't get the euphoria that vicadin gives me and I haven't had any adverse side affects. I will recommend it to my mom who has nerve pain in her legs. I will feel safe knowing she is using a plant rather than some active pharmaceutical ingredient from a company who's sole purpose is profit. \n\nI've done my research on Kratom and have read and watched testimonials from other pain patients. From veterans to people with severe genetic conditions. I strongly urge you not to schedule Kratom. That would be a death sentence to many people who will fall back to opiods. It will also limit research on Kratom which is necessary in developing new medicines. We cannot let the opioid epidemic win. We must fight it with education and safe alternatives like Kratom. You have the power to determine which way the opioid war will go. The days of the Nixon drug mentality need to stop. I have faith that you will make the right move. Stand with the people of this country and not big pharma.

AND at unheard of speed without proper due process. \n  This herb has DRAMATICALLY changed my life. I am 54 yrs old and have severe chronic pain due to osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, plantar facetious, peripheral neuropathy  and a few other wonderful things. This is mainly due to over 30 years of abusing my body since I was 12 yrs old as a construction worker. My Dr's told me to \"change your profession, or you will not be able to walk by the time you are 45 yrs old\". \n  I do not like the more extreme prescriptions for my pain, nor the marijuana option. I do NOT like getting a \"high\". I own a retail sales business and need to remain sharp and functional. Kratom dulls my pain to a level that I can function and focus at a high level. And am not focused on my pain constantly every second, even though I am AM still in some degree of pain, it never goes away. A wonderful side effect of this herd is it's energy boosting effect, AND helps with ongoing stress, occasional anxiety and depression. Actually the ONLY negative side effect I have experienced in over 3 yrs of using kratom was constipation the first few weeks. I have had several long periods of abstinence from the herd with NO withdraw effects what so ever.\n  Another VERY personal reason this plant has changed my life is it's help with alcohol addiction. Alcoholism runs deep in my family.  I am an alcoholic, and was using alcohol for pain management to the point it came close to killing me and almost losing everything I hold dear in the process. Cravings are a constant battle. However when I use kratom they are not a threat, if they are there at all. I have NO desire to drink.\n  I can assure you if I was no longer allowed access to kratom the pain and alcoholic craving will likely eventually win. My family NEEDS me. My Daughters, my Grandchildren, my Brother, Sisters and Father NEED ME. The community NEEDS me to stay sober and not just alive, but LIVING my life and being productive. I am a FreeMason and do a lot of charitable work in my community from Food Banks, animal shelters, supporting law enforcement, fire departments, military, schools and most importantly Children's hospitals. \n  PLEASE hear these people and their real experiences. Do not ban this plant that has done SO MUCH GOOD for so many.

However, because my doctor closed his practice, and because of restrictive laws concerning prescribing opiates (there are now NO doctors in my home town willing to prescribe pain meds), I am now resorting to kratom for chronic pain management.  Without kratom, I have NOTHING for pain management.  Unless you live with chronic pain, you have no idea just how difficult daily life can be - unable to get out of bed because just breathing hurts, dreading rainy days and changes in the weather (fall and spring are really problematic) because you know that you are going to be in excruciating pain, unable to enjoy basic things in life (watching a DVD because you have to bend over to put a DVD in the player, for example).  When your doctor closes his/her office, you are not only dealing with chronic pain due to lack of pain meds, but also withdrawal from those meds.  There are a growing number of reports of pain patients committing suicide because they can no longer receive pain meds or find doctors willing to treat them.  This has devastating effects on pain patients and their families.  Keeping kratom legal and obtainable is a Godsend to people like me and to those who have developed dependence/addiction to opiate pain meds.  Kratom could be the answer for widespread heroin and opiate addiction.  To arbitrarily place kratom into Schedule One will condemn kratom into a legal no-man's land, blocking research into the medical uses for this plant and creating yet another black market for desperate pain suffers and adding to the prison population - no one should have to go to prison because they are in pain.  No one should have to die - either by their own hand or because of black market opiate meds - because they are in pain.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3783","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Linda A.

I'm a 39 year old loan processor. I'm writing this statement in opposition of the DEA putting kratom on the list of Schedule I controlled substances.\n\nI began using kratom approximately 5 years ago to help relieve my occasional migraines. I noticed that it helped diminish my pain without leaving me feeling groggy or under the influence like I would feel when I took prescribed medication for migraines, such as Percocet or Hydrocodone. When I took the prescribed meds, I also couldn't work and risked becoming addicted to them. With kratom, I didn't have to worry about either of these significant drawbacks. \n\nWhile taking kratom for occasional migraines, I realized that it greatly improved my mood and helped me with my anxiety. As a result, when I decided to address my alcoholism, kratom became an ally in my journey. My alcoholism was to a point that I needed hospital care the first day to help me detox. I was experiencing tremors and uncontrollable vomiting. The doctors feared that left unsupervised, I would begin seizing. Day 2 of my detox resumed in the comfort of my home. Although the tremors and sickness weren't as bad, they were still present and a couple teaspoons of kratom helped ease both symptoms. As I've continued my journey of sobriety, I've been faced with the brutal reality of why I drank in the first place. Most of my alcoholism was connected to unresolved anxiety and depression. Doctors have thrown a variety of pills at both issues, hoping to alleviate the problem, but the pills never worked. Instead I became a woman with depression, anxiety, alcoholism and an addiction to prescribed medications. Never feeling like the meds were helping, I would have the doctor take me off of them but still, the issues remained. I've been sober for a year and a half and I've never been happier. I occasionally take a couple of teaspoons of kratom and it helps me with my anxiety and depression. It helps me like no pill or alcohol was ever able. My life has changed incredibly. Instead of daily wishing that I would die, and dying within my disease of alcoholism, I'm a thriving woman living life and contributing to society in a positive way. Even at my sickest, I was able to function and keep a job, support my family, but the happiness was missing. My zest for life was missing. I have it now and I contribute much of my success to kratom for helping with my anxiety and depression. The changes that have occurred within me and my life are drastic and amazing. \n\nI'm so thankful I found this plant. My whole life has changed for the better. Please do not put kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. Kratom is a plant that needs to be researched for its beneficial and healthful properties, and explored as a safe alternative to pain medication. In my quest to continue beating alcoholism, depression, and anxiety, I should be able to choose a plant over medications prescribed by a doctor. I should have the right to choose and so should all Americans. I don't want to ever be forced to put the poison of prescribed medications back in my body but feel I will be forced to if kratom is banned. Again, I implore you to listen to all of our stories and realize that kratom does not produce the effects that scheduled substances do and I ask that it not be scheduled as such. Thank you for listening to my story. If you have any further questions, please let me know.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13005","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Iva Carter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi.

It comes from a leaf and is never altered into anything else or have anything added to it. \nI started using Kratom in about 2013. I have been seen by doctors for migraines numerous times. I have several prescriptions for these migraines and they do not even help. I take a little bit of kratom and my migraine is gone within 20 minutes and I can actually function, work and eat.\nI have friends and family who use it as well. People I know who have come off highly addictive pain killers and anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medications. They take kratom now and are no longer are in a blur everyday and can hold normal jobs. People are able to go out and move around, drive normally again, walk without any help, etc. \nIf you put this drug as illegal you will be harming individuals who haven't had the chance to be part of society and finally are able to be.

Before being diagnosed, I abused alcohol to manage anxiety. After my diagnosis, I took a variety of mind numbing drugs (Xanax, Prozac and Buspirone). I no longer take any of these. Kratom treats both the anxiety and all of the side effects (muscle pain, insomnia, etc). It is also cheaper and allows me to manage my own health. It has less side effects and also, in general, allows me to go about enjoying my day. Being on the prescribed medications is like living under a wet blanket.\n\nI am sure you get many similar \"public comments.\" Any danger that lies in Kratom lies in unscrupulous sellers who obtain and distribute tainted products. All \"deaths\" but one involving Kratom have indicated other drugs or products with adulterants (primarily tramadol).\n\nKratom, by itself, is low potency and non-addictive. You may as well go after Kava or Coffee. Consumers, most of which are people with bonafide medical illnesses, deserve a choice in how they medicate their illnesses. Little by little we are seeing our options to pursue natural treatments disappear behind so-called \"drug laws.\" We had this same national debate with Kava Kava in the 1980's.

I believe a grave injustice is being committed by ignoring the myriad of stories discussing the benefits of kratom and not providing substantial cause as to why the decision to make it a Schedule I drug is being made.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14481","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mauricio Behn Ortiz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My friend is still alive becuse of Kratom...

Its primary appeal is that it is mild and conducive to productive activity unlike alcohol. For some it is a much more pleasant and practical way to wind down after a hectic day than alcohol for these reasons. The key point about whether kratom should be permitted by law has nothing to do with its efficacy as a medicine -- I am told it has some -- but instead it is an issue of freedom of individual choice and responsibility. It is and should remain an option that free people can decide to use or not. The government has no place in making these decisions for people when the use of kratom is not dangerous to third parties in any way. I urge the federal government to leave kratom alone and let the individual states regulate it in their various ways as is legally appropriate under the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8 and the 10th Amendment.

A crucial bit of information not discussed often enough is that this substance comes in so many varieties, some with stronger opioid (mood lifting and mild euphoric) effects while others have almost none and provide more stimulant like effects, and also many others with effects in between these.  Most types, In their mildest forms, have a pleasant activating effect like strong coffee, but actually more predictable, and WITHOUT the painful headaches and other ill effects from caffeine withdrawal.  The milder forms with more opioid-like effects also have the enormous benefit of minimal withdrawal symptoms, nothing at all like what I understand persons dependent on opioid pain medications can experience.  As with all agents, the key is what specific form is being evaluated - I am taking about forms with milder opioid like effects (lower concentration forms  with mainly partial mu agonist activity).  I believe there are some available with stronger opioid effects that may cause some uncomfortable withdrawal for some persons, but I do not believe the strongest forms with this problem are even available for sale anymore ANYWHERE in the US, which is a very good thing.  I have read tremendously hopeful anecdotes of persons using this to wean off their prescription pain medications, and can understand how this is possible - it makes excellent sense from a pharmacological perspective.  My opinion is that addiction specialists are too narrow in their use of substances with similar but weaker effects to wean persons off opioids (like other weaker opioid agonists), this substance and anecdotes with it suggest that it may be more effective to use something with both opioid and stimulant effects (like this substance) for persons with opioid dependence.  Opioid withdrawal causes profound suppression of natural activating hormones in a person's body leading to well known crippling tiredness and apathy (suppression of testosterone, among others).  This substance may help boost similar chemicals and make the process much less terrible for persons needing weaning from opioid dependence.  There is tremendous potential here.  Banning this substance and ending the current exploration of its legitimate uses would be a HUGE MISTAKE (especially in the interest of public safety given all that we know and have seen regarding its safety).  I hope more efforts are made to explore its intelligent use for helping to treat our current opioid epidemic and not to BAN this potentially helpful substance in what appears a misguided attempt to address this self same crisis.  This substance is nothing like other schedule 1 opioids - its similarities to opioids are superficial but perhaps just enough to allow it to be potentially useful.  Speak to persons with experience in its use and put them in touch with addiction researchers and clinicians and lets see what they can do to help people - the potential for helping people here is staggering and should not be rejected without careful scrutiny.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1908","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is not a dangerous substance.

I have been using kratom for about 2 years and it has helped tremendously in a different aspects of my life.  I'm writing in to oppose the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances because when I truly believe something that has a positive impact on people's lives (my life), I stand up for it.  \n\nI am an avid gym goer, fitness enthusiast on my spare time.  I also love to play tennis.  It keeps me in great physical conidtion and helps with mental clarity.  However, I was suffering from a few overuse inuries from lifting weights and playing tennis.  One on on my left shoulder (rotator cuff) and another on my left elbow (tendonitis).  It bothers me quite a bit at the gym, or when I serve during tennis.  I started doing some research on the internet and came across kratom.  Long story short, I can exercise almost pain-free and enjoy life again like a normal person.  Another perk of using kratom is that it allows me to stay focused and keeps my energy level high when I'm working especially when I have urgent matters to attend to.  I also found that I am in a better mood and have more compassion towards other people.  Relationships with my family improved and I am more open to share my feelings and communicate with my parents (I'm naturally an introvert).  On the downside, I think it dries out my skin and lips slightly and I have to moisturize much more frequently.

It is absolutely imperative that this plant be researched as throroughly as possible due to its high potential for assisting with both short term and long term opiate withdrawal which translates to saving lives. I myself have struggled with opiate addiction. I am also a United States Marine Corps combat veteran. Opiate addiction was and still is the toughest enemy I have encountered in my lifetime.  \nThe opiate epidemic this country is currently facing is no secret therefore every single avenue of combating this problem should most definitely be explored and exploited. There is no need to restrict the people of something that may not only be beneficial but can make a huge difference in so many people's lives for this is counterproductive and quite frankly unconstitutional. \n       Respectfully, do not make decisions based off of corporate greed (pharmaceutical), or any corruption that may take place. Please do what is best for the people because this country IS the people. Base your decisions on scienctific research and not propaganda. Do not infringe on the people's rights. It is our right to be able to fight the enemy, and in this case the enemy is opiate addiction. Allow us the ammunition to combat this deadly enemy that hides on our own soil, under our own roofs. \n        Please, allow for more research to be done on kratom. It should be researched as though it is a possible cure for cancer because opiate addiction is a cancer to society. Kratom should not be dismissed so easily.

I also suffer from an autoimmune disease that can flair up painfully, without warning, and sometimes for weeks or months on end. When it does, it impacts every area of my life, including my ability to sleep and my ability function at work. My students need me in top form - not exhausted, in pain, or spaced out on prescription pain meds - and kratom is the only thing that allows this to happen.\n\nI've been using kratom for a little over a year now, and its effects have dramatically impacted my life for the better. Different strains have different effects - some are energizing, some are relaxing, and nearly all of them help ease physical pain. \n\nDuring the day, I tend to use the energizing strains, which provide me with an energy boost similar to coffee, but minus the jitters, and with the added benefit of greatly reducing the amount of pain I'm in. (And since my condition is actually exacerbated by the acidity of brewed coffee, being able to skip the coffee but still get the energy is a double benefit.) At no point do these strains mentally impair me or have any effect that could be remotely described as a \"high\", an intoxication, or an altered state of consciousness. I absolutely cannot say the same for prescription pain medications - which I refuse to take during the day, because they DO mentally impair me and interfere with my work. \n\nIn the evenings, I use the more relaxing kratom strains, which tend to offer the strongest pain relief. Some of these have an anti-anxiety, stress relieving effect as well, but like their energizing counterparts, they are not any sort of \"high.\" They simply make it easier to unwind and decompress after a stressful day, and they help ease physical pain so I can focus on whatever work I might have brought home with me, then get a good night's sleep. And unlike prescription pain meds, they don't leave me feeling groggy and sluggish in the morning.\n\nKratom is absolutely NOT a drug, and in my experience with many different strains, I've found several things to be true, time and again: it is not addictive (no compulsion for \"more more more\" etc), it has no recreational value as a \"high\", and the absolute worst thing that happens if I accidentally ingest too much is I get a tummy ache.  That's it. If we're labeling things Schedule I for giving people a stomach ache, I look forward to seeing the Wal-Mart post-Halloween sale aisle up next for Schedule I. Please feel free to put Taco Bell on the list too. \n\nBanning kratom would make criminals out of regular people who are simply trying to live our lives well-rested and without constant pain. For me, the loss of kratom would mean having to choose between constant pain, and relying on prescription pain medications whose side-effects would inhibit my life almost as much as the pain itself. This is not an acceptable choice. Not when both of the above can be avoided with a perfectly safe, completely natural tea leaf that has no more business being labeled a Schedule I \"drug\" than something you might buy from the Drive-Thru at Starbucks.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17858","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am attorney and a law-abiding citizen. A few years ago, my wife, who is only 31, had a traumatic injury to her spinal cord which led her to develop severe neuropathic pain and a disorder called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) -- which has been labeled as an \"orphan disease\" because almost nobody is studying it or attempting to find treatments that work for it despite its prevalence. CRPS has been described variously as \"the pain of cancer without the relief of death\" and \"the feeling of rubbing salt into a raw wound using sandpaper, 24 hours a day,\" among other things. It is colloquially referred to as the \"suicide disease\" because so many people with advanced CRPS choose to end their lives. On a scientifically-normed pain scale, it ranks higher than the pain from serial amputation of the fingers.\n\nOpiate medications, while helpful for CRPS patients who are getting over flares, can actually make the pain worse in the long-term. There are no cures for CRPS, only hopes of stopping the disease from spreading and mitigating the pain. The most effective drug proven to do this is ketamine, however, inpatient ketamine treatments run $60,000 on average and are not generally covered by insurance companies because ketamine therapy is considered \"investigational\" (meanwhile, it is the ONLY thing that has worked for my wife).\n\nKratom, too, proves effective for managing CRPS-related flares, without the negative side effects of opiates for CRPS patients (i.e., it does not advance the disease). While I understand the DEA's concern with opiate and other drug abuse, (1) Kratom is not an opiate; and (2) the final effect of the DEA's rulings should not be to wage war on people in chronic pain. My wife and others with CRPS are suffering. Please do not take away one of the few coping mechanisms at their disposal to make their day-to-day struggles, which are more intense than people without CRPS can ever imagine, bearable.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10612","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Todd Rosenbaum","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Good morning,\n\nI would like to share a personal story regarding Kratom. Back in April 25th of 2016 I met a gentleman through an online dating site and after spending much time together and becoming close friends, our friendship blossomed into a genuine and loving relationship. I personally do not drink or use any drugs and a big aspect of our blossoming  relationship was the fact that he doesn't drink or use drugs either. He had briefly shared that he abused opiates years prior and owed most of his sobriety to Kratom. He explained how it helped him immensely with pain due to suffering from Crohn's and related surgeries he's had. I've tried Kratom  several times for back pain and I must say that it really does work without the adverse effects of strong pain medication. Although I don't personally take it on a regular basis, my boyfriend does and has been the entire time I've known him. Other than the positive impact this has had on his life, he demonstrates no signs of being under the influence of any strong medication that would otherwise address his pain.

Illegal (luckily not in some States). Drink 5 alcoholic beverages whether at your house or at a bar, and you will likely be in the restroom throwing up and your body will be recovering for days!

I am a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen who has experienced many positive benefits from using Kratom. I suffer from anxiety and depression. Yet, since I have discovered Kratom, I have experienced so many positive benefits from using it. It has lessened my anxiety, so that I do not have nearly as many panic attacks as I once did. I have been able to reduce the use of my anti-anxiety medication as a result. My depression has improved, as well, from using it. Kratom has worked with my anti-depression medication to help me become a better  and more productive person. I used to drink alcohol regularly, both during the weekend and during the week. I have since tapered my drinking to what it is today, which is rarely in social situations. I have never experienced any ill effects from using Kratom, nor have I witnessed any with the people I know who use it. I prefer the usage of a product that is naturally grown, as opposed to using something that is man made. While I do still find it necessary to take my anti-depression medication, but if I can cut back on it with using Kratom, then I am much happier. As with everything, care must be taken when ingesting anything. While I would  understand the DEA wanting a system of quality control for Kratom, I do not believe that it needs to be banned. It is not the harmful substance that people make it out to be. This is spread by people who are simply ignorant of it and its many benefits. I would certainly not be taking it, nor my husband either if there were any risk whatsoever. I follow and respect the laws of this great country that I am proud to have been born and live in.

When I was 19 I was in a boating accident that resulted in nerve damage in the lower right side of my back.  This along with suffering from endometriosis has caused a great deal of suffering of the years.  I've had surgeries.  I do physical therapy.  I've been to many different doctors; most of them just prescribed me opiates and looked no further into my issues.  I took the medications prescribed and nothing helped.  They made me ill and had little to no effect upon my pain.  When I stopped taking the medications I went through terrible physical withdrawal for days.  It was horrible. I decided at that point that those medications were not the key to managing my pain and the dependency they cause is scary and dangerous.  While browsing forums on nerve pain and ways to deal with it I observed that kratom was mentioned several times and the testimonials about it's ability to combat pain, anxiety, depression, etc were amazing.  This prompted me to try it.\n\nKratom has completely changed my life.  I went from having pain so severe that I couldn't work to being able to work, clean my house again, and actually have quality of life.  It's manages my pain efficiently without the nasty side effects that prescribed medications have.\n\nMy nerve damage is bad enough that they had me on medications like morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, valium, tramadol, and many others.  NONE of those things helped and they made life worse with their side effects.  Please don't take away the one thing I've found that helps with my pain.  I don't want to go back to having no quality of life.  I don't want to go back to never sleeping, never eating, and never going out due to pain. \n\nThank you for your time.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7289","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carrie Tatum","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 33 year old mother to 2 young children, wife, and full time employee in a corporate environment.  I suffer from anxiety, depression, and chronic fatigue.  I have tried various rx medication to help with these issues (antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds) however the side effects of these medications made it difficult for me to function to the best of my ability.  I struggled daily with these issues until I started using the herbal supplement Kratom about a year and a half ago.  I found out about Kratom from online searches looking for a natural way to help manage my symptoms.  Kratom has given me back my ability to live my life by managing my anxiety, depression and giving me the boost of energy I need, while being mild enough to not give me any unwanted side affects.  I have never had any issues or negative side effects from taking this herb.  I compare the energy effects to that of a strong cup of coffee, while also giving me a slight mood boost, which is enough to help control my anxiety and depression without making me feel \"off\" or like I am on a medication.  I take Kratom now in lieu of coffee.  Kratom has changed my life for the better.  My family and I are very thankful for this natural supplement and I fear for how I will be able to manage my symptoms if Kratom is banned.  This ban would be devastating to myself, my family, and thousands of others.

I've seen physiatrists since I was 14 and tried every SSRI and restless leg Rx produced.  When I was 23 i was prescribed Prozac (80mg the highest dose) and saw a 50%improvement which was amazing considering. Despite the improvement I still had horrible relapse phases and was put on Abilify to work together with the Prozac. It unfortunately did nothing. Then at 33 after having children and restarting the Prozac (I had to wean off during pregnancy), the  effects had decreased and were closer to 25%. After researching  natural  remedies for the anxiety and depression I stumbled upon Mitragynia, thoroughly researched it (I am an RN) and bought a bottle. Two days into taking under the recommended dosage, I started seeing positive changes. After a week of the supplement I felt amazing! I was up to 75% better!!! It wasn't a \"high\" better though. As a matter of fact when I tried to increase my dosage I got nauseated and vomited the rest of the day. (I'm not completely sure how people can \"abuse\"  or overdose on something that causes such severe gastrointestinal distress  if you take over the recommended amount??) I have been taking it two years and I've actually been enjoying my life as a homemaker! I no longer detest doing day to day chores and I have the patience and desire to stay home with my children!  I'm a completely different person, a lot less pessimistic and moody and not near as easily aggravated! My children have noticed because I don't yell anymore!! Factored into that is the fact that I now get a good night's sleep because the Restless Leg is almost completely gone! Before this it was so severe that I was only getting 3 hours of sleep at night with no relief from anything besides  opiate prescriptions (which I will have to restart when kratom is outlawed and I DO NOT want that  because of the PROVEN risk of addiction and clinically PROVEN SEVERE withdrawal symptoms).  PLEASE don't take away the only thing that makes me feel like a \"normal\"  person!! Any time I havn't taken it for an extended period of time, I've never noticed any withdrawals, besides feeling tired and a bit anxious, but that could just be the \"before\"me coming back out!  When I took Effexor (and almost every other antidepressant  I tried) for an extended period of time and ran out for more than 2 days, I felt 100 times worse and had symptoms so severe that I had to stay in bed the whole weekend, until I could get an appointment, because of the debilitating vertigo and extreme body restlessness and nausea/vomiting!! Please, I ask you to consider making it available for 18 years+ at least until further studies and evidence prove me otherwise. I have thoroughly researched and studied kratom to be 100% sure that nothing determental goes into my body. The effects I had from taking Ephedra (which is legal and been PROVEN to cause deaths) were 100 times worse  than anything I've felt while taking this supplement!! If further studies prove me otherwise and prove to show that it is indeed detrimental and has no positive effects I will gladly stop using it!!!!\n      There is overwhelming  scientific evidence and  first hand  testimony of  millions of Americans in support of kratoms  safety  and  efficacy,  the DEA  Administrator  Chuck Rosenberg  is trying  to classify  this TRADITIONAL  TEA LEAF  as a  Schedule 1  drug. This would  effectively  turn millions of  Americans using  this plant  into felons overnight costing taxpayers millions while obliterating  current federal  research on the plant.  Harsh  penalties,  such  as a  felony charge for  possessing  Kratom  (Mitragyna Speciosa) are ineffective,  and  they severely  limit  future prospects for  jobs,  housing, voting  rights,  food  assistance,  and  education-Prospects that  can  be permanently damaging,  while costing  American citizens tax revenue that is better spent on serious crime. The DEA  is more interested  in  maintaining  failed  drug  policies than  in  making decisions based on scientific evidence. The drug war is a failure. Kratom  is a  safe alternative with important  medicinal uses and  has changed  the lives of so  many Americans.  Please contact  the  DEA.  Please  request  an  oversight hearing asking  to delay  this emergency  action.  I  fear  this action by  the DEA  will only lead  to more tragic deaths of  victims of  the opiate  epidemic  by  effectively  casting them back into the current opioid and heroin epidemic.  Tragically  everything  stated  above is just the beginning.  The  grim  aftermath of  the DEAs decision is something to seriously  consider because we will ALL  have to suffer for  it.

I'd like to voice my opposition towards any intent to schedule the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, which would make Kratom (Mitragynaspeciosa), a controlled substance with no medicinal value. From my anecdotal readings (such as www.americankratom.org/success_stories and www.kratomhelps.org/success-stories.html) and personal experience, kratom - a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions while also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally - would be placed unnecessarily on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/15/the-dea-wants-to-ban-another-plant-researchers-say-the-plan-is-insane/) which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; In animal studies where rats were given mitragynine, those rats had no respiratory depression. This opens the possibility of someday developing a pain medication as effective as morphine but without the risk of accidentally overdosing and dying (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/should-kratom-be-legal/).\n. \n\nI have struggled with diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder and Social Anxiety for the greater part of my adult life. Finally, after 11-years of going to different psychiatrists, who put me on various SSRIs, SNRIs, and benzodiazepines, I realized the side effects and addictive qualities of these prescriptions put me in an even darker place. In fact, I had to go to a 21-day detox for the 11-years of daily klonopin my doctors prescribed. When I emerged, I began to feel there was no hope. I joined online anxiety/depression support groups. I learned about kratom in one of those support groups, yet was very skeptical. After thoroughly researching it, I bought from a reputable, online vendor. After consumption, my mood and anxiety improved. My energy level was actually existent and I felt clear headed. For me, it's not a cure-all, I still have to see my psychiatrist many times a year and go to therapy, but it's helped me gain the motivation I need to do those things. I've been using kratom on and off for several years now. I've taken it daily for over a month, then stopped abruptly with no physical withdrawals. Now, I usually try to only take it a few times a week at the most though to keep my costs down. \n\nKratom has helped me and many others. I urge you to carefully review and consider the personal comments you receive. I strongly oppose the scheduling of kratom. This seems a huge injustice and step backwards from the free, progressive country I thought I was a part in. \n\nThanks for giving me the opportunity for my comment to be considered!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4718","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Wilk","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This should not be illegal.

During my childhood I was diagnosed with OCD and ADHD, and anxiety and depression shortly after. In recent years, my depression, anxiety, and subsequent social anxiety have been the most debilitating and lowered my quality of life, at times very severely. Medications prescribed to me have varied over the years; most recently being Zoloft for depression and anxiety, Xanax for anxiety,  and a stimulant ADHD medication. \n\nIn my experience, Zoloft slightly betters my overall depression condition, but does not do anything for my anxiety. Periods of \"situational depression\" have hit me frequently, characterized by feelings of hopelessness and severe depression usually due to a circumstance or life event affecting me at the time. Zoloft, nor any other of the many medications I have tried would help during these times. Feeling there was no solution, I would sometimes turn to alcohol or other unhealthy activities in a desperate attempt to make me feel better, but doing so would always make my situation worse. This is where Kratom is so different.\n\nMy first experience with Kratom was midway through my freshman year of college. I had read many reports of its helpfulness with conditions similar to my own while doing research into depression and anxiety remedies. When a personal situation left me more depressed than I had been in years, I decided to order some and give it a try. Suddenly, somehow, I simply felt OK. I had a positive outlook, my mood was no longer negative, I was able to put my anxieties and constant worry in perspective. The most remarkable part: I didn't feel like I had taken anything. There was no \"high\", no \"buzz\", or any altered state that was simply making me forget about my problems. I was my fully functional self, but I was now feeling alright when I felt like I couldn't. The effects only lasted a few hours but the new outlook I had on my situation persisted long after.\n\nAfter realizing the great potential of Kratom, I began using it somewhat frequently, garnering a wide range of experiences that will help me describe the plant, and all it has done for me, in this comment.\n\nKratom's effects can be felt, but not in a way that resembles any form of intoxication I know of. The positive changes are very subtle, but more noticeable than other remedies such as kava, magnesium, and Chamomille tea. This is important, as being able to notice when I start feeling better makes Kratom more useful than something that may be placebo, or have effects that are so mild that they are of no help. Unlike something like marijuana, which has potential to make some happier but no consistency in its benefits, I have found that I can always rely on Kratom to increase my mood. This has made it a life changer for me in regards to my  depression. In times that I feel hopeless Kratom gives me a more positive perspective, feelings of reassurance and that \"everything will be ok\", and an energy and drive to keep going at times when it is the most difficult. \n\nOne of Kratom's other major benefits in my life is the relief it provides in social situations. I lack confidence at times, and this frequently gives way to anxiety and hesitation when interacting with others. Kratom does not help my social anxiety by disinhibiting me as something like alcohol or Xanax would; it seems to directly increase my confidence and social energy. I have a desire to talk to others that I would ordinarily shy away from after taking Kratom. It doesn't just make social situations I encounter easier, it makes me want to actively approach them. I feel that I am having conversations on my own, not that a drug is allowing me to participate.\n\nI understand the need for research into the properties of Kratom, and am in support of learning more about the plant. Rushing to prohibit it now, however, is a very dangerous move. It would be of great detriment to ban and bury something that could potentially be of great help to so many people. If Kratom were banned, it would easily become forgotten and overlooked. The public is in no danger in the meantime before a decision is made on how Kratom should be available in the US. I have taken too much before and thrown up, but luckily Kratom has a \"ceiling\" of effects so it is simply impossible for one to be hurt from taking too much. There are so many people who have legitimate use for kratom, and companies selling it for false purposes need to be eliminated, as they have obviously been successful in painting an untrue picture of what Kratom actually is. I hope my and others' reports are showing the true nature of Kratom to those who previously may have rejected it.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Drake","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20704","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Drake","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In 2012 I was in a fairly bad accident. I was prescribed some pain meds to help with the pain. After a few months after the pain had subsided I had this overwhelming desire for more pain pills or I felt worthless , lazy, depressed etc. I would seek pain pills at all costs. Anybody that knows me knows something like that is entirely out of my character but it was a reality and the pills were defining me. I was a college graduate on my desired career and life path pre opiates only to become a shell of my former self due to a drug that had this power over me I can't  explain and unless you have experienced it you will truly never understand. I was seeking these pills at all costs financially and morally I was scared of what I would do next to try and keep going. THAT WAS MY LIFE BEFORE I FOUND KRATOM.  \n\nI found Kratom randomly looking for an answer to my opiate problem on a forum a little over a year ago. It had rave reviews I was most definitely a skeptic at first but I was desperate to solve this unfortunate crisis I had found myself  in. I took Kratom and amazingly I wasn't \"high\" I was myself! I had never felt like myself before my accident until than! I was shocked!!! FAST FORWARD TO TODAY AND KRATOM HAS SAVED MY LIFE!!! I am back on a solid  career path and my Kratom use actually DECREASES REGULARLY and eventually I will likely no longer need it to feel like my pre opiate self. I no longer sell my soul looking for a fix.  I have my life, money and family back due to Kratom.  I am truly shocked that I am even having to write this comment.  Our government should protect us and banning this amazing natural leaf will leave myself along with many of my friends that I have convinced to try Kratom instead of opiates vulnerable. I am one of three people I know directly that have had their life saved because of Kratom.\n\nI am pleading for your ear. I am not much different then you or your family.  \n\nI am not a junkie anymore, I am not a thief anymore.  I am a positive contributor to society, I am  the person who went to college with high expectations. I am the person that uses KRATOM for the betterment of myself and society. I AM THE PERSON THAT YOU WOULD BE PROUD OF AS A FATHER, MOTHER, GRANDMOTHER OR FRIEND BECAUSE OF KRATOM!

After a year of consuming the pharmaceutical industry's most powerful painkillers that resulted in negligible relief and extensive side effects, she began taking kratom.  The result was the alleviation of her pain on the first instance of usage and resulted in absolutely no side effects.  She immediately ceased the usage of all prescription pharmaceuticals.\n\nAn additional example is the result of this friend recommending kratom to my mother who experiences constant, severe pain as the result of degenerated discs in her neck and back.  Her first usage of kratom was actually yesterday afternoon and, for the first time in years, did not need her regular afternoon dosage of prescription pain medication.\n\nWhile I am not a medical professional, I know that when loved ones are able to realize relief from pain, and that relief  is derived from nature, I do not want that resource to be frivolously,  illogically or unconscionably taken away from them.\n\nAlthough I am sixty years of age, I do not take any medication - either natural or synthetic.  Should I ever find the need for any type of medication, my first choice will always be naturally occurring substances.  I am not wholly opposed to prescription medications, have taken them in the past and would consider them in the future if I felt they were beneficial.  However, being aware that over 100,000 people die annually from prescription medications it further supports a common sense conclusion that naturally occurring substances - such as kratom - be readily available to the public and not regulated in any form or fashion by the DEA(or any other regulatory agency) and certainly not even be considered as a controlled substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15443","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Keith Holland","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello I would just like to say that for the longest time I have struggled tremendously with mental health issues.

It worked better than the prescribed Percocet or Vicodin that my Dr. prescribed me.  I do not like to take the narcotics the Dr. has prescribed me because so many side effects and problems arise from these very strong drugs.  Kratom is nothing that can even be compared to a narcotic like Percocet or Vicodin.  It does not make you light headed or groggy or just down right high feeling.  For God's sake, Kratom is natural, 100% and has no side effects that I have noticed accept helping my head feel much better from the debilitating pain that comes from a migraine headache.

I have considerable experience using kratom over the past three years and it is inconceivable to me that this substance should be outlawed. \n\nI do not use any drugs and almost never drink alcohol. I am not interested in getting high or taking any substance which harms my health or inhibits my productivity. \n\nKratom's effects are mild and pleasant and non-addictive, in my experience. \n\nKratom in its leaf/tea form provides a slight mood boost, increased focus, a general background sense of well being, and a coffee like energy. \n\nThe most noticeable effect I feel from kratom is simply that it, in a rather subtle way, makes me want to reach out to someone in my life and tell them I appreciate them. Funny as that sounds, that is one of the most consistent side effects. \n\nFor me, the best part of kratom is that it is totally non addictive in my experience.

The news surrounding the proposed scheduling of kratom led me to investigate this drug, as some claim it's effective for all my problems as well as having various other beneficial uses.   \n\nI took my first dose earlier today and I'm a convert.   It's my first day I haven't desperately craved, or had, a drink to help dull the pain.   I had relief from a bad knee that hurts so bad at times I think it'd be better to not have the leg.    I didn't run to the bathroom six+ times for my IBS problems (and employers really aren't understanding of spending over a hour of your work day in the restroom).     I didn't have to make an appointment with a doctor who can't measure my pain, and is so afraid of losing his license for dispensing a controlled substance for pain management that he treats me with suspicion of being a pill addict.   I don't have to worry about becoming addicted to dangerous opiates.\n\nRealistically, I expect there are some big money lobbyists who don't want to see an effective and safe herbal pain reliever on the market.   I don't blame them, it's in their own interests to see kratom criminalized and that's perfectly natural to look out for one's own benefit.   This is my attempt to look after what's beneficial for me, and tens of thousands of others who use kratom to alleviate their suffering.

If that isn't bad enough, direct-to-consumer advertisements are required to give a \"major statement\"; the list of side effect(s) warnings.  According to the the FDA: There is concern that as currently implemented in DTC ads, the major statement is often too long, which may result in reduced  consumer comprehension, minimization of important risk information and, potentially, therapeutic noncompliance due to fear of side effects, the agency said in a statement issued Feb, 2014:  At the same time, there is concern that DTC TV ads do not include adequate risk information or leave out important information. WHAT?  According to an article published in 2014, (prescriptiondrugs.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=005528) there are many prescription drugs that have been approved by the FDA and then RECALLED due to the serious side effects like birth defects, miscarriages, suicidal tendencies, cardiovascular adverse effects (like death, stroke, etc.), gastrointestinal bleeding, liver damage, serious toxicity to the heart, and the list goes on.  The aforementioned side effects are just from the first 6 medications recalled from an alphabetical list of 35.  Two of those 6 are for pain relief.  \n\nAt a time when the opiate addiction in this country is out of control, word spreads of a tea that is SO compatible with the human body, that THOUSANDS have quit killing themselves with prescription medications, street drugs, alcohol, and more.

I am submitting a public comment in opposition of the Drug Enforcement Agency's (DEA) placing Kratom as a schedule 1 drug with no medicinal use.  \n\nApproximately two months ago, I became aware that there was a product that was being sold in a smoke shop that was being used to help provide some relief for individuals with chronic pain conditions.  There was a sign on the door of the smoke shop (Hazel Sky) informing it's customers that the product Kratom was now being sold at half price due to the DEA's intention to place Kratom as a schedule 1 drug making it illegal to possess and use after September 1, 2016.  I was apprised of the use of Kratom as a medicinal remedy for the  relief of pain and other medical/psychiatric conditions by the sales clerk in the shop.  \n\nI have been a sufferer of chronic pain since 1997, when I fell and hurt my neck resulting in the herniation of one of the disks in my neck at C4.  Since I had no medical insurance at the time, I had to cope with the pain without any remedy or relief.  I futilely tried all over the counter remedies with little or no success.  At this time, I was dating a woman who was being prescribed numerous medications (neurontin, gabapentin, flexoril, ibuprophen) including the narcotic Vicodine.  I tried all of her medications but without any success at getting relief from my chronic pain.  I did experience the untoward effect of being groggy and drowsy however.  I later on obtained a 90 count prescription of Vicodine 10 mg that was given to me by a former girlfriend since the medication severely upset her stomach.  I was taking 8 to 9 Vicodine a day with no relief from my annoying and chronic pain.  \n\nBeing desperate for any relief from my chronic pain, I resorted to using Cocaine as a remedy for some relief.  Prior to sustaining the injury to my neck, I am ashamed to admit that I was regularly using Cocaine on a recreational basis.  Since I knew that the Cocaine tended to numb me all over, I began to use Cocaine excessively to numb me and my chronic pain.  I was using about a half ounce of Cocaine costing between $300 to $350 dollars every other day.  I became a functional Cocaine addict since the money I made as a contract psychologist gave me the luxury to buy the Cocaine whenever I needed.  \n\nSince then, I was released from my duties as a School Psychologist at a charter school, though my removal was not drug related.  Due to the pain, I was no longer able to work, as I was no longer able to self-medicate myself without the income that my job provided me.  I am pursuing disability and have sought medical attention through Care Link, a medical assistance program for low income and indigent clients like my self.  The medical evaluations have identified that I have a protruding disk at C4, bilateral carpal and cubital tunnel syndrome (with the left arm being more impaired than the right, lower lumbar arthritis of moderate severity, and symptoms of pain, burning, pins and needles sensation, spasms and cramps bilaterally in my feet suggestive of neuropathy.  I have exhausted my options at a pain clinic with all attempts being futile and one procedure even aggravating my chronic pain. \n\nCurrently, I have found that using 6 capsules of Kratom (2 capsules mixed into a 20 ounce bottle of water) has not cured my chronic pain, but has gotten me out of bed and off my back such that I am able to do physical tasks that prior to using Kratom, I was unable to do.  I have an abundance of energy, I am able to focus and concentrate better, I am not depressed anymore, and I no longer feel useless and hopeless, as I am more able to be a productive member of society with many skills (though not necessarily physical activity) to offer my society.  In addition to pain relief, I am also aware that Kratom has been effectively and successfully used in alleviating anxiety and depression, as well a helping in treating individuals suffering with addictions to narcotic pain medication.  I pray that the DEA will reconsider taking any actions that would eliminate any ray of hope that I have in achieving some quality of life in my later years.  Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0395","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, my name is Matthew Hawkins.

I am a 46 year old divorced mother of 2. I am working as a Personal Assistant to a doctor while I am getting licensed as a real estate salesperson. Since the age of 15 I have had issues with severe depression and anxiety that developed into substance abuse. These issues caused my life to derail considerably for 25 years. During that time I was jailed numerous times, overdosed on opiates and stimulants more than 14 times and put my loved ones and myself through a living hell. 7 years ago I entered into recovery and have not used drugs since. However, my depression, anxiety and fatigue continued to plague me and did cause me to experience a maladjusted life even in recovery. I was introduced to Kratom by a fellow recovering addict who used it for relief from anxiety, depression, and the urge to use opiates. I started to use it regularly 3 years ago for the same issues. I have found it to be a wonderful natural treatment for my depression, anxiety, fatigue and drug cravings with very little side effects. In my experience it is not something that is used to \"get high\". I have had no experience of being \"high\" from it at all. Instead, it relieves my symptoms and enables me to lead a productive life. I no longer feel depressed, tired, fearful and anxious. I no longer crave opiates. I am able to work 2 jobs and care for my children. I have no desire to take more than I need, and if I do I do not feel \"better\" I feel a little sick to my stomach. So I do not over use it. I have stopped cold turkey and experienced very mild withdrawal symptoms but they were manageable and passed after about a week. Kratom has been a safe and effective treatment for my issues while pharmaceutical drugs have not been. I do not deserve to be criminalized for my responsible use of a naturally occurring plant that treats my issues successfully with minimal side effects. In fact I have no side effects and experience success with its use. Virtually any substance has the possibility of abuse by immature users, take alcohol for example, it kills many and is still available to the public, while it has no medicinal value. It is wrong to classify a plant that has a myriad of medicinal uses and has been used by millions of people safely for thousands of years as a Schedule 1 drug. It is completely an overstepping of the DEA to do so. We, as a people have a right to access a natural cure legally for our health conditions, that successfully treats them with minimal or no side effects, without being criminalized. Research needs to be done to establish the medicinal value of this age old plant remedy, and a Schedule 1 classification is absolutely inappropriate and would take this possibility away. Why would harmful pharmaceutical drugs be available to us and directly advertised to us every day on television while a natural remedy would be criminalized? That seems like a corrupt policy to many of us. Please protect our right to our choice of a natural remedy in Kratom. I have faith that there is a way to protect our right to access Kratom while also creating a safe way to assure its responsible use. The DEA is an agency created for the care and protection of the people, please hear us and protect our rights.

Opiate addicts that cannot get their supply will turn to Kratom to help relieve the withdrawal side effects of opiates, which it does. Kratom is NOT an opiate! This is 100% natural unadulterated herb from a tree in the coffee family. Responsible adults take this herb instead of opiates that helps with many ailments including chronic pain. Opiate addiction is at epidemic levels in this nation and i have personally seen how this has changed peoples lives that do not want to take opiates. One example would be my brother who is a Master Sergeant in the Air Force came back from a year long tour in Afghanistan with major PTSD and back problems. He became addicted to legally prescribed opiates from his physician and at his lowest point was taking Oxycodone to the point where he was drooling on himself. He is now a changed man and a functioning member of society. The men and women in our armed services that risk their lives should have an option besides Opiates from Big Pharma.

My back pain suffering began in my early 20's & as the years go by it has become increasingly painful. I am married with 4 kids and am a pretty successful Operations Manager for a 30 million dollar per year retailer where I've been employed for over 14 years. I consider myself a very credible & positive member of society. About 6 years ago I began frequently visiting a medical establishment that specializes in spinal health and back pain. They put me on a \"pain management\" program. Basically that means \"do these stretches and exercises every day and take these opiate pain killers every day\". So I did and have been ever since. Yes they help & yes they allow me to play with my kids & work. Last year I began noticing that my biological clock was revolving around these pills. I was tired of the constipation and dependency. My body would basically stop functioning anytime I even tried to wean down off of them. That's when someone told me of Kratom. While not as strong it actually enabled me to take less of my pain pills & for a while I was taking zero. That is until it was outlawed recently causing me to take my original pill dosage again. I wanted to share 1 experience that I feel is relevant. The 2nd time I took Kratom  I misread how much Kratom was in each capsule so I accidently took over double what I should have. Here is what happened: I got sick & threw it up. 2 hrs later I was fine. So where an overdose of pain killers could kill u, your body simply rejects the Kratom & forces it out. There is no deadly overdose potential. In addition to that you do not get constipated, dehydrated, or nearly get as dependent on it as pain pills. It gives u a healthy energy boost too. In my experience this is the best and safest alternative to prescription pain mess because it's safer and still works to dull pain. This is just my experience and input but having read hundreds of other people's comments I notice many people share these same experiences. I for one would benefit greatly from a health standpoint if Kratom were kept legal.\nThank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3748","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zach Greenough","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is jonathan burgan  i am 30.

My life was unbearable. Please do not ban kratom! I don't believe in Recreational drug use but kratom is not a drug. It is a natural plant that has helped restore my quality of life without negative consequences or the use of prescription medication and I believe I have the basic human right to a natural remedy instead of risky narcotic medication. Please don't ban this plant as I will have no other choice but to take potentially addictive narcotic pain medications due to my medical situation.

I had an accident in December 2007, which caused a 10mm and 5mm lumbar herniation. The doctors prescribed me Norco 5 mg and Gabapentin 100 mg. I was always fearful of developing a dependency but my doctors assured me that I would just taper off, no problem. Well 8 years later I was taking monthly: 90 percosets, 90 Gabentin, 90 Baclofen, 30 dicofenac, 30 prozac and 30 wellbutrin. I was taking psych mess because I developed psychological side effects from opiates and could not stop taking them because of the pain. I decided to undergo surgery in October 2015 because my mental and physical wellbeing was a mess. I was tired of hurting my husband, daughter, mother, father and brothers. In January 2016, I was at my lowest, still taking opiates, hiding them, running out, in pain and hopeless. I decided I was a disaster, failure and maybe heroin would be the answer. Blown away that this was a serious consideration in my head and very scared, I opened up the Internet and googled natural cure for pain and opiate addiction. I discovered Kratom, not very hopeful, I found a storefront in Denver and my life changed forever. I can't count how many times I swore off opiates only to return pitifully. The day I found Kratom was the last day I took an opiate and as an unexpected perk, I slowly weaned off daily use of all the medications I take. I have become the happy, cheerful person I was before my accident. My family has confirmed this and I truly pray that hope is lost and Kratom stays legal. Not just for me but the fiscal impact on our medical system. My medical bills last year were in the excess of 350K and this year a mere fraction, as I pay out of pocket for Kratom.

In 2004 I injured my ankle severely and have since had 13 operations in an attempt to correct what is unfortunately a permanent condition involving degenerative joint disorder, arthritis, and debilitating pain. I was sent into pain management programs and given incredibly high doses of oxycodone and oxycontin for pain relief, as it was determined that my symptoms are of a permanent nature. I eventually developed a dependency on my pain medication, not only for pain, but as an addictive substance. I did significant research on the side effects, short term and long term, of the medications I was consuming. I was in shock as I learned how horrible and long lasting the effects could and would be, so I decided to quit taking medication all together. While suffering through the worst kind of withdrawal, I stumbled across Kratom as a supplement to aid in pain and relaxation. I decided to try, as I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. My experience has been nothing but positive. I have wonderful pain relief and I don't suffer from panic attacks like I did while taking narcotics. I sleep well and am able to keep up with daily life as a result of using kratom as a supplement. I only ask this question. How is an herbal and completely natural substance with a very useful purpose being called into question as a dangerous substance when patients have access to hundreds of narcotic pills that can cause birth effects, prevent pregnancy, cause horrible withdrawal symptoms and permanent kidney and liver damage and no questions are asked simply because a doctor's signature is on the prescription pad?

I am a 62 year old Grandmother, soon to be Great Grandmother. I am a gainfully employed, full time dental assistant . I have been assisting for almost 36 years and yet Ive only worked in 4 offices. My work record is outstanding and I am very proud of it.\n I have been using food supplements, vitamins and minerals for most of my life. I take Coral Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, beta carotene, Cats Claw, Kava kava, Turmeric, Yerba Mate, melatonin and many more. These supplements are beneficial to my health and well being.  I will continue to take these and will add any others that I believe will help me stay healthy and well. I also grow many of my own vegetables because I know that mine are safe for my consumption. I know that they havent been tampered with in any way.\nOne, of the many supplements that I consume is Kratom Tea. I found Kratom tea at a local Ethobotanical Tea Bar. My husband and I went there because neither of us drink alcohol and we saw the sign out front that said, No drugs or alcohol allowed. It turned out to be such a friendly place, we go there, now, not to a bar.\n Kratom tea has helped hundreds of thousands of people in many ways. I drink a cup of kratom tea every day instead of drinking coffee. I have been drinking Kratom tea for approximately 3 years. I do NOT consume ANY substances to get high. I am not, nor have I ever been, addicted to ANYTHING.  In order to perform my job, I must be alert and on point every step of the way. I have to think one or 2 steps ahead of the doctor because I have to have the dental tools ready when he needs them. It is a finely tuned ballet of 4 hands, working efficiently together to accomplish the best possible result for our patients. I would never consume anything that would fog my mind, make me jittery or sleepy. I always want to be the best dental assistant I can be. One doctor, who I worked for from 1986 through 2003, used to call me Radar (after the M.A.S.H. character) because I was so good at knowing what he was going to do before he was ready to do it.\nThe War on Drugs has been a big money maker for many people; however, its truly been a huge disaster. If Kratom is made a schedule 1, I would instantly become a criminal. How horrific! \nThe FDA even has a section on their web site called the FDA Death-O-Meter. This is unbelievable to me.\nIsnt the FDA supposed to protect us from foods and drugs that will harm us? Maybe you should look at the approved medications, prescription and over the counter that are killing peoples vital organs, before you give the go ahead to the banning of a natural herbal substance.\nDrinking Kratom tea is one of my constitutional, God given rights. Life and liberty.\nI believe that Kratom should continue to be studied and tested. I believe that it may have several medicinal benefits. If it is placed on Schedule 1, research would be severely restricted.\nI believe that the earth provides plants for a multitude of ailments and it is my right to use those plants instead of a man made synthetic and possibly poisonous imposter. Kratom is NOT AN OPIATE! Kratom is safe!  Despite the reports of some shock media, Kratom is not a \"new exotic drug.\"\nKratom is a natural botanical that has quietly been part of the American economy for at least 2 decades. Hundreds of thousands of mature adults suffering from chronic pain have used Kratom for years.\nLikewise, commercial Kratom has been on shelves for years but never caught on as a 'legal high' because it's recreational potential is limited. If Kratom was anything like heroin, it would have seen instant popularity and gotten national attention and prohibition a decade ago.\nThere will always be people who will abuse things.  People sniff glue, aerosol spray and shoe polish liquid, for heaven its easy to explain why Kratom is much safer than prescription opiates or hardcore drugs.\nKratom, unlike prescription drugs or heroin, DOES NOT slow down your breathing. \nThat reason alone is why nobody has died from Kratom and why nobody ever will.\nOverdose deaths (from heroin or other opiates) are largely a result of the brain or body not getting enough oxygen. Kratom does not significantly impact your central nervous system and there is no such thing as \"overdosing on Kratom\". Overdosing\" results in the user getting nauseous, wanting to take a nap or at worst - throwing up. sake! If everything, that COULD be abused were made illegal, EVERYONE would be jailed!\nI am a law abiding, tax paying, voting citizen and I should have the right to legally consume tea, Kratom tea.\nI do not trust the FDA to keep me safe from medications. I do not trust the pharmaceutical companies because I KNOW that they care ONLY about their CEOs and stockholders.\nI DO, however, trust myself to take care of my body and my mind.\nThank you for reading my opinion.\nRespectfully,","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2170","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rebecca Jamin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps me sleep without taking prescription pills... no side effects, no weird feelings.

The marketer's of these products made some very strong (as well as false) claims as to the efficacious nature of their blends. There was even a time when machines were sold to extract paparavine from lettuce as a natural pain reliever. This \"substance\" was called \"Lopium.\" So, after many years of attempting these grand failures, I perceived Kratom as an over-marketed failure, just like all the rest.\nI was very intrigued, when a long-time medically dependent opioid patient was able to stop using all opioid narcotics (including Methadone) and he claimed to be as pain free as on the opioids. I immediately searched for Kratom, in August of this year, and while I could order the leaves, there was a warning about your rescheduling of Kratom coming approximately 45 days later. I have spent most of my medical career involved in the study of \"ethnobotanicals\" and I will not flush my career over pain relief that I now receive from opioid related pharmaceuticals.\nMy desire was to order a kilo of Kratom, study the leaves for comparative safety, and use myself as a test case as I have a rare form of Cystic Fibrosis that attacks the GI system and the pancreas. Cystic Fibrosis patients produce few to no endorphins of their own and, to me, there is no difference between a bruise and a broken leg. Before my disease situation was diagnosed, pain ruled my life. Pain told me when I could wake, fall asleep, eat, and even pleasure my wife. So, as dearly as I hated to do it, I made a pain contract and my life turned around a full 180 degrees. With the CDC's edict on opioid abuse, not contractual use by a doctor one sees regularly and stores all opioid medications in a locked and secure location, pain patients are being dumped to a severely disabled state all across the country. This is neither the prevention of abuse, nor is it anything resembling compassion.\nI urge you as well as your counterparts to seriously research this substance. I would happily join the research program as it was my studies with American Indian ritual hallucinogen use and my studies with LSA that paved the way for Eli Lilly to pose that research on Prozac was safe in the daily clinical setting, although I have never met any American Indian who would use such substances daily. If Kratom can safely wean a person from Methadone and even act as a first line detox/maintenance substance, it must be studied very seriously. I wish I could tell you how successful it was for me, but I do not take any old pile of leaves marketed by a foreign country. It takes a great deal of \"anecdotal\" evidence to convince me of the benefit of any herbal remedy, but this particular substance (Kratom) has piqued my, deeply concerned, interest.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8597","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Lee BSHA/HM/RM","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI think that Kratom should be legal, it seems to have alot of medicinal benefits and needs alot more research.

I have not had a prescription since, save a small amount after a root canal last year, nor have I taken anything available on the black market.

I was relieved to see that the DEA decided to postpone the Kratom ban in favor of a period for public comment, but I will not be fully relieved until I know that I, and countless others, will have safe and easy access to Kratom. \n\nFour years ago I was diagnosed with depression, and as a result of that depression, have low motivation and social anxiety. Kratom, in conjunction with an SSRI, has had a life changing effect on my condition and allowed me to succeed in the ways I always wanted to. I finished my bachelor's degree and will continue my education in international comparative drug law; all while maintaining a full time (or more) job. \n\nMy use of Kratom has been discussed with my therapist and psychiatrist, and both see little harm in using Kratom, especially when its positive effects are taken into consideration. \n\nI understand that the DEA wants to keep harmful drugs out of the hands of people in the US--something I completely agree with. However, Kratom is not one of these drugs. We have seen time and time again that drugs which are easy to produce are very hard to prohibit. Rather than deny research or personal use, please regulate the Kratom market to ensure good, unadulterated product and fair, taxed prices. \n\nI am not against Kratom regulation, but I am against its prohibition. We are in the midst of a rampant opioid epidemic, Kratom is understood colloquially as a safer alternative to heroin or fentanyl and its analogues. Here I only list two of many possible positive things Kratom can do for our citizenry.  \n\nThis plant is not worthy of prohibition. \n\nSincerely, \n\nTyler Nichols","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3957","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tyler Nichols","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My wife has chronic pain due to a mysterious and untreatable condition called interstitial cystitis.

My legs and sometimes whole body jerks uncontrollably. Mostly at night, but I have it mornings and daytime as well. Anytime I am tired. I have it day and night . My prescription medicines knock me out and make me drowsy (Ropinerole and Clonazapam) I also take in the morning Topamax. Mid afternoon or early evening when I am working out of town and up ladders I use Kratom (in the coffee family)  as I don't get drowsy. I am sober, working and it stops the jerking and relieves the symptoms. If I take the prescribed meds and ride in a car I have seizures. This has happened several times a few years back and I have feared it would kill me. The last seizure I vomited., lost my bladder, and seizures repeatedly. I can NOT take those meds and ride in a car. The Kratom WORKS! I travel around the state painting window signs every day and need to work and travel. Kratom allows me to lead a normal productive life. I am not high. I am 58 years old and very successful in my sign business. It has been a miracle for me. Without Kratom for my condition I will SUFFER in hell.  I have used Kratom since I read about it 6 years ago when I heard it helped Parkinsons and Restless Leg Syndrome. My meds are also Parkinsons meds so I tried it. I have tried many herbs and even pot and nothing else ever worked. I do not like being high. Kratom does NOT make me high. It has been a real blessing for me and both the doctors I have had think it is wonderful and approve.  My current doctor thinks it is insane that DEA would compare it to an opiate as it is very mild. And she agrees I will be in a very horrible situation if it is banned. It IS MEDICINAL. That is why pharmaceuticals are patenting it. At LEAST offer a medical card for people like me who. I am a responsible adult who NEEDS this herb for my quality of life. The Bible says \"Yours is the Earth and Everything In it.\". God made Kratom to heal my condition. That is my right to feel well and no one should deny me. Do the RIGHT THING. Keep Kratom legal.  Kratom allows me to take a break from the prescription medicines so K can ride in a vehicle in the evenings and not have a seizure. I need Kratom to relieve RLS . I NEED IT. IT IS NOT RECREATIONAL IT IS MY MEDICINE FOR RLS. There is NO DANGER. Too much Kratom is not fun, it would give someone a headache and nausea. It is NOT a party drug. It is mostly used by older adults who are in control, using for MEDICINAL purposes. Not for fun.. People mention psychoactive properties or euphoria. I don't experience any of that. All it does for me is alleviate the jerking and relax my legs and body from the horrble spasm I SUFFER every day and night otherwise. And prevents the seizures while riding in the car. PLEASE PLEASE understand. Feel free to call me and see I AM SOBER any time day or night I would love to speak to anyone who wants to know more about it or understand the effects or lack of about Kratom. This herb is VERY misunderstood. I don't drink or smoke pot. I don't like feeling out of it. Kratom is what I have to have to survive through this miserable condition. It really DOES RELIEVE RLS. I wrote letters to FDA and Naturopath Ass years ago to help others. Please do what is right for me and others with my condition.

I have however heard numerous stories at meetings about people using it successfully to come off of opioids that are potentially lethal.  I have been on suboxone for 15 years, the only time i have been off of it is when I was using much stronger drugs such as oxycodone.  When my doctor gave me suboxone 15 years ago he told me that it had zero abuse potential and minimal withdrawal effects and i have learned the hard way that neither of these is true despite those claims which were made by its manufacturer when it was brought to market.  If something natural exists that could help people get off life threatening drugs and not have to get hooked on another powerful drug like suboxone then i am all for it.

To ban Kratom is counterproductive in the war on illegal drugs and their effect on society.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15888","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Gavin McKenna and I'm 36 years old. I work in the High End Audio industry.  I have a B.S. in Human Performance and Wellness from Weber State University.  I have been on Kratom for 6 months for anxiety and depression. It has literally saved my life.  I have been off and on anti-depressant, anti-psychotic, and anti-anxiety medications for 15 years with little success. The negative side effects of these medications has always outweighed any positive effects. I have PTSD from the physical and emotional abuse I endured from ages 5 to 11 by my stepmother.  I've been in therapy for the last year and it has helped but I was still feeling like I  was running out of options of ever feeling like a normal human being again.  Thoughts of dying had been in my mind for 15 years but now thoughts of suicide had began to enter my mind. I heard about kratom on a well respected podcast and thought I'd try it.  I can honestly say that since I've been on kratom I have a new outlook on life. No more thoughts of dying or suicide. I have a new found energy and most importantly hope for the future.  I have experienced no side effects except for a little nausea if I take too much. I have even been able to successfully get off of caffeine, which is something I've been trying to do for years.  My desire to drink alcohol has reduced to only on special social occasions and only in small amounts. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE don't make Kratom illegal. It has made me a better person and a better member of society.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14965","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gavin McKenna","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Krater sounds like a gift from heaven for sufferers -- pain relief that's not addictive.

When I first started having the pain, I saw a pain doctor who passed out opiate prescriptions without warning of what could happen to my body if I used them long-term. Then, when regulations on opiates got more strict, the people who needed the opiates for true pain were having more difficulty getting pain relief.  Recently, I made the decision to stop taking opiates because I was starting to have a lot of long-term side effects.  An online support group had a discussion about kratom one day. I decided to try it.  I find that it helps with the pain without the side effects.

It cannot alone cause death. People use it to remove toxic addictions from their lives, and to treat conditions that other medications cannot relieve. People use it as a healthier alternative to sleeping pills, anti-anxiety medications, and as a social lubricant much like others use alcohol. Some even use it to battle alcoholism. If anything, kratom should be promoted, not banned. There needs to be more concrete research performed on how this substance operates in the human body and why it is so powerful. The government is supposed to take care of the citizens, not cause them undue burden. By taking this plant away, the government would cause an undue burden without sufficient justification, and on a vastly unsupported basis. Moreover, to schedule kratom on the same levels as addictive and lethal substances like crack cocaine and heroine is just unfounded and unsound. I do not think a government as intelligent and informed as ours should be so comfortable classifying kratom in this way. If anything, hold kratom to research, the same way medical marijuana is being held, and regulate it so that the best quality can be made available to those who need it the most. Tax it even, like alcohol and tobacco is taxed. As a nation, we cannto be so quick to label kratom or any substance that we don't know enough about as a harmful substance. It would be irresponsible for a government for the people to do so.

I am firmly against the ban taking place and feel that kratom is a very useful herb that saves lives.  I first used kratom ten years ago, when I was 18.  I was seeking natural alternatives to anti-depressants as I had been suffering with depression and anxiety for years.  I found kratom to be useful but did not use it for a very long time (6 months.) Through adulthood I continued to struggle with depression and alcohol abuse.  I desperately wanted to feel happy and I desperately wanted to be sober.  I was also struggling with severe anxiety.  These issues held back my progress as a person.  I started taking kratom again about 3 years ago.  Since being on kratom I have moved to a town I love, I am a full time student and I also work full time.  I have also almost entirely stopped drinking.  I still have drink sometimes, but my relationship with alcohol has become light years healthier.  I am the happiest I have ever been, and feel motivated to improve my life and relationships.  I use kratom almost daily, and I have quit using it for long periods of time.  The withdrawals I experience when I stop using kratom are milder than the withdrawals I experienced when I stopped consuming caffeine.  As I am sure you have heard a lot by now, kratom is not deadly.  I have taken too large a dose of kratom before and it is not pleasant.  It makes you dizzy and nauseous, but it certainly does not kill anyone.  Any account of kratom causing deaths has been the result of the victim mixing kratom with other drugs that are lethal on their own, or the victim has a pre-existing health issue.  Kratom is a very difficult herb to abuse.  I never feel \"high\" on kratom.  I am a person who has dabbled with different illicit substances, but I have no desire to be high on anything at this point in my life.  I would compare kratom to coffee in the energy it gives, but more positive.  Kratom energizes and enhances your mood, without the anxiety too much coffee can sometimes cause.  I do feel that it would be helpful for kratom to be better regulated.  I think an age requirement of 18 would be a positive thing, but in the same manner that I think an age requirement for caffeine would be a useful thing. \nAll in all, I find kratom to be a very useful and safe herbal supplement.  There are very few side effects, very minor withdrawal symptoms, and a low affinity for abuse.  If kratom is outlawed it will ruin lives.  The quality of my life will certainly be affected in a negative way.  Not to mention all the people using kratom as treatment for opioid/opiate addiction.  To ban kratom is the absolute opposite of harm reduction.  It is so much safer than all of the drugs people are using kratom to replace.  Please think of all the negative effects this ban will have on people.  Make an intelligent decision that is not influenced by pharmaceutical companies money.  Kratom is a great and safe herb that deserves to stay legal and have further research conducted on it's uses.  Please, do not ban kratom.  Please think of all the people who have vastly improved their lives with this herb, and all the potential further studies on kratom can accomplish.\nThank you,\nBrian Brownell","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1557","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Brownell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it concerns...I just wanted to state my opinion on how kratom has changed my life ...it has made me a far better wife, mother and person all around, I no longer experience pain and fatigue it has given me the energy I need to perform everyday tasks that were once to difficult for me to do it has completely changed my outlook on life and I no longer suffer from anxiety and depression and I hope that I never have to go back to my old life without it...\n\nSincerely, Crystal Holmes","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14832","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Crystal Holmes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\nMy name is Anthony Marrero and I am against banning kratom. When I was around the age of 19 I started to struggle heavy with anxiety and depression. I've always been the type of person that was against taking medicine or self medicating so I dealt with anxiety to the highest extent with absolutely no support or help until I came across kratom. When I first started taking kratom it helped dramatically, I would add a small amount into my tea or coffee before work and add some before bed and it made my anxiety just disappear. Unlike pills or other medications it didn't numb my mind for a temporary time only for my mind to think even more without it, it did the complete opposite. It made me face the problems and issues I had in my life head on without having a feeling of uncertainty in my heart all the time. Eventually I started taking less because it wasn't needed for mornings anymore, I felt normal and all my social anxieties and fears were something that weren't there anymore. I'm now 24 years old and although I don't take kratom on a daily basis and it's not a big reason for my ability to curve my anxiety I know for a fact that it can be fore others and it can really change lives. I'm a successful employee at Tesla that trains my mind and body every single day and I'm completely happy with my life, if I never found kratom to get me through that time of vulnerability and fear I don't believe that I would be here to say that. Kratom is not a drug, it's not even close to a drug. If you spoke with anyone who has taken kratom I can 100 percent guarantee that they will not seem intoxicated or out of it at all. They will come off as intelligent and goal oriented like any normal person would. Kratom doesn't get you high, it simply helps you curve anxiety and gives you the freedom of making your own life worth living. I don't have a statistic chart or any numbers to give you but I can confidently say that kratom has saved my life and gave me a chance to live outside of anxiety and fear, please don't take it away from people who need it as bad as I needed it at 19. marijuana was just legalized in California and that is something that effects your ability to function so if that's the case then why can't you make it so a medical card or a restriction on age is what is required for people to access it. If you stood in a room with ten people who have tried kratom and pharmaceutical medicine and asked them if they would like pills or kratom to medicate I can bet anything that all then of them would say kratom because there is no addiction, hangover or detox with kratom. I don't really know of any drugs that you can say that about. \n\nThank you for taking your time to read my comment and i hope with all of the public's comments you understand that banning this will ruin thousands of people's lives and in the end probably cause depressed/anxious people to end their lives. \n\nI appreciate you.\n\n- Anthony E.

In the last two years six of the veterans I meet with regularly have spoken about Kratom. To my knowledge none of these veterans know each other and I did not tell them about Kratom. They all found it on their own, all through other veterans, in some cases people they deployed with. They all sought out Kratom for slightly varrying reasons and it has effected them all in different ways, but several things are consistent:\n\n1. All 6 are adamant that their Kratom experience has been completely positive \n2. All 6 reported feeling of well being, which has in turn helped with their personal battles against PTSD\n3. All 6 reported large increase in motivation, with a net benefit to their employment and family.\n4. All have a newfound sense of hope.  \n5. All 6 feel that the positive benefits have helped them take positive steps in their personal relationships            \n\n\nThe fact that these are consistent across the board for 6 Veterans, all with different experiences, varrying support networks and no direct contact with each other is proof in itself that this plant is not a danger but closer to a miracle. I am baffled as to why the Federal Government would find it in anyone's interest to criminalize this or even regulate away people's access. With millions of young Veterans having served in OEF/OIF and coming home with injuries, both seen and unseen, a plant like Kratom is something that should be embraced not shunned. To take this away from these people who have fought in our Nation's longest war is criminal, negligent and contrary to the freedoms that inspired many of these Warriors to serve their country.

I have dealt with a great deal of depression and anxiety throughout my life due to a lot of loss and health problems stemming from my Bone Marrow transplant as a child. I now suffer from an immune deficiency known as SCIDS. During my depression I depended on alcohol as a crutch which in turn got me into a lot of trouble with my family and friends. Kratom has been a life saver for me as it is a genuinely harmless plant. It elevates your mood to energetic and motivated, it does not do it in a psychedelic sort of way, but just in a all around feeling. It reminds me of a feel good coffee as it is derived from the exact same family. It also helps with decreasing consistent pain. I have suffered from hand warts due to my immuno deficiency and they constantly hurt and throb. Kratom has helped to release and subside much of this pain when drank as a tea or added to my coffee.  I truly would encourage you to please consider leaving this plant as a legal leaf that it is. After reading a lot about the plant it has also proven to help people ween themselves even more serious drugs such as Heroin and other nasty things. It is an all around beneficial product and needs to be researched and utilized as a life saving medication instead of a regulated and punishable drug.

I'm writing you today to voice my staunch opposition to the DEA's plan to immediately make the alkaloids in the Kratom plant Schedule I substances.\n\nI have been using Kratom for nearly 3 years. During my years as a high school/college football player, I required a number of surgeries on my knees and wrist. I have lived with constant pain stemming from these surgeries, and Kratom has really helped me control that pain. Additionally, Kratom has helped my sleep improve tremendously. It is a wonderful plant. \n\nI'm by no means in as dire a situation as many of the people providing their heartfelt testimonies on how Kratom has helped them overcome such conditions as PTSD, depression, addiction, etc., but I am just another example of how this wonderful plant can make a positive difference in the lives of every day Americans. I have introduced a number of friends and acquaintances to the plant and have seen them control their opiate addictions. I have spoken with a cancer nurse here in Waco who provides the plant to her patients to help control their pain and improve their mood without the use of harsh chemicals. The plant has been a difference maker in so many American lives to date, and I implore you to consider all of the benefits this plant provides. \n\nI, and others who have experience with the plant are not asking for the government to simply leave the Kratom alone. We all would love to see increased research on the effects of Kratom, on how it could be used as treatment for certain ailments, on how cultures have used it throughout history, etc. Scheduling it immediately before beginning this research will take this treatment away from thousands of people with little to no hope of ever getting it back. This plant has the power to change lives, and again I encourage you to rule against scheduling the plant. \n\nI very much appreciate seeing a government agency taking the time to really listen to the people in a time where many feel their voices aren't heard. Thank you for your time and effort!\n\nSincerely,\n\nWilliam V.

My pain started when I ended up with a herniated disc in 2003. I was 21 and still very young. I ended up with a lot of problems down the road and had to work jobs that didn't require a lot of lifting or bending. I went through doctors and chiropractors and physical therapists. I had my first child in 2004 and had my second child in 2006. I ended up having an L5-S1 disctectomy in July of 2010. I thought that would help with the pain but in all honesty, it stayed the same. I ended up seeing a pain management doctor who then prescribed me Percocet for the pain. I quickly became addicted to pain pills. They were all I had to keep the severe pain at bay. I had moved from Minnesota to Alabama in 2011 and couldn't find a pain management Doctor down there. Once my pain pills ran out, I went through severe withdrawals I had ever experienced. I still went through quite a bit of back pain. I moved back to Minnesota in 2014. I ended up getting injured on the job in 2015. I ended up with a herniated disc and another bulging disc along with degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis. I also have arthritis and tendinitis in my spine. The pain can be excruciating most days and can't do what I want to do with my children. When the pain is severe, I will isolate myself and it's not fair to my kids. I was told about Kratom from a good friend of mine. I had done a lot of research before I ordered some. Kratom literally takes almost 100% of my pain away. I can do things that I never thought I could do again. Pain pills only work for two or three hours, Kratom works for five to six hours so I don't dose as much. This plant is amazing and I haven't taken pain killers since finding out about Kratom. Please don't schedule this amazing plant.

I am not trying to beat a heroine habit.  I'm a software engineer who suffers from chronic back pain.  I don't like to take acetaminophen because it's very bad for the liver, and I also hate to take ibuprofen because it gives me stomach aches.  A nurse friend of mine recommended that I try an herbal solution - kratom.  I rolled my eyes at the time because I assumed that a plant couldn't offer me any real pain relief.. otherwise I would have heard about it by now, right?  \n\nI take two caplets in the morning and two after lunch, and my back pain is gone.  Incidentally, I also found that it was a more effective stimulant than coffee, which offers much more severe side effects.  I have been living caffeine and pain free since I discovered this supplement and I am truly floored by the idea that we are even considering a ban.\n\nI had no idea that my government could reach into my cupboard and unceremoniously decide for me that I should have to live with liver damage, nausea, or back pain... because.. ?  I'm still not clear on the because part of all this.  Because it might act on the brain in similar ways to opiates?  Is this some horrific sin on its own, when it causes no demonstrable harm?  It was my understanding that the privilege of emergency scheduling was afforded to the DEA in order to combat the rapidly produced synthetic drugs that pose a clear and present danger to our public.  This is not happening right now... public opinion on kratom ranges from \"What's that?\" to \"That literally changed/saved my life.\"  The number of deaths that are 'linked' to kratom is laughable to anyone with a college-level statistics class.  \n\nI have done nothing wrong by availing myself of this natural form of pain relief.  You are not better than me because you use Advil instead... Or caffeine, for that matter.  The number of people killed by eating dishwasher detergent pods last year is much greater than the number (inconclusively) linked to kratom.  And hey ok.. folks are less likely to want to eat detergent pods so let's get away from the substance itself and talk about usage... You allow us to kill ourselves with alcohol and cigarettes, but you want to forbid us from the mild stimulant/pain reliever offered by kratom.  How in the world can you logically justify this ban?  \n\nI am not a criminal.

It erased most of her memory and cognition, even words and basic motor skills. She is ambulatory, wild and dangerous. She does not comprehend our world and will not pick up objects, but will wander into them and respond with aggression if touched or held. She requires 2 people  to dress, toilet bathe. One to calm, the other to assist with movement. Her body functions but her brain doesn't. Since FTD is a dementia simiilar to Alzheimer's, the doctors tried the usual drugs to calm her 'hellish' behavior. The drugs just doubled her over 90 degrees and she couldn't straighten up. She was still hellish and also drooled as she bumped into walls.\nWe have never been imbibers of any kind, but on the thought of her doctor saying that her brain is in chaos, we gave her a glass of wine.

I have since turned my life around and become a contributing member of society.  I have also helped many people do the same and get off of the opiat highway that is so easy to get trapped on.

The pharmaceutical drugs taken instead of Kratom cause serious and fatal side affects. Kratom is all natural and has no serious side affects. I personally know many people turning to kratom instead of prescription drugs, even doctors recommending their patients use Kratom opposed to pharmaceuticals.  If the government schedules this amazing plant as a drug, not only will it fuel the black market, it will seriously affect the health of millions of Americans who use this regularly to help improve their quality of life.

It began slowly but by the time I was 23 it hit me full force destroying my life. I spent literally a year in bed never leaving the house.  Pretty depressing for someone in their prime. I was a competitive athlete (soccer, cheerleading, track) active community member & represented our country worldwide as Miss USA International. I founded the \"S\" Club (a community service club linked to renowned Soroptomist Int'l) @ my high school serving as charter president. After college I lobbied in front of Congress for funding for the U. C.collegiate system. After moving to the Netherlands the severity of my pain inhibited me from finishing my law degree & interning at The Hague. I was forced to move back to the US & live w/ my mom. Thank God for her!  Fib to has impeded my ability to make a living, feel like a productive member of society or even a contributing partner in relationships. Basically negatively affecting every aspect of life. The worst part is feeling like a burden for my loved ones. After numerous doctors, therapies (homeopathic, psychological, physical) I found being on controlled narcotics was the only way I had any relief. However the effectiveness decreased w/ time making the high price associated w/ them (side effects,cost, inconvenience) not worth it. After 7 years decided risk outweighed the benefit & stopped going back to withering pain & ceasing normal life activities. I couldn't move let alone work.  One day on my feeble daily attempt to exercise I walked by a shop selling Kratom. Trying it literally changed my life. The relief of my pain was immediate it didn't alter my mind state or have debilitating side effects. It simply relieved the pain allowing me to start living again at 34 years old. Ironically Kratom has allowed me to be more active hence helping my fibro which leads to having to take even less of it. I've also been able to stop taking 2 other medications including an anti-depressant. Completely opposite of opiates which often lead to higher dosages, other medications to treat side effects, respiratory failure,severe withdrawal & even death. Having sleep apnea the respiratory risks were even greater every time I went to sleep. How can that be legal given the number of fatalities each year? My cousin who suffered the same affliction passed away in her sleep at a mere 35 years old. She was back east with her 11 year old daughter who was participating in a karate tournament. This poor child had to wake up to find her mom dead while being thousands of miles away from home and her family.  Imagine the horror that child endured waking up to that in a strange place. My cousin was not known for drinking or any other recreational drug abuse but like me came from a family history immersed with sleep apnea.  If Kratom is banned I feel like I'm given two choices. Be trapped in bed again riddled with pain or forced to restart numerous medications which in fact could be a death sentence. Im completely unwilling to use medicinal marijuana even if it is legal due to its mind altering effects. I can't tolerate the feeling of being impaired and not in control of my senses. Kratom doesn't have this effect nor any withdrawal symptoms I've experienced with opiates. I guess I don't understand the logic when there are so many legal treatments with way more risk of harm. I'm not trying to knock any other treatments simply pointing out the increased danger found in legal alternatives.  When I discovered how well Kratom worked I told my family and friends just wait tell the pharmaceutical companies catch on, they'll have it banned in no time.  Sadly enough I was right. I'm not a huge conspiracy theorist I've just been around enough political arenas to know how effective endless money and lobbying can be. I'm not surprised just sickened we live in a society where an effective option exists. Kratom could help reduce prescribed opiates which could help combat the horrific heroin epidemic.  When I was a teenager heroin was thought of as the nastiest drug out there. The stigma w/ the youth today is different, they turn to it to get the same high they found abusing prescribed opiates. I have a friend whose daughter was using Herion at 18 years old. Both her parents (still married) are respected community members & have no substance abuse history. I get life isn't perfect but if a teen from a well rounded family in the Midwest became an addict what's that saying about heroin's increased prevalence & threat to our youth. It's time for humanity to prevail not the RX companies that feed off people's vulnerability & pain. Going back to a myriad of meds & their side effects or serving as a Guinea pig for new ones in order to barely cope fills me w/dread. I can't go back confined to bed or fear dying each night from opiate respiratory failure like Beth. People of all ages rely on Kratom to live fulfilling lives. Our future is dependent on you.

U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21946","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Rold","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I highly support legal kratom.

For starters, it is an extremely harmless plant that is incomparable to other, actually dangerous drugs that are found on that list. It is not an opiate whatsoever and is exponentially safer than synthetic opiates such as oxycontin that are in widespread use. Kratom can help alleviate many ailments such as mild anxiety, depression, chronic pain, PMS, and most importantly preformed addictions (such as those to synthetic opiates.) I can personally attest to using this plant to help alleviate symptoms of my depression, headaches, and the like. I know that my boyfriend has also used this plant to help his depression, anxiety, and pre-formed addiction to Ritalin, an addiction brought about by his being prescribed this drug since he was a child. As soon as he found kratom, he gave up ritalin for this mucb safer and healthier alternative, for he finds that this plant helps relieve symptoms of his ADD. In short, I believe that kratom does much more good than harm, if it does any harm at all. It should remain unregulated. It helps millions of Americans with their problems as well and is not a danger whatsoever.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3044","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Deanna Waggoner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is safe and very helpful for those who live with chronic pain","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7995","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To make something illegal without proper study is simply ignorant and unjust.

I have a bachelors degree and went to Brandeis university and eastern Connecticut state university (and at both universities was a scholar athlete in soccer).  I am a tae-kwon-do black belt (since age 8), I coach premier soccer for youths and I am a son, brother, uncle and surprisingly a recovering heroin addict. I have been clean for 10 years now and I wish to formally state that I believe the banning of mitragyine speciosa and 7 hydroxymitragynine (Kratom active ingredients) or placing them on the schedule one list would be a most ill advised ruling and a display of pure ignorance on the part of our federal government / DEA.  I struggle with my addiction to this day and although I'm still in recovery (as I will be forever), kratom in my opinion and the opinion of thousands and thousands of others is a life saver. Especially when considering the heroin resurgence that is crushing the youth of this nation, this plant could be a miracle worker. I unfortunately live in a town that has been hit hard by heroin and more than 10 of my oldest and closest friends are now dead because of the drug heroin. I can speak from personal experience that Kratom definitely helps me get through each day without the urge to relapse and use again. It does not impair my judgement or make me sedated as  the other drugs I have been prescribed for my recovery have done (suboxone and methadone)  and still helps with opioid withdrawal symptoms and gives my mind the focus and motivation that I used to have prior to heroin addiction. To make it as illegal as heroin without studying it in depth with clinical trials would just be silly. It's natural, it doesn't impair you as other drug recovery aids do, it gives you energy, motivation and focus yet does not make you high like amphetamines (which I've been prescribed for ADHD that developed after my heroin use) or jittery like caffeine. Additionally, it alleviates pain better than most pain medications I have had prescribed to me for surgeries, aches and pains from numerous orthopedic issues (as I am and have been a lifelong athlete). Please do the right thing and do the research before potentially banning a substance that helps so many from falling back into opioid pain medication use, heroin use, etc. I do not know what I would do without Kratom, I would potentially have to go back on opioids for pain medication myself and that would likely lead back to the bottom for me and relapse.

I'm able to get much more of a stretch, so I can understand why people say it helps with pain management and reduces their need to use addictive pain relievers/opioids. \n\nAs a witness to my husband, who is addicted to opioids, kratom effectively reduces his cravings and, as a result, he hasn't used opioids for more than 4 years. Kratom has truly been a miracle herb for him, maybe even a life saver.\n\nIn my and many others' opinion, kratom should not be banned as a Schedule 1 substance but rather should be closely looked at as a cost-effective remedy to relieve pain, anxiety, depression, and to reduce opioid dependency. Its usefulness in all of the above should not be ignored. The DEA is over-reaching its authority in this instance, as it was established to uphold laws, not to make them. The effects of kratom cannot be compared to Heroin or other heavy drugs.\n\nThank you for your consideration,\nLori Monk","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8293","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lori Monk","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have suffered from severe fatigue and depression symptoms for years.

My daughter has chronic lyme disease, and was taking violin for pain, years ago.It made her lethargic,and never really took away her pain. Violin had a very negative impact on her quality of life. . Kratom has been a real life changer. Not only does it alleviate her pain, but it does not make her drowsy or lethargic. It does not slow her reflexes, or responses in any way.. my daughter is a wife and mother. She has a full time job in Healthcare. She is not merely existing day to day , in depression,  as she was on vicodin. Since taking kratom she is thriving and although not cured of lyme, she does not have the pain she did.\nPlease do not take this herb off the market or make it a schedule 1 drug.

As someone who works in the pharmacy industry, this action defies all manner of logic and reason to me.\n\nI discovered Kratom a year ago when trying to assist my fianc with weaning off of Oxycodone.  He was prescribed this pain killer for ruptured discs in his back.     As you must know, the pain relief provided by Oxy also comes with the added bonus of rapid addiction and a need to increase the dose as the patient develops a tolerance for the drug.    Tired of this dependence and its side effects, he tried to quit cold turkey to horrible effect.  The withdrawal symptoms were text book and terrifying, from the rapid heartbeat to the uncontrollable shaking.  We seriously considered taking him to the emergency room.\n\nEnter Kratom.   Within an hour of ingesting a few grams in capsule form, he was okay.   The tachycardia had ceased.   He was calm and comfortable and no longer trying to crawl out of his skin.  In 2 days, he was done.   No more Oxy withdrawal.  No more Oxy craving.  2 DAYS!   It was like a miracle.\n\nI researched Kratom extensively before purchasing it.  As I said before, I work in the pharmacy industry and I am not prone to ingesting drugs or herbs without ample research first.    I found no evidence that this substance would be harmful.   If fact, it was quite the contrary.   In the few cases I could find where there were claims of hospitalization due to Kratom, it was always in combination with some other substance.   Unlike prescription pain killers, Kratom does not cause respiratory depression and it is nearly impossible to overdose as ingesting too much will inevitably cause the patient to vomit.   \n\nBut is that a point I really need to make?   We live in a country where alcohol consumption kills 88,000 people a year according to The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.   Yet, there is no ban on alcohol.  For some reason, the buzz and impairment that comes from ingesting too many margaritas is of no concern.    To claim it is in the publics interest to ban a useful herb with no harmful effects or documented fatalities, yet allow alcohol to remain legal is a smack in the face of any person with the power to reason.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16036","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Marlowe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is from a plant in the coffee family, and has ample anecdotal evidence that it does, in fact, have medicinal value.  \nWe, as a country, made a similar error before, in placing another substance in the schedule 1 category, where it does not belong.
