There were times when this would result in severe stomach pain and other personal issues. Not only was it causing adverse effects but it merely minimized the issues I was having and made my day survivable.\n\nI take Kratom on a regular basis and my quality of life is improved 100% without any adverse effects. It allows me to feel relaxed and comfortable in social environments, aside from when first waking up - Knee pain that was excruciating from an old injury is completely relieved and I don't face the issues of immobilizing headaches like I used to.\n\nMaking Kratom a schedule 1 substance would be an injustice. This supplement is a 100% plant material that allows consumers such as myself a natural option for pain relief without the adverse side effects linked to prescription pharmaceuticals.\n\nI've gone weeks at a time without a supply and experienced no withdraw effects aside from frustration that Tylenol and bAdvil weren't allowing me to function like a normal human being,\n\nPlease consider me and many like me in stopping the categorization of Kratom as a schedule 1 - invest in research of this plant rather than stripping those who have come to use it as an herbal remedy to ailments that can drastically impact life negatively.\n\nThe quality of life and well being of us as citizens and human beings are in your hands, don't take that lightly.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21395","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris McGuire","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think that we should research Kratom and its side affects before we make a decision so classify it as a Scheduled 1 drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12214","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 100% service-connected disabled veteran living on opiate painkillers along with other prescribed drugs.

Kratom should be given a chance for further research which already has observed minimal side effects.  To put this item on top drug schedules will only worsen the drug epidemic and unnecessarily expand the Drug War.  Also, many law-abiding Americans will risk being charged with a drug offense and end up with criminal records.  This is not a solution to America's drug problem-it only makes it worse.  Please reconsider banning Kratom by making it a scheduled substance since research shows this item which is consumed as tea to be a much safer alternative.   The jury is still out and the good points far outweigh the negative ones.  Postpone the ban and give Kratom a chance to combat the drug problem instead of making it an unnecessary part of the problem.\n\nThank you.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17398","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jerome Wall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"modern day humans have been around roughly 200,000 too a million years.

Aside from the obvious effects, it has also caused depression and anxiety. I spent about 5 years on and off a cocktail of medications, cymbalta, klonopin, and a string of narcotic pain medications(hydrocodone, morphine, oxycodone, etc). My life was ruined by my pain. if I was on the medication I was sick and high  all of the time and I would begin needing the pills after a short time. If I was off them, I would be dealing with withdrawals and in constant pain. Either way, I would push people away and do everything I could to avoid leaving my home. I could go on about how miserable I was when I thought prescription medication was my only option, but suffice it to say that I lost my fianc after 8 years together, my home, all of my friends, and I had to leave my job as a firefighter. \n\nI have been managing my symptoms exclusively with Kratom for about 3 years and I've never been better off. It helps with not only my pain, but my depression and anxiety as well. Regardless of how much I take I never get sick, it's amazing to think that I have not vomitted in 3 years as it used to be almost a daily occurrence. I can not speak for everyone, but Kratom does not get me high in the slightest(and I know all about what it's like to be high). My pain is dulled and I just feel like everything is going to fine. With the help of Kratom I've begun rebuilding my life. I'm not where I was before I lost eveything, but I have a great job, a nice place to live, and I no longer isolate myself out of fear that people will notice that something is wrong with me. I should also note that after 3 years of using Kratom every day, every few hours(and two years prior of sporadic use when I wanted a break from narcotics), I have just had a full battery of tests and am in perfect health. \n\nIt's astounding to me that there is a plant that can replace my need for anti-depressants, anti-anxiety, and narcotic pain medication without getting me high, making me sick, killing my organs, or possibly causing an overdose and someone would want to outlaw it. If you schedule Kratom, it will have huge consequences on my life and the lives of thousands, maybe more, and you will be doing for what appears to be no reason.

I was introduced to kratom four years ago by a friend who brewed his own herbal elixirs. I loved the mood-lifting and energizing effects, and have been using kratom ever since as an alternative to coffee. Two years or so I decided to reduce my alcohol intake and instead I opted to drink kratom. It gives me a smooth energy boost but with none of the jitters that I get from caffeine. Now that I am becoming more familiar with the different strains of kratom, I also use kratom as a pain killer for headaches and body-aches. I highly value kratom as a natural remedy. It makes me sad that a plant that is in the same family as coffee would be banned. I sincerely hope that kratom is not scheduled; the leaf has so much good to offer for people with chronic pain or those who need help kicking their opiate addictions. Thanks for considering the medicinal benefit of this plant.

I work in the craft beer/service industry as well as in the spa and alternative wellness industry. \nI do not believe Kratom should become a schedule 1 drug, or be put in any other schedule as well. I believe it will do more harm then good. \nI believe if anything, it should be regulated like any other herbal supplement, or herb. If so, that would help with quality and consistency control in the kratom in the market, thus preventing adulteration of the natural product and keeping it pure.\nI have responsibly been using Kratom for over 3 years. I use it periodically throughout the week, much in the same way as you would use coffee, energy drinks, or yerba mate. It is in the same plant family as coffee and it is used like coffee for its stimulating/caffeine like affects. I use it for it's coffee/caffeine like stimulating properties, as well as to help me with my production at work. It helps me focus, and relieves my social anxiety being around so many people with both my jobs. It helps me take on more tasks in and outside of work, and helps me endure longer work hours and makes me more productive in all aspects of my life and an overall more productive member of society. It is also relieving for any muscle pain or strains from over exhaustion or exercise. I also use to help with exercise. It allows me to perform better, stronger, faster, and overall more focused during exercise. A surprising effect I've noticed, is that it has also helped me perform better in bed, and last longer. It has helped me reducing my alcoholic consumption to barely even a few times a week, which is rather difficult being that I am surrounded by alcohol at work and involved in the alcohol industry and craft beer culture. Thus lowering my consumption of alcohol after finding Kratom, has resulted in many positive effects like weight loss, more energy, more social, more productivity, save money, and less likely to get involved in risky behaviors that could put myself or others in danger, which we all know the risks and bad side affects of alcohol consumption.\n\nI would not say Kratom gives you a \"high\". It stimulates you like coffee, allievates aches and pains, gives you a sense of calm focused well being, and general feel good, mood boosting, motivation boosting, and anti anxiety effects.\nI have only had positive side affects from Kratom.\n\nI introduced my grandmother to Kratom, because she suffers from incurable Fibromyalgia, and has been suffering with a few broken bones trying to heal that past few years, which has been very debilitating to her life.  Sometimes she cannot even get out of bed for days, because she is in so much pain and has little to no energy. Doctors can't give her anything that actual helps her, let alone without terrible and risks and side affects of opioid painkillers. Kratom has been one of the only things that has helped her find any relief and has improved her quality of life. It relieves her pain, helps her sleep, and gives her energy to do normal everyday things. \n\nIf Kratom becomes a schedule 1 drug, it will do so much harm to so many people. That will cause so many peoples' quality of life to tremendously decrease including my own, and my families. I think it is a short sighted and ill though out proposition, that has not taken into account of SO much anecdotal evidence and scientific evidence regarding the safety of Kratom. The positives of Kratom can't even be compared to any negatives regarding it. The positive benefits of Kratom greatly outnumber the very few negatives, if any of Kratom. \nMaking it illegal will hurt, and destroy so many more countless lives then just keeping it legal. Making Kratom illegal will do way more harm then good. Period. We have seen this with Alcohol Prohibition, and it doesn't work. It only made the problem worse, and more people died because of it being illegal, then legal. And alcohol is way more of a dangerous substance then Kratom. So the thought of making it illegal is ridiculous and not a decision based on the reality, facts, or science. This is a fundamental freedom and right at risk being taken away from us. The right to consume a plant that helps us.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21625","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mathias Ailstock","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I support the use of natural medicines, including Kratum.

Using any tax-payer funded resources of the DEA to go after Kratom is misguided and off mission. \n\nKratom is in the same category as many herbal supplements people use that don't have a long pedigree of research to distinguish them from placebo to having useful active ingredients. So it is left to the public to try them and decide their value for themselves. There are ridiculously low reports of problems with people taking Kratom. I would hope that the DEA would make a risk/reward calculation and use their money to focus on drugs with a proven history of abuse and health risk like methamphetamine or true opiate drugs. Kratom does not have the numbers associated with problems for this to occupy the time of one agent for one hour.\n\n Please adjust your financial priorities to make our society safer by not getting sidetracked with this benign herb. You lose credibility with the tax-payers when we see you going after herbs whose most visible users seem to be people with chronic pain (including many vets), and people trying to get off more odious substances, both prescribed and illegal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2331","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello. I'd like to begin by thanking you for reconsidering the scheduling of Mitragynine Speciosa. When I discovered the wheels were already in motion for the Kratom ban, I felt somewhat hopeless; now I have a faint glimmer of hope for the future of this plant and those who use it. \n\nI'm a 28 year old male. I started using Kratom almost a year ago to help me manage my opiate painkiller dependence. I'm legally prescribed Oxycodone for several years now for Fibromyalgia. I've suffered from widespread pain 24 hours a day for the last 14 years of my life. On top of that, I struggle with fatigue from being in pain, anxiety, depression, severe migraines, and insomnia (all stemming from the chronic muscular pain). As if all of these symptoms weren't enough to deal with, I had recently struggled with opiate withdrawals since my prescription would not always last an entire month, or because I wanted to stave off addiction/increased tolerance. \n\nPrior to using Kratom, I would be in complete misery during these detox days. I would have to spend my days off of work in bed, sick as can be. I could see myself eventually illegally acquiring illicit opiates and becoming an addict if I did not find Kratom when I did. Once I learned how to properly use Kratom, the dread of taking days off from narcotic medication seemed trivial. It alleviated a great deal of my withdrawal symptoms and actually helped with some of the pain and energy issues. \n\nMy medication breaks vary from one day to 10 days, depending on my symptoms. After a one week segment of solely using Kratom, I woke up completely withdrawal free. This is after 4 years of daily prescription narcotic use. Furthermore, my Kratom doses lessened each day. I NEVER would have been able to that on my own, let alone go to work during the cessation process.\n\nAside from the numerous benefits chronic pain sufferers receive from M. Speciosa, recovering addicts have another maintenance drug to utilize. Suboxone and Methadone are arguably harder to quit than the illicit drugs the person was originally addicted to. These drugs are also prescribed at ridiculously high doses and unnecessarily long periods of time. Kratom does a similar job, if not, a better job as a maintenance drug and with a far less severe impact on the addicts life (this information is from personal experience, experience of friends, and online testimonials). Of course there are more serious cases where Kratom isn't the answer for a certain individual, but I truly believe that would be a minority. \n\nMitragynine Speciosa does have medicinal qualities. I understand the FDA needs to isolate a specific compound in order to qualify something as \"medicinal,\" however the spectrum of alkaloids found in this plant benefits many. I cannot see someone using this plant to get \"high.\" I have heard it being compared to prescription opiates. I assure you, as a person who is on a legally prescribed opiate regiment, Kratom does not even come close. It naturally prevents a user from taking too much because at a certain point, the harmless negative effects being to undermine the positive effects. I hardly think being nauseous and a little dizzy can be considered \"getting high.\" \n\nFinally, scheduling Kratom will cause a great deal of suffering to those who use it regularly to alleviate whatever ails them. Many people rely on this plant to stay off of legal and illegal opiates. By making it illegal, I can guarantee the number of addicts, overdoses, and heroin/fentanyl related deaths will sky rocket across the country. The plant is scarcely known in the United States and can do so much for so many. I think it needs to be publicized, not criminalized. It could become an essential tool in combating the opiate epidemic this country faces. Please do not schedule Mitragynine Speciosa. It will hurt the public, and I know it will hurt me. \n\nThank you for your time,\nDominick Peluso","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0791","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Personal","postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dominick Peluso","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"See attached file(s)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8527","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it may concern-\n\nMy name is William McGair.

This would erroneously places kratom into the same category as heroin, LSD, and PCP. I cannot overstate the absolute lack of understanding this action demonstrates for what this substance offers or how safe it actually is by the DEA. As justification the DEA cites a very small number of poison control calls over a half decade which involved kratom, but in almost all cases other major contributing factors were associated with these calls.\n\nI am a veteran who served in the U.S. Army as a UH-60 Crewchief, suffered a bulging neck disk as a result, and was placed on a medication by the VA called tramadol. This medication was promised to provide all the pain relief with none of the opiate addiction issues. After being put on 30 tablets a month to start and walked up over a 7 year period by my doctor to 240 per month, I found out the hard way that this promise of no addiction was not to be kept.\n\nMy point in bringing that up is that I have felt what being addicted to pain medication is like. Tramadol worked, very well actually. But I would not and could not be physically dependent on it or anything. Soon after coming off, my doctor (different non-VA) recommended that I try the herbal supplement kratom. As with most things in this category, I was extremely skeptical that it could do anything for me. To be blunt, I was wrong. Kratom not only eliminates the pain, it does so far more effectively than any medication, over-the-counter or prescription, that I have ever tried. An added add unexpected bonus is that it also seems to keep my chronically high blood pressure within normal levels.\n\nAs mentioned I was a veteran in the US Army, however for the last 5 years I am extremely proud of my service as a Department of Defense (DOD) civilian. I absolutely love my job, love the people I work with, and would never do anything to risk losing this position. Nor would I take any substance or medication that could potentially impact my ability to provide our customers and US service members with the most accurate and effective products possible. Please understand that my respect for the job, the mission, and my team members compelled me to conduct a tremendous amount of research on kratom prior to considering it.\n\nEven if I had not done my due diligence, my understanding of the substance based on multiple studies funded and published by U.S. universities, as well as the National Institute of Health (NIH) indicate overwhelming evidence that kratom is characterized by an extremely high human toxicity level (hard or impossible to overdose) and produces no known long term negative impacts to health.\n\nThe DEA's recent announcement basing this decision on roughly 400 poison control incidents over 5 years defies logic. I believe the number of poison control calls for washing machine pods is in the half million per year range, for comparison. A characteristic of schedule 1 substances is no known medical uses. I can tell you without pause that this is patently false. The DEA rind the real risk of invalidating their entire system and calls into question their motives and leadership.\n\nThis supplement is used safely everyday by hundreds of thousands of people who have been able to take advantage of it's many positive characteristics. Characteristics which are very often superior to other synthetic and addictive options that will likely be turned to in the approaching prohibition. \n\nI urge that any regulation placed upon kratom be limited to a minimum age to purchase, as well as product purity oversight. Anything more restrictive will very likely result in the inappropriate criminalization of a substance which benefits vastly outweigh any risks.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13064","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Regrettably, we did not learn well from alcohol prohibition.

The left side of my body impacted the car, my skull cracked on the hood of the car and my left temporal skull bone was fractured severely. I sustained traumatic injuries in my left neck, shoulder, rib cage,  hip, femur, and knee. My body then fell off of the car and impacted the concrete road, seriously injuring my right side, especially my right hip. I sustained multiple abrasions, lacerations, and bone fractures throughout my body. I would later wake up in the trauma intensive care unit (TICU) at the regional hospital in my state, approximately nine hours after I was struck by the car. \n\nI had extreme cognitive deficits and was having great difficulty with my short and long term memory, I also developed Broca's Aphasia. This type of Aphasia is a neurological disease that affected my speech, language, and communication abilities, all of which are primarily enabled by the left temporal lobe of the brain. My left temporal lobe was compressed by the inward pressure of the collapsed bone fragments from my depressed skull fracture. My skull's bone fragments came within one millimeter of lacerating a major artery in my brain, which would have almost certainly killed me through hemorrhaging. I spent the next year recovering from my body's injuries and my traumatic brain injury. It took me three months to be able to walk again with the assistance of a walker, then weeks later I could walk with a cane, then unassisted. I spent many months in neurological, physical, speech, and occupational therapy. \n\nTwo years after my trauma and brain injury I was almost fully recovered and had overcome my Broca's Aphasia. I've always suffered from severe persistent asthma however, and in the Fall two years post-injury I was admitted into my local hospital's emergency department for a severe asthma exacerbation related to a bout of bronchitis I developed. My asthma attack took several weeks to recover from and I was prescribed heavy doses of both oral and intravenous corticosteroids to treat my lung tissue and airway inflammation. I was ordered to stay on corticosteroids for many months. \n\nUnfortunately, a major side effect of the corticosteroids I was given is Avascular Necrosis, which for me, was the vascular occlusion of my left and right femoral heads, the round bone \"ball\" extension of the upper femur that fits into the \"socket\" of the pelvic acetabulum. Blood supply was cut off to both my left and right femoral heads over the course of several months from corticosteroids to treat my asthma and inflammation. This lack of blood and oxygen resulted in my left and right femoral head bones dying, they became severely necrotic in their cores. \n\nEventually after living with severe chronic pain for yet another year, my right femoral head fractured and collapsed in on itself while I was walking in my home. I then had to wait another two months with a collapsed femoral head and a nearly collapsed, hollow, necrosed left femoral head. My entire existence became defined by severe, unrelenting, chronic pain. I was finally able to get a right-side total hip replacement, which was a success and replaced my necrosed right femoral head, femoral neck, and upper femur with a titanium and ceramic composite prosthesis.\n\nAfter going through more than three years of extreme chronic pain, traumatic brain injury recovery, neurological comorbidities, sequelae, asthma, and many dozens of hospital and rehabilitation center stays and visits, I finally knew what I wanted to do with my life. I decided to become a registered nurse, as the RN's that took care of me so compassionately throughout my many injuries and recovery periods had a profound impact on me. However, even after my hip replacement my left femoral head was still partially necrosed and my right femoral nerve was damaged in the surgery. I still suffered from severe chronic pain of musculoskeletal and neuropathic varieties. Over the past several years my daily chronic pain levels, on a scale of 1-10, have averaged from 6 to 9 out of 10.\n\nTo treat my extreme chronic pain I was prescribed numerous opioid medications. My pain levels continued to be debilitating and made both my daily routine and progress in nursing school very difficult. The opioids also caused extreme side effects and would have killed me from intestinal blockage if I continued to take them. I then found Kratom and finally found relief in this plant, my pain went down to 2-3 out of 10 and my life improved substantially. I have used Kratom for many years now and have never had side effects. I rely on Kratom for my chronic pain control, nothing else works, if it were made illegal my life would become a tortuous, burdensome existence again.

Bracken. I am a sixty-four year old male, U.S. Citizen and taxpayer. I am currently employed full-time at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada, as a casino craps dealer. I have worked at the MGM Grand since it opened in 1993, and I started working as a casino dealer in 1978.\n\nToday is Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 2016. I have a lot to be thankful for, so I chose this day to write my comment and views on your proposed decision to put Kratom on the list of \"Schedule I Controlled Substances\". I am strongly opposed to this proposed decision on the basis of the \"risk-benefit ratio\" of using Kratom. I am certain that the DEA has heard from individuals, and Members of Congress, doctors, and scientists, regarding the lifesaving benefits of Kratom. If the DEA is using actual statistical numbers as a basis for their decision, then Opiates (and perhaps even alcohol) should be banned long before Kratom, i.e.:  \"The DEA named as a reason for banning kratom as soon as possible the fact that from 2010 to 2015, poison control centers received 660 calls related to the plant. Meanwhile, the American Association of Poison Control Centers counts calls for 55,622 opioid exposures between January and October of this year alone. The DEA itself counted 15 deaths involving kratom between 2014 and 2016-14 of which also involved other, more dangerous drugs. (In 2014, the most recent year for which numbers are available, opioids were responsible for over 29,000 deaths in the U.S.)\"  (Link: http://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhedgecock/2016/11/21/what-you-need-to-know-about-kratom-before-december-1/#17fc4780385e )\n\nFirst, I am extremely thankful that Kratom came into my life a few months ago.  But, as soon as I received my first order of Kratom, the news came out that the DEA was going to make Kratom a Schedule I Controlled Substance. So, I decided to wait, even though I knew I needed to try Kratom ASAP.  But, you really scared me off with your proposed decision to ban Kratom from legal use. \n\nSecond, I am very thankful that the DEA made history by reversing its decision to ban Kratom. When I read that news a few weeks later, I decided to try Kratom, while it is still legal, for many reasons.\n\nReason #1: I have suffered for over 40 years with debilitating Occipital Headaches, Tension Headaches, and Occipital Neuralgia. As a result, I was forced to take OTC medications like Excedrin, and later, Aleve, plus a host of other OTC pain medications to try to handle my pain and headaches. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of taking pain medications is something called \"Medication Overuse Headaches, M.O.H.\" (ref: https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/medication-overuse-headache/   and:  https://www.migrainetrust.org/about-migraine/types-of-migraine/other-headache-disorders/medication-overuse-headache/ ). I did not find out about M.O.H. until a few years ago, and by then I had been suffering for so long that I started seeing pain management doctors, who prescribed prescription pain meds, i.e. opiates, specifically Norco (Hydrocodone 10/325).  I am certain that most of you at the DEA are familiar what the results are of long-term opiate use. After using opiates to handle my pain for almost 9 years, I was in a \"living hell\".  I work full-time, and I was also a full-time caregiver to my wife of 33 years who has been disabled since 2009 (she has since passed away, two weeks ago on November 9, 2016). Before she passed, she indicated that she was extremely proud of me for using Kratom to essentially get off of opiates, and start turning my life around! She could visibly see the difference in me!!

I have seen orthopedic doctors, have had MRI's, cat scans, and multiple xrays. I have seen a neurologist, three physical therapists, three chiropractors, and two acupuncturists. I have had multiple injections and even a nerve ablation. My pain keeps me from being able to walk in the morning, run, dance, or jump and keeps me from sleeping at night.  I am not overweight or unhealthy in any other way and I refuse to take pain prescriptions. I don't want to become addicted to prescriptions, not to mention, they do not actually fix the issue.  I have nerve damage through my SI joint.\n\nAbout one month ago I heard about Kratom and decided, after extensive research, to try it. I take less than a tablespoon of powder in some juice and remain pain free for 5-6 hours. This is the first relief I have had in ten years. Kratom has become a miracle for me. I don't take it often, because it does make me sleepy, yet it helps me sleep and therefore, gives my bodya chance to rest and heal.  I have not found it addictive in any way and the only side effect has been a stomach ache, so I take it with Tums. \n\nBy making Kratom illegal, the government is only opening itself up to more black market drug trade. When you live with pain 24/7 for ten years, you are willing to do just about anything for relief. At this point I will go to any means necessary to get relief naturally. I do not want to take prescription man-made drugs. I prefer to take natural substances. The government does not have the right to make a natural plant illegal.

Medical marijuana is one that has been proven to work: drug overdose deaths have plummeted in stated that have legalized it.

The addiction rate is through the roof for these things and according to recent study, someone dies every 19 seconds to an addiction.   Kratom offers me relief from both of these ailments with the any truly dangerous side effects.  Additionally *(in my experience) it is completely addiction free.  If I have back pain for a month and need to take Kratom every day, I have no symptoms of withdrawal whatsoever.

Having to watch myself, my husband and many other family members and friends struggle with side effects from prescription pain killers is heart wrenching. All of that changed when we come across Kratom. Is life perfect now no BUT we can function daily without being crying in pain and unable to move or missing out on quality time with family or even work to provide for our families. Scheduling Kratom the same as drugs such as heroin would take away the very freedoms we all have fought so hard for. So many Veterans have injured themselves mentally and physically for citizens all over our country to live the way we do. Now these same Veterans are left to suffer from chronic pain and mental and emotional problems the rest of their lives. The least we can do is to have a working option without side effects of liver/kidney damage amongst others so they can live the very life they fought for. Kratom has changed the lives of people for the better for hundreds of years without issue. More official testing and studies are needed to show and prove just how useful Kratom actually is. Thank you for allowing the many Kratom advocates to speak our minds and concerns. I hope all aspects will be put into consideration before taking away something that has improved so many lives across the world.

I am a 30 year old male who has struggled with various substance abuse issues for most of my adult life. These issues have had a very negative impact  on my ability to stay employed and be a functional member of society. That is, until I found kratom about 10 years ago. Previously I had been addicted to a variety of pharmaceutical drugs, alcohol, and marijuana. After trying kratom, I knew I had found a very special supplement. All of my cravings for drugs and alcohol were completely eliminated by taking a tablespoon of kratom a couple of times a week, and all of this without any lethargy or \"high\"! I also work physically demanding labor jobs and it helps tremendously to be able to come home and take a safe, natural plant supplement to get rid of the pain in my back and allow me to finally get some sleep. The main concern with opiods & opiates is the very dangerous respiratory depression they cause (which is why people die from these drugs). MANY studies have proven time and again that, uniquely, kratom does not share those dangerous properties at all making kratom CONSIDERABLY safer. This plant supplement has drastically improved my life. I'm not naive though & I do realize there are some mild dangers with ANY plant or supplement. What I would like to see done about this kratom issue is to see it regulated like a dietary supplement, implementing some form of quality control so that product is safe without any additives. And also I would like to see age restrictions & mandatory warning labels similar to alcohol.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20474","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to register my concern with the FDA's plan to label the plant kratom as a schedule 1 narcotic.

It is my belief that my government should not be in the business of regulating every aspect of my personal life, if I am not engaged in hurting others or myself. The threshold of proof in order to enforce regulations of this kind should be exceptionally high & well researched.

It progressed throughout high school and college, and I spent much of that time in pain, sick, and scared. I finally was diagnosed with endometriosis at the age of 22. By that time, I had lost 2 jobs through my illness and lost many relationships, friends and memories and opportunities, and was constantly vomiting or fainting from the excruciating pain. I had my first pelvic surgery at 23 in July of 2015, and only 2 months later, relapsed back to all the same pain and symptoms. In the fall of 2015, I began runnng a Congressional campaign (most of the time from a bed or couch because the pain was so intense), and something needed to be done about my pain in order for me to keep working. I was put on Dilaudid, 4 mg every 4-6 hours. I took the entire 4 mg the first dose, and it had such a strong effect on me that I was slurring on the phone when I called my fiancee to come get me from work. I was comatose the rest of the day. The next day, I took 2 mg, and still was too dizzy to even walk straight. I continued taking 1 mg every 6 hours, and did so for a month until my 2nd surgery in January of 2016. My pain was barely managed, and I still could barely handle the side effects. After taking 1 mg of Dilaudid every 6 hours or so for 5 weeks, I went through horrible withdrawal for 5 days; my head pounded, my heart raced, I sweated, vomited, and was so dizzy I couldn't walk. I had a glorious 8 months of remission after my last surgery, but as of September 2016 relapsed into the most debilitating, excruciating, oppressive pain in my back, my hips, my abdomen, my legs, my ovaries, and all the symptoms to go along with it. I was put on Tramadol to help me get through the day at my fast-paced, intense job. It didn't really do anything for me, but gave me so many side effects and an overall unwell feeling. Luckily, one of my fellow endometriosis sisters told me about kratom. I started taking it in October for pain relief, and it has been the biggest blessing of my life. It gives me a solid 6-7 hours of no pain and consistent energy, and I am allowed to live, unencumbered, as though I don't have endometriosis. The only side effect I have ever had is mild constipation. I stopped taking  Tramadol immediately after trying kratom, and have been managing my pain better than ever before in my life. It has given me my life back. I am able to work, play, create, explore, enjoy my life, go full out. If I lose the ability to take kratom, I will return to a shell of my current self; depressed, hopeless, worn down by pain, unable to accomplish a fraction of what I need/want to every day, unable to keep a job, unable to be the fiancee I want to be, unable to be there in the way I want to for my family. Losing kratom would give me the choice between debilitating pain and pain pills that either don't work well, make me feel very ill, or threaten me with addiction. Please do not take away my hope; for the rest of my life, I will be having surgery, going through remission, and relapsing, and starting the process over. If I don't have the pain relief and wellness kratom offers, my life will be cut drastically short, whether judging by productivity and quality alone, or by the harsh side effects of prescription pain pills, which I will avoid unless absolutely necessary. Please don't take away my choice to care for my health in the way that is most effective. Please don't subject me to a life of pain and torture. Please don't take away my hope and potential and possibilities. Please don't mute who I am, who I will become if allowed. Please don't take away my health or my hope.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8501","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Katie Ussery","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This move does nothing to ensure the safety of the American public. The only group that stands to benefit is the pharmaceutical \nindustry. \nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement. Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose. Instead, kratom should be legally regulated, allowing for quality control measures and product labeling requirements.\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it. If you want to find an answer to the rampant opioid crisis in this country, you need to find novel ways to address it. The benefits of using kratom instead of opioids should be investigated instead of going forward with this typical knee-jerk reaction that has proven itself less than effective in the past. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2667","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\nI recently found Kratom as a natural supplement to combat constant pain and fatigue from breast cancer.

To schedule this plant in any way would be a terrible decision, and could have a negative affect on their lifestyles. These people I speak of are law abiding, god fearing, tax paying citizens that have positive roles in the community. Please leave this natural plant alone, and let adults of legal age choose what is right or wrong for themselves, rather than having yet another freedom forfeited. Kratom(mitragyna speciosa)and all of it's alkaloids are formed naturally in the forests of Southeast Asia. Kratom is a natural botanical that is harvested from lush exotic jungles and provides sustainable income for the surrounding villages and towns, and it should be allowed to stay a natural botanical. If Kratom were to be made illegal and placed in the schedule one controlled dangerous substance category any future research to prove that Kratom has any benefits would be hard to complete if not impossible. Please do not choose to make kratom illegal in America, I personally believe that would be more harmful than beneficial. There are so many other important topics and areas in America that could benefit from the money wasted it will cost taxpayers by making this natural plant illegal. The costs of enforcing the new laws of another natural plant becoming illegal will cost tax payers millions of dollars, if not billions. These new laws could destroy families, businesses, and possibly the entire community as a whole. In the past, history tells us that prohibition certainly creates black markets and the tax paying citizens and businesses that offer Kratom as a legal product today, would be replaced by dangerous and violent non tax paying men and women. Staticically speaking where there is little to no crime in an area at this moment, could potentially be changed overnight, and be replaced with thugs, gangsters, drug dealers and possibly killers. Bad people commit crimes, and making Kratom illegal could offer a new avenue and product line for these evil opportunists, thus creating instant waves of dangerous and violent crimes where none at the moment exist. I ask that you think of the children that will be affected before making such a terrible decision.

Since that time, and with enduring 2 major back surgeries, I have had to take opiate based pain relievers to control the debilitating chronic pain I have, for which there is no cure at this time.  Because of the FDA's REM Program, it is becoming increasingly difficult for me to even get my prescriptions.  I have never misused or abused my pain medication in any way.  \nI realize that I am physically dependent on my pain medication, but I am not an addict.  There is a difference.  Many days, I wish I could just throw away the pain medication, and the other medications I have to take for the side-effects, but I know that  this is no answer for me.  Until my physician and I found the correct medication for me, I was unable to have any quality of life, and was nearly suicidal.\nUpon hearing about this possible herbal remedy, and the proposed scheduling by the DEA, I was alarmed.  I have not as of yet tried it to see if it would work for me, rather than be a slave to the pain medications, but I would like to be able to enjoy the liberty to do so.  The pharmaceutical companies in this country are holding patients like me hostage, with their egregiously over priced medications, and now the FDA is trying to \"fix\" a substance abuse/social issue with extreme measures that only serve to punish those of us who need these medications for real medical problems and who do follow the rules.  \nI hope that you will reconsider any notion of classifying Mitragynine and 7-Hydromitragynine into any schedule.

And with kratom's 10 gram dosage limit,  (more than 10 grams of kratom can cause nausea and \"eye shifting\" which are undesirable effects) overdose is very unlikely. It has been pointed out that in documented kratom overdose cases, kratom was not the main culprit. Users had dosed kratom with more volitale substances such as ecstasy, heroin, cocaine, and alcohol.

It's like coffee as a stimulant and the depressant strands are benign, not leading to a loss of motor control. The lethal dose needs to be further studied. It does not seem to be very easy to induce toxicity for all practical purposes as of now, but this might vary for those with lung conditions. Further research is obviously necessary, but outright ban is misguided. It should be treated as supplement comparable to preworkouts and nootropics. I no longer personally use the stuff but I did use it for about 4 months then stopped just because I didn't want to waste my disposable income. \n\nLove you DEA!

I once worked in the office administration field, as a manager of a criminal justice agency, as well as volunteering as an advocate for families with children who have/had severe mental illness.  I had to leave all of that behind due to a back injury and crippling pain.  At the age of thirty-six I was informed by a physician, that without spinal fusion surgery, I would be in a wheelchair full-time by the age of 40.\n\nI had been on moderate amounts of prescription pain medications which were increased under the supervision of my physician/surgeon over the course of time. I never took more than I was instructed to take. In fact, I was sensitive to the side effects of the medications. So, I was unable to take more than instructed without being very sick.  I had the spinal fusion surgery and about 3-6 months into my post-op recovery, I was abruptly removed from the medications with no tapering period. The physician's assistant explained that they only kept patients on pain medications for a set time after surgery.  I would have to continue any pain management with my primary care physician or a pain clinic if I chose to stay on the medications.  I chose not to.  I didn't realize that just stopping the prescription pain medication would be as debilitating as it turned out to be.  The next few weeks were a nightmare, both physically and mentally.  However, I came through it and thought I was finally going to have a (nearly) pain free life. \n\nThen, a couple of years ago I started having chronic pain and knots in my muscles/joints, horrible skin sensitivity, photo sensitivity, rashes, fatigue, clouded thinking, and insomnia attributed to autoimmune issues.  From time to time, I would still be stricken with acute, \"breakthrough\" pain from my back surgery as well.  I would be placed on and off prescription pain and psychotropic medications during these times.  I finally had enough and figured I was destined to suffer an existence of continual pain.  It is truly depressing when one is given no hope beyond multiple bottles of (barely helpful) prescription medications and steroidal injections. I felt my lot in life was cast and I was destined to be filled with pain for as long as I lived.  As a mother and wife it was such a dismal prospect; along with not being able to participate in activities with my children, completing simple tasks such as going to the grocery store, housekeeping, etc. was heartbreaking. \n\nI heard about Kratom and the impending ban. I didn't think much of it as I was very skeptical that it could actually help me. In an effort to clear my body of all prescription medications, I finally tried Kratom and it has altered my view point. I have hope again! I read all sides of the arguments for and against Kratom before I ever tried it.  In the short time I have been using Kratom, I have found it has improved my ability to think clearly, improved my mood, eliminated my insomnia, and eased my chronic pain terrifically.  I implore you to reconsider placing a ban or scheduling Kratom as a narcotic.  I am strongly opposed to Kratom being labeled a Schedule I narcotic! It has been a wonderful, natural alternative to a plethora of prescription medications that left me with terrible side effects and a shell of the person I used to be.  With Kratom, I have hope that I can, in time, become the person I once was before all the pain. \n\n\nSincerely,\n\nLaura Blakesley \n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4042","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laura Blakesley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After many many years of heavy drug use I started to think there was absolutely no way to quit one thing with out starting another worse habbit. I truly felt trapped by my own fear of not being high.

The first time I tried kratom I took 3 capsuls and drank some apple juice per instructions from the head shop owner.  Not only did I not feel the necessity to use for more then 12 hours but I also didn't feel the slightest bit of the emotional rollercoaster that usually comes along with not being loaded. To top it all off it only took 3 or 4 days of using kratom at the same dosage for me to not need anything at all. What would have taken me months and months of quiting and starting And fighting myself only to fail again has now taken 4 days and was a complete success. To view somthing so helpful and medically progressive as a bad thing that needs to be taken away is a huge step in the wrong direction.

Certain strains in certain doses can relax me just enough to battle insomnia (which is a ongoing problem for me).  There is (for me, anyway) no risk of dependency like there would be with drugs and it is so subtle that now and then, it doesn't even have any effect.

It has a very subtle mood lift as well as a pain-deadening quality.  What pill do you know of that can do that effectively and with no negative after-effects?\n\n3.  I have myasthenia gravis and sometimes can feel very weak and lacking in energy. There is another strain of kratom that gives me that subtle mood lift as well as some welcome energy.  Again, I don't need it often, but it's such a godsend when I do.  No pill currently exists for this symptom of myasthenia gravis.\n\nKratom is a harmless yet beneficial substance that holds virtually no potential for abuse. Marijuana is a much stronger herb and that's being legalized in many states! Somebody is trying to look like a hero in attempting to make this illegal to possess but his or her perspective is extremely misguided.  The DEA should focus on substances that pose actual dangers to society. Kratom isn't one of them.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5818","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jill Terry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \n     As a concerned citizen I would like to ask that your advise our government to do what is best for our citizens and keep Kratom legal and allow additional testing to be done.

I have been a frequent Kratom user for about four years. I had a start up business that went under when the housing market crashed. It left us in debt to the point where I needed to either declare bankruptcy or work seven days a week. I chose that latter solution. I use Kratom along with Tea, as an herb to assist with staying motivated and focused. Without Kratom, I may have been able to dig my family out of debt, but I'm sure my blood pressure would have been much higher. And my anger and frustration would have effected my family in a negative way. It's helped immensely in keeping an even keel while not depending on others to bail me out. I won't be pleased but I can survive without it if it's scheduled. There are many who use it for more serious issues and I feel they may lose hope due to mental any physical pain and resort to drastic measures to escape their pain.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5738","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Boyd","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me become a more productive member of society.

I also felt a bit of euphoria during the process, but my personal experience is not the reason why this should be kept unscheduled. I know two people who have greatly benefited from this product, so much so that prescription medications  were not needed. \nFirst, my boyfriend Adam has anxiety, he has had it since he was a little boy. He does not take a daily prescription for it as advised by the doctors because he says that it causes him to be absent from the world. However, he does keep it on him just incase of an attack. I have been with him multiple times where he was feeling an anxiety attack approaching and had no prescription. I have also been with him during these times where Kratom has been available, and watched him quickly start to ground and relax after only drinking 5g of the powder. He also can take it daily if he needs to and avoid the prescription meds altogether. It would be a shame if this was not available to people with similar issues.\nAlso, our friend suffers from depression, anxiety and ADHD, he has been medicated daily for years. Recently, he started taking Kratom as a supplement. Instantly he found relief, even stopping some of the doses of Ritalin he takes throughout the day, he said  he feels like a real person when he doesn't have to take his medicine like clockwork. \nKratom is a great supplement for many different reasons. The different strands ACTUALLY do different things and help in different ways. Making Kratom unaccessable by making it a scheduled substance is a mistake and a disservice to many.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3890","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shawna Sudyk","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using kratom for some time now to help with my depression I tried it after my dad offered me some because i was so depressed i attempted suicide and it helped better than the medications i was on since then i have been able to function in real life i managed to find a wife get a good job and be happy all thanks to this wonderful herb that yall are trying to make illegal due to some false accusations. please stop this bill","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13889","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Roscoe Osborne","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am absolutely opposed to any ban on kratom.

I strongly oppose a ban on Kratom. I've been using Kratom every day for over two years. Since a co-worker made me aware of Kratom, it has helped me keep a positive outlook, sleep better at night, maintain a healthy appetite, and ease the pain in my feet after a hard day's work. I can't imagine why you would want to unilaterally ban a plant that I believe to be 100% safe, and good for so many people's health, due to a relatively low number of calls to Poison Control Centers placed out of the ignorance of its safety. The Association of American Poison Control Centers receives several million calls every year. \"85% of poison exposures reported to US poison centers where non-toxic, minimally toxic, or at most had a minor affect,\" according to poison.org. Kratom also, quite literally, saves lives of people who would otherwise be turning to dangerous opioids. If anything, Kratom should be promoted. I greatly commend you for your work taking dangerous drugs off the streets of our country. The opioid epidemic is claiming more and more lives and ruining even more. Vendors who mix other drugs into their products should be prosecuted as well, obviously. I have suffered no ill effects beside the very occasional nausea when first learning how much to take and constipation. It also fails to impair my cognitive function. If only for the integrity and public image of your agency, don't ban a completely safe substance that helps so many people and saves lives! Criminalizing Kratom would be a hazard to public health. I trust and pray you will make the right decision!

When I started my family, I put my career as a special education teacher and grad school on hold. After my son was born prematurely with Noonan Syndrome, I put my job as youth counselor in a psychiatric treatment center on hold. He was in the NICU for 89 days and had 4 heart surgeries before he turned 3 years old. \nFor most of my adult life, I have struggled with severe depression, some anxiety and chronic low back pain. A variety of factors including arthritis, extreme weight fluctuation, stenosis and a car accident have contributed to the complications I've had with my back. I have had dozens of procedures short of being cut open including steroid injections and nerve burning. \nOver the years, I have been prescribed many medications and experienced many negative side effects. The most horrifying was 4 years ago, when I had to be air lifted to Mayo in Rochester for emergency surgery. They found that I had 2 holes in my bowel caused by long term use of ibuprofen. My doctor had prescribed prescription strength Naproxen at a visit that involved discussion of the addiction risks with continued us of opiates. The surgeon told my husband they would not have been able to save me, if I had come by ambulance rather than helicopter. I was hospitalized for 17 days, came home with drains for several weeks and 3 months later, all of my hair fell out. My boys were only toddlers; I was 2 hours from home, and it was extremely traumatic. \nI was amazed to learn that something like ibuprofen causes over 1000 deaths each year. It was after my long recovery from this that I started researching natural alternatives for pain control as well as healthy supplements that would enhance my overall well being. I read about kratom. I read dozens of consumer reviews about it from herbal websites. I read many personal stories similar to my own about the life enhancing benefits of the plant. I read as much as I could find for several weeks about kratom, before deciding it was exactly what I was looking for. \nSo for about the last 4 years, in addition to my daily medications for depression, low thyroid, and anemia, my life has been easier with kratom. I've had a bit more pep in my step that many folks get from coffee. I have a more consistent uplifted mood that helps me get along with everyone and keep a more positive attitude. I can shop longer before \"I drop\". I can be on my feet and finish more physical tasks without my back flaring and needing to lie in bed to recuperate. I no longer feel like I may fall asleep at the wheel from exhaustion when driving in the afternoon. \nIf kratom were to be banned, I fear I may be back in my bed in hibernation mode. I don't want to fall back into the routine of sleeping the pain away. I dread the feeling of needing to will myself out of the bed and waiting til things get \"out of control\" to complete the slightest household task. \nI wish that those in power will educate themselves beyond the hype caused by misinformation and falsely labeled packaging. I wish people would understand that kratom is a herbal supplement that is a safe alternative for those who suffer. This leaf is the difference between night and day and even life or death for many people. This leaf is God's gift for the suffering. Please, let no man take it away. \nSincerely, Amy Jensen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15645","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amy Jensen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be banned.

It has only had positive impacts on my mind and has helped me cope with stress, social anxiety and depression that comes along with it. I also use some other supplements including kava, 5-htp, l-theanine and phenibut. I like to use many different supplements and rotate as needed for my anxiety and Kratom is one of the very best at improving my mood and helping me fight my anxiety. I graduated from college this year and fought the anxieties that come with finishing school like finding a job and have been working as a java developer since august with great success in no small part because of the help of Kratom. This was perfect timing for me to learn about Kratom as it was a vital part of easing my transition from school to the real world. I was so overwhelmed and if it wasn't for supplements like Kratom i may have been yet another depressed socially anxious hermit living off disability in my parents house or even worse i could have went through with my suicidal thoughts that plagues my mind when my depression is at its worst. I am in no way in the clear and I am continuing to fight an uphill battle with my anxiety but am gradually accomplishing positive results. Kratom is only helping to make me have a positive impact on society and in no way inhibits, intoxicates or endangers any more than the supplements listed above in my own anecdotal day to day experience. This is great since many drugs like alcohol and other pharmaceuticals can be very harmful to a users life and also cause intoxication that could make a person have a negative impact on society. When i take Kratom you may only notice that i am more positive and functional as a normal person and no longer feel as anxious and depressed.  I am not a doctor so i can't talk about any long term health effects of usage and hope research can be done to help us all learn more about Kratom. I think Kratom deserves to be researched and used since it has had such a positive impact on my life helping me start to overcome my crippling anxiety in ways i thought would never happen in my lifetime. There is still a long road to go in my journey to overcome my anxiety but in the meantime I will use the whatever tools i have available to better myself and try to live my life to the fullest without letting my mental ailments hold me back too much. In the end i can only speculate what my life would be like without Kratom maybe i take some powerful ssri and become numb or maybe i get addicted and abuse other drugs that could kill me. What i do know is what my life is like having a suppliment like Kratom and with it i still have some faith in my life a time when my faith was almost lost. I am grateful you are all taking the time to listen to our comments about how Kratom is impacting our lives and hope an informed decision will be made for the benefit of society at the end of the comment period.\n\nSincerely,\nAnonymous 23 year old male","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4609","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a student physical therapist and personal advocate of M. speciosa, better known as kratom. As you might know, kratom has gained some political attention recently, some positive and some negative. I know that part of the DEA's job is educating yourselves on the issues that matter to the public, and I appreciate you taking the time to educate yourself on this issue which is very important to many Americans.\n\nPlease consider advocating for the regulation of kratom as a dietary supplement vs. DEA scheduling. There is an inherent risk with putting any kind of substance in the body, and there are also many potential benefits. We need all need food and water to survive, but we can suffer toxicity from a substance as benign as water when imbibed to excess. There are reports of toxicity from legal, regulated substances such as St. John's wort and kava1, yet this amount of risk is considered permissible because each of us assumes personal responsibility for what we put in our bodies, and there are also many potential benefits to sufferers of chronic pain. In conjunction with diet and exercise, kratom has allowed me to stay functional in the workforce despite chronic pain. I have exhausted prescription drugs available for my condition to no avail. Please keep this plant accessible and legal for the public through reasonable regulation and quality control measures, not scheduling. Thank you.\n\n1. Singh, Y. N. (2005).

I have never been in trouble with the law, care for my elderly grandmother with whom I share a dwelling, and maintain a 3.9 GPA at a local university; looking forward, I plan to attend graduate school. I am also a regular user of the plant Mitragyna speciosa, commonly known as Kratom. I have a history of depression, which until two years ago, I was self-treating with other herbal remedies, like St. John's Wort and Valerian root; unfortunately, both of these caused me to experience some side-effects to which the benefits only marginally outweighed. Then, upon doing research on the internet, I stumbled across a forum in which members provided testimonials on their experiences with Kratom and how the consumption of the plant had been helpful in abating their depression. I did some more research on Kratom specifically, and then, seeing no reason to believe I should come of any harm, decided to locate a vendor and order a powdered preparation of the plant. In the time that has passed since I received my first order, my depression is all but non-existent, and without the sedation and mental fog that the aforementioned herbal supplements had a tendency to cause in me. \n\nYou may ask why I, as an individual who works in a pharmacy setting, would choose not to seek a pharmacological solution to my problem. The answer is that I have, historically. I mentioned some negative side-effects from my previous self-administered herbal regimen; those were nothing in comparison to those I experienced with modern pharmacological treatments for depression. I was tried on different varieties and combinations of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors, and Tricyclic Antidepressants, all of which failed to alleviate my depression and caused a slew of negative side-effects. Kratom has been my only saving grace, and it frightens me to think that something that has been so beneficial for myself and others may come to be categorized and associated with dangerous narcotics and other substances of abuse.\n\nI ask of you, as a respected government body, to please reconsider the scheduling of Kratom and it's active alkaloids. It is not harming us, it is helping us.\n\nSincerely,\nNieko E","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7526","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nieko E","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA, \n\nMy name is Marie Mauerman and I am 56 yrs. old. I am a grandmother and am amazed that I am sitting here typing a letter to the DEA! I have been drinking Kratom tea for several years and have NEVER gotten high from it. It reminds me of coffee and that is what I have always thought of it as. I drink a cup in the morning and it gives me energy like a really good cup of coffee but without the jitters. I cannot believe you are considering putting this on the Schedule 1 list. I mean it isn't even close to being heroin or even marijuana. I feel like the people at the DEA should have to try something that is a natural herb before placing it on a list like that. \n\nI discovered Kratom after the death of my nephew. His name was Dennis Howells and was from a wealthy family. I say that because he became addicted to heroin due to a broken arm in which his doctor gave him an opiate pain medication. His death was devastating to his family. Especially his mother as you can imagine. His mother started a grief support group as well as Solace of the Valley that helps those who suffer from addiction. I helped her in these endeavors. After searching the Internet I found out people addicted to Heroin were using Kratom to help alleviate the withdrawal symptoms and I began to tell people about it. I saw first hand these kids finally being able to get off heroin. They stayed off of heroin and were able to quit Kratom with nothing but a headache as the withdrawal symptom. (Same as if you stop drinking coffee). \n\nI thought I should really see what this stuff does if I am telling people about it. I drank a cup of tea. It tasted terrible but after drinking it I realized that I felt good. Not high or anything like that. I just felt good. I have sciatica and often cannot move around well without my back killing me. It doesn't cure sciatica but it helped me feel better. It is like drinking a really good espresso coffee from Italy except there are no jitters and my heart does not beat fast. I really wish you would try it before making this horrible decision.\n\nI am sure my nephew would be alive today had I discovered this Kratom before he died. My brother suffers from bi-polar disorder and drank Kratom when the doctor changed his medicine recently. The doctor was amazed at how well he handled the change of medicine with the Kratom. There was no severe mood swings that usually happen when a person with bi-polar changes medicine. My brother took a lot more than I would and he did not OD. It made him sick to his stomach and that was only for about 20 minutes.\n\nI understand that there were 15 deaths that are being blamed on Kratom, however it is a natural leaf and I am under the impression there was other things in their system so how can you blame Kratom? My nephew would have lied about what he was taking but admit to the Kratom because it would not get him high. So the families of these poor people would blame the only thing they were told the person was taking. Since there is not much known about it yet the police, medical professionals, coroners and addiction specialist immediately villainies this simple herbal tea that has been used for centuries. Please do not fall into this trap. You are the professionals and are the ones who will let these others know that it is not harmful. If you need proof then do not schedule it so people can run more studies. The studies that have been run recently have shown it to be very safe and assist addicts to get off of the very dangerous drugs.\n\nPlease do not schedule Kratom or at least try it before you do. Drink a cup of this tea and see how you feel. I am still sitting here saying to myself that I cannot believe I am writing this letter to you for two reasons. The first is because I am a gerontologist that specializes in Alzheimer's disease and has never been involved in drugs. The second is I can't believe that this simple tea that I have been drinking for years is even being considered as a drug of any kind. Thank you for all the things you do to keep us safe. Banning this herb is not one of those things\n\nPlease feel free to call me if you have any questions.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4980","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marie Mauerman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think it's disgusting that in order to patent two alkaloids you'd make an entire plant illegal to a nation of people who want and need the plant Kratom for it's amazing benefits.

I think this plant should be left legal as it was when it sprouted and the earth gave it to us to use.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12572","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"jason brimer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \n\nI find it very discouraging to hear that something so helpful to recovering addicts will be taken away from them.

There is a tremendous difference between substances that are addictive and dangerous, such as heroin, cocaine, and oxycontin and other synthetic opiates. With opiates such as oxycodone, efficacy decreases over time. This is not true with kratom, and this is a crucial point: the pain relief that it provides remains constant with the same amount taken, as the human body does not \"adapt\" to kratom as it especially does with the synthetic opiates and with heroin. Those of us who have used kratom for pain relief instead of truly dangerous and addictive substances such as oxycontin, oxycodone, and hydrocodone, are urging you to please do the right thing and keep this natural substance off the schedule list. Let researchers figure out the reasons why this substance is able to provide pain relief and anxiety reduction without being addictive or dangerous. The opioid epidemic in the U.S. may well be solved by these discoveries.

I vigorously oppose the DEA's move to put kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. \n\nI began using kratom tea in 2011 after discovering the plant online. I had begun to suffer from degenerative disc disease several years prior, which lead to issues with extreme nerve pain, resulting in cervical fusion surgery and other procedures. Despite these procedures and years of treatment and physical therapy, my severe pain issues continued unabated and resulted in a serious decline in my quality of life and ability to work. Using kratom tea, however, has allowed me to mitigate many of these issues, become physically active again, and be able to fully engage with both my family and my business again, with no deleterious side effects. Kratom tea has, without question, immensely improved my quality of life. \n\nI firmly believe that kratom should remain available as a regulated, unadulterated dietary ingredient. The benefits that I have enjoyed from this plant are far-reaching, and the potential for study for kratom is vast. I also believe that scheduling this plant in its natural form would have disastrous consequences for many, including myself.\n\nThank you for your attention.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15639","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adam Wright Carmean","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am an RN and we need an alternative to helping people who are in pain.

I have suffered from chronic myofascial pain and a severe, intractable iliopsoas spasm in my hip since I was 19 years old. An avid hiker, four years ago I contracted Lyme disease and ehrlichiosis and spent a week in the hospital. Though I made a full recovery, my immune system has not been the same, and my chronic pain has worsened considerably. I employ a holistic approach to managing my pain, which includes physical therapy, trigger point injections, a TENS unit, meditation, and up until five years ago, medication. In 2011, I discovered kratom and ever since I began using it, I have had almost zero need for muscle relaxants and narcotic pain medication. With two to three moderate doses of kratom per day, I am able to function at my highest level; I finished graduate school, I have an internship as well as a job, and in my spare time I hike and garden and am working on building a nonprofit to help trauma survivors access mental health care. Without kratom, I will either have to give up my functionality or return to using pain medication. This is my greatest fear come true. \n\nThousands of people like me have derived tremendous health benefit from using kratom in moderation to relieve chronic pain, depression, anxiety, allergies, and to treat opioid dependence as a substitute for suboxone or methadone.\n\nIn contrast to the rampant and factitious rumors that kratom is the new heroin, kratom is an herb native to Southeast Asia, related to the coffee plant. It is neither opioid nor opiate, nor is it related to marijuana. In low doses, it is mildly stimulating, much like caffeine, and in higher doses it is slightly sedating and helpful with pain. While the active chemicals in kratom do bind weakly to opioid receptors in the brain, they are also partial agonists, and do not produce the euphoria caused by classic opiates and opioids (e.g. heroin and oxycodone). Active chemicals in chocolate, cheese, and human breast milk all bind to opioid receptors, as do commonly available over-the-counter remedies like dextromethorphan; yet none of these substances are cause for alarm. \n\nUnfortunately, the rationale for emergency scheduling of kratom is based on unfounded assumption and buzzword hysteria. Kratom is not equivalent to heroin at all; heroin is eventually metabolized into morphine in the body. Many commercially available and commonly prescribed opiates are converted to even stronger morphine metabolites (hydrocodone and oxycodone in particular). Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, the active chemicals in kratom, are not, and do not have a close chemical relation to morphine. \nThe DEA references 15 kratom-related deaths; however, I find myself unable to locate a single instance of toxicity in a user that ingested solely kratom. The ones I was able to locate are instances of polysubstance use, which is an entirely separate issue as the presence of other psychoactive drugs renders the assessment of kratom as a deadly drug to be entirely inaccurate. I also confess that I'm quite confused as to the proportionality of the DEA's reaction: the CDC's study of alcohol poisoning deaths in Massachusetts between 2010 and 2012 showed 11.9 deaths per million. Caffeine is the most common addiction in the country and produces withdrawal symptoms upon cessation. Nicotine is an unscheduled psychoactive substance demonstrated to be addictive, and smoking tobacco is known to be causative for numerous forms of cancer. What's more, the strong opiates in Schedule II are behind an epidemic of opioid addiction in Massachusetts. Other drugs in Schedule II include methamphetamine, ketamine, and cocaine, as they all have recognized medical uses. Rendering kratom a Schedule I substance effectively says that it has no known medical value and high potential for abuse. \n\nIn light of this, the \"emergency\" scheduling of kratom is unfounded and actively harmful. At minimum, kratom deserves to be researched and subjected to clinical trials. That will not be possible if the DEA's action is not reversed. Please do this nation a favor and allow for the continued legal, responsible use of kratom so that it can help thousands of people achieve and maintain quality of life in the face of their health issues.\n\nSincerely, \nJessica M.

After 35 years in the construction business, I have a lot of pains, including lower back. Before kratom came into my life I took OTC anti-inflamatories daily and occasionally prescription opiates. Kratom is such a good anti-inflamitory and pain reliever that I no longer take the OTC or prescription pills. My digestive system and liver are far healthier with kratom.\nA bonus for me is that kratom is also a histamine blocker. I was able to go through the entire 2016 allergy season without taking any antihistamines. Thanks to kratom's allergy relief, I am not having sleep apnea problems when I have a cup of the tea.\nAlso, my wife died March first of this year. It was extremely stressfull and depressing for me. A friend gave me some kratom to try, and it elevated my mood and made my life tolerable during the subsequent difficult months.\nI don't like to take pills, and consequently I highly value this herb that gives me relief from life's miseries in a natural herbal form.\nPlease do not turn this benign, healthy and beneficial herb into an illegal street drug.

I suffer from severe depression and anxiety, and this plant has been the only saving-grace in my life. I also suffer from debilitating endometriosis and instead of hydrocodone, I am able to substitute this much safer pain-reliever. My quality of life while using kratom increased dramatically. I understand the concern for our youth and I would strongly advocate this plant be 21+ so as to ensure it is being used in a responsible manner. However, it is not a danger to most individuals. This is a remarkable plant in the coffee family with extraordinary medical possibilities. \nPlease understand that kratom users are not anti-social miscreants craving a fix. We are people who function responsibly in society. I would never touch an illegal drug, and would never want to break a law. I am an educated, upstanding citizen who contributes to my community in every way I can. I have simply found a plant that has saved me from dangerous pathways (including prescription medications) in my desperate search for relief. Please view this topic through the eyes of compassion. I have suffered tremendously in the past, but am now able to be a productive citizen.

Two common misnomers about Kratom is that it has a negative overdose factor and is responsible for causing psychosis with frequent Kratom users. In regards to overdose, it is a virtual impossibility. There are as many Kratom overdoses as there are marijuana overdoses; which are essentially zero fatalities. I personally have overdosed on strong Kratom and what happens is that your body vomits out the excessive Kratom from your system. No harm, no foul. I have personally noticed a recent onslaught of hit pieces in regards to Kratom overdoses in the media. I can assure you Kratom did not cause these individuals demise, and it would be relevant/appropriate to look at the psychiatric/illegal-drug history of each individual case of people who have been associated with Kratom deaths for the real causes (other than Kratom usage) behind their passing's. \n\nLastly, I find the recent ban by the DEA on Kratom to conveniently coincide with the rise in Kratom popularity. Is the Kratom market absorbing some of the profits from the pharmaceutical industry? Is Kratom becoming a problem for the Big-Pharma Lobbyist's and the powers-that-be? I assure the reader that Kratom is 1,000 times safer/healthier than current drugs that are being prescribed by physicians/psychiatrists. Further testing would prove that. Why is the DEA & Big-Pharma punishing the general public for choosing natural supplements over their high side-effect causing drugs (i.e. antidepressants)? I think those are fair questions to ask.

I am the mother of a wonderful 2 year old little boy named Damon. I was introduced to Kratom a year ago by my boyfriend, Jacob. He informed me that is was amazingly effective for all kinds of pains, discomforts and ailments. I've been taking it intermittently ever since. I had always been very anti-drug, and I'll be the first to tell you that Kratom is no \"street drug\". It isn't something to get high off of, that isn't the point of Kratom. Kratom is a shoulder to cry on, a warm bed to come home to, a lullaby, a hug, a savior. Kratom tells you everything will be okay, and means it! The \"high\" associated with Kratom is significantly more mild than cannabis, even. Aside from that, you have to take quite a lot to get anywhere near that. People use it to feel better, not to have a \"trip\". Personally, I have found that it helps me a lot with my digestive issues. Back in early February of this year, I had to have my gallbladder removed due to a gallstone being lodged in my bile duct. Since it's removal, I have still been plagued by digestive problems. They are tremendously more mild, but they indeed do still occur. Most often it manifests in the form of abdominal cramps or diarrhea due to the constant stream of stomach acid flowing through my digestive tract. Thankfully, Kratom's most common side effect, which is constipation, ends up helping me a great deal! In my case, even the \"bad\" side of Kratom is surprisingly good! It also relieves my knee and foot pain associated with standing for hours on end at my place of employment. I told my mother about the pain relief and mood boost that Kratom provided me with, and she gave it a try shortly thereafter. She ended up loving it! It helps her with her persisitent chest pain, which is a symptom of her Barret's Esophagus and all of the damage that has been done to her upper digestive tract due to severe acid reflux. She now takes it daily and it is the only pain management treatment that is effective for her pain! On top of that, it helps her with her depression and her stress! Kratom has made my mother fuctiontial, even through all the pain and discomfort. Kratom has served my family very well, and has given us all the power and motivation to work, play, live and enjoy our lives once again. This is a miracle plant, which has saved countless lives by relieving pain and providing a happiness boost! Ban Kratom and you ban happiness and comfort for many, many Americans.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12747","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sabreena Lutz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not agree with the ban on kratom.\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely, \n\nJoseph Whitis","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8758","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Whitis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 42 year old CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine programmer and  CAD (Computer Aided Drafting) mechanical drafter.

Nausea is the only affect which is caused from taking too large of a dose. There is little to no withdrawal after stopping at least no more than coffee. The FDA recognizes the risks involved with prescription drugs and the growing threat these drugs have become to our country.

I work at an herb apothecary and that's how I was introduced to Kratom. Kratom has personally been indispensable for me in assisting with my departure from the downward spiral of lethal, highly-addictive opioid painkillers. Since discovering Kratom I haven't taken a single opioid and have now stopped all drug use because of the easing off that kratom afforded me. This is a common story for countless other individuals and it continues to champion a host of benefits with little negative side-effects and a very low abuse potential. The scheduling of Kratom is an appalling misuse of governmental time and money. Not only is this grossly unjustifiable, it is directly detrimental for those in need of alternative pain treatment for severe illnesses as well as those suffering from addictions frequently caused by this very treatment. Kratom deserves to be as easily dispensed through the free market as coffee currently is, with all the market pressures that comes with, stabilizing the product and ensuring quality. We ask that the DEA not place itself firmly, once again, on the wrong side of history and force an all-natural plant in the legal cage of an invisible schedule.

I was in and out of the hospital for multiple surgeries and began a years long journey of chronic pain and the search for relief from it. The first weeks after the accident, I was on a morphine drip followed by assorted versions of opiates and numerous anti-swelling medications. As the years ticked off I began to realize what a dire situation I was in as I tried to get off opiates and deal with my back and  foot. Started physical therapy. Got corrective orthotics to put in my shoe, I had to sit with my foot elevated above my heart or it would swell up bigger than my shoe. Spent a long time on crutches or a strap on boot so I could walk. I went to Chronic pain  management 2 different times for a year each, had physical therapy and accupuncture and massage. I was taking 12, #40 oxycontins a day for 15 years.I had to change something. I began to taper off the oxycontin but had a miserable time of it. Years went by, still tapering, slowly, hating how difficult it was. Got down to 5 #10 oxycodone a day but felt stuck there.  One day a friend  emailed me about something that might help,Kratom. I never heard of it but gave it a try.  The resulting outcome was life changing. It seemed at first to give me a lift like a good cup of coffee, but then came the surprise. My pain was almost completely gone but more importantly, the un-ending cravings I had experienced stopped. The next morning, I had 1 tsp. of kratom in O.J., the same thing happened. In two weeks, I met with my Doctor to tell her I would no longer need the Oxycodone. That was over a year ago. I have stopped and started Kratom many times without ill-effect. It leaves me in a painlefree, well rested state of mind. I continue to enjoy a cup of Kratom tea twice a day and my life has changed.

I considered and even attempted suicide more than once.  \n\nSince discovering kratom, I've picked up a part-time job and am able to exercise (gently) 3-4 days a week.  I no longer am confined to my bed with depression and pain, which is why this plant must remain available.  I cannot return to an invalid lifestyle or I will die.\n\nPlease listen to the voice of The People and keep this herbal supplement off the Scheduled Substances list.  It doesn't belong there.  With a little public education, this plant can be an asset to our society.  It has already been used in Asia for millennia to improve stamina and relieve mild to moderate pain.  I'm confident that consenting adults here in America are capable of using it successfully as well.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nAnnette Prichard","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2308","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Annette Prichard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Brad Anderson and I am a 34 year old father of three.

I cannot put it in any simpler terms.  For over fifteen years my life was in shambles.  I was already a full blown alcoholic and then I injured my back.  I was prescribed opioid painkillers for bulging discs in my back.  I was soon abusing both alcohol and painkillers.  I could not hold down a job and was only living to kill physical and emotional pain.  \n\nDespite numerous detoxes, treatment centers,  and AA meetings,  I could not remain sober.  This cycle was repeated for over ten years.  Then I discovered kratom and everything changed.  Not only was my physical pain alleviated without the side effects of prescription painkillers.  But the real surprise was that my obsession to drink was greatly diminished!  \n\nFor the past several years, I have lived pain free and sober.  My anxiety and depression lifted and I started being a productive member of society again.  All thanks to a PLANT. \n\nKratom has been used safely for thousands of years and much like marijuana, there is NO record of anyone dying from an overdose.  Please do not ban this miracle plant.

I am a 52-year-old self-employed business owner. I started using kratom over a year ago because I am interested in natural methods of becoming healthy and I read about kratom on a blog that I follow.\n\nI've been drinking kratom as a tea a few times a day, substituting it for coffee, which I've found makes me much too anxious these days.  I enjoy the mild stimulant effects I get from kratom.  I find it much more gentle than caffeine.  I especially benefit from using kratom before I exercise.  It keeps me motivated to keep going. I've never felt a desire to use more kratom than I currently use everyday. It seems to have a ceiling effect similar to coffee, where more isn't necessarily \"better\"--at least for me, personally.  \n\nI oppose the scheduling of kratom in any way, shape, or form.  I find it incomprehensible, frankly, why the DEA would need to schedule this plant.  I have been reading a lot about kratom lately, and it seems completely safe.  From what I've read, the deaths widely touted to kratom, in each case the user was also using many other drugs--making it difficult to \"blame\" kratom for any of these sad events.\n\nI understand many folks use it a form of pain control or to wean themselves off of dangerous opioids. If this is the case, it seems very important that this safe dietary supplement remains completely legal and easily available.  It could be a very useful and necessary tool to fight the terrible opioid addiction epidemic our country is experiencing.  \n\nAgain, please do not schedule kratom.  It's a dietary supplement.

My name is Samantha Hall, I'm 53 years old, retired and an active grandmother and the spouse of a disabled man. I have been supplementing my diet with kratom for 2 years now (which has alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymtagynine). I highly oppose kratom being placed on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. My husband had pharmaceutical resistant depression and a lot of pain due to work injuries (he'll write his own comment) and I was looking into helping him with natural supplements when I found kratom. I learned that it can help people with insomnia and which I had severe insomnia. I would go for sometimes 48 hours with no sleep and it was taking a huge till on my health and I was unable to spend any time with my grandchildren and I was barely able to take care of myself, not to mention my husband. My doctor told me she would not prescribe me anything addictive for insomnia. The two antidepressents she prescribed me didn't work and just made me terribly ill. Therefore I have had no medical treatment for debilitating insomnia. No hope. No where to turn for help. That is, until I read about others supplementing their diet with kratom and I tried it myself. The very first night,  I slept though out the night after consuming half a teaspoon of kratom. Kratom has been a miracle for me. In hind site, I'm glad my doctor never prescribed insomnia medication because they're all addictive and one builds up a tolerance to them and has to take more and more, from what I read. My health was deteriorating due to insomnia and now I am a healthy, active participant in society. Kratom needs to remain available so people such as myself who have no where else to turn for alleviating certain ailments will continue to have this choice. I've also never understood why it's not a constitutional right to supplement our own personal bodies with a natural God-given plant. I know you're trying to protect us, but we are adults and it seems to me that a warning of concerns and warning of all possible issues that could arise would be sufficient. That's what pharmaceutical companies do--they give us a list of side-effects and interactions (which often includes from headache all the way to death) and then let us make our own choice. I know we have doctors to tell us all about side-effects and such. But lets be honest, doctors rarely have the time to educate us on an RX, they barely have time to evaluate what RX we may need. We read about the possible issues with an RX from the pharmacy pamphlet or most of the time online from RX help sites and from other consumer's experiences they place online. So why can't the DEA simply give us any and all warnings they deem important and then allow us to decide. On a side note, kratom has had the additional positive side-effect of lowering my blood sugar (the RX medications for this my body cannot tolerate). Rarely does an RX have positive side effects.

My name is George \"Will\" Thomas, I'm 19 years old, and I work nights at a gas station for now. Kratom has significantly improved my, and several of my friends', quality of life. I strongly oppose the scheduling of kratom as a controlled subtance, I think it'd be a huge loss for everyone using it for its wonderful ability to make self-medication feasible and a huge loss for personal freedom in general. I was diagnosed with scoliosis several years ago and within the last year or so especially my back pain has caught up with me, as I'm sure it will continue to do for the remainder of my life. Two of my close friends also use kratom to self-medicate for back pain. One of them has marfan syndrome and has been using kratom for about two years. It's allowed him to be largely free of his chronic pain without having to turn to harmful and addictive pharmaceutical opioid pain medications, especially since over-the-counter pain medications will not alleviate his pain most of the time. My other friend has scoliosis, like me, and has been using kratom for about a year. It also alleviates his pain, that OTC drugs won't, without having to resort to narcotics. The friend who also has scoliosis introduced me to kratom, and I found that it is profoundly helpful in reducing my pain. Its anxiolytic and sedative properties are also a nice added benefit for the occasional being unable to sleep. Kratom has certainly reduced my and my friends' pain, provided plenty of others around the world with relief by its psychoactive properties, and even is a good tool for recovering opioid addicts. \n\nThis New York Times article roughly outlines a few of the major benefits of kratom, but researching further the full benefits of it would hopefully change the mind of anyone who thinks kratom is harmful:\nwww.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/10/19/is-kratom-the-plant-that-heals-or-kills/benefits-of-kratom-are-more-legitimate-than-the-fears\n\nKratom is more than just an extremely helpful tool for alleviating a number of physical ailments, it stands for our personal freedoms in terms of being able to choose how we medicate ourselves. Adding kratom to schedule I would be a serious loss not only for those who rely on its benefits to live happily but for personal freedom in general.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21382","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"George Thomas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement\nkratom.

Miracle cure or as safe as eating food? Probably.around the same context. Moderation is the key to the plant being a supplement and not a problem. Much like anything else consumable, the alkaloids can be beneficial or potentially harmful depending on dosage and duration. Much like the difference between a few vitamins versus taking so many that toxicity becomes a problem, Kratom can cause problems. Disclaimer aside, this is my experience. \n   I have a degenerated disc in my back and multiple old nagging injuries which benefit from the use of this substance but I choose to consume it for anxiety and ptsd. Not to be politically incorrect but many justify drug abuse for unjustified reasons. I have had panic attacks lasting from minutes to days my entire life. Not pseudo problems, but true attacks. Heart rate at 160 sitting still, paralyzed and sweating,tunnel vision, followed by extreme fatigue and a depressed state of mind. The battle has been real and the options I have had prior to Kratom were both ineffective and wrought with side effects. Opiates are brutal and there is no arguement and anti depressants have inevitable side effects. Insomnia,bowel issues,impotence are among just a few. It may work well for some but I have yet to know a happy consumer of either and to say the least,I have asked around enough to write at least an article on the consequences of both.\n   over a decade ago I hurt my back so bad that I had a hard time even getting out of bed or bathing much less being a functional member of society and trying to work. Doctors invariably prescribed me hydrocodone , methocarbamol, and strong anti-inflammatories. within a few weeks of consumption I was able to overcome the muscle spasm flare ups and function with just mild to moderate pain. I am afraid of damage to my organs with any chemical or drugs so I discontinued use a few times after using the prescribed medication. With each prescription, I stopped using them when the pain was manageable. Overall in a little over ten years I have taken them for a month four times. Each of these durations, it only took a week or so to develop a tolerance as well as a craving for them. I could have become an addict easily but my fear of the drugs kept me from filling the bottles again. Side effects were moderate and consistent. Needle pupils, erratic heart rate, incontinence,impotence,sweating,hot flashes, insomnia, so on. the worst part was coming off of the drugs after just a few weeks and having the typical withdrawal symptoms of opioids that lasted around a week by just taking as recommended by physicians. It almost  ensures another statistic of addiction to begin these prescriptions and that is no secret.\n   After my Dad passed I had a hard time dealing with it, 8/30 years old for the first time I tried antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication. Lexapro and Klonopin was prescribed by what I considered to be a good and conservative doctor. He strongly advised counseling and exercise and being proactive and healthy about managing anxiety and depression. That said, I had been doing those things for many months to no avail. I took them for roughly three months and the side effects were.... Ghastly. Basically the same as the medication for pain but with much worse insomnia hands and absolutely conquering impotence. my memory was adversely affected as was my social ability hands I basically became a Zombie. Lethargy was already a problem which was only worsened with the meds. I discontinued them. the withdrawal symptoms were a lot tougher than I would have imagined. I fell into a depression like I had never experienced before and I am a veteran of the State of Mind. The insomnia was terrible and the overall symptoms were much like an addict coming off of a drug Because that is exactly what it was.\n   Que Kratom. for roughly a year I went without any medication or treatment for both physical and emotional duress and everyday is a battle that way. After researching homeopathic and natural remedies to both I discovered mitragyna speciosa. I have been taking as medication for roughly six months now. somewhere around 10 grams a day of plain leaf maeng da and occasionally days with up to 20 grams. thus far it has improved my sleep patterns, my energy levels, my ability to exercise and socially it is night and day. I still have anxiety but it is easily manageable compared. I have studied the withdrawal symptoms of Kratom and wanted to experience them for myself. I must be unbiased and say that the withdrawal symptoms are real. After about 24 hours I was a little restless and felt like I had a cold. day 2 was perhaps slightly worse with not being able to sleep as well. day 3 I was over the hill. I went a total of a week without consumption and was normalized. Throughout the detox I was still able to function and was not even close to the misery from pharmacy options.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3116","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"DEA please keep Kratom legally available to help with less invasive option to help with chronic illness and such.

I hold a PH. D. in zoology and physiology from a major research university and am retired from a university teaching career of nearly forty years during which, as a zoology professor, I taught such courses as human anatomy and physiology, genetics, physiology, and embryology.  I am confident that my education, my teaching experience, and my familiarity with the research process including publication in peer-reviewed journals provide me with a legitimate background to evaluate research information better than most people.  \n\nKratom has been investigated at various universities, including research at colleges of pharmacy, and the results of those investigations are very promising.  Kratom has been found, in this research, to relieve symptoms of opioid withdrawal, depression, pain, etc.  NO significant negative side-effects were noted in this research.  The testimonials by those using kratom are nothing short of amazing!!  Im sure (and hope!) that you have seen and heard many of these, but, in summary, kratom has saved lives  literally and figuratively, without endangering any at all as indicated by factual accounts.\nIn spite of the false claims of the DEA, there are NO reports of substantial negative side effects of the use of kratom!!  Yes, kratom has been found in the bloodstream of some individuals who had died from drug overdoses, but there were much more significant illegal drugs also present that would have been the cause of death rather than the kratom.  Once again, there are NO reports of significant negative side effects of kratom!\n\nIn fact, report after report indicate that it is impossible to overdose on kratom, for the ingestion of excess quantities of kratom induces vomiting, eliminating the product from the body!!  One cannot consume kratom in great quantities!!  Consequently, how can one overdose on kratom?????\n\nAlso, kratom does NOT produce a high!!  Yes, it does relieve depression and anxiety in some individuals, resulting in an improved mental state  simply a return to normality!!  If this is a high, then those of us requiring no medication for psychological problems must be high all of the time!!  Absolutely ridiculous!!!\n\nTestimonies, one after the other, demonstrate that kratom has allowed great numbers of people to return to their normal lives.  I read of one mother who was so crippled by fibromyalgia that she had been bed-ridden for months, totally unable to care for her young family.  Her husband learned about kratom, and, the day after she took her first dose, she was able to prepare breakfast for her family for the first time in months!!  I have read (and have seen videos of) testimonies from U. S. military veterans suffering from PTSD and/or physical injuries suffered while serving our great nation  who credit kratom with saving their lives, often literally.  One such veteran actually recorded at least two videos, one while he was using kratom and one after he no longer could purchase kratom after the DEA actions this fall.  In the second video in which he no longer was using kratom, his body was wracked with twitches and what might be interpreted as mini-seizures  whereas, when he was using kratom, no such symptoms were apparent at all.\n\nIt appears that several pharmaceutical companies are preparing to market active components of kratom in the near future.  It is apparent that the pharmaceutical lobby is acting in Washington and our state capitols to eliminate access to kratom in order to increase the profits of these companies.\n\nHow many lives of our families and friends are we going to allow to be sacrificed for the sake of pharmaceutical profit????\n\nFinally, it is true that one problem with the sale of kratom is its availability in retail outlets such as head shops and truck stops.  Evidence indicates that the kratom sold in such sources often has been dosed with synthetic drugs to induce effects that will result in repetitive sales to customers. This most likely has contributed to legislation in some states that included kratom along with synthetic marijuana and bath salts as banned substances.  It would be very easy to eliminate kratom sales at such retailers and limit sales to businesses that deal exclusively or almost exclusively in kratom, and a number of these (or all?) are internet vendors.  It would be relatively simple to check the kratom sold by this much smaller number of vendors to assure the sale of pure kratom products.\n\nLives can be restored and be saved (literally) by the continued availability of kratom!!!\n\nDr. Michael L .McMahan, Ph.

I am a part-time field merchandiser. I'm writing to ask that Mitragyna Speciosa, aka kratom, not be placed on the schedule 1 list of illegal drugs that have no medical value.\n\nI suffer from chronic pain syndrome due to a rollover car wreck in 2005, which caused neck injuries (2 herniated discs) that were not treatable with surgery, and did not respond to physical therapy. It was treated with hydrocodone and muscle relaxers. At the time I lived in Texas.\n\nUpon moving to New York State in 2013 I discovered that doctors in this state will not prescribe narcotics. My condition was not deemed severe enough to warrant them. I'll admit it was probably for the best overall, but it's still hard to hear that nothing can be done and I will have to live this way for the rest of my life. They all say \"just go home and take ibuprofen,\"\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I read an article about kratom. I researched it, and decided to try it. I have been taking it since. My pain is diminished greatly, and some days eliminated entirely. I have insomnia and RLS as a result of the constant pain. I now sleep much better with taking kratom regularly. The RLS has virtually disappeared. Also, many years ago I was diagnosed with Seasonal Affective Disorder, a chemical imbalance where the pineal gland does not produce enough serotonin during northern winters when the lack of sunlight and cold prevents us from having enough sun exposure to our skin. I have severe depressive episodes during winters. Thanks to kratom, I can deal with these and all my symptoms more easily. \n\nI also have 3 daughters (ages 25, 33, and 35) who have scoliosis and various immune system issues. One has Behcet's Syndrome. Another has psoriasis. The youngest has the worst scoliosis, and only grew to be 4'8' tall. All suffer from at times debilitating pain, which taking kratom has helped. We're not looking for a \"legal high\", we simply want relief from our various symptoms. I'm thankful to have found one with the apparent level of safety that this herb provides. It's wonderful to experience the relief it provides, and realize after several hours of work (merchandising can be strenuous) that I still don't hurt.\n\nPlease don't take this away from me, and millions like me. I agree that some sort of regulation by the FDA is warranted, for the safety of people from unscrupulous vendors. The ones who are honest should be allowed to continue to provide their product.

But Kratom seems to be a far better alternative, all things considered.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6065","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Russell Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 38 years old, a stay at home mom of 2 little boys & a wife to an amazingly understanding husband. I am a teacher by profession, and taught until 2011 but currently home school my eldest child. \n\nI was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, PCOS, and endometriosis in 2007. I also struggle with depression and anxiety as well as PTSD. I also struggle with aspergers syndrome which can compound the symptoms of these ailments. \n\nIn 2011 I began staying home full time with my then 2 year old. I was then on Cymbalta, trazadone, darvocet, ambien, and xanax. My days were filled with struggling to survive and stay awake to take care of my child. I completely went off all medications in 2013 because I took an ambien to sleep after not sleeping for 4 days straight. It knocked me out so bad that I was unresponsive to my toddler who was apparently screaming at the top of his lungs when his dad got home from work. His dad told me that he had to place a mirror in front of my face to see if I was breathing and stayed awake all night to keep an eye on me. I have zero recollection of this. I slowly weaned off cymbalta but quit the other stuff. The struggle to function was not worth the loss my son was experiencing. \n\nI discovered kratom in April of this year when a friend told me about it. I did some reading, and decided to try it. I was unmedicated at the time I tried it (and still am). Kratom has allowed me to be a mom again. It helps me to feel energized in the morning so I can take care of my now 2 boys. It helps alleviate the pain & fatigue that I feel on a constant basis. \n\nTaking kratom away from me would mean taking away my boys functioning mother and my husband's capable wife. Taking kratom from those that use it means taking capable people from society. It would mean addicts falling off the wagon in our drug ridden society, it would mean that those who suffer from constant pain would have to fully rely on prescription drugs and have to be in pain management because of the narcotics prescribed.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8622","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Angela Turner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I'm a 33 year old mother of 2 that has been drinking Kratom tea for 2 years.

I was on the verge of sticking with just my Bachelor's because I have a sever case of Crohn's Disease along with many other health problems (including lesions on my spine caused by the Crohn's and the inflammation which could lead to MS later in life) and when I was on the brink of giving up on life in general because there are no mainstream treatments that actually work for sever autoimmune diseases like Crohn's, I made a last ditch effort to find an herbal alternative that could help with my over all health. What I found was Kratom. When I first took it three years ago, I was basically bedridden because of the pain and the constant trips to the bathroom and the dehydration that went along with that. A month later I was able to go see friends that I had not seen in years and while visiting these friends, I met the love of my life. Because I was able to get out in the world, we were able to build a relationship and a life together. I have had two miscarriages in the past because of my health. When I found out I was pregnant a year and a half ago, I felt I had no choice but to continue taking the Kratom because I knew if I did not, my baby would not survive my body (I would not be able to keep food down to support her or keep enough nutrients in my body to allow her to grow no matter how many vitamins I consumed because that was what happened with my previous pregnancies....) and my baby was born healthy, unaddicted, and, most importantly, ALIVE. She came the day after her due date and to this day she continues to grow big and strong. I took Kratom up until the time my water broke. Obviously, it is not \"herbal heroin\" or she would not have been healthy and well as anyone who has ever seen a baby born to a heroin addicted mom knows. My baby is now eight and a half months old and when I heard about the DEA ban, I collapsed in tears because I do not know how I will function to care for my child if I have to go back to the way I was before I started taking Kratom. In fact, I am twenty nine years old now and I predict that, with the extent of my health problems, I will not see my child turn ten. Kratom has saved my life and, although I will never be healthy and nothing will make me function at the highest capacity for someone my age, I am doing the best I could be doing with my issues because of Kratom and I am the best mom I can be for my baby, the baby I was able to have because of Kratom, because of Kratom. I am not alone. You have many Americans that are telling you that this herb helps us be better in one way or another. In addition to that, regular Kratom powder (I am not sure about the 20X20 extracts or the 50X50 extracts as I have no personal experience with it and I have not read research focused on these products....but to be fair, there was also a powerful caffeine powder that makes people very sick as well and it is still legal) has not been found, by itself, to be harmful in any way. It is not addictive as far as we know. It alone has never taken a single life. People are helped with depression, autoimmune diseases,anxiety, drug addiction, etc. by this seemingly harmless herb. I beg you, respectfully, to drop this ban and to leave the FDA out of it and to leave things as they are because the people you try to protect need something like this to help fight the terrible addiction problems that come from things like heroin (which people are recovering from using Kratom) and pain pills needed for a lifetime of chronic pain. Also, I would just like to note, in my personal experience you do not have to constantly adjust your dose of Kratom to help you as you do with pain medication. I feel as if leaving Kratom as it is right now is a win win for the people and for all of you who are trying to help curb this addiction problem. Please do the right thing by us.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1057","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Keair Snyder","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has saved a friend of mine from being on bedrest to being mobile again.

The DEA scheduling would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown the primary alkaloids in kratom to be beneficial without causing respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\nKratom is a regulated dietary ingredient. Kratom is not a drug. Kratom is not addictive.\nMy name is Melody Ellis.  I am a 59 year old retired RN.  I tried from nursing in 2011 as a result of an opiate addiction.  I went to treatment for this addiction in 2009 and was unable to stay cream for more that 30 to 90 days at a time.   I believe my addiction started as a result of generalized anxiety disorder  and major depressive order.   During treatment I had been diagnosed with both of those and was prescribed Lexapro and wellbutrin.  I retired my license because I did not want the temptation of being around really absolve pays to variety me to lose it or to very into legal troubles.   I started researching alternatives to pain pills and psych meds last year when I became a lunch lady and started working very physically. I noticed my meds were not as effective against anxiety.  I had  a cup worker tell me about her experiences with Kratom.  I was very scared because of my past problem with addiction   but started taking a dose as many of the forums  had suggested.  Today(a year later) I take the same dose and it has enabled me to go to work,  pain and anxiety free.  I no longer have cravings for opiates.  \nWhen I was on pain pills I ended up at my worst having to take 40 to 60 mgs  every hour just to feel normal and continue my day. I also had to find dangerous,  illegal and unethical ways to get those pills.    This had not happened with Kratom.  I can buy it when I need it  take it as I need it without having to increase my dose or my budget.\nIt has  been my experience that Kratom is non addictive,  cost effective way of treating my pain and anxiety.  My grandchildren have their \"Omies\" back  I am a trusted member of my family and society.  Please do not take my life from me.   I lost it once to  opiate addiction and while I may never use another opiate if a kratom is banned,  I know I will loose my ability to function in a productive,   happy normal  life.  Taking 2 doses of Kratom daily  has given me a will and the ability to be a part of this wonderful world.

My hips and pelvis was crushed including my foot being reversed on my ankle.  I spent a couple months in the hospital being bolted back together not knowing if I would ever walk again.  I also spent a couple more months in a wheel chair afterwords. The person that hit me only had 10/20 insurance so in the process I lost everything. Due to the pain I became addicted to pain medication almost immediately and was watching my tolerance levels double month to month.  I tried virtually every pain medicine on the market including eating 2 bottles of Ibuprophen a day. I even went as far as growing my own poppies to make my own medication due the the insane costs of seeing pain doctors. They tried every type of pain medication on me including shots and nothing worked. It hurt my family life and job in a terrible way. I was in constant emotional and physical pain from using the pain pills.  A few months into the medicines I found kratom and have not since used a single pain pill.   I use it as needed now and have been a daily user since that time. I have never had any side effects like I had with pain pills. I don't want to take pain pills. I don't want them in my life. Due to the negative media and my fear that their might be a ban on kratom I actually moved out of the USA about a year ago. If there is a possibility that the government could stop me from using a holistic alternative to help me I would simply rather move to a different country. Yes it is that important to me.  I have seen kratom help so many thousands of people. Of course big pharma doesn't like kratom because it hurts their bottom line so much. Please do the right thing and do not try to keep kratom from the people in the USA. I know of several doctors that actually suggest kratom to their patients. I am also working with a doctor in one of the lead hospitals in Mexico that is encouraging his patients to try out kratom. He does work for the government in Mexico and he is introducing it to the government as a much safer holistic herb.  Pills have stolen the lives of millions of Americans. When people feel they have discovered something that may be helping them please leave it alone. Kratom has never hurt anybody. Its never caused a death unlike all the medicines on the market.   Kratom should not be regulated at all. Its not a drug. Its not a synthetic.  Kratom is simply an herb.  Just because an herb is very effective does not mean it should be regulated or controlled. You have no right to restrict or control the use of herbs. America is supposed to be a free country. God created herbs.

I take Kratom for energy and mood lift through out my day. It helps me to be more productive. I use to struggle with doing things I shouldn't do and Kratom really helps me to not go back to my old habits. I have also lost a lot of friends over the past decade due to over dose. Some of these friends were really close, amazing, and genuine people. I am so tired of loosing friends to the heroin epidemic in this country. I made a you tube collage of all the people I have lost over the years and it really breaks my heart. I have seen this herb transform so many lives and enable them to live a happy productive sober life. I know so many people that use Kratom for so many reasons from fibro, lupas, depression, anxiety, and pain. I even know hard core body builders that use Kratom during for their work outs as well as to manage swore muscles afterwards. This herb comes from south east Asia and is in the same family as coffee. Depending on what you are using it for, it can be an amazing tool to use from day to day. Some people don't have a choice and Kratom is the only answer for them. I def can't see my life with it Kratom and it has truly helped me and so many others in so many ways. I def wouldn't be where I was today if it wasn't for Kratom. I have friends thank me all the time and tell me that I literally saved their life by introducing them to this herb. Please take the time to do your research and really understand that this is a herb that has helped so many lives all across the map. To ban this herb would do so much damage to so many family's and hurt so many people. I really wish people would take the time to do their research instead of banning a herb with out even doing their research and allow to people to speak on the topic. I have been in the Kratom community for over 2 years now, and I must say that we are all one big supporting family that are there for eachother. We have all grown very close and we all have each others backs. We all look out for one another and this herb has brought so many people closer together. We already have a hard stressful life as it is. Kratom is just there to use as a tool during hard times. Please keep Kratom legal. I stand behind Kratom 1000%.

I find for me it was about 75% as effective as Percocet for my chronic pain issues without the addictive and harmful narcotics. I understand that some individuals have abused the substance. If hundreds of teenagers drink 6-10 energy drinks and wind up going to the ER for a racing pulse do we prohibit responsible adults from having a cup of coffe in the morning? If an alcoholic over consumes alcohol and behave negatively do we prohibit hard working taxpayers from having a couple of glasses of wine once or twice a week in the safety of their own home? If people we can't control behave irresponsibly do we punish those who do, not in this country. If 7 toddlers consume dishwasher tablets (which look a lot like candy) do we take dishwasher tablets off of the market? If a few individuals seeking a \"high\"over ingest an effective all natural pain reliever do we prevent honest tax paying citizens from relieving their chronic pain from drinking tea instead of using opioids? We all have to live life at our own risk. This country used to support our right to do so as long as we didn't interfere with others rights. If people abuse alcohol in public or even sometimes in the privacy of their own homes if their behavior is bad enough they are dealt with by the law. Perhaps Congress should look into laws that address people who over consume energy drinks and go to the ER raising costs for all of us and wasting time of clinicians who could be tending to the law abiding. Maybe the same with Kratom. Every new regulation, law, edict, and city code creates fewer law abiding citizens and prohibits freedom in general.

Kratom is a very dangerous drug that is easily bought. Then was very disappointed when the DEA backed off making it a schedule 1 drug, and I am sure is due to pressure from Paul Pelosi, who is in charge of the American Kratom Association. He gives this association an unfair advantage and access to the Federal Government that people like me do not have. How do I know? I had to Detox my son from this Drug back in May, he is just now getting back to normal. Don't believe the people to tell you otherwise, they are just protecting their legal high. My son ordered this from a company for a year, and then started buying it from a store in Austin, Tx.  He has anxiety and concentration issues and the information on the internet said that this is perfect for these issues. He told me it was an herbal supplement and safe.  If you are buying it from a company freely selling the drug, you assume it is safe.\nThe first of May he started having delusions, rambling incoherent speech, restlessness.  After two days of this, we called the Mental Health team to come evaluate.  Their ultimate suggestion is to take him to the hospital for drug testing.  He was rocking, shaking and I said he was like rain man in the movie.  I have a short video of him. \nThe other issue is when someone goes to the hospital for drug testing, this drug is not in the testing protocol, so they think they are clean. The mental health professional who evaluated my son thought he was on meth, all the signs of meth. We went to the hospital, but he was clean, no drugs found in his system. So they sent us home with a very sick boy, did not know how to help him. I took him to a safe place until we could get into see a doctor.  Doctors have no knowledge of this drug, how to treat or what to do.  We called a lot of Doctors before we found one that could see him within a week, most have a month waiting list for new patients.

I have taken it for three years and it has been extremely useful in allowing me to work a strenuous job and take care of my family. After a bad car accident in 2009 I was put in pain management and supplied monthly with a hefty dose of opiates. At first it was helpful but eventually it almost cost me my family. The opiates left me in a fog all the time and I began to spiral out of control. After 3 years of prescribed use I lost my job, crashed my car and missed my daughter's important surgery as a direct result of the painkillers I was taking. I was given an ultimatum by my wife to get off pain pills or get a divorce. I have 4 children who I love and cherish and the answer was easy: to discontinue taking opiate medication. I was tapered by method of  Suboxone and I successfully quit the pain medication. However the results of my car accident came glaringly back into my life. I was in so much pain and discomfort that I was pretty much useless. I spent most of the day in the shower or in bed trying to catch up on lost sleep from pain. This went on for months after my taper and I started to become really depressed. I thought about taking pain meds again but realized that wasn't a viable option. I had had years of physical therapy including acupuncture, trigger point injections, coritozone injections and chiropractic visits. They could not relieve the pain I was in. So in desperation I tried to find something natural that wasn't addicting and wouldn't ruin my life. That's when I found kratom. Having been on daily on 4 morphine, 6 Norco and 6 baclofin I was well aware of how opiates affected me. When I began to use kratom I could find no comparison between the two. It helps my mild to moderate pain with no inebriation and no craving to keep wanting to dose. It does fall short of my acute severe flair ups but helps it to be more manageable. I have e now been working for two and a half years straight with no late shows or absents. My employer took me back after I explained I had been on opiates before and that was why I was extremely unreliable. I was graciously given a second chance and I have been productive, reliable and responsible. I can only attribute this to kratom as it's the only thing I take. My pain is manageable and I am able to focus on my job and my family. My wife thinks ita a godsend considering the hell she was forced to live in during my time on Rx pain meds. Recently she had a hysterectomy and had a difficult time refilling her Rx pain meds because the surgeon wanted her dr to fill it but the dr refused to get back with her and place the order. She took powdered kratom leaf in gel capsules to help ease the pain of her incisions and insides. It helped her to get through weeks of pain and discomfort. She stopped taking it with no problems what so ever. Though it is anecedotal evidence to use it is fact. Kratom has been very beneficial to our lives. We have had no negative impacts from taking it and a ban would be very harmful to our family. Please reconsider this action and be aware of the reality for many people who it has benefited. I and many I know would be willing to undergo examination to document the positive effects it has had with minimal negatives. Don't let my children lose their father to pain and depression because of sensationalized media stories. The truth is kratom has helped many many people suffering from chronic pain, and the evidence shows prolonged opiate use has far more negative effects than positive. You are well aware of the negative effects of Rx pain meds as the supply has been reduced , the process to get prescribed has been tightened and the scrutiny  of those prescribing is high. Let us responsible adults take our leaf in peace and enjoy being able to live life freely not burdened by pain.

The Federal Government lacks Constitutional Authority to ban a Free Citizen's use of a God-given (Genesis 1:11-12 KJV) plant.  Besides, to ban any personal substance use, we would need to amend the Constitution, as we did with the 18th Amendment (for which the Volstead Act, notably, had both religious and medical exemptions).  The Federal Government DOES have the authority to REGULATE Interstate Commerce (i) to protect consumers from corporate abuse, and (ii) to tax gross excesses.  \n\n2.  A top-down model of imposed order is antithetical to basic American Principles of Federalism and Personal Liberty.  The Federal Government should not be stifling innovation.  As it is, the DEA is acting without the broad support of The People and therefore has lost the Moral Authority to lead on this issue.\n\n3.  The time has come to re-think the Purpose of the DEA to better Protect and Serve the vulnerable.  Perhaps we could change the name to \"Drug Engagement Agency\" (to keep the DEA swag), and enact  joint oversight by Justice, Health and Treasury.  This way, the DEA could step into a community that has been ravaged by drugs and provide a temporary socioeconomic plan to spin the local economy in the right direction while providing necessary social and health services infrastructure.  With the right economic model, any given community could be turned around in three months' time, with an additional three years of ACCOUNTABLE oversight.  This will cost  MUCH LESS than you would otherwise might expect.\n\nI am happy to travel down to Springfield to whiteboard out a stronger plan with you.

I'm 21 yrs old. I have a condition called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome which causes joints to slide in and out of place and be extremely unstable or hypermobile because of lack of collagen ( which is what holds your body in place ) along with many symptoms that go along with it . My skull, neck, and upper back are completely fused together with metal and bone graph because of it crumbling on itself. I have no mobility in my neck permanently. It's an extremely painful condition that causes people with it to need extremely painful surgeries. including fusions of metal throughout the entire body. which caused me personally to need to be on opiates at a very young age constantly . I also developed an addiction to opiates which was first triggered by fentanyl withdrawls ( fentanyl was prescribed) I wanted to get off of it. But I was so sick I ended up buying something off the streets. It was an on and off thing from there that ended up going downhill very fast. Turning into a heroin addiction along with causing a gateway to other substances. I'm sober now, it's been a few months and I'm very glad to be clean. Kratom has helped so much. from the recent surgery there are times i need to take opioid medications but if I'm able to take kratom most the time I feel much better and am not at such high risk for relapse . As someone who has abused many different drugs I can honestly say Kratom isn't like that, Kratom doesn't get me high. It has similar effects to an antidepressent along with pain relief. Kratom doesn't make me want to use drugs, it's NOT a gateway and would only become a gateway if it's banned, which then will cause people to try and get it illegally which will possibly introduce a drug dealer sort of situation causing a gateway  to other substances. Kratom does not treat conditions but it does help with side effects such as pain and is much safer and more effective than suboxine and methadone for those in recovery from addiction. Kratom saves lives and helps many not need strong dangerous narcotics that otherwise would and will if you go forward with this ban.

I've had 2 major back surgeries with fusions in L4/L5 and deal with constant nerve pain from the discs below the fusion point.  I've suffered from chronic pain for going on 9 years now.  It's constant.  It never stops.  It saps my energy, my strength, my very desire to live.  Words cannot define how life destroying chronic, constant pain is to a person.  It kills their very soul.\n\nFor the first 5 years I saw a pain doctor.  He started me on Hydrocodone, and then as my pain worsened, or the medication was no longer effective, put me on stronger medications and threw in muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and anti-depressents.  At the end, I was on methadone and a concoction of 7 other medications.  With all of these medications I was still hurting.  So much so I could not function.  My last year with the pain doctor, I was unable to stay employed.  I simply had lost the will to do anything.  I spent most of the year laying on the couch, huddled in a ball of pain.  \n\nFinally I had come to the conclusion there was no end.  That I had to stop the pain.  I saw death as my only relief, and had planned out how I would end my life.  I had stopped eating for the last two weeks, limiting myself to sodas and water.  There was no food in my house.  I didn't need any.\n\nThanks to a fearful mother, who upon learning I had no food, took action.  She just wouldn't let go.  With her aid, I fought back one last time.  I began researching alternative medicines and treatments.  I tried several different products off the internet, and thankfully, one of those was Kratom.\n\nWhen I first used Kratom, I didn't think it worked.  I had not taken much of it, roughly 2 grams, and I noticed no effects.  Disheartened, I continued researching, and there were people continuing to swear by the product.  So I slowly upped my dosage to 5 grams.  Finally I felt a little pain relief.  It wasn't the same as I received from the opiods, but it was some relief.  In addition, and more importantly, I had energy, energy I had not had for YEARS.  I wanted to get up, go out, talk to friends.  Things I simply had not been doing.  Not only did I have the energy, I had the desire to do these things.  Prior to Kratom, my only desire was for the pain to end, even if it meant ending my life.\n\nI continued to take Kratom, for the last 4+ years now.  Since then I've gone back to work, and held a job for the ENTIRE time (yup, same job, same company, longest job I've ever held now).  I had been unable to keep a job while under the care of a pain doctor and on all those 'prescribed' medications, having lost 3 jobs before giving up on keeping one and not working for a year.  \n\nBest of all, since switching to Kratom, I no longer see a pain doctor and I ONLY take Kratom.  Nothing else! I feel free.  I feel alive.  \n\nI fear what a ban will mean for me.  It will mean I will have to be shackled to pain doctors once again.  Shackled to medicines that failed me.  Doomed to walk the same path I've already walked, where my entire world is encompassed by unending pain, and where the only escape is suicide.  \n\nPlease do not make this unavailable for those of us who are suffering.\n\nKratom saved my life.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22949","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jimmy Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, I am a weekly Kratom user and I have many uses for this amazing plant.

I have been heavily involved in the care of patients suffering from addiction. I have witnessed the aftermath of drugs such as heroin, oxycontin, and bath salts...and how they systematically dismantle a person's life like a Trojan horse. I have watched the withdrawals. I have administered the Narcan. I know what an addictive substance is capable of. \nKratom is not one of those substances. In fact, it is ludicrous to even liken kratom to any scheduled narcotic, be it illicit or prescription. \nI have even taken kratom myself:\nAt the age of 26 I had major abdominal surgery. It was the first of many surgeries to come.  Time after time I have been sent home with a prescription for percocet. Fortunately, because of my profession, I had a bit of forewarning that other people often go without. Almost every single opiate addict I have ever met has a story that begins with a prescription painkiller. Sometimes many prescriptions. Before they know it they develop an addiction. Eventually they are using any opiate  they can find as a means of escaping the ravaging withdrawal rather than chasing a high. And it is the PRESCRIPTION medication that ultimately starts it all. So many people end up using heroin because it's cheaper and more readily available than the script that got them hooked.  \nUsing kratom for pain relief SAVED me from potential danger. I have never once had a negative side effect. I have never once experienced cravings or experienced detox. There was no \"high\", only less physical discomfort.\nI have uses it as needed off and on for several years. I am a strong, fully functional health care professional. I am just as opiate free as I was before having surgery, thanks to kratom. \n\nBottom line: kratom is a a safe and effective herbal supplement that has pain relieving properties. Safe and effective pain relief is something that should readily accessible. Scheduling kratom will leave many Americans with no way to effectively treat chronic pain...other than dangerous prescription narcotics. I am one of those Americans.\nPlease consider the long term implications of this decision extremely carefully.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6375","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jessica Graves","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern:\nMy name is Martin DeVido and I have been using Kratom for over a year.

I am a certified Pharmacy Technician. I do not feel that Kratom should be placed on the list of schedule 1 drugs. Kratom in my opinion should be considered a plant much like St. John's Wort. Kratom has a great deal of benefits and very few, if any, side effects. I feel that something that can prevent so many problems, should be kept available to the public. \n\nI also take Kratom myself for several different things. It helps me a lot with anxiety, depression and occasionally when I get tension headaches. Being able to take Kratom keeps me from drinking alcohol, which used to be a problem for me. I haven't drank in quite a long time and I'm worried that if Kratom becomes unavailable, I might start drinking again. I have also had to take pain killers for my tension headaches. I had a lot of side effects with the pain killers including constipation, sleepiness and worsening of my depression. I used to feel tired and sleep a lot on pain killers. Kratom makes me feel better and gives me energy. I'm afraid of having to take pain killers again mostly because of my depression. Kratom has saved me and several others from having to go through that. My depression was so bad at times that I felt suicidal. \n\nI was told about Kratom by a friend of my family. I have been taking it for a year and a half. I don't know what I would do with out it. I can take Kratom and still function. If it is no longer available, I don't know what I am going to do. I am scared for myself and scared for all of the people who have come to rely on this plant. Kratom keeps so many people from having to rely on addictive pain killers and anxiety medications. I fear that there will be many overdoses if Kratom is taken away from the public. I also have a cousin that was addicted to Oxycodone which became a vicious cycle with her because of the horrible withdrawals. She was able to start taking Kratom and get off of the Oxycodonde. Opoid addiction is an epidemic and if Kratom were kept available it will save countless lives. People that take Kratom to keep from using other things are at risk for going back to things that are harmful to them. Please keep Kratom available to the public! Please help save lives!\n\nSincerely,\nKrysta Sabrina Meehan","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21423","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Krysta Meehan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using Kratom for two months now and am recovering from a knee injury that left my ACL, PCL, and MCL torn.

I have been fighting for years to see my child again. Its been 7 years without seeing my child. The emotional pain that a mother feels when grieving a living child causes complicated emotional and mental challenges. I have suffered debilitating symptoms that could be described as anxiety, depression and PTSD. I also suffered intense physical aches from years of stress and tension. The pain has been so extreme that at times I couldn't stand life anymore and attempted suicide. I was not living, only surviving and managing pain day in and day out, I never thought that anything other than seeing my child again could cure my agony. One week ago my husband found out about Kratom. I was skeptical and scared. The psychiatric industry had failed to helped me, it actually damaged me even more and I was scared of addiction to any substance. But I was in such despair that I was willing to give it a try. I read about it and was surprised that Kratom helps with every type of pain, and people said it helps with emotional pain as well. I read that it miraculously helps veterans who have PTSD and people come out of pain medication addiction. I read that Kratom made you feel normal, not high, not dizzy, nothing, just normal... I read miracle stories and couldn't wait to try it for myself. I took my first dose skeptically. But then the miracle happened. About 20 minutes after I took it I felt as if the pain banished. I couldn't believe it! All pain, emotional and physical banished... I had experienced intense pain for over 2,500 days with no rest and in less than half an hour the pain was gone! The last week of my life has been a week of remembering what it was life to be pain free again. A week of enjoying being alive. I became stronger and capable to start handling my custody battle from a calm perspective. Be the strong calm mother than my child needs me to be. I am living, not surviving. This week I am really taking care of my home and my husband and I am being as productive in work as I used to be 7 years ago. Taking Kratom out of the market and making it illegal will damage people tremendously, and users like me will do what we have to do to access it... do not create criminals of people who are just trying to be functional. Do not work against people because you will create an unnecessary war. Do not take away something that is helping people get in their feet and be productive, happy, healthy members of society.\n\nThank you for reading.

I am writing to you in order to make my opinion on \"kratom\" known. I have utilized this leaf (which I order whole or in powder form) and consuming it as tea or in smoothies for three (3) years now. I originally decided to try it when my tough physical training schedule caused me to have severe muscular pain lasting for days and rendering me unable to walk up and down stairs. Kratom worked wonders for me in that regard, but it also alleviated my social anxiety and as a result I started dating again and met the woman who would become my wife (we were married in October of 2016). I wanted to stress a few points that I don't often see made:\n\n1. Kratom has never rendered me incapable of performing ANY activity. I routinely drive, type proposals, create graphics for government contracts - including DoD and DHS - and I have given presentations after consuming kratom. It is, to me, the most effective treatment for pain that also provides a slight pep similar to caffeine, but without the jitters. I recently learned that it is a relative of the coffee plant, which convinces me that it should be cultivated and regulated/taxed rather than prohibited. \n\n2. I have several friends to whom I have recommended kratom for things such as migraines, hangovers (yes, sometimes adults do drink too much) and anxiety. Every one who has tried it has stated that it was effective, and none of them have become \"addicted\" or even started using it regularly.  In its leaf or powder form, kratom is no \"drug of abuse\" - but like anything, including caffeine, alcohol or even common kitchen spices like nutmeg, any substance can be abused or converted to more powerful, unnatural versions.  However, even the so-called \"extracts\" of kratom, which I have tried but not particularly liked, are not likely to cause any responsible adult to become an \"addict\" or to overdose. It simply isn't possible in my own admittedly anecdotal experience to consume standard or \"extract\" kratom in sufficient quantities to induce much more than vomiting, followed by feeling standard effects of the substance - slight peppiness and alleviated pain.  In summary, this just isn't a habit forming substance in the same way that most drugs currently scheduled by the DEA can be. \n\n3. I am concerned that the DEA originally decided to simply place kratom on the most prohibitive schedule and to do so based on somewhat dubious or non-public sources. I would, however, be comfortable if - after the period of comment and evaluation has passed - the DEA decided to schedule kratom extracts or treatments of the plant such that the product or the solution which resulted is not available to persons younger than 18 or 21 except by prescription from a medical doctor/physician.  The regulatory and enforcement framework for this type of restriction may be difficult to implement, however. But the leaf itself or the powder form of pure kratom simply does not belong on any type of law enforcement list. I understand that some states have succeeded (and some have failed) in prohibiting kratom, but in each of these cases there was a representative legislative process under which this was accomplished and there is a transparent, legislative process by which it can be amended or reversed in the future. \n\nIn almost any case, other than for the most dangerous street and designer drugs, I am for regulation and taxation. I don't want the DEA to lose focus on its core mission of protecting the American public from actual drugs with dangerous precedents and I also don't want to push botanicals like kratom into the black market where the drug cartels of Mexico and other criminal organizations become the primary vectors of entry for prohibited items or substances that people will attempt to obtain regardless of prohibitionist policies. I also am extremely uncomfortable with the thought of jailing otherwise law abiding, tax paying American citizens who contribute in almost every phase of society because kratom has provided them with a miracle cure of sorts. \n\nFinally, I think that research organizations and pharmaceutical companies should be able to study this important plant and placement on the DEA schedule (especially I and II) makes this (as a matter of intent) nearly impossible. \n\nThank you for this opportunity to express my concerns regarding what is a very important matter to me personally as well as to many, many other people - some of whom face crippling addictions to drugs and pharmaceuticals which kratom has seriously helped them break. \n\nSincerely,\n\n-CC\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19302","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Casy Cook","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My brother introduced me to Kratom and I tried it at his house.

I work for a substance abuse treatment facility and homeless shelter. Many of these patients are or have been addicted to drugs. Kratom has been a mirical in many of these mens lives helping many of these men fight the urge for opioids an maintain long term sobriety. Kratom has truly changed many of these men to productive members of society. Kratom has helped me in my personal life as well. I was the victum of a horrible accident. Without kratom I would still be on prescription pain killers. Kratom eliminated the urge to use those pain pills and has actually helped my pain as well. This is not a drug! This is a  plant in the coffee family and has no opioid  or narcotic like effects. This herb removes the urge for other drugs and provides me with a safe cost effective alternative to drug addiction and poverty. Kratom has allowed me to become a productive, pain free member of society and allowed me to be a loving member of my family once again. Today I am pain free and drug free. I rarely use this herb anymore but I see it help hundreds of recovering people every day.   Please allow time for the truth about this plant to come out. Iam a responsible adult consumer of Kratom for help with cronic pain and depression. If you support this ban and contribute to the schedulng of this herb , you will not have the support of my family and hundreds I work wth.

I am 25 and currently work full time in a warehouse for The Home Depot. The work I do is very strenuous and tiring. Kratom has helped alleviate pain and fatigue when needed so I can preform to the demand my job requires. I no longer need coffee to keep me awake or pain relievers like tylonal or ibuprofen to keep my muscles from aching. I was referred to Kratom by a coworker. I have been taking as needed for more then 3 years. I have not noticed any addicting effects as I only take when needed and have no cravings when I don't take Kratom.\n I strongly oppose the DEA putting the alkaloids found in Kratom on schedule 1. It does not fit the description of a schedule 1. Also I believe the statement of kratom being an \"imminent hazard\" is false .I have never seen any adverse health effects anywhere. One death had found Kratom in his system but he was also on other prescription medication so there is no way to tell if Kratom by its self had killed 1 person.\n\nI greatly believe that Kratom is safe and should be available for public use as it is currently being used by many people around the world. I also encourage more research on the Kratom plant as I believe there may be several medical benefits that should be utilized in our country's health care system.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13222","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jose Martinez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jennifer Basel I am a 46-year-old married woman from Michigan. I am college-educated business owner, a Realtor and I work another full-time job, raised two successful young adults. Please let me tell you my Kratom story. It all started with bad gene's from my parents both with serious back problems, riding horses professionally for 13 years. 20 years ago I was in a serious car accident. I sustained several injuries. I have been diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis, ankloysing splondesis, SI joint syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease, lumbago, pinched nerves, arthritis, fibromyalgia, lupus, radiculopathy, restless leg syndrome, anxiety, depression, panic disorder and failed back surgery. I was prescribed a pharmacies worth of drugs. Norco, Vicodin, Duladid, Extra strength Oxys, Percoset, 75 mg Fentanyl patch, Xanax, Motrin 600 & 800's, Lyrica, Effexor, Cymbalta, Abilify, Mobic, Tramadol, Zoloft, Prozac, Amitryptilene, Klonopin & Wellbutrin- just to name a few. Because of intermittent paralysis in my legs I was brought by ambulance to the hospital I was immediately put into surgery. After surgery I had a very serious infection in my spinal cord, spinal fluid and blood. I was in the hospital for over 30 days, hit with the largest amount of antibiotic's. Was given a Picc line and for the next four months had to give myself the antibiotics through an IV first in the hospital for a month, then mot. My case was taken from the doctors and given to the centers for disease control, it wasn't until they prescribed a last ditch effort antibiotic, not used often, that they could finally drive the infection into dormancy.  The infection is forever in my bones. I was told by the CDC that there would never be a time that I would be able to have another surgery because this infection has only gone dormant and can come back if anyone cuts into my bone in anyway.  Puts me in a real bad place doesn't it?  But that's nothing compared to the pain I endure every day. Because the first surgery did not help the second surgery to eradicate all the infected bone and tissue only made more scar tissue and made everything worse, I sought help with a second opinion. The new surgeon wanted me off any and all drugs before surgery and encouraged inpatient detox. After I did just that and went to my pre-surgery appoint,  he backed out of my surgery on me because of my high risk for antibiotic resistance. Next came another mgt. dr. and I was kept on Suboxone, the same Suboxone that I was given in, in patient detox. I used it for pain management, not for opiate urges or withdrawals, just for pain for the next 8 yrs. I hated it so I tapered myself off, I tried three times to withdrawal Suboxone. I read Facebook message boards about Suboxone and in doing so learned about Kratom. After finally off Suboxone with Kratom I also stopped taking Neurontin my last pharmaceutical. Kratom helped in all aspects and I was able to stop all pharma's. It brought a calmness I can't explain. I was able to think without fog. In 2 yrs time I never had any issue. I cannot have surgery my only option is to stay on pain management for the rest of my life.  \n\nIf it is taken away I won't be as healthy or pain free as I am today.  It's my right to make that decision.  I've had zero problems in 2 years of taking it.  That speaks volumes.  Please listen to those who've changed their lives because of it.  It's been taken for centuries without fail, pills can't be said the same for.  Don't let big pharma get their way and turn these precious alkaloids into their own money maker, that's just wrong.  My life has changed for the better, that's all you should need as proof.  It has been studied, its safe, please do your homework THOROUGHLY and morally before making any decisions based on what the pharmaceutical companies want.  You'll have a lot of people in a bad situation if it's taken away.  I am one of those who if I can't take it won't know what to do.  Pills are NOT an option anymore.  They wrecked my life and I'll never go back there.   \n\nSincerely,  Jennifer Basel - Michigan  586-372-0982\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9603","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Basel","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA, My name is James Heineman and I am a business owner.

It does not appear to cause troublesome or dangerous mental states in users that could lead to self harm or harm of others. Kratom is praised by users as being beneficial to them when dealing with chemical addiction, most notably heroin addiction. Kratom needs to be researched heavily given the overwhelming positive anecdotal evidence from consumers. This research would become very difficult if it were to be  classified as schedule 1.  We need to work together to find out if kratom is a viable alternative drug in helping individuals with a variety of needs or ailments. We need to think of the future and what additional options we can create for those that are suffering. Lets work on getting kratom out of an unregulated market and into the hands of responsible corporations that can help research and create jobs for the distribution, manufacturing and sales of this drug, to help our economy and help our people. Even if we find out kratom is somehow dangerous or harmful to people at least we can back it up with legitimate research instead of defaulting to make it schedule 1.

I understand that many ordinary people can become addicted to opiates through prescriptions from doctors, and on this point I think an evil is committed through negligence on the doctors' part ; however, I think that if the DEA criminalizes the possession and/or usage of this substance (which may have the potential to help these people ween off their opiate addiction) then the DEA will have also committed an evil of equal or greater magnitude.\n\nWe already don't need people to be criminalized for victimless actions  especially if a person's actions are in aim to provide relief for his/her suffering. So I write to you to ask you to please do the right thing: Do not criminalize this Kratom substance, and allow it to be independently and scientifically studied to determine its efficacy to relieve pain and ween an individual off of opiates.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13499","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Campiz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To who it may concern,\n\nFirst I would like to thank the DEA for opening a public comment period and listening to what direct users have experienced using Kratom.\n\nI have a Bachelors in Chemical Engineering and have worked in technical sales in the industrial water treatment industry.  My sales territory is half the state of Oregon and I'm in a hotel 4 nights per week while on the road servicing customers.  I've struggled with drinking since graduated college and starting my career.  It got to the point were I was drinking a pint of whiskey every night.\n\nI heard about Kratom on a podcast about 6 months ago and tried it a couple days later.  After a week of using Kratom I was able to cut off my drinking.  For the past 6 months I have consumed Kratom 5 to 6 days per week.  In the past 6 months I have drank only 4 times, which consisted of a couple beers, not the previous whiskey indulgence.  \n\nKratom has given me interesting results.  Thus far I have not experienced any negative results.  I would be curious to know what the effects are of long term use (i.e. 3 to 5 years or longer).  Kratom has lifted my mood and somehow removed the need or urge to drink.  My job performance has greatly improved and I feel much more balanced.  The drinking would give me short term relief (for the night).  Kratom seems to provide similar relief while allowing me to stay focused and effective.  I have also noticed that there seems to be no addictive repercussions while using Kratom.  I occasionally still have the urge to drink at the end of the day.  I force myself to have a glass of Kratom tea and the urge to drink quickly goes away.  I normally drink one glass of Kratom in the afternoon and have no urge to consume any more Kratom.\n\nI think it's very important the Kratom remains legal and available.  It would be important to conduct long term usage studies.  Again, in the last 6 months I have not noticed any negative side effects.  There is no doubt in my mind that Kratom is a far safer alternative to alcohol.  And from what I've heard people are using Kratom to replace much worse alternatives like pain pills and hard drugs.\n\nI really appreciate the DEA taking the time to read public comments like this and pray that Kratom will remain legal and available to those that are really benefiting from it's use.\n\nThank you,\nWayne","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12661","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Wayne ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was an alcoholic for about ten years. About a year ago, I found kratom and it gave me the strength to quit drinking. When I take kratom, I have no cravings for alcohol at all. Not only that, but it has helped me greatly with battling anxiety and depression, which probably contributed to my drinking problem. I take very small amounts, about 3-4 grams throughout the day, and it gives me an energetic kick while easing my anxiety and improving my mood. It doesn't get me \"high,\" I would describe it to something similar to drinking a cup of coffee. It has also saved many of my friends lives who were severely addicted to opiates. I can't imagine what might happen to them if kratom were taken away from them.

In the past, I was not interested in trying it out to control my own pain levels, but as pain is creeping up on me along with age. I had remembered how many people had recommended it for me. Healthy, level headed, professional people. I was aghast to find out it is on the verge of being made a schedule 1. Don't do this. Its very helpful to people. As I've seen. And darn it!

I am 31 years old and I have endometriosis and fibromyalgia.  My doctor had me on Norco for pain and it wasn't working so they did some DNA test and determined that my body doesn't metabolize most opiates very well which is why it helps with certain pain but not my stabbing pelvic pain due to the endometriosis.  I have tried all the treatments and had surgery.  The only thing, and I mean only thing that helps manage the chronic stabbing pelvic pain is mitragyna speciosa, aka kratom.  I have been taking it for over two years with the blessing of my doctor who said she was glad I found something that worked.  I don't feel high from it, it just makes me feel like a normal functioning responsible adult.  \n\nBecause of this plant I get to play with my daughter, give her piggyback rides, chase her, take her to the park and enjoy my life with her.  Before I found kratom I was depressed and suicidal because I was curled up in a ball in pain all day and felt like I did not deserve my daughter for it.  She deserves a mother who can be there for her 100%.  Who isn't in bed crying all day, but helping her to grow, teaching her, engaging her in all the interactions babies need to thrive.  I finally feel like I deserve her and that she has a wonderful mother.  \n\nIt took me 3 years to conceive her because of fertility problems due to endometriosis.  I probably can't have any more kids so I am trying to enjoy her young years and when she gets in school I wish to get certified to become a yoga instructor.  All of this is only possible if I can safely and effectively manage my pain, which only kratom helps with.  I don't want to get hooked on dangerous prescription medications that really don't even help with my pelvic pain just make me feel high and not all there.  I don't want that at all.  I want to feel clear headed with little to no pain, like kratom makes me feel.  \n\nThis plant should be researched by unbiased people, and regulated so that only adults can legally purchase it.  It should not be made into a schedule 1.  That is unfair to the thousands of responsible chronically ill adults whose lives have been made livable again due to this wonderful and mild plant.   All that does is turn responsible law abiding citizens into criminals overnight, citizens who aren't trying to get high but trying to feel normal and we all deserve the chance at a normal low-pain life.  \n\n\nMy dream in life is to watch my daughter grow into a beautiful young woman, to teach her yoga, to teach yoga classes and bring  love and light into the world.  That is all I want.  I don't want to be bedridden or forced to take prescription pain meds that do not work on my pain.  I don't want to become suicidal because I feel like I'm a burden on my daughter and husband.  I want to contribute to society, not be holed up in my bedroom crying all day. \n\nI appeal to your empathy for us as fellow human beings.  Please don't take this mild plant away from chronically ill people.  I want to be able to feel normal by taking a natural plant, not synthetic chemicals thrown together in a lab.  The plant has dozens of helpful alkaloids not just for pain but help people with PTSD, anxiety and depression.  It helps make our lives manageable. If you take away the plant from us in its natural form, while pharmaceutical companies just yank one or two alkaloids from it and synthesize it in labs and we are forced to take that concoction, we are not getting the plant in it's natural form the way it was created and not benefiting from all of its numerous helpful alkaloids.  \n\nPlease let us continue to have the freedom to procure this plant.

I am writing to convey my support for regulation on the Kratom industry.  It should be regulated to keep consumers safe.  More reasesrch should be done to identify the many possible uses of the plant.  I am 30 years old and have been a Kratom user for about a year.  2 1/2 years into my recovery from IV heroin addiction, I was prescribed opioid pain medication for a back injury.  This triggered an old way of thinking for me and turned into a relapse.  I returned to opioids and alcohol for about 6 months.  I finally got on suboxone and was for about a year.  I couldn't stand the many side effects of suboxone and it's more difficult to get off than opiates.  I found Kratom and did as much research as I could.  I tried it and it worked.  I weaned down on suboxone as low as I could until I ran out, and made the switch.  It was still painful and uncomfortable but I was able to work and care for my responsibilities.  I continue to take Kratom to treat that back injury as well as life long depression and anxiety.  Kratom is a mood altering substance, but so is coffee.  That being said, it is not intoxicating like opiates, alcohol or benzos.  There is physical dependency to it, but there is to coffee and phenibut as well, both legal and regulated.  So many people have benefited from this plant and the community, and so many more can.  This plant can have a huge impact on the opioid crisis in a positive way.  Responsible use of Kratom is saving lives and it can save/help many more.  Can it be dangerous, sure it can.  But there are plenty of more dangerous and perfectly legal substances out there.

It's very similar to drinking an espresso-drink - uplifted, energized, aware.\n\nAnd it doesn't kill. Two of my friends died from prescription-drug-related accidents. Accidents. They just took too much, and died. When a person takes too much Kratom, they throw it up. \n\nIf Kratom is made illegal, I won't relapse and start buying pills on the streets again. But I'm lucky and upper-middle class and have a strong support system. I'm sure most people taking Kratom WILL start illegally buying dangerous pills if they can't safely buy it from a local shop.\n\nI'm sure you have concerns with the regulation and quality, but for every shady Kratom company, there are several reliable and reputable companies. This is an issue that can be fixed by simple regulation like how tobacco is treated.\n\nKratom is not equal to opiates. It should not be classified as an opiate or as any kind of scheduled drug. It's much more similar to a cup of strong coffee, or tobacco. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration, I hope you can see the humanity in what so many people are asking you for.\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17284","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nicholas M","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Over the past several months there has been a ground swell of support for kratom following the DEA's threat to emergency schedule the plant and it's alkaloids.

States like Georgia reversed course on scheduling due to evidence that it has not caused any harm in that state. \n\nThe evidence is simply not there to justify an emergency scheduling much less put kratom on Schedule I. Doing so would stifle research, create enormous distrust of law enforcement and federal agencies, and take away the freedom of millions of Americans to consume a plant that has little to no ill effects. Tens of thousands of Americans are consuming kratom on a daily basis. Where are the bodies? Where is the surge in attendance at treatment centers for kratom addiction? \n\nLike millions of other Americans, my life has been touched by family and friends that have struggled with opiate addiction. Kratom has been shown to be an effective part of ending addiction to opiates. Why take away a plant in the coffee family that can harmlessly and effectively provide pain relief to so many people? Why criminalize the behavior of these constituents of our great nation seeking to better their lives? \n\nPlease listen to the people.

That said, however, I have seen first-hand how effective it is at easing opiate / opioid addicts' acute withdrawal syndromes. I have seen 3 different people manage to cease using much stronger and more dangerous opiates with the help of Kratom. In fact, one of those 3 people was an IV heroin user. He desperately wanted to quit using heroin but just could not deal with the post-acute withdrawal syndrome's symptoms despite multiple stints in rehab facilities. Most believed he was a \"lost cause\" and we all knew that he would eventually become homeless because he always spent every last dollar on heroin and had been forced to move back into his parents' house because he could not make his rent payments anymore.\n\nHowever, with the help of Kratom and a determination to quit the heroin that was ruining his life and breaking his family members' hearts, he has been clean for years, and has even reduced his Kratom usage substantially and is planning on quitting Kratom entirely in the near future as of last week when I spoke with him last. Meanwhile, he has managed to not become a drain on society and has remained self-sufficient. in the absence of heroin, made possible by using Kratom.\n\nI wish to point out that whatever benefit is believed to be attainable by banning Kratom, I have no doubt whatsoever that there will be far greater consequences for those who used it to \"get clean\" from the harder drugs - as they very likely will go right back to using the street drugs they managed to avoid by using Kratom (which has virtually no overdose potential and far less addiction potential than IV street drugs).\n\nI do not understand how this outcome would benefit society in any way, with the exception of the prison industry which will enjoy even greater incarceration rates of non-violent offenders than it already has, but which is itself a drain on our country's resources as we all know at this point.\n\nI ask the DEA to please consider the terrible things that will happen to thousands upon thousands of people (maybe tens of thousands or more?) in the event that Kratom is actually banned in the US. Additionally, I hope that the DEA will act in the best interests of our country and choose not to schedule mitragyna speciosa (Kratom). We will not benefit in any way from forcing otherwise law-abiding citizens to risk going to prison or worse because of this, and adding this plant to the list of controlled substances will undoubtedly cause far more damage through more overdose deaths and prison sentences than we already have.\n\nPlease do the right thing and please refrain from adding mitragyna speciosa (\"Kratom\") to the list of controlled substances.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9586","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Daniel Holmes & I am a 42 year old male from Caledonia, Mississippi. I'm writing this administration in regards to the kratom plant and its components mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragine. As someone who uses this as a natural remedy for pain, I'm asking that you do not make this a schedule I substance or illegal in any other way,including its import. I have used this as a alternative to prescription pain killers for the past 2 years without any side effects or dependency whatsoever. Whereas the prescription medications have not agreed with my body at all & over the counter just doesn't work for me. I have less anxiety in my life than when taking the prescriptions & feel completely safe with the kratom. This naturally occuring plant works great for pain,anxiety,PTSD,fibromyalgia,opiate & alcohol treatment, and Yes,even endometriosis and PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) which my wife was diagnosed with 2 years ago. She has had the endometriosis for 10 years and nothing has worked for her up until recently when she started trying the kratom. So far the results have been great for her and myself. Our lives have improved drastically. So,please keep the Kratom plant and its import legal to allow further research and knowledge of its many benefits to hopefully help others with endometriosis & PCOS. I thank you for your time and ask that you keep in mind all of the facts,including the opinions,feelings,and well-being of people such as my wife,myself, and many others whom kratom has been a blessing to.\n\nSincerely,\nDaniel D Holmes","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3350","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Holmes","title":"Comment on FR Doc #

She went to several doctors and had many tests run.  Doctors had prescribed many drugs which had many side effects and caused addiction to occur, but still did not fix any of the problems.\nBelieving that plants are food and food provides the nutrition that our bodies need to heal themselves, I started reading up on kratom and how it had helped others.  I gave her some red vein kratom and literally after one night she said she had slept better than she had in years, and her pain was now manageable.  She now takes it every night before bed and has a new life.  It did not cure her, but it helped her body to receive the restorative sleep it needed to heal itself.\n\nI have been using white vein kratom for about six months.  It has helped me better manage mild anxiety and the only side effect has been mild drowsiness. The claim that there is no medicinal value is fraudulent.  All foods have some sort of medicinal value towards health.  The claim that it is as dangerous as heroin or meth is flat out deceptive.\n\nNeither one of us feels any kind of addiction to the herb, apart from maybe what one would consider a routine or a habit.  If we do not take it, the only negative experience is that we return to the state that we were in prior to taking the herb.\n\nWe do not take the extracts, only the whole plant.  We consider the extracts to be drugs because they are far more concentrated than what one might find in nature, and we believe that could be harmful.  However, we have seen the whole leaf effects to be pleasant and safe.  We find it offensive that the government would try to ban or regulate a natural plant by calling it a drug.  We find it even more offensive that taking a food supplement herb that has helped us in many areas of our lives could potentially land us in prison.  \n\nIf safety were the legitimate concern, alcohol or even acetaminophen would be banned.  Yet these are readily available and both responsible for thousands of deaths each year.  Kratom is safe and has value in both saving people's lives and making them more manageable.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10108","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeffrey Brown","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been taken kratom for over 7 years.

In our state, as in the entire country, there is a significant problem with narcotic abuse and diversion which has lead to a backlash against the treatment of chronic pain in the medical community.  The problem is that, for pain of significant severity, there are very few effective alternatives to narcotics. Independent of the concern for abuse and diversion there are many well known limitations to narcotics for chronic pain.  These range from constipation to somnolence to respiratory depression.  Add to this the issue of dependence and tolerance (not to be confused with addiction) and narcotics, even without diversion and abuse, are a very imperfect solution.\n\nSeveral years ago the state of Vermont initiated its medical marijuana registry.  At it's inception I was pretty apprehensive of a flood of patient with \"glaucoma\" wanting onto the registry for dubious reasons.  There were some of those, which had to be deflected/redirected, but also there have been many success stories.  I have been gunuinely surprised of the effectiveness for many, even patients quite resistant to the idea, but desperate enough for pain control to try it.  Like narcotics, it is not a perfect solution, but a useful tool for some.\n\nI have only had one patient, to my knowledge, try Kratom.  His experience was quite positive, but that hardly represents meaningful evidence of its benefit.  I actually know very little about Kratom and have no misconception that it is some sort of panacea.  But we have few tools for the treatment of intractable pain and those tools are quite flawed.  I think it essential not to close the door on anything that might prove to be one more potential tool in the treatment of chronic pain.  Should Kratom lack the side effect of respiratory depression, that alone would be an incredibly important safety benefit over narcotics.  \n\nMy understanding is that a DEA schedule I substance is one with no therapeutic potential.  While, to my limited understanding, the evidence for the potential benefit of Kratom is weak and anecdotal,  there is equally weak evidence of its extreme risk.  There is no risk free medication, or for that matter, substance.  There have been adverse reactions and even deaths due to an excess of antihypertensives, insulin, Tylenol, and even water.  The absence of risk is an illusion.  The question of benefits from Kratom , however, is still an open one.  Given this, it would seem incredibly premature to classify Kratom as DEA schedule I, drastically limiting potential for research.\n\nIn short, my hope is that Kratom be left open to research of both its risks and its benefits.  The need for treatment alternatives for chronic pain are far too great to ignore a compound with such potential benefit.  Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12606","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeffrey Haddock","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"No one has died.

I also have a high degree of education under my belt, and I have to say that I think it is ridiculous that Kratom would be placed on a schedule 1. Kratom has brought many people their lives back- it has made them happy and pain free. Kratom should not be placed in the same category as LSD, Heroin or cocaine. It is nothing like those things. \nIf giving people the right to choose is a threat-- and the fact that people are actually finding relief for their pain that doesn't harm the rest of their body and give them awful side effects-- well then i can see why the DEA would want to do everything possible to keep it away from the hands of the public-- Kratom  is one of the best things that has happened to me in my life and I know in many other people's lives. If the DEA is trying to control our choices and make decisions for us-- I guess that would be why they would schedule Kratom. \nKratom is non-addicting-- and helps people in so many different ways.

After 45 years in the work force, I have retired and pursue my hobbies of biking, swimming, cooking, playing the piano, and traveling. I am a responsible, tax-paying citizen. \n\nIn 2006 I was diagnosed with severe spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis. With all conservative measures to alleviate the pain failing and my subsequently developing sciatica (which kept me from being able to stand or walk for more than a few minutes without having to sit or lie down), it was determined last year that I needed a two-level spinal fusion. While the surgery mostly corrected the stenosis and spondylolisthesis and alleviated 80% of the pain, I was still left with residual pain that limited my every-day activities. I was prescribed opioids, muscle relaxers and NSAIDS, all of which did help with the pain; but given their side effects, I began to search for something natural. When I joined an online forum for back pain sufferers, I read about kratom, which people were using with great success for pain control. I had never heard about it but spent some time researching kratom and also read hundreds of posts from people who consumed it for pain.  I additionally found that it also helped people with anxiety, depression, PTSD, fibromyalgia, and those attempting to wean off opiates. I found no negative posts about this plant, only positive stories. I was amazed that one plant could be so beneficial to so many people for such an array of issues. Although a bit hesitant to try something new, I placed an order from a recommended, reputable online vendor. I discovered that kratom does indeed help alleviate my pain. I consume a small amount in the morning, which brings my pain level from a 6/7 down to a 2/3 and allows me to go about my days activities. In the year I have been consuming kratom, I have never experienced any negative side effects.  I stop taking kratom for a week or so at a time, and the only side effect is that my pain returns.\n\nClassifying kratom as a Schedule 1 drug will force me and millions of others to choose between opioids (which are now being prescribed less and less per the DEA and CDC) or to go without pain relief. Some may even turn to illegal drugs. With the opioid epidemic that the country is so concerned about, why would the DEA even consider banning a plant that so far has been shown to be safe and effective? I ask you to keep kratom unscheduled, as it should be.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1306","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carol Grogan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I respectfuly request that you do not ban kratom.\nI am 55 years old and have suffered from knee pain, depression and high blood pressure for years .....until I discovered the benefits of kratom.\nSince I started taking kratom I have been able to get off the anti inflammatory drugs blood pressue pills and antidepressants.\nIt is not unusual for me to be able to work 10 or more hours a day now pain free thanks to this wonderful plant: kratom.\nPlease do not take this all natural, safe plant out of the hands of hard working people .\nI have had only positive, safe experience with kratom.\nAt no time have I felt \"high\" , addicted or not in control of my mind and body.\nFor me Kratom has been a safe affordable alternative to prescription drugs.\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10361","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shane Hicks","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a wonderful substance.

This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\nI found Kratom years ago when I was addicted to opiates. It literally saved my life by allowing me to deal with the withdraws as I weaned myself off. Since I overcame my opiate addiction, I have used Kratom as a caffeine substitute. I have recently become sensitive to caffeine and can no longer consume it without having vertigo. Kratom allows me to stay focused and work long hours doing manual without fatigue, pain or the side effects that caffeine gives me. I also have grown and sold Kratom to hundreds of people who were suffering from opiate addiction, were in severe pain that couldn't use opiates, and people that used it to get off blood pressure medications and pharmacuetical stimulants.  \n\nKratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life.

I was a gymnast all my life,  from the age of 3 years old until I was 18. I am now a 37 year old wife,  mother,  business owner and realtor.  I have worked hard my whole life.  Unfortunately the years in gymnastics and physical labor took a toll on my body.  It got to the point where I could hardly stand without being in pain.  I went to the doctor,  had MRIs done and found bulging disks &  bone spurs on my spine.  I also have major joint deterioration, ozgood slaughter disease in my knees and carpel tunnel.  Which is why I finally went to school to be a realtor.. My body can't take the physical labor of my job for much longer!  When I went to the doctor,  all they did was put me on pain meds,  started with Norco and after 6 years I was on oxycodone,  dilaudid  and methadone.  I was also still in pain everyday!  And on top of that,  was also addicted and dependent on pharmaceutical medications.  Which is a horrible horrible cycle!  Without the medication I could not even get out of bed,  and NOT only due to the pain in my body,  but because of the awful withdrawals that medication causes!  About a year or more ago I found Kratom!! It has changed my life!!  I am no longer dependent on pharmaceutical medications  and I am virtually pain free when drinking Kratom tea.  This plant has given me my life back.  I live a very productive active life again and my children and family are so happy that  I finally found something that truly helps without ANY side affects!! Please listen to me and so many others that this plant has given their lives back to!  I thank  God for providing this plant on our beautiful earth and I thank you for listening and you consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12552","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Janene DeMorse","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello please don't ban Kratom and place it on the Schedule 1 drug list as it does indeed have medical value.

All banning these substances would so is create yet another black market for a mostly harmless plant. A plant that may actually have several important uses such as the potential for safer pain killers and has an opiate withdrawal aid.\n\nYes there have been some deaths and bad reactions to it, but the information on whether it was the plant itself or a contamination is sorely lacking. Government agencies shouldn't ban something without properly researching the thing in question; they shouldn't ban something based on anecdotal evidence. The government should base decisions like these firmly on the side of science, and the science on this plant is practically nonexistent.\n\nMaking this plant a schedule one substance would completely stand in the way of any benefit it may prove to have if more research is able to be freely done. It's time to stop the clearly ineffective practice of banning drugs.

It will be the 13 year I've lived with chronic back pain.  After years of coping with the pain, and seeing many doctors, I fell into a depression that is as debilitating as the pain.  The medications I've tried under supervision from my doctor is a laundry list of drugs that did not work, whose side effects were worse than the symptoms, or were cost prohibitive.  I found Kratom, and tried it not expecting any results.  After all, I've heard the same stories the media and government are now hearing.  The impact this plant has had on my life is nothing short of a miracle.  \n\nI consider myself a pragmatist.  My occupation is heavily focused on mathematics and making decisions based on reason, not emotions.  I do not want to paint the picture that I am in no way looking at this plant through rose tinted goggles.  Kratom is more alike to tea, or coffee than an illegal substance, or even pharmaceuticals engineered to relieve my symptoms.  While addicting, I take it 5 days in a row, then two days off, and it is no more addicting than going without my morning coffee.  To classify this plant as a Schedule I drug is absolutely absurd.  \n\nTo remove access to this plant would be devastating to so many people.  While I haven't spoken about Kratom to some family and friends, they have seen, first hand, the transformative impact it's had on my life.  I worry more about them, than myself.  So many people rely on me to support them.  The only thing that supports me is this plant.  \n\nI understand, if this is even read, that a technician is reading my story.  I don't know how much weight my voice has in this important decision.  But what I would like to propose is this: Contact me directly.  You will know immediately that I'm not an addict, or a person looking to abuse this plant; but someone that is trying to lead a normal life.  So many people are in the same position as myself.  \n\nIf you are truly interested in protecting Americans, please, instead of making this Schedule I, fund its research.  I am confident the data will back up my anecdotal experience.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7417","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andy Frazier","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nGreetings, my name is Jamel Jarquin and I am a US Army Combat Veteran, I served from 1999-2007.  One of those years was spent in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, which I found it very difficult to readjust to society afterwards.  Kratom has helped me with that because it is a supplement that energizes the body and mind.  I feel that it also promote sociability and increases productivity.  Those are a few reasons why I enjoy the plant and I would appreciate it if I can freely use it.  The plant is also a great pain reliever as well, I recently had a back spasm.  The injury was work related and I was prescribed medication for it that didn't work too well.  I used a Red vein variety of Kratom that helped ease the pain and enhance my mood.  That enabled me not to focus on the pain and I was able to do some of the exercises necessary to recover.  I was moving around like I didn't have an issue with my back and was able to do the exercises necessary to recover.  Kratom helps me to be productive and I strongly believe that many others can benefit from this plant.  This plant has been used for hundreds of years and it's in the same family as coffee.

I would like to start out by saying that this is a God-given plant that should be accessible to anyone who wishes to consume it. I've used it in the past as a tea myself on numerous occasions without a single negative incident.\n\nI understand you've heard this over and over again, but I truly feel it needs to be stated again: This is an herb that's related to the coffee plant; it is NOT a drug, and it is NOT dangerous. Let's face the facts; no one has ever died from using this leaf. Those individuals who have deceased from a so-called \"kratom product\" undoubtedly had a drug laced with it, and that's what makes anything dangerous - synthetic compounds. Kratom is not synthetic and never has been; it is 100% purely natural.\n\nHere's a question: If this plant material is considered such a hazard to the public (as you have originally claimed it to be), how then do you account for the tens or hundreds of thousands of citizens in this country who use it on a regular basis without one single incident? When the news broke out about the DEA's intent to schedule this plant, people came forward in DROVES to display their dismay for such an initiative. Over the past couple months we have seen the peaceful and civilized demonstrations & protests against the prohibition of kratom, along with personal heart-felt testimonials. No violence came out of them, and no arrests came out of them. Keeping this in mind, I must say that in all of my 46 years of life, never have I seen such a display of support for a natural benign herb as these good down-to-earth folks have shown. These are the folks who are fighting very hard to keep this leaf from becoming regulated and/or scheduled. These are the law-abiding citizens who do not wish to break the law, having done no harm in society, and are choosing to do what is best for their own bodies in a safe and effective manner. It's a good point to ponder at this juncture. The primary focus needs to be placed on petrochemical pharmaceutical drugs, not leaves that grow on trees. \n\nI would just like to close by saying this: The good people of this country HAVE spoken - and now is your chance to actually do something GOOD for the people of this country and prove beyond a shadow of a doubt once and for all that you have our best interests at heart - and to drop the senseless intent to ban a TEA leaf.  I urge you to allow your conscience be your guide.

I have two associates degrees and working on my bachelors in psychology at The University of Arizona, I am paraprofessional at a high school working with special needs children such as autism spectrum disorders, Down syndrome, bipolar disorders, anger management disorders, borderline personality and antisocial disorders. I am currently using Kratom (Mitrgyna speciose) for my own generalized anxiety disorder. I started taking kratom about a year now, and it has dramatically changed the course of my life significantly in a positive way. \nThe reason why I started using kratom is because since I was 16 I started to suffer from severe anxiety, panic attacks and depression. By age 20 I was diagnosed with clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and derealization/depersonalization disorder, a type of dissociative disorder. In efforts to understand my disorders and fix them I decided to study psychology, and focused my studies in personality disorders. Meanwhile in college my panic attacks and anxiety attacks became worse, was having difficulty getting out of bed, having intense fear of everything, life to me was gritty and ugly, the world literally seemed repulsive.  My depression made it so that my body specifically my back was in intense pain, and my skin felt like I was being cut by razors when the panic attacks came on. I started seeing a psychiatrist and as a result I was placed on medication treatment for anxiety and depression. I was first placed on Buspirone which did absolutely nothing to help. And from there I was placed on Valium, Xanax, lamotrigine, hydroxyzine, and clonazepam. I was on clonazepam for 2 years, which did not benefit me at all, it calmed my anxiety attacks slightly but I was not able to function, was not able to maintain a job, or personal relationships, I could not retain any new information and forget what I did during the day. I became addicted and was on 8mg of clonazepam a day all while still having panic attacks and anxiety. I was not able to function in society at all; I couldnt finish my bachelors at the University of Arizona, because my panic attacks became worse and worse that I started to shut off from society and not leave my room. I could not retain any new memories with the clonazepam. I had to make a dramatic change and stop the treatment that was destroying me; it was obvious that the drugs prescribed to me werent working. \nIn my final hope already on the verge of giving up, I turned to look for an alternative way to help with my various range of symptoms which now included addiction disorder because of the medications I was on. I came across Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) and at first I was skeptical and would not believe all the positive claims people were stating. I decided to try it, and when I did try it, it felt like I could breathe again, like I was having trouble breathing for more than 10 years and I could finally take a deep breath.  The intense pain I had as a result of the tension in my muscles and the depression suddenly subsided. I suddenly was not scared of life no more. I started crying from joy because for the first time in years I felt fine, and did not feel like taking my life away. Suicide to me was the only other solution at this point, it was the only means of escape for me, and it was the only thing that gave me comfort because I could not deal with life and pain anymore. In my last hope I tried kratom and with that it lifted the blindfold of depression I and seeing that life doesnt have to be this repulsive and difficult, that life is beautiful. \nEver since I started taking kratom my life changed completely in a positive way, it has helped me manage my depression and anxiety attacks, my pain I get from depression; it has helped me become a productive member of society, by obtaining a job at a high school helping children with special needs. I found a job I absolutely love as a paraprofessional teacher assistant for students in special education. I love my students and always try to do more for my students than its demanded of me. I get paid very little but having what I have, doing what I love which is helping people and  being able to manage my symptoms using kratom makes me more than happy, because people with anxiety and depression know its the worse feeling there could be felt and feeling mentally stable is a blessing. Kratom does not alter mental status or is it intoxicating; it allows the user to feel normal in comparison to the abnormal feeling of constant fear of anxiety and depression. Kratom helps with motivation and energy in the same manner as coffee does, promotes a more positive outlook of self and life in general. Please reconsider the intent to schedule this non harmful and beneficial supplement.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19055","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adan Galaz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Don't Place Kratom as a Schedule 1 Drug.

I was an abuser on pain killers due to a motorcycle accident I had back in 2001. The doctors prescribed me Oxycotton 40 mg for 2 months. After a few weeks I was addicted to them very fast. I went back to the doctor for a last refill and he said that I am abusing the drug when he was the bastard that prescribed the addictive drug to me. For 2 years I was buying any kind of pain killers that I could find for a dollar a mg which was making me spend thousands of dollars every month. \nI then decided to take myself to a rehab for rehabilitation for my life. While I was in rehab after the 2nd month I started buying pain killers again and realized that rehab is not working for me. I decided to look for a pain doctor that prescribed methadone but I found Suboxone instead and started my recovery with that highly addictive drug (suboxone). At the time I was so happy that I could find a drug for my addiction when in fact it was just a legal way of taking something highly addictive. I took Suboxone for 3 years and my doctor was busted for fraud while I was working in Afghanistan supporting the war fighters. The detox from Suboxone was one of the worst detox I have ever been through in my life. It literally took almost 3 months for my body to clean its self from that legal addictive drug. \nI was free of addictive drugs for 4 months but I was not happy at all and depressed shortly after. There were times I just wanted to kill myself, I had no interest of life what so ever. I was neglecting my son so much because I was so miserable. I did not have any energy or motivation to do anything. After cleaning my body from Suboxone I hated to be around other people and I really hated to socialize with others, I would walk the other way if I seen somebody I knew just to avoid a conversation with them.I had terrible anxiety and could not sleep for months. I was on the verge of losing my job because I did not have any interest in working anymore until I was told about Kratom. \nI had purchased my from strain of Kratom from www.authentickratom.com and I was even spectacle about buying something natural without all of the chemicals that pain killers had but I tried it out and my first day of taking Kratom I was the happiest person alive. I was socializing with all of my Coe workers and peers around me. That same day I was awake until 4 am because I called all of my family members just to say hello and how were things going. 2 out of 4 sisters were crying because I finally reached out to them and opened up, I then started to cry with them because of how much I needed them, but for so many years I was antisocial and did not want a relationship with anybody. Kratom has really saved my life for the better and to label Kratom as a class 1 drug would mean thousands of families going back to pain killers and illegal drugs. This would be the destruction of many people and go back to square one where they first started. \nKratom is a natural leaf just like marijuana and as we all know marijuana helps with allot of illnesses but America made it illegal which is a mistake. I have a fabulous relationship with my son and my 6 month old daughter because Kratom keeps me focused and motivated for life itself. Also since taking Kratom I understand and make sense of everything I do. My memory is also way way better since I started Kratom. Before I could not remember even a small task I would perform at work. Now I am on top of everything I say I will do. \nI truly believe deep down in my heart that if America makes a natural leaf illegal that has saved thousands of lives would mean an uproar and destruction of Kratom users lively hood and sanity. \nAlso their are thousands of Opioid abusers that have not found Kratom yet but I am certain if they were introduced to Kratom their lives would be saved as well. The problem is that Kratom is Farley new to America and not many addicts know of the leaf. Please do not make Kratom illegal. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3976","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jesus Nieves","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not make kratom schedule I.

I want to be completely honest with my experience using the substance in hopes that it may help in making the decision to schedule it.\n I first used kratom when it was recommended to me by my brother. I had sustained an injury to my shoulder at work and I was therefore having pain and restricted use of my arm and shoulder. Kratom not only relieved the pain beyond what was becoming an excessive use of ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But, kratom also gave me higher levels of energy and kept me in a better mood. \nI have now been taking kratom for several months. My use is not maintained out of necessity and addiction, but rather as a daily dietary supplement allowing me to be less anxious, happier, and more energetic through the day. To confirm that I was still in control over the substance,  I have stopped using kratom on multiple occasions with no side effects,  \nI strongly feel that if the DEA continues with its push to place kratom as a scheduled substance, they would be denying me of my right to enjoy a much better lifestyle. I also feel like they would be throwing gasoline onto the wildfire of opiate and heroine addiction that is destroying our nation. \nIn conclusion, I hope that the DEA will be honest and unbiased with their research of kratom. And I hope that they will consider how people, the everyday, hard working, tax paying people that they represent feel, and what their wishes are. Thank you for taking the time to read my input, and I ask that you please carefully consider the decision before you and how it will affect the people you represent.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10732","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gary Jenkins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My cousin has been taking this for quite some time, and it's nice to have her back again in better shape than ever!

I run a small business and employ 5 people. Kratom has been a blessing to me as an alternative help for minor pain relief and improves my mood in the winter. Having access to this natural product helps with my day-to-day greatly. Kratom is not an opiate and is not a street drug. Even though there is minor mood elevation kratom cannot get you \"high\". There is a true threshold for recreational use and even pain relief. I've never had even close to an incident with kratom. Kratom is not a designer drug, it cannot be compared with bath salts or synthetic research chemicals. With no confirmed deaths from kratom it is not dangerous and with reported statistics put out by the DEA it shows kratom is actually one of the safest products on the market. Furthermore banning kratom will make the already terrible problem of opiate addition much, much worse. Kratom should be encouraged for help in this area. I strongly urge the DEA and FDA to not fill our jails further by detaining hard working and productive citizens for choosing something so mundane yet greatly beneficial to many.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6465","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathan Estes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom saved the lives of 2 of my friends.

Or if it does, it is only interested in helping out the Big Pharma industry, who undoubtedly see Kratom as a danger to their bottom lines, and have enlisted the DEA to do their dirty work. \n\nAlternately, perhaps the DEA is worried about their own relevance in the face of the growing tide of marijuana legalization, and is looking for the nearest thing to lash out at and direct their misguided energy towards. Face it, attitudes are changing, and the old ways are not relevant any more. You've got to adapt to the times, DEA.\n\nPlease resist the ugly corporate interests of Big Pharma, see past the myopic haze of departmental self-righteousness, and act in the interest of the people.

Yes those helped but I was always foggy headed I had no energy and quite honestly I stayed in my home because I was always in so much pain I couldn't really function or stay focused. I'd lay around with heating pads use ice packs and hot Epsom salt baths and just absolutely miserable everyday. Then one evening my mother was researching more relief methods I could try and ran across this an article on kratom and reviews from the users and we immediately made an order. It's been a year now since I tried kratom and it has truly been a blessing. Honestly I thank God for my mother stumbling across the article on kratom. I'm now able to move my body without being so miserable in pain, I'm able to focus on life again and not how I'm going to get the pain to ease up just enough to cook dinner for my family.I can proudly be an active member of society again.

It is a health issue, not a law enforcement issue. A person should have freedom to do as they choose, to perhaps make mistakes, and to learn from them. The government is overstepping it's purpose, it's bounds  and taking our freedoms away; enough already. Stop it!\n\nIf Kratom is banned by the DEA, instead of having the intended effect of reducing the supply and demand for this relatively harmless herb, it will have the opposite effect. More people will want it, more people will distribute it, and a huge black market will be created. Like when you were a child, and told only adults were allowed to have or do something, it did not make your desire for the prohibited thing less; in fact, it increased it. Prohibition is perhaps well intended, but does not work because the human psyche is not geared toward blind obedience.\n\nIf Kratom is banned by the DEA, it will discourage it's use as an antidote for opioid addiction and in doing so actually encourage the use of opioids. People are dying and the epidemic is growing even larger every year. We need to put the pharmaceutical industry in check, and the prison complex, and the police state mentality and the failed war on drugs in check. Federally banning an herb shown to be effective at fighting opioid addiction would send the message to the citizens of the USA that they must follow the rule or face the punishment, and 70 years of marijuana prohibition has shown how poorly that works.\n\nIf Kratom is banned by the DEA, the public is likely to lose additional confidence in the government, a trend continuing to grow in momentum. Instead of a government by the people and for the people, the action of putting Kratom on schedule one is yet another example of governing 'at the people' and 'against the people's wishes.'\n\nIn spite of the people's wishes, when you just go ahead and do whatever you want, you are writing an end to your existence, DEA. Be warned, the public can ban your organization, too.\n\nRespectfully,\nMark Russell","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4631","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Russell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have serious problems with the drug war.

It has worked wonderfully! Not only has kratom help to reduce my pain level but it has also helped reduce the amount of prescription medication I've had to use to get through a normal day. After being diagnosed with a degenerative bone disease I never thought I would see a day again in my life without prescription medication and after using kratom for less than a week I can see that day in my future. Which is absolutely amazing to me.  In researching kratom I've learned that it has been in use worldwide for thousands of years and has been sold in the United States for decades. In my opinion kratom has great potential to help address some of the issues our country is facing. But kratom will be useless if it is made illegal. The DEA has done wonderful work in keeping illegal substances out of our great nation. My hope is that the department will continue doing great work in the future. But I believe that the future of kratom belongs in the hands of the people. Let's let science and logic determine the uses or non-uses of this plant. But that work and those decisions can not be made if kratom becomes a schedule one drug. In closing I would like to extend my gratitude for all of the great work the DEA has done over the years and also I would ask to please take time to make this decision and not rush to judgment over this issue.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19057","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Levi Cranson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jackson- I am 29 years old and have been working for a company that develops fluid dynamics physics software for the last two and a half years.\n\nI am a veteran of the United States Navy.

It has been over two years since then, and I no longer use kratom to avoid alcohol abuse, nor for pain management. I feel blessed to be back on my feet.

Kratom should be regulated, not scheduled. America has had enough of the drug war. We can all agree it was a mistake, and has caused far more suffering than drug abuse itself has caused. I believe it is a human being's right to decide what he/she puts into their body. Prohibition has often been catalyzed by corruption; lobbyists for special interests want to keep their monopoly over an industry, and they care not how the common man suffers from their actions. I think I speak for most Americans when I say \"We've had enough! We will no longer recognize the decisions of men who speak only for themselves; we will not go quietly into the night; we will not be tread on!\"\n\nI suffer from chronic pain and I was morphine dependent for 6 years. Kratom has helped me break that dependence and control my pain without the physical addiction. Those who have experienced dependence to Kratom can tell you it is far easier to go without and yet is equally capable of controlling pain. If Kratom is made illeagal I will be forced either to go back on morphine or obtain Kratom illegally. Given the choice I would much rather continue to use Kratom.\n\nIf Kratom becomes illegal I predict that the heroin epidemic in America will grow far worse. When the pharmaceutical companies began the sale of Oxycontin and the opiate epidemic exploded in America, many Americans became dependent on opiates and have since taken to heroin use. I personally have seen chronic pain patients begin to use heroin when they could no longer fill their prescriptions. These same patients have freed themselves from that terrible addiction by switching to the far more benign Kratom. Taking this herb away from them would be tantamount to sentencing them to death.

One day I was talking to somebody online and they asked me if I had ever heard of Kratom?  I told them no this person happen to be a herbalist and a vendor of many herbal options. The first offered was kratom he gave me several ... I sampled them and I was amazed at the outcome. Pains vet the drugs Pharmaceuticals couldn't touch the Kratom help ease it greatly. As a couple weeks went by I noticed that I was urinating a lot I was falling asleep without sleeping pills I was able to get up at night and walk to the bathroom without urinating on myself because I couldn't walk. Kratom changed my life. I was able to go out and sit at one of my son's ballgames and enjoy it. I started going out with old friends and actually leaving my house and doing things because I was able to. Kratom changed my life in so many ways. It gave me my life back. I have ran out after a very long period of time of using kratom I noticed no withdrawals of any kind accept for my pain came back I wasn't urinating as often just the effect that the Kratom was working for we're coming back because the crowd wasn't there anymore. Needless to say I didn't let that happen again, and I don't know what I would do if it were taken away. I've been doing research and found multiples of other herbs that may come close to what kratom does for me  I don't know I haven't tried them. I really hope that I don't have to. I believe if it's not broke you don't fix it Kratom has been the answer to my prayers and so many facets of my life my mood or temperament my energy my sleep my pain the list goes on and on and never have I had any side effects or addiction issues with it.

I used kratom to end a decade-long pathological relationship with booze. I started drinking in college to self medicate depression and anxiety, until eventually I needed it to function from day to day. I tried quitting cold-turkey on a number of occasions and finally ended up in the ER from the delirium tremens (severe ethanol withdrawal). That experience scared me enough to quit drinking for about three weeks. Two months later I was back in the emergency room with a BAC of 0.47. At this point I had never even heard of kratom, but at the suggestion of a concerned friend I gave it a chance, and it has changed my life incalculably for the better. For two years I have used kratom regularly, as a tea in the morning, in a similar fashion as millions of other Americans drink coffee. Unlike coffee however, kratom simply dissolves any lingering anxiety and craving, and anxiety about craving alcohol. This innocuous leaf has freed me and thousands like me from the chains of alcoholism and other life-destroying addictions. If kratom is banned I will be annoyed, but fine. However, I am fearfully certain that many in my (recovering alcoholic) situation will return to the bottle. Please do not take away what was my, and could be for countless other Americans, last chance at recovery.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20840","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adam Gregory","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have read up on this topic extensively and have come to the conclusion that Kratom has done far more good than bad in our society.

The store in Pinellas Park was within 1/2 mi of three of the largest \"Pill Mills\" during the pill epidemic and the Bradenton store is heart in the middle of the current heroin epidemic. \n\nWe have been open in Pinellas Park for 6 years and in Bradenton for just over 5 months.  In Pinellas Park we have over 60 customers who are no longer breaking the law by purchasing opioid pills from drug dealers.  They were able to rid themselves their pill addiction while still managing their pain.  They find that they became productive and are now having a positive impact on society.  They do not achieve a high and for that most are grateful as they can hold jobs and maintain a \"normal\" and productive life.  \n\nIn addition to pill addicts beating their addiction, we have several people (about 10) who no longer take methadone as they have found Kratom to rid themselves of that dependency.\n\nIn Bradenton, we currently have 11 customers who have beaten their heroin addiction through the use of Kratom.  Several of those have brought friends to our store to help them rid themselves of the addiction.  Heroin is a really big problem in Bradenton and as the word is spreading about the positive affects of this natural alkaloid (note that Kratom is NOT an opioid) we are seeing more and more people coming in to beat their addiction naturally.\n\nWe self-regulate by not selling to anyone under 18 years of age and will not \"over-sell\" to anyone, meaning that we start people off with the minimal amount, instruct them on how to take it in conjunction with their addiction, and insure that people are educated on what they are taking.  This is not a supplement that should be banned but, instead, heralded as a natural way of managing pain and beating addiction.  \n\nA note about \"overdosing.\"  Wanting to make sure that I knew what we were selling, I purposefully took more Kratom than anyone should take so that I understood the affects of an \"overdose.\"  First it is not lethal.  Second, the affect of taking too much is that one begins to throw up as if they had food poisoning.  It lasts for about two hours and once your system has rid itself, you go back to feeling \"normal.\"  This notion that this is a dangerous supplement that can lead to death is not supported by science or actual facts.  \n\nIt is with this information that I implore you to refrain from listing this wonderful and natural plant that has been used in Chinese medicine for hundreds of years, as an illegal Schedule 1 drug and move to create rules/regs that govern the safe, positive, and legal non prescription distribution of this supplement.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1599","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tristan OConnell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Whether or not substances are harmful is irrelevant to the criminal regulation of these substances.

I originally got it for my husband's migraines. He is a 90% disabled combat vet who did two tours in the mid-2000s. It would take me a long paragraph to talk about all his symptoms and problems. Suffice to say, while it did not help his migraines, it did help his IBS which stems from PTSD as well as his stomach taking so much abuse from painkillers to deal with his migraines and other pain. I also feel it has helped him a little bit with his arthritis. \n\nAs for myself, I took it, and found that it helped with my depression and anxiety. I take it 1-3 times a week, and even knowing that it's legal and available, makes it easier for me. It's easy, even on days when I don't take it, to know if things get really bad, that I can take it because it works for me. \n\nI'm the type of person who doesn't even take ibuprofen often, maybe once a month. I try to avoid caffeine, and I don't really drink, and I definitely don't \"do drugs.\" I was extremely disheartened to see how transparently crooked the DEA was being. They abused the system, and I will certainly be doing whatever small part I can to support everything I can to defund, and put more checks in place. It's disgusting that this was even threatened, especially where we are in this country with alcohol deaths, and prescription abuse, as well as street-drug-related crime and death.\n\nKratom should not be made illegal. It should not be scheduled. The DEA, as well as the FDA needs to go focus on real threats to the American Public, and not be guard dogs for corporate profits at the cost of everyday people still financially reeling from the recession.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4495","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Shawna, I am 49 yrs old and disabled.

If an adult can choose to use alcohol or tobacco, which have various carcinogenic properties, then they should have the freedom to consume kratom.

This would put kratom -- a plant consumed safely in the U.S for decades and world-wide for millennia, and one that helps millions of people -- on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. \n\nThe DEA scheduling would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown the primary alkaloids in kratom to be beneficial without causing respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\nKratom is a regulated dietary ingredient. Kratom is not a drug. Kratom is not addictive.\n\nI am a 37 year old Registered Nurse and have safely used kratom for one full year. I started using kratom after a friend told me how it helped ease her symptoms of chronic pain, fatigue, and depression. I use Kratom to ease those same symptoms as well as to ease my anxiety and insomnia symptoms. Kratom has helped me go from being nearly bedridden to functioning properly as a mother able to take care of a household, run errands, and attend doctors appointments and some social gatherings \n\nIn my opinion as a user and Registered Nurse, I feel kratom, a safe and completely natural supplement, should  remain legal and fully available to the public without restrictions. Kratom helps ease many symptoms that are chronic and acute and is a natural and safe alternative to opiods and other pharmaceutical medications used to treat pain and other conditions. Kratom does not cause respiratory depression or negative cardiovascular complaints and research to date shows no deaths resulting from kratom when used alone. \n\nIn conclusion I ask that the DEA and other governmental regulatory agencies keep kratom and its alkaloids legal and fully available to all individuals as a natural herbal supplement. \n\nThank you for your consideration and concentrated attention.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15985","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lauren Arnold","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a licensed attorney have not used this substance.

I have something called Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy which is a rare disease and is considered one of the most painful conditions in the world, it ranks higher on the McGill Pain Index than child birth or the amputation of a limb!!!! The worst part is that as of right now there is no cure and it can spread to any body part without warning. It not only causes severe pain but I had lost the function in my right hand and was losing the ability to lift my arm up and basically unable to have anyone or anything touch that arm. The hardest part of all this was treatments and medications were not working and my family along with me were suffering from my inability to do the most basic of tasks. I have been through over 13 surgeries in the last few years due to a few other conditions I have called endometriosis and poly cystic ovarian disease, last year I went through a total abdominal hysterectomy and lost all my reproductive organs all before my 30th birthday. In August of 2016 I was facing another surgery but this time it was something serious, I was looking at having to have a device implanted at the base of my brain into my spinal cord to interrupt my sympathetic nervous system in hopes of relieving some of the pain along with more nerve injections and a surgery to release the pressure off my thoracic nerve. I just couldn't continue living in pain but was unable to accept that this was my last option for help managing my disease. That is when I searched and stumbled onto Kratom and decided that I would try it as I really had nothing to lose at this point. And within a week, literally my life has changed in the most unbelievably positive way. I am no longer chained to a life full of prescription medications, dr appts, specialists, surgeries, and hopelessness. I no longer need help to clean my house or someone to  help with my kids on a regular basis. And I have had no negative side effects whatsoever.  I AM FINALLY FREE.

I began drinking in college, like many, and by the time I hit 40, I had 'evolved' into a heavy drinker, severely affecting many, many parts of my life.  Second, after a full knee replacement and a back issue that led to surgery (the insurance requirements to get relief basically encourage drug abuse, but that's another story), I was addicted to opioids. While addicted to pain killers and desiring to kick the habit, I discovered kratom. Kratom allowed me to get and stay off opioids. I also was able to quit drinking. I've maybe enjoyed 2 good brews on four occasions over more than three years. And that's another huge point: while I go 6-8 months without anything to drink, when I do it is in moderation. Now, I can tell you with the desire to drink completely gone, I've gone from near 240 pounds to 195 pounds (at just over 6\"2'). I am in excellent health, have the energy to exercise and, at 51, look better than I have in years. (Kratom is part of what makes exercise possible with my medical history that includes the aforementioned plus plates on my tibia/fibia, brain tumor and numerous broken bones from sports and playing hard.) So, to sum, I plead with you not to make kratom a controlled substance. My life, my marriage and my relationship with my kids is a thousand times better because of the 'helping hand' of this plant. Similar to how two cups of coffee get me rolling in the morning, it has allowed me to successfully navigate my addictions and live a healthy, highly effective life at work and at home.\nThank you for your thoughtful consideration of this important decision that will impact millions. In a society with individual liberty as one of its primary pillars, I sincerely hope this choice is not diminished. \n\n(Preferred methods of contact: Mail, text, phone (please leave message and return number))","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0362","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Troy Foos","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 64 year old woman who has gone through a 4 level lumbar fusion, 2 hip replacements, and one rotator cuff surgery..one more to go.

(My boyfriend died in 1987 from a combination of asthma and codeine..so I know about this all too well.)\n It is painfully obvious that this proposal is to benefit the drug companies that sell Tramadol and suboxone. Kratom can actually get addicts clean. Isn't that enough reason to keep it legal????\n  I am not against some type of regulation. I know there are \"extracts\" (I have never tried them.) that might cause problems when mixed with other drugs, but the plain leaf should remain legal.\n I spent years being a \"criminal\" because I used marijuana.

Let me quickly give my backstory since it makes my comment more relevant if you know a little about my history. I will remain anonymous since my history is not something I am proud of and I fear that my colleagues would view me differently if they knew my troubled past.\n\nWhen I was 16 years old, I tried heroin for the first time. I come from a middle class family with a teacher for a mother and my father a lawyer. They were very loving but the pressure I felt to succeed was overbearing and I turned to drugs. Anyone who knows anything about heroin will tell you that it is an absolute escape from reality and is both physically / mentally addictive. After an 8 year battle and 4 rehabs including a long 1 year rehab at age 23, I finally dealt with my issues and gave up the drug for good. I acquired my GED along the way and then worked full time while getting my bachelor's degree. Today I have a BS in Information Technology and graduated with a 3.93 GPA. I work a full time job for a corporation and also run an IT consultation business on the side. I own 2 homes and have made serious strides towards reducing my 45K+ student loan debt. \n\nNow that I have given you my backstory and you can see that I am a productive member of society, I'll explain why Kratom is a part of my life today. The threat of returning to Heroin use is always a monkey on my back even though things are going well. The pain pills which are so readily available are seriously dangerous for me to use (especially Percocet and OxyContin). It is a serious struggle to stay away from these meds and I know they will lead me straight back to heroin if I take them regularly. It's a slippery slope!! The amazing thing about Kratom is that it is a twofold win for someone like me. With the correct dose and mixture, Kratom is a wonderful plant. It is safe!! It gives a boost of energy like coffee, relives my anxiety and helps me tackle the day which is always extremely busy. I also suffer from anxiety both social and general and it really helps me stay centered / focused. Less is more with this plant and it took me a while to discover this fact. One major benefit is that it completely takes away any craving I have towards pain pills and heroin. This is a big deal for someone recovering from a heroin addiction. Kratom is the only thing I will take when I am in extreme pain because it is the only thing I can take safely and I have been now for 4 years. \n\nAbove is why I take Kratom but for others, the benefit is even greater. I believe this plant is a better alternative to methadone and other detox type treatments that don't work. The recovery rate is utterly pathetic for heroin addicts and this plant is and will be a life saver. Given the growing heroin epidemic in this country, we cannot afford to not study this plant and have it readily available to the world. I am not against regulation but a scheduled ban is insanity and a waste of a God given plant. People are scared of what they don't understand and with Kratom this could not be truer. I know of several people whose entire lives have been turned around simply by taking this plant. It really is something which improves the quality of life for so many Americans. This is not something you get high on and I know what high is... This is what people don't understand. To schedule this plant would be a huge mistake!! There are tens of thousands of good people that know this. They are our veterans, our professionals and our everyday Americans. This is a plant that people use from all walks of life. \n\nIn conclusion, America has never needed this plant more than it does today!! The heroin epidemic, our suicidal veterans with PTSD... The benefits are real and that's why the DEA faced such backlash over this scheduling. Please do the right thing and keep it legal, study the effects, and do what's right for the people of this country!! I still trust in this country although I am becoming very skeptical these days. I think I will truly lose all trust in the government if this is banned. The only possible reason the DEA would schedule is due to lobbying big pharma. The American people aren't dumb and will see that money is driving the ban and people are not going to take it anymore. I urge you to save lives and do the right thing!! Please study this plant and look to understand the real science behind its effects because they are real and beneficial! \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my comment!\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5472","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI have never signed any kind of petition or written to any government agency prior to today. But I feel the subject of keeping Kratom legal is extremely important.  I feel that the driving force behind the effort to classify Kratom as a Schedule I drug is misguided and ill informed. Kratom is not the dangerous street drug that some are trying to claim. In fact, it's just the opposite. It's the only legal alternative and in many cases, the only way out for many people who find themselves trapped in the grip of opiate addiction. I am. 43 year old man who found himself addicted to opiates after ten plus years of back problems and surgeries. For years, my doctors readily prescribed opiates to which I, like so many became addicted. When the rules were changed a few years back and the belt was tightened on prescriptions and doctors cut people off on their scripts, when drugs like Lortab were discontinued, the result was the creation of many heroin addicts and criminals.  People who could no longer get the medicines their doctors had pushed on them for years and were left high and dry. In desperation. Opiate withdrawal is a horrific and incapacitating process.  The natural reaction is to do anything necessary to stay well and not have to go through withdrawal.  Many turned to heroin or were forced to buy pills illegally. I was one of the latter. I had a good job and a family to support. I couldn't afford to go to rehab or lose my job because I was going through weeks of withdrawal.  Ultimately, I was arrested for possession of street pills. now with a criminal record haunting me, holding me back in life, I am determined to never be looked at as a criminal again because of what is actually a medical condition. Kratom has made it possible, alomg with counseling and NA meetings, has made that possible. Kratom is the only legal substance that anyone can obtain and use to ween themselves off of opiates. So many of us cannot afford to put life on hold and go to detox and rehab. Kratom makes it possible to work and be productive while healing from addiction. Kratom is a Godsend, not a danger. \nI still have back problems and severe pain intermittently. Kratom is the only natural, non threatening substance that I can use to treat that pain. Thousands of people use this plant safely and responsibly every day. It literally saves lives. Please don't take that lifeline away from those who cannot or choose not to use proven dangerous and addictive pharmaceuticals to treat their ailments. The pharmaceutical companies have enough victims as it is. Don't force us to be slaves to those companies and the addictions they create.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11737","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brad Pointer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom will not be made Schedule 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-9J5-KCHCU&t=23s","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10302","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been life changing.

This is an unacceptable course of action and is either comes from a place of radical misinformation or active disregard for American citizens in pursuit of selfish interests.  \n\nThe kratom plant poses negligible danger to society and should absolutely remain legal and unregulated.  Putting this plant on Schedule I, where it would not even be able to be researched, would be a great disservice to the citizens of the United States of America who find kratom it be a functional alliterative to prescription opioids for treating chronic pain.  Disallowing citizens to make their own decisions for how to manage their medical condition goes direction against the maxim of liberty on which this great country was founded.  \n\nThe intoxicating effects of kratom are negligible compared to those of legal psychoactive compounds, such as alcohol.  Kratom does not encourage an individual to be violent or reckless.  The effect is mild and localized.  \n\nThe fact that there is no conclusive evidence of anyone ever dying directly as a result of kratom consumption with no extenuating circumstances shows how contrived the danger of this plant is.  Compared to alcohol, which causes many thousands of deaths in the United States every year directly from overconsumption, kratom is extremely safe and does not warrant any type of scheduling.\n\nIt would be a good thing to allow further study of the pharmacological and physiological effects of prolonged kratom use, which is another reason to keep the plant off of the Schedule I list.  If, through scientific study, kratom is found to have no significant negative effects from long term use, that would be a tremendous breakthrough in medicine and would improve and even save thousands of lives by allowing people a safer alternative to prescription opioids as well as offering a pathway to sobriety for those citizens who struggle with addiction to heroin and other highly addictive compounds.\n\nOverall, there is no reason for the DEA to schedule kratom.  It does not make sense and it goes against the unalienable right to liberty which is endowed to all human beings.  Many thousands who rely on kratom for medical reasons would either be considered criminals under the law or would suffer needlessly if the DEA goes through with the scheduling of kratom.  Please reconsider.\n\nSincerely, \n\nA concerned citizen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8978","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jared Morningstar","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My son has suffered from severe depression, social anxiety and bipolar disorder since he was very young.

We speak regularly about patient status and options, as I am part of a group who tries to help and support those with severe chronic pain, anxiety and related issues.  In the past 8 years since forming this group that has supported over 200 people, we have never seen anything make such a difference to people as we have with Kratom.  It has allowed dozens to get off opioid and methadone treatments, while dramatically lessening their symptoms of pain, anxiety, while significantly increasing their ability to improve or get back to a better quality of life with higher levels of productivity and overall mood and outlook.\n\nThis is not to say that we don't see benefits and improvements sometimes with traditional pharmaceutical, mental health and related treatment options, in fact, we often believe that they should be used in combination with natural alternatives that include things like meditation, Kratom and such.  It is just that the side effects and contraindications associated with those taking Kratom have been much, much less than with traditional medications, and the benefits to them have been significantly better.  \nHowever, I can tell you that the elimination of Kratom as an option for many, will push many of them back to higher levels of pain, lower levels of participation in social and other activities, while also increasing the rates of opioid usage that we have seen over 18 deaths over the past few years.\n\nLike many others I have seen and heard input from on this matter, we believe that the best thing would be for Pharma to embrace the usage of naturally occurring options like Kratom, rather than taking them off the table completely.   It's elimination without such a replacement is simply going to result in increased rates of premature deaths, suicides, premature deaths and lower quality of life.  While it may increase overall revenues for traditional treatment options, like most others, I believe that the lives and livelihoods of those suffering should be given the highest weight, which would beg to allow it to remain legal until pharma chooses to review and move forward with it as and option.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22089","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Denis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jonathan and I am 31 years old.  I have been out of work now for 7 years due to medical conditions.  I strongly oppose the DEAs reclassification of Mitragyna Speciosa.  I firmly believe Mitragyna Speciosa a.k.a. Kratom has been a saving grace and a godsend for me.  At a time when I was suffering greatly from the crippling effects of a mysterious and difficult to diagnose medical condition, this plant provided some pain relief when nothing else had worked.  Due to my condition, not knowing what was wrong, and my slight intolerance to them, neither I nor my doctor were comfortable using traditional pharmaceutical pain meds.  For years I tried many natural healing and pain management therapies.  I made lifestyle changes, diet changes (to the point my life was unrecognizable), but was still losing my normal abilities to function.  Getting around to appointments and to the grocery store required assistance.  The pain would stop me in my tracks, and it could happen anywhere, anytime.  An old friend happened to recommend Kratom to me after hearing about my dilemma.  With the first dose I was very surprised that it had an effect. And I found that it didn't affect my mental capacity to function the way traditional pharmaceuticals had.  It's been years now and I have Kratom to thank for getting me through the hard times.  I use it like a knee brace or crutch.  It allows me to function when I am otherwise not able to.  And even though it helps so much I would say I find my coffee or occasional sweet treat more addictive; and I definitely think it's safer than alcohol or tobacco by a mile!  In the wrong hands, anything can be unsafe; But we're not regulating candy stores and McDonalds because of the obesity and diabetes epidemic.  Kratom is safe.  Criminalizing it's millions of peaceful and legitimate consumers is inappropriate and even immoral.  I believe this herb is undervalued and needs more research.  This action by the DEA would stop all future attempts at that.  For this reason alone, I believe the DEA should not declare this plant unsafe.  Any intelligent person is qualified to look at the current research available and already gather it's safety and effectiveness. www.americankratom.org/science Besides Kratoms scientific & historically proven safety, I believe the 'war-on-drugs' needs to be re-approached.  The ACLU is calling for progress in all drug laws. https://www.aclu.org/report/every-25-seconds-human-toll-criminalizing-drug-use-united-states   Criminalizing those with legitimate medical reasons for peacefully taking medication is insane and a violation of human rights.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18900","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathan Krise","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA \nI currently live in a county in which the opioid epidemic in which this country has seen, has ravieged.

I have taken various medications to help with those conditions, and while some of them have helped, none of them have had anywhere near the positive effect of kratom, and all have had worse side effects.\n\nKratom makes my anxiety and depression bearable, and it makes it easier to adjust my focus so that I can pay attention to the things I need to focus on. It stimulates my mind similarly to caffeine, and it reduces the pain associated with social interactions. It helps me not to dwell so much on those things which my depression usually pushes me to obsess over.\n\nHere is an exhaustive list of the side effects I have experienced with kratom: sometimes it makes me slightly queasy. OK, I'm done. What I certainly have _not_ experienced is any kind of dependency. When I stop using it, I cease to experience its benefits. That is all that happens.\n\nI am the kind of nerd who likes to read a lot about anything she puts into her body, so I have done considerable research into what is currently known about kratom. Based on that, it is shocking to me that the DEA would consider regulating it at all, much less putting it in the most restricted class alongside heroin and bath salts.\n\nAs not just a user of kratom, but a citizen concerned for other Americans, I am also horrified by the prospect of banning kratom in the midst of an opiate crisis. I have read so many inspiring stories of former opiate addicts who have used kratom to stay off of hard drugs, and I'm kept up at night by thinking about what will happen to those people if their access to kratom is restricted.\n\nI hope that the DEA will look closely at the existing body of evidence surrounding kratom, and make the correct decision to focus on other substances instead.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13298","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ada Cohen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Earlier I told You My Story how Kratom has helped me with my own addiction to pain killers.I need to emphasize How much it has also helped Many others I know that had far worse problems than i did.

Currently I am currently a patient at a pain clinic. I've had all sorts of testing and been through physical therapy as well as injections and even had my nerves burnt. I have degenerative disk disease, my hips sit uneven, my nerves are either pinched or too narrow(dr doesn't know which), my spine is bent in a place where it shouldn't be, my spine is straight in a place it shouldn't be, I have a bone spur in my foot that shouldn't cause the pain it does but nonetheless I still often have trouble walking. The pain clinic gives me 4 different medications for pain and none of which are helping but they won't try anything else and that adds to the many that I'm already on for other things. I don't want to have to ingest all these pills and would much rather get rid of all this stuff that doesn't work for my pain when they don't even work and go with something natural. My quality of life is well below where it should be. It should not take me 8 1/2 hours just to do the dishes, clean my kitchen, and sweep & mop the kitchen floor. I should not have trouble riding in a vehicle or dread having to make a meal because I know it's going to hurt. My children who are use to me being able to do so much with them should not have to feel like I'm letting them down and it kills me to know that my pain is hurting them too. I'm in so much pain all the time yet these doctors haven't been able to figure out a single thing that helps. Kratom should not be regulated when it grow naturally. It isn't altered like medications we get through doctors that aren't good for us. Nothing the doctors do not that I do gives me relief. If I stand, sit, or lay very long it only increases my pain. I have yet, due to not being sure where to get it and because we are on a fixed income, been able to try Kratom but I would love to if it works as well as I've been hearing it does. I should not have to live my life like this and there are days I wish someone would just put me out of my misery but I've got kids and they need me. So please don't regulate Kratom or anything else that grows naturally because if it keeps people from seeking out opiates and other drugs then isn't that a plus. Desperate people do desperate things. Please don't force people to do that.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4640","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W\nDear esteemed comment readers at the DEA,\n\nI am not a radical.  I like to think that I am a fairly balanced person who weighs both sides of issues with equanimity, before I decide where my personal opinion resides.  I am a teacher, one who feels a strong need to make a positive difference in those who take my classes.  And now I feel the need to make a difference by standing up for what I believe is a balanced way of looking at the herbal supplement kratom and to reconsider the decision to prohibit it.\n\nDoes kratom have a beneficial place in our society or are we all better off by blocking people's access to it by classifying it as a Schedule 1 drug on the same level as LSD and methamphetamine?  Shouldn't that depend on how many people have found that they really couldn't function in society without it vs. the number of people who have been harmed and even killed by it?  The truth is, there are thousands upon thousands of people in our country who need kratom in order to relieve the debilitating pain that they suffer because it is as effective as opiates for this purpose and much less harmful to the body, if at all.  In addition, to the best of my knowledge, no one has died exclusively because of taking kratom, but rather because they mixed it with alcohol, barbiturates and other substances.  \n\nAnother benefit of kratom is relief from anxiety disorders.  For those who have extreme anxiety when in social situations, kratom has been a godsend.  It has allowed them to interact with others and not collapse emotionally or isolate themselves.  For those individuals who suffer from anxiety, kratom is priceless and irreplaceable.  Prohibiting it would be injurious to their health and wellbeing.  \n\nOpiates are far more dangerous to ingest and far less effective for anxiety disorders.  For this reason, kratom occupies a unique place in the natural supplement market and in my opinion should not be pushed under the legal carpet by prohibiting it and thus forcing it into the black market.  If anything needs to be done, I think it would be reasonable to limit it to those 18 and older and do some quality control on it to ensure that people are buying a product that is pure and unadulterated.  That, in my opinion, would serve the greatest good.\n\nAs a country, I would like to think that one of our goals is to allow as many people as possible to be productive members of society.  If you classify kratom as a schedule 1 drug, in my opinion you will make it harder for thousands of honest, tax-paying citizens to be able to perform their duties and maintain their employment due to overwhelming pain and/or crippling anxiety.  Please reconsider the ban on kratom, for the greatest good of all concerned.  \n\nThank you for your time and consideration,\n\nKurt Kemp","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16602","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kurt Kemp","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For me kratom has been absolutely amazing.

I'm married with two children and the Director of Life Sciences for a large healthcare company.\nI've been using Kratom for around 5 years.\nMy story is probably similar to many others.  I had two lumbar discectomies before I was 35 years old. The first was a success, but the second left me with permanent neuropathy in my left leg, specific to my peroneal nerve.  My physician prescribed a number of pain medications, Ultram, Neurontin (for nerve pain) and Opiates. In 2011 I became addicted to Roxycodone. This nearly cost me my career and my marriage.  I stopped Roxycodone, and went through most of the WD cold-turkey, and it was when I started looking for something to help me to feel like myself again and deal with everyday pain without opiates (since I will never touch them again) that I discovered Kratom. I believe this plant has literally saved my life and my family as I am the primary source of income. I know longer take any pain medications, not even ibuprofen. I drink Kratom tea 3 times a day, and am pain-free, without being in a zombie state. I'd also point out that I'm not a recreational user of any drugs, and don't drink alcohol.\nWithout Kratom, I'm not sure what I would do. I guess I would just try and deal with the pain, but I don't look forward to living like that and not being able to function.\nI don't believe this is a dangerous medication in any way. If you take too much, you feel dizzy and become nauseous.  It's not like an opiate, where more provides a euphoria. More of Kratom just makes you sick.  I've also noticed that there's little if any tolerance build up. I've been taking the same amount for several years.\nScheduling this plant will do far more harm than good. People will either be left suffering, or go back to opiates, or even heroin.\n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider your decision to Schedule Kratom. I would agree restricting access to those under 18, but to make it a Schedule I seems very careless given the benefits it has provided for normal, everyday, tax-paying citizens like myself.\n\nSincerely, \nJason Shaffer","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8074","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason Shaffer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should be investigating pharm drugs that have caused more problems than any plant.

I have been using the supplement kratom for about two years now to help ease my conditions with no side effects. With my doctor prescribe medication such as Xanax and Zoloft they help my conditions but the side effects of low energy and restlessness cause me to live like a zombie while taking them. When I take kratom I'm able to relieve my anxiety but I am not tired, it gives me energy to go to work do my job safely counteracting my prescibed medications side effects.  Unlike coffee or caffeine supplements kratom does not increase my anxiety alongside the energy. I believe that everybody has the right to take supplements there is no reason for kratom to be banned it helps myself and so many others with multiple disorders and injuries. Also I feel that a potential ban would also do way more harm then good, it would cause an increase in opiates and other drugs that people use to get relief whether it be mentally or physically. I know most people are probably thinking that the people protesting the potential scheduling of kratom are just drug loving hippies or previous addicts and that is not the case most of the users of kratom are veterans, doctors, nurses, law enforcement and other educated individuals and contributing members of society. Kratom should not be scheduled and the scheduling of kratom would also make good people instant criminals for using a leaf from Thailand that has been used for hundreds of years safely. I think it is a crime in itself to not allow people to choose their choice of medicines whether it be botanicals or prescriptions which there are more related deaths from precribed medications than natural plants. The few deaths that are supposedly attributed to kratom  (which every one of those cases also involved other substances and not kratom alone) is a tiny percentage and I believe it is worth the minuscule risk for all of the relief it provides to the thousands of users. How many people die from peanuts a year because of allergies? I bet it is more than the recorded deaths involved with kratom usage yet peanuts are not scheduled. I urge the DEA to leave kratom alone for the sake of my health and many others.  I know that the DEA is just trying to keep everybody safe and I agree completely with getting rid of dangerous substance but I feel and my doctor does too that kratom is not dangerous and my doctor check ups show that. So please make the right choice and let Americans be free with choices and the choice of natural relief without big pharmaceutical companies involvement creating synthetics that are causing more harm than good like opiates.

I have tried every procedure under the sun and I still suffer.  I currently see a pain specialist for my injections and most of the time the pain is so intense I have no option but to revert to pain medication.  This stuff is the worst thing they can give anyone but the fact that it sometimes helps leaves me with very few choices and not to mention things that I can do.  I am very limited because most of the time, it makes me tired, no motivation, and constant vegging on the couch.  Then about 10 months ago I discovered Kratom while looking up other ways to manage my pain because I was afraid I was going to lose it.  At times the pain gets to you so much, you don't even want to be around anymore.  From the very first time I took Kratom, NEVER did I get any high like a pain medication would, but for once my pain was tolerable.  I had energy and had the willing to live again.  I didn't feel weird or like a zombie.  To be honest, had it not been for Kratom I honestly can say that I may not even be writing this letter to you.  To want to ban this would be the worst thing that could happen.  I could see if you want to regulate it like alcohol, 21+ simply to keep out of kids hands, but to totally ban this would be devastating.  Until you can physically put yourself into our shoes, with the daily pain we have to deal with, you will never know what we have to overcome on a daily basis and to take maybe one of the very few things that give us hope, again, would be a devastating blow.  I ask you to please reconsider this motion and allow Kratom to be legal in the US.\n\nThank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4006","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mike J","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a second year medical student at West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine and I don't believe that kratom should become a Schedule I drug. \n\nNot only would this hinder any current or future research being done, but I feel that this is a very heavy-handed response to a very minor problem.

The pharmaceuticals narcotics and illegal drugs are overkill when providing that \"one thing\" that the drugs give them.  Every time the \"safe\" and mild solutions are such as kratom are no longer an option, you push decent people no other choice but what they can get cheaply on the streets, or at the local drug store.  Kratom has about as mild of effect on someone as anything I, or anyone else I talked to, than anything else out there.  I can tell you, if you ban this non-public threatening plant, I can tell you you will have millions more people driving up the risk of the drug and pharmaceutical illegal trades, driving up crime, more human rights violations in countries that supply the US, which I think you agency knows very well.  If I were to drink alcohol, I would say that would be much more dangerous to my health, and the health of other I could hurt than this ridiculously mild plant.  I respect the jobs of each honorable DEA agent and the officers on the streets, enforcing heroine, cocaine, etc.  It is a tough and dangerous job in this world. I believe in my heart, by making Kratom illegal would be a great disrespect to all those agents and officers, since anyone can get the hard drugs on the streets because they don't have any \"mild\", and again, harmful, alternative to the hard drugs.\n\nPlease consider this before you decide to put millions of people on a more dangerous path for themselves, the public, and the safety of all the great agents and local law enforcement on the ground.  \n\nThank you for reading this and God Bless America!\nBrian","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4344","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Turner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me deal with pain management after a vehicle accident.

Since I was 18 years old I have had chronic back pain from an injury I sustained at work. I have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, severe arthritis, bulging disc and sciatica. My Doctor decided to put me on Norco. Started out with 180 per month. Then when that quit working he doubled the strength and gave me 150 per month. I was on these for 7 years. At first it seemed to work, but quickly changed. My pain seemed to get worse but now I was addicted to the pain pills. So I was still taking them , as well as otc pain meds, getting shots near my spine and doing physical therapy. Quickly I found I did not like the hold the norco had on me, more so than the pain I was in. I researched natural alternatives online where I found kratom. I tried quitting the norco cold turkey and quickly became ill with withdrawals. I ordered kratom and tried again this time using it. To my surprise there were no withdrawals and even better I had no pain in my back. I am proud to say that I threw away my norco and that was 5 years ago. In this 5 years, the first year I took kratom daily, after that I switched to only taking it when my back would flare up. I became much more active in my daily life, at home and work. It never clouded my mind like the norco. Kratom helped me beat prescription narcotic addiction all the while helping my back pain more than all other things combined. Because I was able to be more active I lost weight which in turn helped my back problem considerably. I now very rarely have any back issues and probably only take kratom once a month to once every two months when I do. Most of the time otc motrin is enough to help these days.

This causes full body pain  I also have digestive pain, an anxiety disorder and PTSD as well (and other things that I won't get into here).   I just recently started Kratom and have been sticking with only 3mgs. It has taken my pain and anxiety away! No side effects. This has been very helpful to me. Its only been 2 weeks with a day off in between and its only once in the early morning. And like I said, no side effects for me, whatsoever, and no craving for more, either. It seems to work for many hours for me. I do still take something else for the days in between that I don't use this.  But Kratom is still worth it for me for the days I do use it.  This has been a miracle and I suggest that the DEA/FDA keep it legal because I just got the guts to buy it to try out after searching for a natural way to get pain relief because I prefer natural medicine over chemical prescriptions if possible. I am a smart and responsible person and I know that anything in excess has risks, even SODA!  So not EVERYTHING can be governed. I, and many others, feel this herb is very beneficial for pain relief and anxiety.\n\nThank you for hearing my story and strongly taking it into consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2064","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Heather Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom was the most important factor in overcoming my alcohol addiction.

As a highly successful real estate investor, which hokds  both undegraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Colorado I'm  happy to report that me and many of my friends and coleagues responsibly use Kratom on a weekly basis. Not a single one of use has ever experienced any of the negative effects that are sometimes attributed to Kratom.  I honestly believe this attempt is a completely misguided attemp to ban Kratom is based on misinformation and fear of misunderstanding, probably due to the lack of understanding about the effects and perceived dangers of this safe natural plant. \n\nFirst I would like to address the question of whether kratom is safe or if it is the highly dangerous plant that deserves schedule 1 designation in the same category of methanohetamine, cocaine, and other obviously danger drugs. In order to make this determination and hold a conversation on this issue let's consider the facts about Kratom safety. \n\n1) The US government has noted a group of 15 or so Kratom related deaths in our country in the last 5 or 10 years. Well, with closer examination not a single one of those incidents was attributed to Kratom and Only Kratom. These people virtually all had a coctail of legal and illegal substances in thier system which more likely to be the cause of over dose. Just because Kratom was in existence in those cases does not in any way determine it was the Kratom that caused thier overdose. In fact, people from Southeast Asia have safely been using Kratom for thousands of years without a single report of Kratom death or overdose. \n\n2) The health benefits of Kratom are vast. Kratom is a light mood amenhancercthat create a feeling of energy, well being, reduction of anxity and decrease in depression and chronic pain. These affects are mind and last no longer than 4 or 5 hours. It encourages productivity and energy as well.  Compared to other mind altering chemicals the intoxication effects are millions of times less intense than alcohol and marijuana.\n\n3) in conclusion Kratom is a very safe \"coffe like\" substance that is extremely safe and should be made available to responsible adults, \n\nOn behalf of the medical patients in the country who are no longer willing to endure the crippling side effects of prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines and prescription pain killers, please bo not take this safe alternative from our access. Try it yourself if you don't believe me. \n\nSincerely,\n\nObservatory Properties LLC\n2810 Clermont Street\nDenver, CO, 80201\nJake Silcott, B.S., M.B.A\n720-431-0164\nJakesilcott@hotmail.com","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10588","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jake Silcott","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Abraham Oriz.\n\nAs a former Sergeant of the United States Army, I am in favor of keeping Kratom Legal.

I have numerous lingering effects of injuries I suffered in a coupe serious car accidents, and from playing football throughout middle school, high school, and college. Including degenerative disc disease, and constant migraine headaches from concussions suffered throughout. \n     My doctors were prescribing me very strong narcotic painkillers as a result, combined with the fact that I am deathly allergic to acetaminophen and NSAIDS, let to progressively stronger doses. And it got to the point where the side effects were absolutely awful, including irritability, reduced sex drive, constipation, and extreme fatigue, and when/if I didn't take the medication I would suffer from insomnia, restless legs, diahreah, and increased anxiety. It got to the point where I could barely work and adequately provide for my family, I was headed to the point where I was going to have to be on disability for the rest of my life.\n     I was told about Kratom 3 years ago from an old football buddy who suffered from similar issues discribed above, who told me that Kratom completely changed his life for the better. So I started supplementing Kratom into my diet as needed, and it completely changed my life as well. I have experienced zero side effects, and it has helped me turn my life around to the point where I am able to work a full time job (40 hours+ a week), and provide for my family like I have never been able to do before, and it also helps with social anxiety disorder that has plagued me since adolescence.\n     In short, if Kratom is banned it will GREATLY reduce the quality of my life (and countless others) and how I am able to provide for my family. I dread the possibility of having to rely on prescription painkillers once again. I just don't see how it would be beneficial to ban a tea leaf that has been consumed safely for thousands of years. From the extensive research I have conducted, there isn't a single recorded fatality that can be attributed to Kratom alone. It is a safe and healthy plant that greatly helps countless people, I feel it would only prove to make things drastically worse if it were to be banned.\n\n     Thank you for your time.\n      Sincerely\n       Kristofer Topper","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19413","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kristofer Topper","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\nMy name is Kristopher B. Rawson. I myself am a recent college graduate with enormous student loan debt. I work two jobs and support a family and a large network of loved ones. I have used Kratom off and on for around a year. I use this herb when I am totally run down and in need of energy and a pick me up. Kratom is a miracle in my life because I am able to work harder, smarter, and faster due to its effects. Also, if I am feeling anxious or have aches and pain due to a non-stop work load, Kratom helps me to alleviate these burdens and work through the toughest of times and also helps me to relax.\n\nAmerica is in a pickle at this point and we need people to work harder and smarter without the thoughts of political, or environmental doom. We all need to buckle down and work for the future of this great nation in which our freedoms and liberties are associated. As Americans our freedoms coincide with having and using a wide variety of natural and medicinal herbs and medicines such as Kratom. Without Kratom to alleviate our aches, pains, and mental torment we are doomed to mediocrity at best, in this fast passed changing world.  \n\nMany people enjoy alcohol to relax and rub off the burdens of a hard and trying day. Alcohol is also one of the most deadliest and dangerous drugs known to man. I myself do not enjoy the effects of alcohol or any other legalized stress reliever that American society has to offer, Kratom on the other hand is the only medicinal compound that I will use intermittently in life.\n\nSome people say that Kratom is extremely addictive, I have found that I am able to take it at the toughest times in my life and am able to stop taking it as fast as I started. I feel no harsh or lingering effects from the herb, and have never been addicted to its effects. \n\nIn total, Kratom is a miracle and taking it away from the American people at a time when we feel our freedoms are being lost would be a huge mistake. We cannot and will not stand by while our freedoms and prosperity are being stripped from us. Kratom is just one small piece to this hugely evolving puzzle we call liberty. \n\nI hope that we the people can have justice and freedom from despotic government control that would inhibit our nature as god loving, freedom fighting American citizens.\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10137","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kristopher Rawson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom,\n\nI used Kratom multiple times a day for two months last year with no ill effects.

I'm in my late 20s. I was a really stupid kid, and decided to do heroin when I was a teen. I quickly got addicted, and my life totally fell apart. For years, I used  a lot of it and never intended to quit, but as I got older, I started seeing a light at the end of the tunnel, and I decided it was time to get clean. One day, I quit heroin cold turkey. Once the withdrawals kicked in, I realized I could not do this by myself. It was unbearable, so I quickly got myself to a methadone clinic. The methadone did help me stay off heroin, so I stayed on it for a while, but I was always heavily intoxicated from it, and would lay around 24 hours a day. I grew to get sick of that, so I weened off the methadone. Despite weening, I was still getting significant withdrawal symptoms. After getting totally off of it, I was doing good for a few months, but my urges to use heroin came back with a vengeance. I didn't want to go back to my old life, so I decided to go to another clinic, this time for Suboxone. Once again, Suboxone was helping me stay off heroin, but I never had any energy, felt intoxicated, and would get very sick if I missed a dose. I started doing online research, for some new ideas, and that's when I discovered kratom. I quit the Suboxone, and purchased kratom. Ever since I started medicating with kratom, I've been able to stay away from heroin, methadone, and Suboxone.

Half the time, even cleaning the dishes caused my wrists a lot of pain.  I go to the free clinic in my town of Winchester, VA, but they haven't taken me serious about my pain, and since I haven't had health insurance since I turned 18, because I could not afford it, I can't exactly just choose a different one.\n\nNow that I've found Kratom I actually have the energy to do things around the house and with minimal pain.

OTC drugs dont do much, and my doctor and I have tried all the non-opiate choices to no avail. On really bad days I take prescription pain killers and they work, but the last thing I want is to survive on opiates. I worry that it will only get worse. Kratom, even at low doses, eases the discomfort a great deal.\nI discovered Kratom about 6 months ago after hearing about its potential health benefits on CNN or one of the news networks. I cautiously began to use it and after time I found that it has evened out my life. With less pain and increased motivation I look forward to every morning, and I get things done! I have not experienced any side effects, certainly not like those on prescription drugs.\n\nAnd painkillers! Although I personally dont worry about it, opiate addiction is a problem facing our country, maybe as serious as we have. I chose not to list a lot of links - I know you have probably seen the same articles or webpages, but the promise of Kratom as a possible substitute or withdrawal agent is evident. I worry because the addicts we see are our family, our respected co-workers, our friends - certainly not the criminals that are stereotyped. There should be other options to get these folks back to a normal, contributing life.

Since I've started taking kratom, I am no longer interested in opiod pain meds.  I've also started to work out again, am excelling at my job, I was able to break free from a failing marriage, I've made great friends, and I am a much better mother to my children.  All of these capabilities were within me, but my depression has prevented me from expressing them for so long.  If I had a complaint about kratom, it would be that it isn't regulated/tested so different batches can have different effects.  Also, there is a physically addicting aspect to the powder.  However, I've learned how to take kratom through trial and error.  When I first starting taking it, yes I would throw up if I took too much.  But I've thrown up many more times by drinking too much alcohol - which is completely legal.  I would like to thank the DEA for listening to the public and not classifying kratom as a schedule I drug.  There is much good to be learned from kratom.

I appreciate your time and effort in reading the many responses from people like me who use Kratom regularly to help deal with the many health issues we face. \nI was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 2002. I have been on every medication used to treat the symptoms of fibro and many off label to try to get relief from this horrible neurological condition that affects the muscles, ligaments and every other part of my body, from Paxil to presently prescribed opiates. Through all these years of suffering, I have not had relief from these medications. They'll make me feel drowsy, but don't help with the pain and exhaustion that I go through everyday. You may have heard fibromyalgia is very hard to treat. \nAbout two years ago, I was on a Facebook group for fibromyalgia sufferers and someone mentioned Kratom. They said it was a plant from the coffee family and was not dangerous like opiates are. As you're well aware, opiate use and abuse is at an all time high across our great nation. Heroin and prescription pills are killing people everyday. I've personally lost two family members to opiate abuse. I did not want to become a statistic or memory to my daughter. \nI am one who has always been proactive in my healthcare. I researched Kratom for months before I finally found the American Kratom Association website. The group helped me find a Facebook group and there is found A vendor who has a safe and tested product. My first time using Kratom still causes me to tears up. For the first time since I was a teenager, I felt like that strong man with his hands clawing into my upper back and shoulders had released me! There was no high, no woogly feeling, no spaciness, just a relaxation that came over my body. I cry email etude time I think of it because I finally found something to help give me a break from the horrible pain I've felt, most of my life! \nI learned about the different strains of Kratom, and found there was also one that helped people lie me get energy. I tried it along with the first and I could clean my house! All my daughter's life, I spent on the couch, curled up in pain. My pain costed her a childhood she could have had, had I known about Kratom. As much as I tried to work 45+ hours a week, and be a good mother, I was just too exhausted to do much of anything else when I picked her up from daycare. \nKratom has given me life! Literally life! My now 24 year old daughter and I can go shopping, and spend the day! Yes. I am exhausted and achy the next few days, but at least I can do it! \nPlease take the comments of people who use this natural botanical in to consideration before you take it away. With the dangers we all face with opiates, this plant could be a saving grace for the millions dealing with pain and opiate abuse. \nThank you for your time. \n\nPeggy Hall","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10545","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Peggy Hall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has saved my life.

My job is very physical as I deliver food and restaurant supplies to restaurant chains ( Pizza Hut, Chipoltle, ect.. ).   I have done this type of work since being honorably discharged in 2001. Along with this, I have been obsessed with weight training, eating healthy and optimizing personal performance since the age of 12.                                                                                              Unfortunately, injuries are almost always certain sooner or later. Six years ago my shoulders reached a point where the pain was always there and nothing I did was of much help, including long stints in physical therapy. My physician prescribed Percocet to me and I reluctantly started to use them. At first I only took them when I was working and the pain got severe. Before I knew it I was taking them as soon as I woke up because I would feel completely miserable if it was not in my system.                                                                     Five years after filling the first bottle, having tried so many times to get off of them with no success, I heard about the Kratom plant. I actually heard Joe Rogan and another gentleman with a similar situation to my own discussing it on his podcast.                               I ordered a small bag of it the next day and finally felt like I had an edge this time to kick It for good.                                                                                                                                The Kratom worked wonders for me. I used it a couple times a day while tapering down the opiates. Today I am opiate free and there is no doubt in my mind this would not be the case had I not found out about this plant.                                                                                        I sincerely hope that Kratom remains legal and similar stories to this quickly multiply. I would have never predicted I would end up one of the millions of opiate addicted Americans. It was absolutely the darkest and most depressing years of my life. I would never wish it on anyone. Kratom was my way out, my way of getting back to who I am proud to be. I know there are so many other good people in the same situation and I am confident this plant can and will get their life back on track.                                                                                         Thank you very much for listening to me and others. I hope it shines a little light on the actual reality of kratom.                                    Sincerely, Jacob M.

I was diagnosed with Chronic Migraines by the time I was 11 years old. Since then I've been taking all kinds of Aspirin and Ibuprofen. That means that I have been taking over the counter pain medication for 18 years of my life. Some Doctors tried to work with me, getting me on different medications, or changing medications I was already on to try on lessen my Migraine headaches. Other Doctors told me to just keep taking what I was taking. That doesn't work for me. I grew quickly tolerant of Aspirin and Ibuprofen. I started having to take more and more, most of the time just going through the steps even though the painkillers stopped working. During an especially bad attack I had taken 10 200mg Ibuprofen pills in an hour. I was making myself sick. I was killing my kidneys and liver. I couldn't keep doing that to myself.\n\nI didn't want to be on-over-the-counter painkillers my whole life, and I didn't want to become addicted to narcotic painkillers and never be able to come off of them.\n\nI looked into what I could possibly start doing to help my migraines. I started yoga and relaxing exercises. These helped a bit, kept the migraines at bay mostly. I then did some more research and found Kratom. I thought it was too good to be true. How could something like Kratom be legal in the U.S.A and not me picked up by the DEA or the FDA. I looked at testimonials and found people who were quitting Heroin, Vicodin, and Percocet using Kratom to help them because it was non habit forming, and helped with withdrawals that would have killed them. I found other people with the chronic pains using Kratom to help them through there day-to-day lives, and expressing how much their quality of life has changed. I had to try it.\n\nI've been drinking Kratom tea for a little over a year now, and am overly thankful that I don't suffer as badly from migraine headaches anymore, my Sciatic nerve problem has lessened as well as all other aches and pains I didn't realize I have. Kratom has allowed me to have less days in bed, in the dark, trying not to vomit from the pain. Kratom has allowed my spirits to be lifted. Kratom has allowed me to stop taking Ibuprofen every single day, allowing me to not damage my organs further.\n\nSo DEA, if you put Kratom on Schedule One, me and many other people in the U.S.A are going to succumb and revert back to how we were before Kratom. Addicts will have to spend tons of money to go get clean and use Suboxone, increasing their risks of getting back on the wagon again. \n\nI don't want to be stuck on over-the-counter and prescription painkillers my whole life. We should have a choice.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5283","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I suffer from spinal disk disease and am in chronic pain.

I'm happy to have this opportunity to comment on government actions in connection with the natural plant product known as kratom.\n\nI consume crushed kratom leaf once daily (about 5 grams).  In 2002 I injured my back moving furniture.  I have managed to avoid surgery, and I'd like to keep it that way.  I have used legally prescribed hydrocodone to manage the pain associated with occasional flair-ups, but until I discovered kratom I did have these flair-ups on an \"every few months\" basis.  Since I began daily consumption of kratom I have not had a single such episode - my life feels \"normal\" for the first time since the injury.  The plant has been a godsend for me.\n\nThe idea that kratom has proven harmful to some individuaels is of course of great concern to me.  However, I'm reminded that some people kill themselves with alcohol as well, and we all agree about the adverse health impact of tobacco.  But no one is talking about banning those items.  I absolutely believe that kratom is harmless if used intelligently and in moderation.  I absolutely believe that is has beneficial medicinal effects - my own experience is total proof of this.  And I absolutely believe that as free individuals we should be allowed to make such choices for ourselves.\n\nMy wife and I are both highly educated professionals - in no way connected to any sort of \"down and out drug community.\"  We have a family and I can tell you that kratom in no way diminishes my desire to love and care for my children. Indeed - I worship the ground they walk on and do everything I possibly can to ensure their welfare. Kratom *enhances* my ability to do this by removing otherwise ever-present physical discomfort from my life.\n\nI have never consumed kratom in its \"extract\" form - only in the form of raw crushed leaf.  My decision to avoid extracts stems directly from the uncertainty I have about the process control procedures of extract vendors - I would prefer to maintain precise control over the amount of active chemical I consume.  I would be 100% supportive of regulations placed on kratom *extract* aimed at ensuring consistent strength and consumption safety.  I don't feel that the crushed leaf form of the substance requires any regulation.\n\nI will be honest and admit that I fundamentally don't feel that government agencies should have the ability to make decisions of this nature autonomously.  As a believer in our democratic and republican form of government I feel that such decisions should be made by Congress - our elected representatives.  I also feel that \"that government is best which governs least,\" and I believe government prohibitions on free behavior should be enacted only when the evidence is *absolutely overwhelming* that no good and only bad arises from the behavior in question.  I do not believe such evidence exists in the case of kratom.  I implore you to remember that American citizens should be, first and foremost, *free* to make their own life decisions.\n\nBanning kratom is not a right and proper action for you to take - please don't do it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7032","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Individual","postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Samuel Ingram","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Debi Gerwitz. I am a 24-year-old mother of a 20 month old son, a full-time student, and the president of a not for profit organization that provides free and low cost service dogs to individuals with a wide variety of disabilities. I am firmly opposed to the DEA putting Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances at any point in time. I am legally disabled by ADHD with comorbid Social Anxiety, Situational Anxiety, Agoraphobia, and treatment resistant depression, as well as, Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis. I began using Kratom fairly recently after the initial emergency scheduling was postponed for commenting. A close friend of mine had recently begun using Kratom as a way to regain her life from her disabilities and the change was astonishing. At this point in my journey, I have been able to test and discover many different strains of Kratom and find out how much this supplement can really change my life. \nI am a better mother. I have more energy and less pain, which has allowed me to be there more for my son and become a more active part of his childhood. See, because of my laundry list of disabilities and illnesses, I will not be able to have another child. My little boy is my one and only and I dont want to miss a second of his wonderful life. His giggles, his falls, his tears, and his calls. His smile, his scream, his face messy with ice cream. The moments that many parents take for granted, I cherish because I dont know if I will get to be there for the next wonderful moment. No, Im not terminal, but I am often wheelchair bound, stuck in bed, pushing down pain that I would not wish on my worst enemy and I miss things. I miss his first sentence. I miss his first steps. I miss kissing his boo-boos and wishing him goodnight. But Kratom changed that. I get to see him run. I get to run with him. I get to take him to the park and the zoo and all the other places he loves to be. I can be the mother this amazing little boy deserves. \nI am a better student. I can attend classes, stay awake, pay attention. The goals and dreams that were always just out of reach before are now in my hands. I graduate in 10 days. It is just my associates but a few months ago? I was on the verge of dropping out. I listened with all my might but still could not hear what the professor was saying. My mind would race. My thoughts would be cloudy and strained. My eyes would be heavy. My head would start to droop. Dammit! I missed what the teacher had repeated once again. I would nod like I agreed, like I understood, like I knew what was going on, even though I didnt. Now, Im quick again. I see my old self peeking through. The me that was smart as could be and quick as a whip. Kratom did that. Kratom gives me my life back.\nI am a better friend. I am a better dog trainer. I am a better wife. I am a better daughter. Sister. Mother. Teacher. Leader. Motivator. A rock. A foundation. A glimmer of hope to those still fighting demons of their own. Im a light in the dark, a hand to hold onto. I am Kratom. Kratom is me. Please dont make me into something Im not.  Im not a criminal, a convict, a dealer, or a troublemaker. I just want to live the life that so many others take for granted. I am a mother. I am a student. I am a friend. I am a teacher.

Kratom is a member of the coffee tree family and similarly mild in effect. If the scheduling were to succeed, the Kratom plant would be rendered a Schedule 1 controlled substance with no medicinal value, lumped in with devastating hard drugs like heroin. That is very far from the truth. Kratom has a long history of medicinal uses and continues to help millions of people today, including myself! It is a fantastic remedy for a plethora of ailments, ranging from physical, as well as psychological, conditions including chronic pain, anxiety, depression, PTSD, but maybe most strikingly, it is a miracle remedy for opiate addiction- an epidemic in our country currently. Ive personally been diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which are emotionally crippling conditions in themselves. It has affected my family relationships, jobs, and every aspect of my life, which certainly contributes to being partial to opiates. Ive tried many medications but Ive found a system that works. Kratom is a prime factor in my psychological health, but its not just my emotional health that benefits from kratom, as Ill explain. A major concern of mine is that we would be losing out on future research of this versatile plant and I and many others will lose their saving grace. There have already been studies determining that kratom is an effective painkiller without the potentially deadly respiratory-depression that comes along with opioid medications (such as OxyContin, Dilaudid, etc), the main culprit in overdoses everyday.  People are unnecessarily dying and there is a better option that deserves our attention.\n\tSeveral years ago, while playing with my little girl I injured my back. It was the most excruciating pain Ive ever felt in my life. I had to be carried down the stairs and into the hospital and ended up having to use a walker to assist me for the following weeks. They initially gave me Fentanyl in the E.R. followed by other medications including Vicodin and muscle relaxers. Eventually, I developed a dependence to using opiate drugs. It began to affect my ability to work and to interact with my family. It was like my daughter didnt know who I was anymore. Once I knew I had to stop using these drugs, I looked to treatment programs like methadone clinics and Suboxone doctors. These prescribed substitute drugs were as difficult, if not more so, to become abstinent from than the original meds! If the meds werent available, I looked to street drugs. After trying rehab and still desperate for an answer, I began to search the internet and found that some people had positive results with some kind of tea-like leaf called Kratom. After picking some up from a local shop, I made the decision to try it instead of the synthetic alternatives with their myriad of side-effects, including drowsiness and being emotionally distant to my friends and family. The effects were nearly imperceptible but I realized I didnt feel the usual withdraw symptoms like I did when attending opioid maintenance programs. I needed less and less Kratom daily and in a relatively short period of time, I wasnt dependent on any chemicals, whatsoever! Somehow this herbal powder gave me my freedom back and made me feel normal without prolonged withdrawal effects. Now, I do not use any opiates or other drugs and its thanks to kratom. Kratom was virtually free of side effects and very mild, similar to other herbal supplements you can obtain at the grocery store.  Unlike other over-the-counter meds like Aspirin, ibuprofen or Tylenol, kratom doesnt cause any issues with the stomach or liver. I honestly dont know where my life would be at had I not found it. It saved me.\n\tWith the opiate/opioid epidemic sweeping our country and overdoses ever-rising, we need a safe alternative to pharmaceutical painkillers and Kratom is that better option. Im certain opiate use and overdoses will continue to rise even higher if a ban is placed on Kratom and even I, might become a casualty. With a job, daughter, and family that needs me, I know the standard of my life wont be the same without kratom. I humbly ask you to reconsider the scheduling of kratom.\n\tThank you so much for taking the time to hear my story!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13763","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin White","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Sir or Madam:\n\nAs a professional who treats individuals with substance abuse problems and co-occurring mental illnesses, it is rare for me to support non-research-based treatments or supplements.  While I do not recommend kratom for my patients at this point, I have, recently tried it in order to manage my own chronic migraine pain, and to good effect.  \n\nI am a true cynic, but with cautious and self-educated use (as much as is possible with limited research), I have been able to significantly manage the pain of chronic migraine days (8-14 days/month) without resorting nearly as often to hydrocodone or other Schedule 1 painkillers I previously used.  This allows me to be a contributing member of society, not home in bed sedated as with the opiates I used to take, and the phernegan it took to keep them down.  I am a law-abiding citizen, and do not use alcohol or drugs for recreation.  Should kratom become illegal I will no longer use it, and return to the medications prescribed by my physician.\n\nIt would also more easily allow the needed medical research to be done to further focus on the specific chemicals in kratom that work to develop more targeted medications.  Thus far both case study and published research http://www.cato.org/blog/addiction-problem-case-kartom indicates it does NOT appear to have the same addictive potential as other narcotic drugs. \n\nThe legislation, as it currently reads, would place Kratom and its alkaloids in the most severe scheduling category, schedule I.  Making this plant and its constituents schedule I, effectively makes it impossible for legitimate researchers to discover and develop valuable medicines from Kratom that could benefit the lives of millions, and possibly replace the much-more-deadly opium-based drugs.\n\nLike almost all supplements, avid promoters would have you believe it is a panacea.  I am sure it is not.  However, it appears to have benefit in treatment of pain, drug (legal or other) withdrawal, and possible immuno-modulation properties. A brief search in any scholarly database will present hundreds of peer reviewed studies and clinical trials that can attest to the medical POTENTIAL of this plant.\n\nOf course there are side effects, and again I note that making it a Shedule 1 drug will eliminate the ability to effectively and readily explore the risks as well as the benefits of this substance and it's active substrates.\n\nWith the opiate crisis, I understand the desire to clamp down on anything that could possibly add to those terribly sad deaths.  Not having safe and legal ways to manage chronic pain are what have driven many to illegal street drugs and subsequent death.  \n\nA more reasonable and thoughtful approach to kratom could certainly be developed than slamming it into Schedule 1 without exploring the possible benefits. Please re-consider placing this plant in the most severe scheduling category and consider reasonable legislation that would allow for those over age 18 to use it, perhaps as marijuana has been legalized, taxed, and monitored for quality in several states. This is not a substance that needs to have a war declared on it; but one that can be safely studied and utilized by the medical community.\n\nThank you for your consideration,\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23093","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"TK Locker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, my name is Michael and I am 36 years old.  I work in the solar energy field here in Seattle, WA  (I know right? Of all places Seattle lol), but there are lots of aware and green minded people who live here that support renewable energies and believe it or not we get a good amount of sun here and the solar energy business thrives often.  I digress, as i've come to comment against the kratom ban.  Kratom is simply one of the most amazing plants on this planet, especially for the human species, and it needs to be studied.  The people on this planet have spoken about so many positive things regarding this plant.  I personally have suffered from chronic depression for most of my life, since my  teenage years.  I thought I just had a bleak outlook on life but come to find that it was a natural chemical imbalance in my brain. I've always looked for things to help with it and have hardly found anything to help take the darkness away.  Doctors have prescribed me medication but I've always refused to buy and take it.  I don't want to be a drone as I want to experience my emotions and reality still as a human being, not someone under a chemical guise. A few years ago I found this natural plant known as Kratom, and found that it helps take away that bleak and dark outlook in my life. So much, that I find it is the best thing for me daily instead of any pharmaceutical that is created in a lab.  When I use it, it changes my mood from unhappy to being mostly smiles and a productive, aware member of this human race.  I simply love plants and natural things, being that I'm into renewable energies and living as green and aware as possible in this day of age.  I recycle and compost avidly, I try not to waste things, I try to only use chemical-free and natural products.  I try to only eat organically (especially my fruits and veggies), and try to stay away from plastic.  As you see I'm an aware person with a responsibility to help this planet that humans have hurt although I know that in the same effect that we're the solution.   One step is by helping to keep this plant legal and available to all who chose to use it, especially for those who it helps with deep issues.  I have stopped using it many, many times although the depression always comes back eventually.  If there is something that can aid human beings in producing a good mood, productivity and being kind and helpful to others, well from experience I can say that this is it.  It is simply one step up from coffee and is nowhere near that of any schedule 1 substance (in fact light years away).

In the years since that first kratom consumption I have earned back my role in my family, and the friends I had lost wanted to talk to me again.  I have begun attending classes again and have a great job.  I wake up every day and feel immense gratitude for Kratom, until the end of August.

Im a 44 year old woman living in Powell, Ohio.  I would like to give you a brief history about myself.  Im a college graduate and I have been a law abiding citizen my entire life.  I was in media for almost 20 years and was successful in my career.  I was a very active person, paid my taxes and paid into the Social Security system.  Then, in 2010 my life as I knew it ended when I became ill with the Epstein-Barr virus, psoriatic arthritis and Chronic Lyme Disease, just to name a few of my ailments.  I had to leave my job.  I spent the next four years in and out of doctors offices.  None of my ailments can be cured; only treated.  And I cant treat my psoriatic arthritis because of my Chronic Lyme Disease.  Ive accumulated large amounts of medical debt that I simply couldnt pay because I had no income.  The one doctor I had to see every month was my pain specialist who prescribed me large doses of opiates.  I didnt want to be on opioid medications but they helped me get out of bed and do the very basic chores of bathing and feeding myself and kept me from committing suicide.  Im not trying to be dramatic when I share that information but if youve ever suffered from chronic pain, you are aware of how absolutely depressing it is to live with constant pain. Especially when you have no hope of ever being cured.  All I can do is treat the symptoms and take one day at a time.  Add to being depressed from my illnesses, I wasnt proud of taking pain medications.  Pharmacists and doctors treated me like I was an addict just looking for a fix.  And I was raised in a very conservative family and had very conservative ideas about myself, my life and my work.\n\nIn October of 2015, I had to make the choice of giving up my pain management doctor.  His office visits and the costs of my prescriptions became too much.  It was costing me about $1,000. per month.  I knew I was going to begin a very ugly withdrawal when my body stopped receiving the medication.  I panicked.  I called all of my other doctors and explained the situation but they either wouldnt or couldnt help me.  As Ive found out over the years, there arent many doctors who want the repercussions from our government/DEA from helping chronic pain patients by prescribing opiate pain medications.  Its a shame but its the reality of the situation.\n\nMy next step was getting myself into a drug treatment/rehabilitation facility.  The waiting list at that time was months.  Like 3-4 months.  Unless I had approximately $4,000. to pay upfront for a private facility, which, of course, I did not.  I wasnt thrilled at the idea of going to a rehabilitation facility because there they take their patients who are addicted to one drug and get them addicted to another drug (Suboxone, etc), but I was terrified to go though the withdrawals which Ive heard can be life threatening.\n\nWith the possibility of a rehabilitation facility gone, my only choice left was to buy pain medication from drug dealers or start using heroin, a much less expensive option.  Then, a nurse from one of my doctors office told me about Kratom.  She had a friend that used it to kick her heroin habit.  She told me it was completely natural and convinced me to try it.  I truly believe God sent me an angel in that nurse.  Ive been off opiates since November of 2015 and am doing better than I had ever hoped.  Mentally Im fantastic and Im even working a little more, which is fantastic as Ive been denied SSD twice.  Before you make a decision to make Kratom an illegal drug, I want you to consider a few points:\n\n1)\tKratom is safe.  Its virtually impossible to overdose on it.  Unlike heroin or opiates, the more you take does not equal a better high.  In fact, Kratom doesnt make me high at all.  It is not a danger to our citizens.\n2)\tThere are not enough rehabilitation facilities available for people in need.  By making Kratom illegal, you are forcing an already terrible drug epidemic to become even worse.\n3)\tThere is NO proof that Kratom is dangerous.  People around the world have been using it for centuries, if not thousands of years.\n4)\tKratom is the best choice for me and living with chronic pain.  There are thousands of me out there.  Dont take away a natural leaf that has helped so many with pain, PTSD, anxiety and other ailments.\n\nIn closing, thank you for your time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22479","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"JENNIFER BLAIR","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a crossfit coach and avid fitness enthusiast, I have been using organic kratom for a couple of months now and I must say the benefits are impressive.

Please tell me that you are comfortable banning kratom while you know caffeine overdose has the ability to make a mans heart swell to about 10 times its natural size and attempt to petrude out of his skin.

It is my opinion that no plant should be banned from public use, for any purpose, without clear and present dangers.\n\nTHC is the standard bearer for plant based hallucinogenic and pain relievers outside of Opiates.  THC is proven to be MUCH less dangerous then alcohol while significantly more dangerous then nicotine.  \n\nI have read several medical reviews and studied the chemicals and conclude that kratom is extremely dosage specific, in low doses is is essentially CAFFEINE,  in moderate dose is no more dangerous the low dose Opiates(Like cough syrup) and is equal to a high dose of THC or a little more active in extremely high doses.\n\nIt seems to me it would be VERY easy to develop intoxication level tests for and set proper usage requirements for this drug, rather then ban it outright. Since one would practically have to be industrially refining it to get enough purity to make regularly doses able to get them high enough to become a danger to others and there is no known instance of permanent damage of death due to an over dose then I can find, there is no EARTHLY REASON TO BAN IT.  This makes abuse of kratom no worse then alcohol at its worst , and significantly better then such in normal use situations and probably even below THC, which is proven to be less harmful then either Alcohol or Benadryall to public safety.\n\nI'd implore the DEA to develop better testing and regulations geared toward DUI reform, rather then witch hunting drugs for the pharmaceutical industry.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3891","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daryl Kiddey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not take this vital medication from me.

As a criminal defense attorney I have seen dozens of clients who have used Kratom for pain management and also to help defeat an opiate addiction. The adverse effects of Kratom are minimal to say the least. The advantages outweigh any side effects associated with Kratom ten fold. I can also attest that Kratom is not a potent high. The effects are similar to coffee. I, myself, have tried Kratom for the pain associated with disk compressions I live with. It helped with the pain somewhat and I can tell you there was no feeling that would even come close to that of any controlled substance or legal opiate. Those that claim they get an opiate like high from Kratom are either taking something else with the Kratom or are simply fabricating a falsehood for whatever hidden agenda they are perpetuating. If Kratom where scheduled as a controlled substance you will see a rise in the already out of control opiate epidemic. I can only assume the big pharmaceutical companies are driving the false narrative about Kratom and the effects associated with its consumption.

I am a 38 year old husband, father of two, and small business owner.  I am a hard working, tax paying, honest and reliable person.  I also vehemently oppose the idea of making Kratom a schedule 1 controlled substance.  I understand your desire to protect the public, but as a six year user of Kratom and as a productive and hard working person, I can tell you that this ban would cause much more harm, than good.  I began taking Kratom after doing research to find alternative to my prescription anti anxiety and depression medications.  The pills I was on made me functional, but I was still an enormously unhappy person.  The prescription medication came with a laundry list of negative sides effects.  Side effects that were DRASTICALLY and negatively affecting my personal life.  During my research I found Kratom.  I ordered some, tried it, and I can say that my life improved immediately and drastically.  Over a short period of time, I was able to get off of my prescription drugs and ALL of the negative side effects of those drugs subsided in a short time.  I enjoy my life now!  I haven't considered suicide since starting Kratom, but did frequently and seriously beforehand.  I honestly fear for my well being if Kratom were to be made illlegal.  Please!!!  Consider carefully what you are contemplating.  Their are many others like me whose lives have been improved drastically from Kratom.  Please!!  Take into account all of the people who would be damaged by this decision.  Please!!  Consider that you would potentially be making criminals of millions of hard working, honest, productive people who find so many helpful benefits to Kratom.  There are so few negatives to Kratom and so many positives.  Please!!  I don't think you can fully comprehend all of the negative unintended consequences that would come from this ban.  I know you are trying to do the right thing, so PLEASE consider that the \"right thing\" may be to leave Kratom and its user alone.  \n\nThank you again for taking the time to read this!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22029","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Charles anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please conduct more research on this product before your final verdict.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11574","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin Figueroa","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi. I'm a 41 year old caregiver working with both children and elders.  I took kratom long-term, every day, in fairly high doses (1 tbs, 2-3 times a day) consistently for about 3 years.  I started taking it after hearing about it from a friend who let me try some of his.  It helped me immensely with anxiety and depression and energy level.  There were never any bad side effects.  It is both mild and effective, in my personal experience.  I always purchased the pure powder in bulk form from trusted sources, just like an herbal tea.  My family supported me in taking this supplement because they could see that it helped me.\n\nMy kratom consumption never interfered with my work, my relationships, or my stability.  On the contrary,  it helped me to be healthier and higher functioning, better able to do my job.  \n\nThe only reason I have stopped taking kratom is because I am trying to conceive and I am being extra cautious.  Quitting kratom was easier than quitting coffee, and I stopped taking it 3 months ago and have no cravings of any kind.  I'd like to have the option to take it in the future if I need to.  Alternatives (pharmaceuticals) have never worked as well for my mental health with as few side effects or dangers.\n\nKratom has been used medicinally in Southeast Asia for thousands of years and has proven in that long period of time to be generally benign.  It helps so many people with chronic pain.  It does not cause respiratory depression or death. At most, it causes nausea/vomiting if someone takes too much (although this has never happened to me).  \n\nIf it is made illegal, it seems to me that it would purely be a political move, not one to help people.  Do we really need to further the failed drug war over a mild herbal medicine?  In states where kratom has been banned, opiate use has gone up.  People have died as a result.  If you truly want to protect people, protect this plant as a natural herbal medicine, available in it's pure and natural form.\n\nI ask that you keep kratom 100% legal.\nThank you for considering this comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22171","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Melanie Daniels","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and there is evidence supporting its potential as a pain reliever and opiod replacement.

I am much happier in my life, my relationships are better, my work performance has improved, and my family has commented on how my mood has improved since my first dose of kratom.

As someone who is diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety, I have been on many medications (prosaic, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Xanax, and lorazepam).  I now no longer take any of those medications.  I take Kratom twice a day and my life has improved incredibly.  It also seems to help with the arthritis I have in my shoulders.

The plant is very effective at reducing my pain without intoxicating me, and allows for a natural option juxtaposed to the addictive prescription opiate alternative. During my year of use I have not experienced any side effects from using the plant other than some minor slowing of waste movement through my bowels, but this has not really been an issue because I eat a high fiber vegan diet. I have stopped taking kratom many times throughout the period of my use and had no issue with doing so - the withdrawal effects of stopping are more mild than even caffiene withdrawal. I have also nearly stopped drinking alcohol, and quit smoking cigarettes since I started using kratom. \n\nI implore you not to take this medicine away from the people. It is a harmless plant that allows for a safe and effective alternative to the addictive prescription opiates that have  fueled the genesis of a heroin epidemic in this country. Please, follow the science in this ruling.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11699","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Matlock","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please allow more studies on the plant kratom before it's designated a schedule 1 drug.

I went through a couple more bouts of addiction before deciding to give Kratom a try.

It's not an easy cure, it's nothing like the pharms I had been taking. I still get mental  cravings but they are 100x easier to manage without the physical pain of withdrawal.

Before I started taking the Kratom, my doctor kept putting me on drugs like Abilify, Prozac, and Paxil. The Abilify gave me muscle spasms so bad that my body would lock up into one position and I could not hardly move. The Prozac made me black out and do things I do not remember doing. The Paxil just put me in a daze all of the time. Kratom was a great solution for me at the time when I needed it for my anxiety and depression.\n     Now that I no longer need it for depression, I use it sparingly to treat menstrual cramps. It works VERY well. Ibuprofen barely takes the edge off of the pain. When I get the cramps, the pain radiates through my back and down my legs. Kratom makes the pain GO AWAY. Then instead of laying in bed feeling sorry for myself all day, I can get back to work. I feel like Kratom is a great herbal supplement that can be used to treat many ailments. It also has very few negative side effects that I have noticed. The only negative thing I have noticed about it is that if you are too tired when you take it, it will make you cranky. That is not a very profound negative side effect to me.\n    I think Kratom should be researched to determine what effects it might have on other medications. It should also be studied to see if it poses a risk to pregnant women and their unborn children. Kratom is just misunderstood due to the blatant lack of research that has been done on this helpful herb.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21421","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kayla Ponder","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have not myself taken Kratom, but the plant does show much potential for being a useful drug.

That accident did nothing but deepen my depression and create a heavy dependance on opiates. I have been a welder/fabricator for 27 years. Having experienced long term use of opiate base painkillers, I am very wary of similar substances for the simple fact that I had such a difficult time getting off of them the first time. Too many times in the past 2 decades have I found myself at the \"end of my rope\" and was physically and emotionally distraught. This plant has made my life imeasurably more manageable, from an emotional stand point I can see light at the end of my tunnel and no longer feel as if I've taken the worlds guilt and placed it on my own shoulders. For those of us that need such medications there is little in the way of alternatives when it comes to chronic pain and clinical depression. I have just recently been in a severe car accident and without Kratom I would not be the functioning member of society that I am.

My personal story with kratom is simple. I am 68 years old and have worked as a professor in my various fields of expertise (physics, anthropology, mathematics, computer programming) for over 20 years. I also write programming textbooks that have been published by a major company (Pearson). Between full time teaching at a public college in Gainesville, Florida and writing or editing, I work long hours to improve the quality of life for anyone who wants to get an education. \n\nI have used kratom for the past three years much as I used coffee or tea in the past. It certainly does not get me high but it brings me back into focus throughout the day. Before I found kratom, I would sip coffee or tea. Both of those caused stomach problems. Not only does kratom give me a mild stimulus when I need it, but I have found that my stomach problems disappeared. \n\nThis is a plant that simply cannot be used to excess. It is not any more addictive than coffee because the effects are based on the alkaloids in the plant, relatives to the same alkaloids in coffee. I have heard that kratom has other medicinal properties. Perhaps research might show how it worked to calm my nervous stomach and that would certainly benefit a large portion of the population. But, with this ban, that research may never happen. \n\nI also worry that this ban may set a precedence. Ginseng is grown in many places throughout the country and is used by many for its reputed health and medicinal properties. If kratom, another natural substance that also has been used, without any bad effects, for ages, can be banned, what is next? This proposed ban seems to have the mark of Big Pharma behind it. Pharmaceutical companies have the most to lose if people use a natural substance like kratom in lieu of one of the numerous drugs presently on the market. \n\nI dont take any prescribed medicine. In fact, I dont drink alcohol at all, not because I find it intrinsically evil, but because it makes me feel sleepy and I dislike that feeling. The one thing that I do is sip kratom tea and it makes me more, not less, effective as a contributing member of society. I would be very upset to learn that this natural plant which has no bad side effects, is not addictive, has a low cost, and has helped so many people is going to be banned.  I hope you will listen to my plea and that of the hundreds of others who write to you and urge a call to prevent this ban.

Three years ago, tired of taking three medications (gabapentin, Horizant, and tizanidine) that only partially aided in my RLS relief, I tried kratom for the first time.  It took a week or so to get the dosage correct, but once the appropriate dosage was found, it has been a life saver.  Not only does it remove my RLS symptoms, it also helps me relax and get to sleep easier.  I've also taken Ambien, Sonata, Lunesta, etc. for sleep assistance, and kratom easily helps the most.  Without this plant, I'm back to taking a handful of pills two to three times everyday, only to be provided with minimal relief.  As an added bonus, kratom has also helped manage the chronic leg pain I was feeling (which I believe was a result of the RLS, but could be unrelated).  Because of the results I'm getting from kratom, my neurologist is also testing this plant out on other patients who have had little relief with current RLS medications.  With any luck this plant will be as much of a godsend to them as it was to me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0023","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chase Jordan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"See attached file(s)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6206","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It's time to decriminalize and change the classification on cannabis","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10344","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carl Cook","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is more responsible to conduct proper research for any substance that is completely natural to ensure that informed decisions are being made in its regards based on facts, not myth.

I am a 34-year-old mother of three children under 12 and part-time server. I suffer from clinical depression and chronic fatigue syndrome. I have chosen to occasionally and responsibly consume Kratom tea a few times each week, for the last few years. I believe it has helped me in many ways. For instance, after a cup of tea, I feel energized (without the usual jitters I get from caffeine, which, by the way, can the American people look forward to ban on coffee beans also in the near future? I can't see how that's any different...) and I feel that it also helps improve my mood. These benefits help me not only be a better mother, but a more productive member of society in general. Some days, I haven't felt I had the strength to get out of bed, but on those days I know I can go to the cabinet and make a cup of Kratom and it may (and always does seem to!) help. \n\nI use many different botanical supplements (as is my right, as well as any other human on the planet. I believe plants are alongside us on this earth for our use and who is anyone to tell another they may not use a certain plant without punishment from the law?) such as echinacea when I need to boost my immune system or alfalfa when I had a bleeding condition or prunes when I'm constipated. This is my choice and it is not harming or even  affecting anyone else (except my family, I suppose, who would have to deal with me without the help of the remedies I choose to use!). \n\nI could go on and on, to be sure, but all I really want to say is, PLEASE  reconsider following through with your proposed ban on mitragyna speciosa! As I enter my comment here, I see that I'm joining the nearly 12,000 other commenters (and counting!). It's terribly sad to think that this many people could soon have something taken away that is so valuable to them, or worse yet, be criminalized as soon as it becomes banned! Thank you for your time and I wish you the best as you consider what's best for the American people and the system (and the COUNTLESS cases of people who have used Kratom as a way to get off of dangerous narcotics as we stare into the face of a huge and UGLY opioid epidemic that is killing nearly 50,000 people per year, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine) and overturn this ridiculous decision to ban a plant that's been an asset to humankind for over 2000 years!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19858","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 32 year-old white male living in California. I have an Ivy League degree and work in process development in the bio-pharmaceutical industry. I have taken kratom since 2014. These comments are abridged with much concerning the pharmacology of kratom removed as potential trade knowledge.\n\nIn 2013 I suffered a traumatic crush injury on my left leg that resulted in rhabdomyolysis, muscular atrophy, full paralysis and a necrotic sciatic nerve. For pain during physical rehabilitation I was prescribed morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl (in succession). After about 18 months, I decided the pain was less severe than the side effects of the drugs and tapered off all opioids. \n\nVery soon I was suffering from opioid withdrawal, chronic moderate intensity pain due to my limb dysfunction and depression due to my situation. At this point I discovered kratom. It appealed to me because it was derived from a plant, was freely available, and was described as \"mild\" a \"partial-opiate agonist\" and for help with \"opiate withdrawal and chronic pain.\"\n\nI started taking prepared capsules at the amount of ~ 4.5g / dose. I found that these doses lasted around 6 hours, which brought my average daily consumption to between 12-14g. At these levels, both the withdrawal from fentanyl patches and the residual pain in my leg were alleviated. \n\nAt the daily doses I was taking there were several side effects: nausea, pain in the abdominal area, vomiting, itching, stimulation, anxiety, sleeplessness and abnormal thought patterns. The negative side effects are dose-dependent and are not necessarily typical opioid side effects. It is not clear which side effects are due to the preparation (nausea and abdominal pain could be caused by the physical consumption of 14g indigestible plant matter daily) and which are due to (un)desirable active alkaloids or other causes.\n\nI found that it was almost impossible to sleep, except at night, when taking kratom. This is the exact opposite of the situation with traditional opiates, where one struggles to stay awake. Again, it is not known if this effect is common, and whether it is due to one of the putative active alkaloids or to one or more of the dozens of other alkaloids present in plant matter. Although I felt that the transit in my GI tract was slower while taking kratom, I did not experience constipation. \n\nAt no point in my two years taking kratom have I felt that I was slipping into unconsciousness unintentionally or struggling to breathe. In the instances that I have \"overdosed\" on kratom, the most severe effects were anxiety, slightly elevated heart rate and palpitation, nausea, vomiting and over-stimulation. This side effect profile is closer to that of caffeine than morphine. Only once, after about a year of taking kratom on a daily basis, were side effects bad enough to seek a doctor. I went in for abdominal pain, was told to take less kratom, drink water and take more exercise. These interventions were effective. I also had a blood panel done which showed no elevated liver enzyme levels. \n\nWhen I heard that kratom was about to be scheduled, I decided to stop taking it. I was extraordinarily fearful of a severe withdrawal syndrome because I had been using it in place of fentanyl. I did a taper over three weeks. The withdrawal syndrome was very mild and more psychological than physical. It was harder to taper off Prozac than to taper off kratom. A month after stopping use, I would state that there has been no long-term after-effects.\n\nAs a substitute for opioids and as a treatment for chronic pain and depression, I believe there is substantial evidence that kratom or its active ingredients are effective.\n\nI support regulation regarding GMP manufacture, sourcing, purity and warning labels for kratom. I believe that the powdered plant matter should not be extracted or compounded and should be regulated as a supplement rather than a drug. I also believe sale should be limited to 21+. I believe that it can be habit forming. I also believe that it is a viable, inexpensive and relatively safe substitute for much harder, more addictive and dangerous drugs.\n\nI believe there is potential for the development of pharmaceutical derivatives, which would fall under DEA scheduling requirements. Being in the pharmaceutical industry, I am highly enthusiastic for all new candidate drugs that emerge for intractable problems - such as opioid addiction. I would like to see the potential of this substance developed, rather than destroyed. The DEA and the FDA should work together to ensure a workable solution, including the AKA and other pharma industry representatives.\n\nThank you for you time.

The anxiety makes it very difficult for me at times to be the husband, and father, and friend that I would like to be. I have been seeing a psychiatric doctor for this for a few years and she has tried many different pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments on me. Every treatment we have tried could be described as temporary at best.\n\nI first tried Kratom about 7 months ago. Initially I was just looking for something that would boost my energy level like caffeine, but without the anxiety that caffeine exasperate in me. Instead what I found was a plant that has been nothing short of miraculous. What I found is something that has significantly helped my anxiety with no apparent downside. I take what is considered to be a very low dose between one and three times per day. My dose never escalates. I have experienced zero side effects from Kratom and have had zero negative health consequences. My wife says that since I found Kratom, I now remind her of the man that I was when she first met me (before the chronic anxiety). When I told my children that the DEA was trying to prevent their dad from taking the medicine that helps me to be the dad I want to be everyday, they asked me if that meant I was going to go back to being mean. \n\nThat is my personal Kratom story. I have to say, the wording the DEA used when they rescinded the emergency ban makes it sound like they are going to heavily weigh their decision on the results of the FDA's study, and place very little weight on the thousands of personal comments from people like me.  I certainly hope that the DEA puts more weight into the personal testimonies of the people that actually use Kratom. The DEA is requesting that the FDA merely determine if Kratom has any medicinal value and any risk for abuse. The irony is that the method by which they measure medicinal value requires billions of dollars and many years of research. Kratom will never have these financial resources because only the pharmaceutical giants can afford the expense required to obtain FDA approval. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical giants can't recover these costs from the ailing Kratom user because Kratom is a plant. They very well can't file a patent on a plant like Kratom and then gouge us to recover the cost. \n\nIt's an impossible test that the DEA and FDA has decided Kratom must pass. Kratom must essentially prove that it has zero downside to go along with all it's obvious upsides. All reward and zero risk is what the test requires to pass. The marketed drugs are NOT judged by this standard. Even if Kratom does pass the test of 100% benefit and zero risk, the DEA or FDA would still have to ban Kratom because otherwise it would put the pharmaceutical industry out of business. These big pharma companies are in the process of making billions of dollars selling drugs like opiates that kill 29,000 people a year (2014). They couldn't compete against a truly safe and truly effective plant like Kratom. \n\nWe could also talk about the generations old racially originated failed war on drugs, and prison overcrowding by non-violent drug offenders, and for profit private prisons, and being the land of the free yet having the most prisoners per capita of any nation, and the big pharmaceutical companies fighting with huge sums of money to oppose natural safe effective alternatives to their high cost dangerous drugs, and the ridiculousness of placing safe effective plants with very little risk of abuse and high medical use like marijuana in a less restrictive drug category than crystal meth! We could talk about why drugs like alcohol and nicotine and caffeine have zero medical use and a very high risk for abuse, yet none of these three are scheduled drugs according to the DEA. Caffeine and nicotine can cause fatal heart arrhythmias in people that are predisposed to that sort of thing, and alcohol in particular can be and is very lethal both in the short term and long term. \n\nAmerica is supposed to be the land of liberty and freedom, yet the government chooses to tell us what we can and can't put in our bodies. I have no problem with restricting the use of Kratom to adults of legal age and regulating it that way. But putting it on any of the controlled substance schedules will only have the effect of immediately turning hundreds of thousands of taxpaying law-abiding citizens into felons, and causing an explosion of pain and suffering and death in tens of thousands of Americans.

Beginning in 2001, a number of tragic as well as life-threatening events occurred in my life.  Without going into the details, suffice it to say that the amount of stress was intense and unyielding.  The psychological and physical effects resulted in the need to see a number of counselors and psychiatrists, and also a variety of medical doctors including general practitioners, internists, and surgeons.\n       From a psychological perspective, I was diagnosed with \"compound trauma,\" and \"anxiety disorder.\"  Every physician that I saw, albeit from a mental/emotional or physical/bodily perspective, recommended Xanax and a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI).  While I could tolerate Xanax, I am one of the few people who have an extremely negative reaction to any and all of the SSRI drugs that I was prescribed.  I therefore became increasingly dependent on Xanax.\n       Over the course of a decade, the stress took its toll physically resulting in a brain tumor, fibroid tumors in my uterus, and breast cancer.  The surgeries required a concomitant number of pain medications, thus the difficulty in weaning myself off these medications became increasingly challenging.  Because Xanax was so hard to free myself of, I swore to avoid it at all costs and ultimately ended its use entirely, yet the trauma issues had by this time resulted in PTSD.\n      About three years ago a friend who was experiencing significant stress recommended Kratom powder.  I was leery due to my previous experiences with Xanax, pain medications, and SSRIs.  What a surprise to find Kratom powder efficacious in treating the anxiety disorder.  The \"recommended\" dose seems to be about 1-3 teaspoons up to 3 times a day.  I have been able to find relief by using only 1/2 teaspoon twice a day.  Although this is a small dose, it has proven a lifesaver.\n      To ensure that I was not getting physically addicted, I have stopped using Kratom a number of times with no adverse reaction: no headaches, chills, fever--in short, the type of reactions incurred when I had attempted to wean myself from traditional pharmaceutical drugs in the past.\n      Kratom is the only substance I take.  It has helped so much with anxiety and with high blood pressure that it is the only product that I need to take.  My quality of life has improved beyond what I would have been able to imagine prior to trying Kratom powder.  I am able to sleep at night, perform paying freelance work, and do volunteer work for two organizations.  The thought of going back to those pre-Kratom days is, I trust understandably, most distressing.  Ensuring its legality is extremely important to me as I fear with all of my being the thought of returning to traditional pharmaceutical remedies.\n      Thank you for your help in keeping Kratom legal.  It means so much to me.\n      With kind regards,\n      Donna Koth\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6067","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Donna Koth","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe the proposed ban of kratom should not be finalized and needs to stop. Kratom is usually not sold for human consumption but when it is used as such it provides a mild relaxed state. Upon discontinuation of the use the withdrawal effects are very mild. Kratom is never sold as an extracted chemical but rather plant material and concentrated plant material. It can not be snorted, smoked, or injected, so there is no \"rush\" of a high addicts seek. It was stated 16 people have died from it but i have only heard of one from solely kratom, Take into consideration the deaths may have been from allergic reaction which almost anything can cause. Heroin has killed countless americans and kratom has only helped addicts quit, because it alleviates some opiate withdrawal symptoms. To ban this would do nothing good for our country.\n\nMany states are adopting medical marijuana, a timeless illegal drug in the US. Why should we ban a safe herb that has only a small cult following of users who have never been influenced to harm others by the plant? On a different note; datura is a species of plant used to produce an intense dilirius state involving hallucinations, but is not banned, because essentially; banning plants is just a stupid waste of tax payer money. To hunt down something naturally occuring is an insane waste of drug enforcement funding; especially something relatively harmless. We would not ban alcohol because it can occur naturally just by leaving juice in the sun, and look at what a waste alcohol prohibiton was.

Please reconsider the scheduling of Kratom in category. Even if it means putting some regulations on it. Please do not outright ban this herb that has saved my life. I was first put on pain meds (hydrocodone) when I was 11 years old. I have been on and off them my entire life due to taking myself off of them to try to regain control over things. I was wasting away, and literally didn't care if I died really at times. Tried to overdose many times as well. The copious amounts of medications they had me on affected not only me, but the people around me too. It made all our lives a living hell. Since finding out about Kratom, its fully changed my life around. I'm able to get pain relief that I never could with pain medications. I don't get over sedated, and turn into a bed zombie like the oxycontin I was on. This herb is helping hundreds of thousands to kick the opiate addiction as well. If Kratom is banned its going to cause an epidemic of people returning to street level drugs, or prescribed by doctors. I work full time now, 60+ hours a week with a job through the United States Govt. I beg you to reconsider, there's no way I could ever work like I am on oxycontin or other medications like that.

However at the beginning of the year 2016 in January I began to have symptoms that could be described as a hypersensitivity centered at the base of my tongue and extending outward to include my tongue, gums, and cheeks, especially outer cheeks.\n\nAs time passed the hypersensitivity grew to what would be described as pain.  I could literally feel the facial hair of my beard growing through my skin. It felt like a thousand mosquitoes biting my face at once without stopping., I could feel my teeth touching my tongue to the back of my throat. It felt like my tongue had become swollen, almost cutting off my throat. I could feel the grainy texture of food on my tongue like sand. I did not enjoy eating anything. The grainy texture of food was discomforting I only wanted to chew and swallow to get the food down.  Eating was a chore except cold, soft ice cream.  My gums felt 'wrong' like they were rotting with severe gingivitis or cancer. \n\nI shaved constantly, as much as my skin could take, brushed my teeth over and over, gargled constantly.\n\nMy dentist said he could see nothing wrong. My primary doctor said he had no idea what it could be unless it was an allergic reaction to some other medication.  My other medications I have taken many years without a problem.\n\nMy neurologist did not know what could be causing it.  He did not think it was a brain tumor but I needed to know so got an MRI taken, nothing showed up in my head that could cause these symptoms.\n\nAll this time to treat my pain I had been steadily taking over the counter pain medications.  No single OTC medication helped and I was desperate for relief so I was taking OTC pain meds every four hours around the clock, day and night.  Every four hours I would take 4 extra strength Acetaminophen, 2 to 3 naproxen sodium, and 3 Ibuprofen.  Twice a day I would take a 24 hr antacid. I knew this is more than recommended but even at this high level the OTC meds simply helped me to manage my sensation/pain.They did not remove it.  Without them I may have been screaming with just so many sensations entering my brain at once and never letting up.  I knew that these dosages would give me a bleeding ulcer, weaken my bones and ruin my liver.  Frankly, I did NOT care about the future but only wanted to make it through the day.\n\nMy primary doctor prescribed Neurontin. It helped but then stopped helping in weeks.  \n\nNo doctor could give me a diagnosis so I could not consult a pain doctor to help with the sensitivity/pain.  With no diagnosis, there was no way to treat it.  The best guess was a new side effect had happened because of some old med I had been taking for many years.  These meds are for emotional stability so I could not really play around with them without experiencing changes in my mood.  I see a psychiatrist for a bipolar condition and he could not think of any reason for these feelings in my face and did not think they were stress induced or imaginary.\n\nI was talking with an old friend and telling her of my plight.,  She recommended that I try Kratom.  She said her son had tried it for some pain symptom which it helped. My friend's son told my friend it might help her with her pains in her back and knees that takes away the quality of life.  My quality of life was ZERO.\n\nI ordered some capsules, they DID help! Actually I was pain free. This was after seven long months of living in hell.  Soon all the sensitivity was gone completely which meant the feelings of pain were gone as well!\n\nThe side effect for me was like I was also taking strong coffee. I had more motivation and energy. This was helpful as it counteracted the lack of energy my other medications created.   I researched Kratom a lot and saw a question on a website where someone asked what it was like to get \"high\" on kratom.  I laughed out loud which is something I never do, at least I only do it two or three times a year.  It was so funny though because the feeling I got could never be described as a 'high.'  There is no 'high' at least no more than coffee.I don't know why but it just seemed funny to 'me'.\n\nI urge you NOT to make this illegal.  You will be ruining MY life. Also, going to OTC meds will ruin my stomach.  This has NOT hurt me in ANY way.  Please do not hurt me yourselves by siding with companies who will lose money if a cheap pain med is found.\nPlease,","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5211","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Roy Belletete","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jayson Rohrback.

I am a father , grandfather  , conservative, church going ,voting citizen of a small  community in North East Georgia.\n\nSince the 1990s I have suffered from degenerative  spinal arthritis, stenosis and herniated disks. I was prescribed opiates at the time and quickly became addicted to them. After a few years of hellish life  as an addict  including overdosing several times , I entered a methadone program  with hope of tapering and becoming free of narcotics. Unfortunately the methadone was worse than  what I had been taking and the  clinic offered me  absolutely no help in tapering.\n\nIt took me 2 years but finally by  the Grace of God  I was able to quit methadone. Unfortunately my pain returned  ,the craving for opiates did not disappear and I struggled to remain drug free. \n \nIn searching for a better alternative to pharmaceuticals, I discovered Kratom in 2004.  By using a tea made of the crushed plant  I got the pain relief that I needed, and my craving for opiates  disappeared.\n\nI have used Kratom tea  daily since 2003  and have never experienced any adverse effects from using this plant .  I have bi yearly  medical exams including  a blood /liver tests and have never experienced  any abnormal results.\n\nOver the years I  have  quit  Kratom a couple of times for short periods. The  effects for me  were about the same as quitting caffeine.  Also, I have never overdosed on Kratom tea.\n\nI do not use Kratom in a recreational way and am saddened to see that it is seen in the same category  as synthetic pot , bath salts and other substances that are used in this way.  I am against the marketing of Kratom as a way to get high and I am opposed to the sale of Kratom to minors. \nMy concern is that if  Kratom is categorized as a Schedule 1 controlled substance many people including myself  will have to turn ( or return ) to opiate use for pain relief . I am truly frightened by this prospect.\n\nSo,  please reconsider making Kratom illegal so that Kratom users  can  continue to have access  to  safe pain  relief and research can continue with this life saving plant.\n\nSincerely ,\n\nANONYMOUS","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6454","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My kratom journey started about 3 years ago...\n\nWhen I first discovered it, I was skeptical about kratom.  I saw it being sold in counter culture shops and gas stations, similar to the way spice and \"legal\" was sold.  I thought for a while that it was another substance created* to alter the consumers mindset to become \"high\". \n\nMy how my perspective has changed since I shed the ignorance of this amazing plant.  Shortly after learning about Mitragina Speciosa's benefits and the potential it had to combat chronic pain, anxiety, and even help addicts cope with withdraws (both from heroin AND pharmaceuticals).  I had to give it a try. \n\nI had been suffering with a very addictive personality and mild scoliosis for most of my life, which at times causes my back to become inflamed with chronic pain.  During one of my painful periods, I tried some kratom as provided from a dear friend of mine who had been aware of it's potential and how to correctly use the plant.  After about 30 minutes from consuming just 3 grams of raw powdered leaf, my pain was completely gone.  Additionally, I had an unmistakable burst of energy and extreme mood enhancement.  At that moment I was sold.  \n\nI don't believe this plant should be demonized or banned, like the corrupt have done with cannabis, while allowing the real poisons, (alcohol, benzos, opiates, heroin, meth, just to name a few), to flood the streets and take countless lives in the process.  \n\nThe fact that this plant has helped AND SAVED the lives of so many people is clear enough reason to reverse the decision to ban it.  If anything should be banned, OR EVEN REGULATED, it should be the poisons used to control the populations while taking the money and the lives from so many innocent families.\n\nYou are helping to create customers, NOT cures.  The only cure is to shift back to a natural, holistic state of living along side Our Mother Earth instead of the greed-driven corporations who have managed to spread their tentacles in to every facet of OUR PLANET\n\n\"Our governments\" have created separation on a global scale over control, power, and money.  This process has drained the blood from our planet and taken countless innocent lives.  \nKratom should not be banned as it has only taken the lives of a couple handfuls of addicts who abused it's potential by mixing it with other PHARMACEUTICAL SUBSTANCES. \n\nIt's time for a shift in the agenda.\n\nI know you see the waves, tearing the illusion apart.\n\nWe the People, Are Waking Up..\n\nEither Join US for Peace, or continue the destructive revolution.\n\nJust remember, LIGHT ALWAYS CASTS OUT DARKNESS!!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22474","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"JOhn Dillon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think Kratom should stay legal.\n\nI oppose any law that prohibits responsible adults from being able to freely buy or take kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21969","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not change the law regarding kratom.

I would like to express my opposition to the schedulingn of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (AKA \"Kratom\"). I have been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a painful and debilitating, inherited condition. There is no cure for my illness and I have struggled to manage the symptoms throughout my life. About a year ago, Kratom was recommended to me as a possible treatment for pain and other ailments. It allowed me to begin living my life again without strong and addictive controlled substances. Kratom is not any more addictive than caffeine, and I can say from personal experience that using Kratom regularly does not lead to tolderance or a need for increased amounts. It also does not produce a \"high\" like prescription painkillers. Kratom has a mild, relaxing effect that is similar to drinking chamomile tea. Restricting Kratom will undoubtedly block patients with real health concerns from finding alternative treatments to opioids, including myself. Kratom has allowed me to work full-time, care for my child, and function in society. Please do not add the only thing that has truly helped my disorder to the controlled substance list.\n\nThank you,\nLaura","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13509","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"6 to 8 percocets a day....\nWhen the Feds handed down thier \"New Findings\" on the oxycontin monster they had released years ago and now were frantically trying to coral the monster back in the cage...My and all of the Local doctors\ncompletely took me off of My Percs ..couldnt find a dr.

Scheduling it as such would put it in the same category as heroin, which is a dangerous and misleading representation of this plant. While it does remain true that Kratom acts on opiod receptors, it is not the same. I have personal experience with opiods and Kratom. In May, I was in a car accident that left me in an incredible amount of pain, pain that still plagues me to this day. After the accident, my doctor prescribed me 5-mg Hydrocodone with acetaminophen, to be taken every 4 hours for pain. While it did help relieve my pain, it also gave me some horrendous side effects, such as the incapability to make complete bowel movements, irritability, and all I wanted to do was sleep. I began to find myself wanting the pills before it was \"time\" and would become increasingly angry or sad while I waited. I did not want to become another statistic, addicted to painkillers because I was genuinely in pain. So, I just tried to stop taking them. I found myself struggling to stop. I couldn't sleep, I was incredibly ill, and the depression that ensued was debilitating. That is when I was introduced to Kratom. A friend who had been in a similar (actually worse) accident than me introduced me to Kratom. The plant was a miracle in my eyes. When I drank the tea he had made, it only took 15 minutes for my back pain to subside, and I didn't notice any of the ill effects that I had from the opiods. I was not upset or totally lethargic. The first day I took Kratom was the first day I had felt human since my accident. Now I can wake up and drink this tea, go to work, and function. \nWith that being said, there is some controversy around the side effects of Kratom, which are listed on the National Institute of drug abuse's website as: sensitivity to sunburn, nausea, itching, sweating, dry mouth, constipation, increased urination, and loss of appetite. It can be seen that the side effects of Kratom do mirror those of opiods, but that those side effects do not include respiratory depression, liver damage, or death like the pills given to people every day, or the street drugs that are often turned to when the scripts run out. It cannot be denied that these side effects are present in some users, but it can be said that they are infinitely less noticeable while using Kratom vs. opiods. This is important to consider, especially when there are so many stories about people using this plant to distance themselves from opiod problems (which include heroin). It also cannot be denied that there are people who feel \"withdrawal\" from Kratom, but in every case that I have heard of the withdrawal symptoms are incredibly mild compared to someone who attempts to stop prescription opiods or heroin. In my personal experience there have been days where I either had to go without or even FORGOT to take it. Of course I would notice my pain, but no terrible symptoms like I did when I was trying to stop taking the opiods. Allowing Kratom to be easily accessible could really help with the opiod crisis. This is not just some cry from a personal user hoping to keep this plant available, but a person concerned for all the people who remain functional and clean today because of this plant.\nNow that the medical concern has been addressed, it is time to talk about some other concerns when it comes to banning this plant. This plant, a tree native to southeast Asia, provides income to the people who harvest and sell the material. The ban threatens these trees because once that source of income is ripped away from these people, they will most likely turn to palm oil and paper production. This will result in mass clearings of these forests. Withdrawing the ban will leave incentive for these people to maintain the forests. Protecting the forests is of course good for people because it keeps the air clean, oxygenated, and keeps the land from wearing away (due to the root systems), but it is also painstakingly important for the entire ecosystem. These forests that may face annihilation after the ban are also home to species such as the orangutan, elephants, and tigers. There is the argument that deforestation in these areas is illegal, but that did not stop the burning of trees in the area in 2015, when the need for money caused the people to clear land (illegally) to produce palm oil in order to supplement their income. If it happened once before, what would make anyone think that these people would not feel desperate enough to do it again if they faced another hardship when this source of income was taken from them?\nI genuinely hope for the good of the people who have found sanctuary in Kratom, for the people who have earned a living harvesting these leaves, and those endangered species, that the sale of this plant remains legal. It would be a great disservice to the world to place Kratom in the Schedule I drug classification.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8598","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nastassia Lucas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Brian, I am 38 a responsible father, son, and husband.

I have not lived a *normal* life since becoming sick. I have been bedridden at times, and I have suffered pain that no human being should be expected to live with. Doctors have been little to no help, as their only idea of a solution is to prescribe me a bunch of dangerous drugs that do nothing to help me, they only cause disastrous and frightening side effects. I think those drugs have been more harmful to me than living with a disease. When I heard about Kratom, I was excited to try it the first time. I'd heard many stories about its origination in Asia, and how the Asian people enjoy this tea all day long, and rarely get ill. I gave this tea a try and fell in love. I could drink it all day long myself. After the very first day I noticed I wasn't nearly as depressed as I usually am. Having a chronic illness causes a sadness and hopelessness I can't explain. My chronic pain was eased a lot, and I have become a happier, better person because of this beautiful plant. I have chronic insomnia and I am sleeping soundly, and it helps me similarly to the Valerian root and Melatonin supplements which I use at bedtime along with my Kratom.

He was fortunately not paralyzed, but was prescribed OxyContin at the time for the pain. As do many people, he quickly became addicted to the pills. He began abusing them and ended up in 13 year battle with a prescription drug addiction which eventually turned into a heroin addiction. \n\nA few years ago he discovered the natural herb, Kratom. Kratom helped him get completely clean from all prescription and street drugs.  During his time under the influence of addiction, he sustained several other injuries due to not being cognitive enough to make smart choices. He is now a 34 year old man with a body that feels and acts much, much older. He suffers from daily chronic pain and does need something to alleviate him from this. The pull toward prescription opiates would be too easy under these circumstances if it were not for Kratom. Kratom helps him cope with his pain in a healthy way. He is now a fully functioning person in society and finally free and happy. \n\nUnlike opiates, Kratom does not effect his cognitive behavior nor does it give him any kind of high. He is simply living pain and addiction free. There is nothing more that we could ask for in this world than happy, functioning people. I don't ever want to see him in a place where he is forced to take opiates to get through the day. \n\nPlease consider with deep thought how the decision to ban or not ban Kratom will effect thousands of people just like my husband. \nKratom saved his life. \n\nThank you, \nJessica ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0478","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jessica Earley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm 46 years old and I work at an apothecary in Austin, TX. We have multiple people come each day to get kratom. These people all claim to have been on pills or some other drugs before they found kratom. They seem much happier and healthier than people I've seen on drugs. I often hear people who have experience with chronic pain say they went from eating multiple different types of pills a day to just a little bit of kratom instead. They also tell me they don't feel physically addicted to kratom like they were with the pills. Seems like a way smarter healthier choice than having to take any pharmaceuticals. I don't need to take kratom, but I see the help it's offering people around me. We also have a lot of people who come in and take it claiming it helps their anxiety and even depression. Kratom is a great natural plant that needs to stay legal to continue to help all of these people. I believe people need to be able to practice their freedom to medicate with any of the natural God given herbs we have on this planet. Thanks for taking the time to hear out my thoughts.

Its an awful way to live. I was literally a zombie. Everything in my life revolved around my next dose. I hated myself for becoming dependent. I wanted sobriety. Methadone withdrawal is tricky. It was 3 or 4 days before the real withdrawals kicked in. It was brutal. No one knew what I was going through. Being an addict comes with a stigma. A stigma I didnt want to have dragging behind me for the rest of my life. Even now I'm somewhat paranoid that I'm going to be outed by commenting here. But I feel like I need to voice my experience. By day 3 I was really beginning to feel the withdrawals in their full glory so did a little research online and stumbled across a forum where kratom was being discussed for opiate addiction. I placed an order and had it overnighted. It helped me when I was at my worst. I still felt bad, don't get me wrong. That withdrawal was probably the hardest thing I've ever been through. But I was able to work. I was able to be around people. I was able to function like a normal human being, not like a dope sick fiend. Please pause and reflect on this. I was addicted to the very same thing that Dr's prescribe adddicts and it was awful.

We live in a world of reactionary, under-informed, and misinformed public opinion.  The internet is quick to confirm any bias you may be searching for.  There is no harm is slowly down, doing the research, and listening to what the country actually has to say.\n\nI am an MS graduate in Electromagnetics - not pharmacology or biology for sure, but I am an academic nonetheless. I have researched kratom, and I have quite a few colleagues who frequent SE Asia, where kratom can be well likened to cannabis in illegality, public stigma, as well as competition with corporate interests against actual (dangerous) opiates and opiods.\n\nI'd simply like to make a few terse points below:\n\n- There is no credible evidence that there is a viable overdose case for kratom.  The few cases available online and in the news (including the death-certificate cause case) are circumstantial, few, and in many cases multiple substances were found in usage, making it impossible to make good conclusions.  It's not possible to say \"There has never been a single case of deadly overdose,\" but it's also not possible to say that about agreed-harmless items like coffee and cheeseburgers (not to mention alcohol).\n\n- There is no argument for kratom as a gateway drug, and if anything there is the opposite argument, given kratom's opiate-like effects and proven successful tool in aiding opiate/opiod withdrawal.  This plant is arguably part of the solution, and it would be clearly in corporate interest of Pharma (and not the people) to ban it.\n\n- Possibly most-importantly, we have learned a lot from the banning (and step-wise decriminalizing and legalizing) of marijuana.  A LOT of people who are otherwise ethical and moral people were imprisoned for years (to life) for participating in a harmless trade, which provided people with something they desired, and did them, nor anyone else, any significant harm.  Additionally it undermined the legitimacy of the DEA's opinion on what was truly dangerous.  When you have harmless agents like pot (or kratom) on a list next to heroin and meth, it may cause people to think \"Well clearly this list is BS.  What other drugs on this list are actually harmless?\"\n\nAgain I applaud your effort to seek public opinion, and I hope you hold with you decision to leave kratom unscheduled.\n\nSincerely,\nDave Dieter\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4189","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"n/a","postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dave Dieter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nMy name is Matthias Witty and I am an application software developer in my late twenties employed at a rapidly growing fortune 200 company in the Health Care industry. I am writing to express my opposition to scheduling the active constituents in Kratom. I am diagnosed with ADHD and am prescribed amphetamines as treatment. This medication is effective but the negative side effects are note worthy so I sought a more natural alternative. It was in this pursuit that I found Kratom. This plant has increased the quality of my life significantly. I consume Kratom primarily as an aid to my ADHD. Amphetamines disrupt my sleep, mood, and personality...they make me feel less human. When I consume Kratom I have the energy and focus I need without the qualities I so despise in amphetamines; Kratom helps me be productive and engaged while keeping my natural personality. I feel this plant has a broad range of use with a good safety profile. It truly seems like a miracle plant.\n\nBesides the positive impact this plant has had on my own life...I have several friends with chronic pain issues whom consume Kratom to help them get through life.

The pain in my feet so excruciating the slightest pressure felt like broken glass, cutting deep into my flesh. \nTo my dismay doctor, after doctor told me there was nothing they could do. The only option being surgery, which all agreed would make it worse. Unlike the stories of many others, I did not develop an addiction to pain medication. See, not only did I lose my ability to walk without unbearable pain. I was told there was no treatment, nothing I could do other than resign myself to this new reality. \nAbandonment by my medical professionals forced me to look for an alternative. Thus, I found Kratom. I Was hesitant to try it at first. How could a supplement which derived from the coffee plant help my pain?\nAs I crawled up my stairs on my hands and knees to use the restroom I came to the conclusion I had nothing left to loose, so I placed an order.\nImmediately with my very first dose I was able to walk without excruciating agony! I was amazed! My grandmother always said God has given us a natrual way to assist us with all our issues. Just as cinnamon and honey will ease a cold. Kratom eased my agony. It has also enabled me to cope with my depression and anziety better.\nMy mind is not altered. I have never experienced any sort of euphoric high from my tea. I simply am able to cope with my cronic pain better. \nI am not addicted. I can stop drinking my tea and not feel any sort of withdrawal. What happens is the symptoms of my nerve damage which is unbearable pain comes back. In turn so does my depression and anziety. Because I am in such pain that I am unable to apply any pressure on my feet. Narcotics do not provide relief like this supplement does. They cloud your mind. Make you feel hazy and ill. They alter your emotions and are well known to be dangerously addictive. I do not want those dangerous chemicals inside my body. I do not want to face possible addiction. I simply wish to use my God given right to drink a natrual herbal tea. \nThe people who use Kratom tea as a supplement are not the young seeking a recreational drug. We are middle aged and older people who only seek a natrual suppliment to assist us with our aches and pains of age. \nIf Kratom is made into a class one drug my quality of life along with that of thousands of of others will be destroyed! Our familys as well. \nIf this action is made you will place so many healthy, active and happy people back into a misrable state of pain and addiction to dangerous narcotics.\nI implore you! Have mercy! Do not take away this herbal supplement tea which has assisted so many people with the ability to cope with their issues with pain and addiction to dangerous narcotics. \nThank you for your time. \nRespectfully,\nTeri Chapman \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7318","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-26T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Teri Chapman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please make Kratom legal...the good benefits far outweigh the bad.\nThank you.\nMary Murgo","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15154","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mary Murgo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12745","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Julie Mahdi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is safe.

I am a 38 year old male. I live in Richlands, VA and am currently an associate pastor at my church in Cedar Bluff, VA. I am also a digital marketing entrepreneur who works from home and makes a living from consulting and advertising. \n\nI think it is preposterous that the DEA has an intent to make Kratom a schedule I substance putting it into the same classification as heroin and other harmful chemicals. I oppose this intent with every fiber of my existence. \n\nI was not always an associate pastor. The reason I am appalled at our government wanting to put Kratom on the same level as heroin is because I used to abuse heroin and other narcotic opiates. \n\n14 years ago I had ran to the end of my rope. I won't bore you with the whole story, but just know that I had stolen from family members, lied, been a horrible human being to get my fix. I was shooting heroin when I could get it, snorting oxycontin and hydrocodone, roxycontin and just about anything I could get my hands on. I was a mess. My family was slowly slipping away and I couldn't do anything about it. \n\nI knew I had a problem so I went to the methadone clinics, but I was just trading one habit for another one. When I stopped the methadone it left a void and I went back to doing what I used to do. Finally, 14 years ago, my sister gave me something called Kratom. She said it would help me. I didn't believe it, but at this point I wanted to try anything to get me away from these opiates. I was withdrawing and falling into depression without self medicating.\n\nSince that first day Jennifer gave me my first dose of Kratom, I haven't even taken so much as an aspirin. Currently, I still use Kratom to regulate my diet and supplement my healthy lifestyle. Kratom allowed me to get control of my life. Without it, I doubt I would be an associate pastor today.\n\nI am no doctor or medical professional, however, I do have my own personal experience with Kratom and I can tell you that when I took Kratom it helped me. It continues to help me. Please see this article (there are many like it) www.ibtimes.com/what-kratom-federal-government-wants-ban-plant-can-cure-opioid-addiction-2430528\n\nKratom does not get me \"high\". I know what high feels like and this isn't it. But I do get happy right before I take it.\n\nIn conclusion, \n\nI would personally hate to lose the benefit of taking Kratom as a supplement for my overall well being. Just like it's cousin (coffee), like many people have relied on their cup of \"joe\" to start their day, I too love my cup of Kratom to start my day. It is an all natural herb which helps my overall well being of life. \n\nI am strongly against the DEA's (or other form of government) intent to ban Kratom. I am a law abiding citizen now. Have been for 14 years. I do not plan to break any laws or do the wrong thing, but I feel as an American citizen, we should be focusing on the real problem at hand which is the war on \"REAL\" drugs like heroin and the others I mentioned above.\n\nPlease allow scientists and doctors to test this plant on real people with real problems. I recommend test subjects who are drug abusers and people who have daily pain like fibromyalgia. People who are living in depression. Study this plant from a non-biased perspective and then make your decision on what we should do with Kratom.\n\nI wouldn't be who I am today without this plant. It has changed my life. From a drug addict who couldn't get out of the gutter to an associate pastor who is now helping other people like me get out of the gutter. Kratom works and I hope you will give it a chance to prove it to the people who are trying to take it away.\n\nSincerely,\nRichard Wade Harman","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1246","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Harman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom this may concern,\n\nMy name is Richard Warner.

Ever since that time, I've had difficulty with addiction, chronic pain, and I also have arthritis due to the accident. The pain is crippling. I have also been a victim of being prescribed interacting medications, that had a moderate interaction level together, which neither the doctor nor pharmacist had notified me about. As a result of the two prescriptions being administered together, I suffered a seizure, which caused me to dislocate my left shoulder. Ever since that incident, I have had chronic pain and limited mobility in that arm. It is often very painful, and is subject to dislocate frequently, which sometimes is the case. I'm feeling much better now about it, but ultimately will need surgery, before it will be completely normal again. As a result of this incident, I also have calcific tendinitis in my left shoulder, which also causes pain and severe discomfort.\n\nAt any rate, I was prescribed many different drugs, anti-depressants, narcotics, benzodiazepines, anti-seizure medications, and painkillers over the years. I was lethargic. I was in a constant fog. I couldn't remember what I had for dinner the night before. I was prescribed so many mind-altering drugs, I didn't even know what was going on, half of the time. I heard about kratom, started taking it, and I noticed a huge difference in my life as a result. I also have successfully taken myself off of all prescription medications, gradually, and safely. I now take kratom as needed, instead, which sharpens my mind, eases my physical pains, and gives me my energy and my life back. I'm very active now, and have really taken control of my life. My family and friends noticed I'm happier, healthier, and nearly pain-free. Kratom has helped me immensely through these difficult times. The best part about kratom, is that I can stop taking it at any time, just like you can stop drinking coffee at any time. I don't have to take it all of the time. I take it only as needed, and haven't noticed any withdrawal symptoms other than feeling a little tired for a couple of days, much like when you stop drinking coffee. I used to be an avid coffee drinker, so I know how it feels to go a day without coffee, when you're using it everyday. Thanks to kratom, I'm back in control of my life, and feel better than ever! Kratom has helped so many people like me. All of my friends have tried it, and speak very highly of it. I won't even take Tylenol or Motrin anymore, because kratom is all-natural, and safe when used responsibly. I believe a lot of traditional medicinal cures and herbal supplements go unrecognized in society, because some of them are indeed very helpful. It doesn't produce a high, but gives your mind a \"boost,\" much like a great cup of coffee, with perhaps a splash of espresso in it. At work, I am solving more Information Technology problems than ever before, and have really made an improvement in my work life. I feel like a brand new person!\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you took my comments into consideration, as you move forward with investigating kratom. Please keep it legal for me to use, and also for those of us Americans that use it, as it is very helpful and much safer compared to synthetic, and even prescription alternatives. I don't know a single person who kratom has not helped. I'd like to see more suppliers who have consistently pure product, with no synthetic materials or fillers. There are a few pure online vendors, but they are sometimes hard to find. I think that good companies with pure product should be more available to the consumers who are looking to use it. I'm very passionate about this, and hope that it remains available to those who use it. It would really mean a lot to me if it remains legal and available. I don't want to go back to my old life of addiction to prescription medications, and utter misery. Those were the darkest days of my life; and kratom was the light at the end of my tunnel.\n\nThank you very much for your time. I greatly appreciate it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20800","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Warner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi I'm Trevor!

I'm a 69-year old woman from Portland, Oregon, an IT professional retired from a large medical provider, and former small business owner.\n\nI would like to voice my opposition to the DEAs Intent to Schedule the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, which would make Kratom (Mitragynaspeciosa), a Schedule I controlled substance with no medicinal value. This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\nI personally do not use kratom, but I have a number of relatives who suffer from very serious chronic pain who do.  It is the only thing they have found that enables them to live a normal life.  Some of these relatives work on my farm and are essential to my living here.  I am afraid that I will have to sell the farm after kratom becomes illegal because I cannot run it alone and help from relatives is the only way I can keep it going. \n\nMy relatives suffer chronic pain due to autoimmune conditions and vehicle accidents.  One person in particular has seen numerous doctors over the last 10 - 15 years and was prescribed opiods such as oxycodone.  Due to these prescriptions they had become unable to live a normal life.  In particular they had no energy or motivation to do anything.  After stopping all prescribed pain medications and starting kratom several years ago, they have been able to stay off the medications they were previously addicted to.\n\nKratom has given my relatives their lives back.  They can work at physical jobs and thus support their families.  Some have gone back to school for advanced degrees.  Rather than killing motivation as opiods do, kratom gives people a mood lift (not a high).  From our experience it is as dangerous as coffee.  In fact many of the things the DEA says about kratom can also be said of its relative, coffee.  I doubt anyone would say we should ban coffee because it is \"herbal speed\" and I find it extremely misleading to call kratom \"herbal heroin\".\n\nI believe kratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed many lives.  I fear this emergency action will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic. I know that my relatives' quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16266","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marlene Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has saved my life as with many of my friends. 2 years ago I was homeless and addicted to heroin. I started like most people did with a car accident and scripts from my doctor for the pain. The progression of the disease is real and I never thought it could happen to me. I had ruined my life, lost my job, was no longer a productive member of society. \n\nWhile on some forum boards for opiate addiction, I started to read about kratom. I was hesitant at first but it was my only hope. It has kept me off heroin for two years now. I have a great job, pay taxes, and participate in local town meetings. I would not be where I am if it wasn't for kratom. In rehab, they wanted to give me suboxone or methadone but those can be even worse than narcotics in many ways. I no longer take kratom, but if you take this away from American's in general, then it's almost a given that more people will die from heroin withdrawals and go right back into a depraved lifestyle. \n\nKratom never got me high like opiates normally do, but it eased my mind, helped me stop thinking about getting high. If anything, regulate it and make it 21+ for purchasing it. Do not ban this. I have friends that were hooked up to as many opiates as they could for pain management and their lives were awful.

Historically, propaganda, government control and hysteria ruled the day.  Today, a very informed public calls on the FDA, DEA and likely the NIH to invest in the research first, before we make another 'erroneous\" scheduling error leaving millions in pain without a single dash of evidence to back the decision up.  I'm a cluster headache patient. The medication used to stop the excruciating pain was developed by Sandoz, called Sansert.  Sansert has been removed from the market place, leaving 10's of thousands of patients suffering from this debilitating sleep-pain disorder (called a headache?) to looking into the molecular properties of Sanser...which turns out to be LSD. Really?  Yes, really.  And we all know now how marijuana is a medicine, it's likely LSD and psilocybin are medicines stopping the most painful disease known to medical science&  MDMA looks promising as a medicine for PTSD.  I see the trend and I believe most Americans see it too. If we can do anything to help reduce the opioid epidemic I think we're all in. Especially if it's as simple as relaxing the research hurdles scientists now face by this current scheduling system.  Don't set us back another 50 years. Pain is subjective, yet every human being will tell you \"Yes, I know pain\". Why do we do this to one another?  It's inhumane to criminalize pain patients.

I am writing to provide my thoughts and arguments regarding the proposed ban on Mitrogynine, and 7-HydroxyMitrogynine.\n\n\n\nItem 1: \n\nTo claim a drug has no accepted medical use, as is the definition for Schedule I substances - Then why are people using it?  Please consider.\nOne might say,\n\t \"because people like getting high\". \n\t \"People slip into the dark abyss of addiction to dangerous drugs\".  \n\t\"They fall in with the wrong crowd.\"   \n\nI think this is a very limited answer.\n\n\nWhile ANY substance (water, alcohol, drugs, food, exercise, sex) has potential for 'abuse', they each have potential for healing.  \n\nPeople choose to use medicines which work for them in some manner.  They may use opioids to mediate chronic physical or emotional pain.  They may use psychedelics to explore their consciousness and find a healthier perspective for their life, just as every indigenous culture has done with psycho-active plants - with incredible results.\n\nSingle case studies of people acting inappropriately or violently are loud in the news, and quick to be pinned on 'drugs' - when the mass media never stops to consider - maybe these are experiences which would be appropriate in a particular mindset and setting?  Perhaps more acceptance and harm reduction, which DOES have scientific support, can lead to more positive and healthy outcomes at significantly lower cost?\n\nCan we fund the DEA's $3,000,000,000 budget into harm reduction?   Then the 'war on drugs' might be more like 'peace talks on drugs' and will accomplish what it PROCLAIMS to be intended for.\n\n\nItem 2: \n\nIf you really want to schedule Kratom and truly fear the plague of destruction that some illicit kratom trade creates, consider Schedule III or IV.   The DEA can still tout its own importance and keep American people safe from themselves.\n\nSchedule III definitions are given as follows (A,B,C):\n\n\tA. The drug or other substance has a potential for abuse less than the drugs or other substances in schedules I and II. \n\t\t- Mitrogynine's Nausea at high doses keeps overdose a practical impossibility.\n\n\tB. The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\n\t\t- Applying Schedule I will totally block any potential medical research for decades - Which I know is part of the charter at the DEA, but please consider the morality of this action. There are tens of thousands of positive reports of therapeutic usage already.   How many M.D.s, PhDs, and citizens must advocate its usage for a 'currently accepted medical use' to be applied?\n\n\tC. Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.\n\t\t- Some reports of long term usage indicate withdrawal periods - Much like CAFFEINE. Perhaps Caffeine should be scheduled as well?\n\n\nItem 3: \n\nBefore placing a substance into Schedule I, please consider that there are many peaceful citizens who will continue to acquire, distribute, and use it, because it is medicine for their chronic pain and opiate addictions.  Many of these people are middle-aged, gentle, productive citizens.  This scheduling gives the DEA the right to hunt them down and imprison them along with violent criminals.\n\nMany of these people are using Kratom as a much safer transition out of heroin and meth.  Many of those people WILL DIE because of this scheduling.\n\nThis scheduling gives the DEA permission to continue an archaic witch hunt.  In the Dark Ages there were healers who provided medicine, who were misunderstood, feared, and burned at the stake for being witches.  \n\nHow is life in prison is any more humane than a burning at the stake?\n\nHow on Earth have we not graduated past this insanity?\n\n\nItem 4: \n\nTo some degree, I expect that the DEA will deny the pleas of thousands of responsible users, who have received their lives back through Kratom.   I expect they will continue to cherry-pick and misrepresent the few reports of Kratom-related fatalities, such as by failing to recognize the fatal admixtures (o-desmethyltramadol - http://kratomnation.com/kratom-deaths/ , Or this case with THREE prescription meds plus alcohol: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25516573).   I expect further fear-triggered mass media reports to provide biased stories of these 'dangerous new drugs' coming from plants.   And I fully expect them to preserve their jobs and funding by maintaining an archaic, fear-based, research-void trigger-finger authority over \"the War on Drugs\".\n\nHowever I do still have hope that we can develop an America, which promotes freedom, health, understanding and support, through communication, Harm Reduction, and Science.\n\n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nPlease do not schedule Mitrogynine, or 7-HydroxyMitrogynine.  To do so would be a wasteful harm.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9470","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi!

I sustained substantial trauma to my feet and ankles. I had to undergo 3 surgeries. Now I have a steel plate and 7 screws in the heel of my left foot and no cushion between where my ankle and leg bone meet, on my right foot. I have chronic pain, Restless Leg Syndrome, and arthritis in my hips now, because of the way I walk. After my orthopedic surgeon released me, I was then referred to a pain management doctor. On my first visit, the doctor prescribed my 120 hydrocodone, 90 morphine and 120 neurotonin a month. I did what the doctors told me and, after a year, the doctor decided that I needed to see a psychiatrist. They scheduled an appointment for me the following week and, after two visits with him, I was prescribed Xanax, Seroquiel, and Paxil. Between these two doctors, I was taking 6 prescriptions. I couldn't function. I would lose days at a time. I couldn't do things with my daughter, and my memory was non-existent. I couldn't work. I was a walking zombie. I finally had had enough. I quit taking all 6 prescriptions, cold turkey, and the withdrawals were hell. I thought I was going to die, literally. I made it through the withdrawals, but the pain, anxiety, PTSD, and depression were back in full force !!! Then a friend told me about Kratom. I did my research, and ordered a few samples. Kratom saved me. Kratom gave me my life back. I now enjoy refinishing furniture, which I sell. I feel better. The pain is still there, but I am a functioning member of society now. I am happy. I feel NORMAL again. (Like I did before the wreck). Most importantly, I get to enjoy my daughter again...and she's happy to have her mom back. We laugh together, we have \"girls day out\", go shopping, get our hair done, or, sometimes, we just sit out on the porch and play with our fur babies. My daughter told me the other day, \"Iam glad your back, Mama\". I just cried and smiled and said \"I am glad I am back too\".\nDO NOT take that away from me or my daughter !!! DEA, you have no idea how many lives you are going to destroy. I have no side effects from taking Kratom. It doesn't make me high, it doesn't impair me in any way. I have gone several days without taking kratom and I have no withdrawals from it. It's kinda like having a really good cup of coffee in the morning. I am not going back to any doctors.\nI won't !!! You can't ban something that has given me my life and family back. You'll take away my freedom from something I've worked very hard to overcome, my chronic pain. I can do this with Kratom. If you take Kratom away from my family and I, you might as well put me 6 feet under, because that's what it would be for me...a death sentence. We, as Americans, have the right to make our own choices. That's what this country was built on.

Back in February of 2014 I had been prescribed suboxone for opiate addiction. I was addicted to the suboxone, but wanted to quit using it. I was unable because the withdrawals were so terrible. That is, until I discovered Kratom. I began to use Kratom as I quit using suboxone and all other opiates. The Kratom stopped my suboxone withdrawals completely, it was amazing.\nI am also in chronic pain everyday, as I have arthritis, eight bulging discs in my back, bursitis in both hips, and severe chronic pain in both of my feet when standing. The Kratom took away much of my pain. It gave me my life back. Before I was unable to live without some kind of prescription pain medicine. Now I can, as Kratom helps my chronic pain very much, and it also helps my fatigue and depression. \nIf Kratom was banned tomorrow it would substantially change my life in a bad way. Kratom is an amazing plant which has given me some kind of hope to keep moving forward in life. I am very grateful to be able to use Kratom for my chronic pain, fatigue, and depression.\nIt is foolishness to make Kratom a controlled substance. The big wigs who run the prescription drug companies are the ones who are putting money into someones pocket, so that Kratom can be banned, then they can continue to make their millions through selling there presciption pain killers, which everyone knows are dangerous to use.

Once I no longer took them, I searched for a natural homeopathic way to relieve the unbelievable pain that I had to endure every night and day! Luckily I discovered kratom! I had never heard of this, until i did my search, so I found it highly unlikely that this PLANT would even touch this pain! Well, I learned immediately that it actually works, but not only that, it works better than the meds that my day ctor had me take for all those years, AND without that 'drugged ' feeling that narcodics leave you with! I'm able to focus clearly, without pain, and take each day by storm. Please, don't take this miracle plant away from those who need pain relief without that drugged up feeling.

I am one of those people; for years I battled depression and anxiety, and turned to prescribed drugs and narcotics to help alleviate my dark thoughts and inability to function in a world that is fast-paced and unforgiving. \nLike so many others, kratom helped me overcome these debilitating illnesses, and allowed me to become the successful, ambitious man I am today. I eat well, I sleep well, I take care of myself, and I care about the life I have and those in it. It wasn't a matter of me being weak, it was a matter of finding who I am and aspire to be, which I have. So many others seek the same thing and more, and if the path that guides them to their better selves involves kratom, why is that such a bad thing? \nAny sound experiment will show kratom to be virtually harmless. I am an example myself; I used kratom for 2 years, used it as a pedastal to lift myself from the hell of my illnesses, and then discontinued use once I met my goals. I was a perfectly functional human being during my use, much more so than I before and during the doctor prescribed pills, more so than my alcoholic self, and just as much as I am now. \nI do not know the goal of the DEA's call to ban this wonderful healing herb, but whatever it is, it is based in unsound reason, if not absolute corruption. People have gone so far as to say the DEA is nothing more than the militried wing of the pharmaceutical industry; I don't believe this is the case, or at least, hope not. Regardless of the reason, it has been proven time and time again that this tactic of surpression and criminalization of any substance has been ineffective and even harmful to the public good.\n\nDo not ban kratom, discontinue the downward spiral that is the Drug War, and maybe then we will be able to come together and help everyone overcome their own demons without putting them in chains and locking them away.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20783","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Watson Fitts","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 43 year old male who has fought a losing battle with drugs and alcohol all my teen and adult life. About two years ago I joined Alcoholics Anonymous in a last ditch effort to stop the self destruction. After several months sober I was injured at work, and accepted some opiate painkillers to help with the pain. once again, I began to spiral downward into addiction. A colleague at work offered me Kratom one day when I couldnt score any pills on the street. She said she had been using it as a means of alternative pain relief in order to avoid harmful pharmaceuticals, and explained that it was an herbal remedy from Asia. I have never been much on \"alternative\" medicine, always preferring methods with garanteed results. I drank a small cup of her tea mostly to be polite, and was amazed at the effect it had on my pain. What I wasnt counting on was the effect it had on my opiate cravings. It has been a year and a half since I have swallowed so much as a single prescription pain medication. I drink a  small cup of Kratom each morning with breakfast to help with my physical pain, and it also helps me to maintain a sense of well being and purpose within society. My entire life has turned around since being made aware of this amazing plant, and, like tens of thousands of others out there, I dread what will most likely happen if this resource is taken from us.

A relative to the coffee plant, kratom has been used in Southeast Asia for thousands of years as a remedy for pain and fatigue. Traditionally, the leaves or extracts of them have been used as local anesthetic and to heal wounds. Diarrhea, intestinal infections, and coughs have also been treated with kratom leaves and their extracts. Kratom is well known in these cultures for helping workers be able to work longer by keeping them energized, relieving pain and enhancing mood.\n\n\nKratom has helped to save the lives of many people by allowing them to quit the use of opiates and other dangerous drugs. In 2014 alone, over 28,000 people died of opioid poisoning. The people who died while consuming kratom had other at least one, if not more, other drug in their system at the time of death. I don't believe that it's humanly possible for anyone to die from kratom alone. Kratom has a built in \"safety net\" in that it makes one vomit if one consumes too much for the body to handle well.\n\nThe plethora oftherapeutic uses for this plant, kratom, are too vast to be given a the label of a schedule 1 substance. Unlike traditional opioids, kratom does not depress respiration at high doses. Kratom is safe for use by adults who choose to do so.\n\nAs a veteran of the United States Military, I've suffered from chronic pain and fatigue for nearly a decade. I discovered kratom at an herbal tea bar and it has given me my life back. Since I've started using kratom, I've been able to work, exercise, and take care of my family; these are things that were difficult if even possible at all before I knew about kratom. I know that are thousands of other people who are much worse off than I who rely on kratom to be able to live without the use of drugs. The drugs that these people would be dependant on without kratom are proven to be deadly. It's vital for the health, well being, and lively hood of Americans to keep kratom legal, for use, purchase and to be sold in the United States of American and I ask that it NOT be labeled a schedule 1 substance.\n\nThank you for your time and concideration","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19779","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is my desire that the DEA reconsider the proposed ban on the medincinal herb Kratom.

If it contains qualities that could help someone medically, then I am all for that route. If the FDA's evaluation shows no harmful effects or possibilities of overdosing than it would be fine to make it legally recreationally, but I do not believe that will be the case. Unlike alcohol, this seems like a substance that would be much harder to monitor levels of and I am afraid of it being easily to overdose on. Along with that we have to think how easily it is currently attained and the possibility of it getting in the hands of minors. Something like this that can be harmful to them can ruin their life from such an early age. We also have to consider driving under the influence of kratom; can the levels be recognized? At that point others are in put in harm's way. Overall, I am stating that I wish for the drug to be classified and the legality determined by the result of the FDA's evaluation.

Suicidal, depressed, worthless , insignificant, pointless. Those were all words I, at one time, used to describe my life. At 24 years old, I have a life as I should,  full of experiences, love, laughter and enjoyment. 2 years ago I would have never said that. Countless plans cancelled or rescheduled and hundreds of missed opportunities. All because of an injury at 2 years old that has destroyed my life for the past 22 years. I suffered from a spinal fracture in my femur due to an accident at daycare. I now suffer from hips that rotate opposite ways, severe sciatic nerve pain in my right leg, a herniated disc and a torn disc. I've also already had one knee surgery and was sincerely considering a disc fusion surgery in my lower back. At 24, the lifetime of potential consequences seemed horrifyingly daunting.\n\nThen one day, it all changed. My friend introduced me to Kratom, and it was unlike anything I've ever tried. I was so focused and productive at work. I had the ability to talk to people without being riddled with anxiety and most importantly I was doing my job and living my life pain free. There is a really common misconception that Kratom is \"herbal heroin\" or \"just like opiates\" to name a couple of things I've heard, but in all actuality, it's nothing like that. My mind is  completely clear, and I don't have that druggy haze that 99.9% of narcotics (that I can't take due to an allergy but still have taken out of sheer desperation for pain relief). I'm focused and I'm happy. Fulfilled, content, happy, pain-free, hopeful, and eager to live are all now words that I can honestly use to describe how I feel about life now. i can live my life without the threat of pain lurking around every corner. This plant is about as harmless as its cousin coffee. \n\n14 of the 15 deaths that were supposedly caused by Kratom all had harder drugs in their system. Kratom has proven to be wildly successful in curbing the nation's increasing heroin crisis. There are so many people out there that are like me, suffering from real, inconsolable pain that you can't even begin to imagine. There are people who have used Kratom to get off opiates, alcohol and even instances of tobacco. This is a natural plant with very minimal negative side effects. If we claim to care about our fellow citizens in even the slightest then we can NOT schedule this plant. The number of lives that can be saved outweighs any side effect that this plant has, which are few and far in between to begin with.\n\nIf this plant is made illegal then know you will have blood on your hands. The blood of every individual who resorted back to hard drugs and died, the blood of every person who kills themselves because that's their only way out from the pain and they're sick of being labeled druggies or pill seekers by people who can't even begin to comprehend what they're going through. You will leave children without parents and parents without children, sisters without brothers and brothers without sisters.\n\nOur pain, our issues, and our REMEDY is very real, very safe, and very much less problematic than any hard drug that you can find on the street. If you care about the war on drugs please leave our plant alone. Educate yourselves before you create the imminent drug crisis you fear this plant is causing. Thousands die from heroin and opiates every day, every week and every year and the best you can come up with is 15 deaths (with other drugs in their system) over 6 years?

It's nothing short of amazing.\n\nI live in an area of the country considered ground zero for opioid addiction: SW VA and NE TN. That's all one hears on the news. I lie awake each night fearing that if the DEA were to make Kratom a scheduled drug, I will find myself with no choice but to go back to the most dangerous drugs on the planet: opioids. Please don't do this. Let me live out the rest of my days with as little pain as possible, all the while allowing me to live a normal life with my family a friends....something that I found impossible to do while on those truly dangerous opioid concoctions.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10528","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Frank Kaylor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"its grate for my back pain and all natural !!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14845","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christian Bicker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Isaiah Bugarin. I am a college student and a former opiate addict. If it was not for the plant known as kratom, I would still be an opiate addict on a collision course with death. For a long period of my addiction, I was completely aware of the course I was taking and where I would end up. The stereotype is that people of my kind are either unaware of their eventual demise, or must be simply too strung out to care. The fact is that I was aware and I did care, greatly. I cared enough to quit more times than I could count. But opiates are not like other drugs; they find a way to suck you back in through ways so novel there appears at times to be a sentience to its deception.\n\nOne of these ways is through withdrawal. Withdrawal, being only temporary, seems like it would pose an insignificant challenge for someone with a little dedication. This is not the case, and it is where most of my attempts to quit opiates ended. To say withdrawal is crippling would be a significant understatement. I have had cancer, and opiate withdrawal is the only other experience in my life that has been so painful, so relentlessly tormenting. With relief from this suffering just an opiate away, it seemed there was an insurmountable amount of willpower necessary to push through weeks of withdrawal's abuse. This is where kratom came to my rescue. After dozens of unsuccessful attempts at quitting (with a few half-successful relapses), I decided to try using kratom to taper off opiates. In doing this, I experienced a significant decrease in withdrawal symptoms that made quitting a simple matter of dedication. I quit successfully on my first attempt and haven't touched an opiate since.  \n\nAnother way opiates creep their way back into addicts' life is through PAWS (post-acute withdrawal syndrome). The depression and anxiety that accompany a post-opiate life are the reason that many addicts make the seemingly daft decision to relapse. It is this monster that lives inside the addict's head at all times and shouts at random intervals about how nice just one dose would feel. How much better this day would be if I got high. It is a monster that you never truly learn to live with. But with kratom at my side, living with it is more than manageable. Tickling a few of the same receptors that opiates used to flood, kratom provides just enough of a relief to force the monster mute into a cage without giving a recreational high. Kratom is what prevents me from returning to a life of opiate addiction. I wish I could say it was willpower, but the fact is I have tried the willpower only route of abstaining from opiates. Every time ended badly. Now that I have been using kratom to kill the inevitable opiate cravings, I haven't used an opiate in nearly 2 years.\n\nOpiate addicts are not lost causes. They are people who more than anything in the world just want their lives back. All they need is a way, and my experience has shown me that kratom is an unparalleled tool for doing just that. Some in the scientific community have also made note of its potential in this regard. Instead of allowing for further research to help combat the massive opiate problem in this country, the DEA has decided to declare kratom an imminent public health hazard and place it on the Schedule I list of drugs. They are not treating the opiate problem; they are taking away the cure. Not only is this a gross overstep of the DEA's authority, it is going to put tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of people just like myself in a position where they must rely on their notoriously unreliable willpower to keep them from a lifetime of opiate addiction.\n\nPlease, give my monster a cage. Keep kratom legal.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17230","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Isaiah Bugarin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern,\n\nKratom has saved my life.\n\nI have struggled with anxiety and panic attacks for the last 15 years.  It has crippled my life.  I had to drop out of school, I was unable to work or have any kind of social interaction.  There was a point when the anxiety and daily panic attacks had gotten so bad that I couldn't leave the house.  For a period of about 3 years I was pretty much housebound.  Something as simple as taking the trash to the curb would cause me to shake and sweat.  I couldn't afford to see a psychiatrist or a therapist regularly and I don't like the grogginess that anti-anxiety meds cause me.\n\nBack in 2012 I was hit by a truck while in a crosswalk and now my back is all messed up.  Simple things like standing at the sink doing the dishes will send pain shooting up to the base of my skull.  Walking for more than 10 minutes becomes difficult.  I won't touch pain pills anymore because for a brief period of time I found myself becoming addicted.\n\nAbout 2 years ago a friend of mine told me about Kratom.  Within the first few days of taking it I started to feel functional again.  I was able to step outside and breathe.  Do you know what it feels like to be terrified (for no logical reason) to walk out of your own front door?  Do you know what it feels like to not have any control?  It's terrible.  It's not something that I wish on my worst enemy.  The Kratom makes it easier for me to walk for longer periods of time.  Most of all, though, Kratom has given me back my life.  I'm back in school.  I don't know what will happen to me if there is a ban put on it.  I don't know what will happen to thousands of others if this ban goes through.  This plant truly is a life saver.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJennifer Smith","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22981","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to let you know that I suffer from Osteoarthritis in the RIGHT KNEE and the LEFT HIP.

Contrary to FALSE reports that I have read, Kratom is NOT addictive. During periods when my pain is more manageable I routinely stop using Kratom for periods of 4 days to 2 weeks. I have NEVER had any withdrawl symptoms or any problems at all. I simply use Ibuprophen instead when my pain is more manageable. When my pain becomes unbearable, I resort to using Kratom.

However, my anxiety remains. And kratom helps. It doesn't produce a \"high.\" It just...helps. Immensely. \n\nLike I said, being in the medical field I did my due diligence and research before I started using kratom. I only order from vetted distributors identified through the American Kratom Association. I agree that kratom shouldn't be in head shops and/or mixed with illicit street drugs. That's dangerous. That needs to stop. But in its natural form, I believe kratom to be safe and effective. After all, it has been used for decades here in the USA and for hundreds if not thousands of years in Southeast Asia. If it was a significant public health hazard I think we would know about it by now. \n\nA main concern that I have is research. If the DEA bans kratom, research comes to a halt. Please don't let this happen. What if we really have an effective pain reliever that does not suppress respiratory function?! Do you realize how many lives that can save? Especially now with the opioid crisis the way that it is. Too many people are dying because they do not have a safe, natural alternative to help with their pain and suffering. I read posts on social media and testimonies of veterans with PTSD, those with chronic pain, those recovering from addictions...you cannot deny that kratom is helping a lot of people. Safely. Naturally. Please do not ban it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3399","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kit Coward","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To DEA,\n\nI'm a retired AF vet.

After the drug abuse he fought a battle with depression and anxiety/stress every day.

It allowed him to lead a more healthy lifestyle and get about his day.\n\nThrough the use of Kratom, my husband has beaten depression, he has beaten drug abuse and withdrawals too. He now uses Kratom to change the lives of other people who are going through the same symptoms he went through so long ago. \n\nCurrently, my husband uses Kratom to relieve his back pain where he has 3 blown discs and a herniated disc and several other back/shoulder issues. It has allowed him the assistance of moving around daily. Kratom does not get him high, neither does it affect his motor skills, speech, etc. What it does is assist him in living a better lifestyle than he could on his own. \n\nWe are not supposed to say Kratom cures anything. But I know first hand that Kratom has made a difference in our family. Please do not make Kratom a Schedule I substance. My husband is a law abiding citizen and a God fearing man.

All of that is to say I'm not a junkie or an addict or even  someone who has ever set foot in a head shop. \n\nI also suffer from generalized anxiety disorder. I have tried numerous things to help my symptoms; half a dozen prescription drugs, meditation, exercise, breathing techniques, and all sorts of supplements. Kratom has helped in a way that nothing else has. I have been using it for years now and it has made a big difference in helping me to relax and focus on my life rather than on worries about the future. \n\nI use it several times a week. I consistently use the same amount and I have taken breaks for weeks at a time with no difficulty. The side effects are minimal, and in my experience kratom, in plain leaf form, is extremely safe. On the few occasions when I've had a little too much, the resulting upset stomach is enough to make anyone stop. Too much plain leaf will make you vomit long before you could ever hurt yourself in any more serious way with it. \n\nI have researched kratom extensively and the available evidence bears this out. Deaths associated with kratom are rare. Much lower than say, alcohol (which is legal and unrestricted, by the way) or even aspirin (which is also legal and unrestricted and far easier to kill yourself with). The modest number of deaths associated with kratom are all confounded by the presence of (usually high amounts of) other, more dangerous drugs in the body of the deceased. I am not aware of a single death caused by kratom alone without any other more dangerous substance being present. Calling kratom a \"public health emergency\" is laughable. \n\nMaking marijuana illegal is one of the most pernicious things the Federal government has done to its own people, criminalizing a safe and medically-effective plant for no good reason and leading to the incarceration of thousands who do not deserve to be in jail or have criminal records. Making kratom illegal would be duplicating this same mistake. \n\nIf you ban kratom, you aren't protecting me or anyone else. You are using the force of law to rob people of a helpful and recreational plant for no good reason. You are ruining the livelihood of kratom vendors and threatening those who choose to continue using kratom with prison for a behavior that harms no one. At that point, one must ask oneself which is more dangerous - kratom or the federal government? Only one of the two can ruin your life with a criminal record and a lengthy stay in prison. The other just helps you relax. \n\nKratom is a safe, useful, and recreational herb. It should remain unscheduled and should be regulated only to ensure that vendors aren't adulterating it with other substances. If the DEA wants to maintain any thin pretense that it exists to serve the American people then it will honor the evidence and the experiences of so many users and abandon this mad plan to ban a harmless and much-loved plant. Leave kratom alone.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5137","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I work in the music industry as a computer tech as well as a musician/producer of records.

I was given several diagnoses & treatments but none of which decreased my excruciating daily pain. I was losing hope of ever finding relief when I discovered Kratom. It was able to stop my pain as well as improve my overall mental well being--which by then had begun to take a  turn for the worse. I was finally diagnosed as having an atypical Migraine condition & given medication that helped, but still did not solve, my problem. I still have pain a few days a week but it is more controllable at this point & I do not need to use Kratom regularly--but it is comforting to know it is still a treatment option for those days when my Migraine medication cannot help stop my Migraines. \nI have also had several friends who lost their lives as a result of Opiates, both legal & illegal over the years. I feel confident that Kratom could have helped them & perhaps they would still be alive had they known about it. \nIf made Illegal, many 1000s of people would be turning back to Opiates for pain relief--increasing the already dire epidemic that currently has our Country in its grip.\nPlease reconsider the scheduling of Kratom--many lives, including those of our wounded Veterans, depend upon it.\nThank You for your time & Consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4246","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a professional in Corporate Audit for the largest bank in the country; more than 30 years.

My last prescription to benzodiazepine put me in a position to which I had to make a choice, at that point I made the decision to live without pharmaceuticals.

I was absolutely amazed that something like this had been out there waiting for me for so long. Little aspects of my life started becoming normal. Suddenly I was able to do simple things like take my dogs for walks, go to the mall with my step-daughters, and run errands without my husband having to chauffeur me. Even something as simple as submitting this comment would have been out of the question for me just months ago.

Thousands of years of the use of kratom has yielded no evidence that the herb poses any such risks. To deny my daughter and millions of other Americans coping with numerous mental health issues access to kratom would constitute an injustice of monstrous proportions, create a massive black market of illegal kratom commerce, and inordinately tax the resources of the DEA -- which I hope, as a tax payer, has more important battles to fight.

To do so, the DEA should have solid evidence that there is no medical use and high potential for abuse - both of which are lacking in this case (and for most drugs in the CI category). In fact, evidence exists to the contrary. Many report on medical benefits of using Kratom. While it's not without risks (no drug or herbal product is) there is no evidence Kratom should be a CI drug. In the midst of an opioid epidemic in which thousands of Americans are dying annually it is blatantly in the public's worst interest to place a drug like Kratom in a CI category as many use Kratom as an opioid alternative or to ween themselves from opioids. \n\nThe move would perpetuate a broken trend of trying to prohibit drugs or plant products which inevitably creates a black market and associated dangers, people are criminalized for trying to relieve their or others' suffering, legitimate medical research is oppressed by grueling regulatory burdens, and the problem doesn't get better (it gets worse). Please consider rational and evidence-based policy solutions such as harm reduction rather than prohibition which has proven itself to be a failure time and time again. The fact the DEA wants to do this exemplifies to me that they do not care about public health, medical research, or evidence-based policy making. It seems they are motivated mostly by trying to find ways to increase the burgeoning prison population and a status quo of ignorance to drug effects. I can't say much more except it is disgusting and heart breaking this would be proposed.\n\nThanks for your consideration of this comment in this important decision that will affect the lives of many Americans..\n\nBen Malcolm, PharmD, MPH\nAssistant Professor of Pharmacy Practice","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16560","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Benjamin Malcolm","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Good day,\nI have been drinking kratom tea for over 12 years.

I'm a 24 year old male living in San Diego, CA. I graduated from the University of San Diego in May 2015, and currently work as a front desk agent at Tower23 Hotel in Pacific Beach, CA. I am vehemently opposed to the DEAs proposal to make the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, found in kratom, a schedule 1 controlled substances. My stance on the matter is based on the limited available scientific research on kratom, my own philosophical, political, and ethical views, as well as my personal experience using kratom to alleviate physical pain, anxiety, ADHD, fatigue, and trouble sleeping. I first consumed kratom in the fall of 2013 while playing rugby and finishing my undergraduate studies at the USD. At the time, a local restaurant made tea using kratom that they only sold to adults. I happened to try it during exams and quickly noticed how it helped me focus while simultaneously relieving anxiety related to school. The added focus was especially nice because I was diagnosed with ADHD a few years prior and don't particularly like how classic ADHD meds such as Adderall make me feel. Additionally, using kratom lessened the physical pain that resulted from injuries caused by playing rugby, while motivating me to continue exercising in order to stay in shape and continue playing. All that said, what most compels me to voice my opinion on the legality of kratom is the plethora of friends, family, and acquaintances of mine that abuse or have abused prescription pain-killers. The problem has become so common and pervasive that I'd be hard pressed to name someone that I know who's life hasn't been negatively affected in some fashion by prescription opiods. Furthermore, I have personally witnessed several friends kick or lessen substantially the severity of prescription drug habits and/or alcohol abuse using kratom, which thankfully has little or no serious side effects such as respiratory suppression. I, myself, was able to avoid taking prescription oxycontin following a recent surgery for a wrist injury that left me with awful nerve pain. Neither gabapentin nor oxycontin made the nerve pain bearable, but kratom did so effectively without leaving me constipated, lethargic, or foggy-minded. My guess is that many people suffering from chronic pain would be healthier and far more productive members of the work force using kratom rather than prescription opiods. I encourage those interested in the science behind kratom to read the work of Chris McCurdy, a University of Mississippi professor of medicinal chemistry and pharmacology. The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association among other reputable sources easily found online also provide objective, fact-based, and somewhat comprehensive research and discussion regarding the effects of kratom. It is clear; however, that substantially more scientific research needs to be done, especially regarding possibly dangerous prescription drug interactions involving kratom, in order to allow medical professionals and the general public to make educated and responsible decisions regarding the use of kratom for various ailments. It is my sincere hope that the DEA acts deliberately and without haste- fully considering all input and thoroughly analyzing all available evidence, while resisting any potentially biased influence from pharmaceutical companies or grieving mothers, before making an objective, fact-based decision regarding the legal status of a plant that many (veterans, students, business executives, soccer-moms, etc...) American citizens rely on for maintaining their quality of life. \n\nSincerely,\n\nGarrett T.

While I recognize the worries the DEA has about Kratom, I feel a ban on the plant would do much more harm than good, especially when you view the number of deaths recorded from the plant (15, 14 of which were in combination with other drugs) compared to opioids (around 20,000 per year.) As someone who suffers from PTSD, I find that Kratom is very beneficial in helping my symptoms, and compared to opioids I used to take (legally) for pain, there is a night and day difference in addictive properties. In summary, I believe a schedule I listing would be drastic, premature and ultimately cause more harm than good. If the agency seriously cares about the opioid epidemic, then please consider keeping Kratom legal and do research. Making it schedule I would make it next to impossible to study the active ingredients in the plant and possibly create less harmful opioids, not to mention removing the beneficial properties from those that need it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13676","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Don Gilman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Gary Hathaway and I am a 57 year old small business owner who resides in Colorado.

I was introduced to Kratom tea by a friend a little over a year ago and I have been amazed by its effectiveness in helping to lessen my symptoms. Kratom has helped to ease my depression and my extreme anxiety without any of the annoying side effects from other medications that I have taken in the past. Kratom also has an added benefit as a very good pain reliever. I was a professional dancer all my life and my body has suffered from the results of that. In the past I had to take many over the counter pain relievers to get through the day pain free. Drinking my daily cup of Kratom tea has now made that unnecessary. (It also works great in the relief of migraine headaches.)\n\nI understand and appreciate the DEA's concern about things that could be  harmful to our health, and I thank them for their vigilance and protection. I am also confident and trust that after careful study of the benefits of this amazing plant called Kratom, and after hearing the life changing testimony of the multitudes of people that it benefits, you'll hopefully come to the conclusion that it should not be labeled a schedule 1 drug and it will remain available to all citizens like myself to use legally and responsibly....Thank you for taking the time to read my comment, it is greatly appreciated!\n\nSincerely,\nGary Hathaway","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18270","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gary Hathaway","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi my name is Chris Mercer.

If this is taken away from me I really have no clue of how I will cope being thrown back into that world of pain. I also have general anxiety and depression, which causes problems with my eating and sleeping habits. Kratom has also made these afflictions much more bearable in my every day life.

Not to mention the amount of people NEEDLESSLY addicted to PRESCRIBED opiates, when this product can practically alleviate every issue that can drive a person to become addicted to opiates. The amount of prescribed drugs in the world that WILL create a much worse quality of life to a person is appalling.  I have heard of numerous amounts of doctors that swear by this product. Just think; if doctors were allowed to suggest this to patients of practically every condition, how many lives would be saved and made better?

Where to start... Kratom... Just another thing that should be regulated on a legal level. Lets start with the stigma. There is a stigma - a mark of shame - behind most drugs, being that when someone hears the word drug, they think of something harmful, that gets you \"high\", something that is wrong. We as a society fail to remember that alcohol, tobacco, tea, coffee... are all drugs. Everything has potential for abuse, habitual addiction, and harm to some degree. I have been using kratom periodically... recreationally. It really helps put me in a good mood. It relaxes me and makes me just feel happy when theres no means to be happy. Its theraputic, much like recreational marijuana. And I have found marijuana to be more habitually addicting than kratom to be quite honest. I enjoy it much more than alcohol, meanwhile alcohol is much more addictive, harmful, toxic, and has much stronger, negative side effects of regular use, especially in large amounts. No one has ever died exclusively from kratom use. Only when it is mixed with other depressants will harm truly be a worry. People can even drink it with alcohol to a certain extent. Meanwhile, alcohol has high liver toxicity and can kill on its own from alcohol poisoning or much easier when mixed with other depressing drugs. I think that banning something just because of a stigma  - just because not much is known about it - just because there is an array of ignorant people who say bad things about it much like other substances - just because it makes you \"feel\" something at all - is wrong. I advocate for kratom use and its many benefits including relaxation, a sense of euphoria (release of dopamine much similar to how marijuana or nicotine products work), its ability to rehabilitate people with much more harmful opiate addictions (kratom is wonderful for this with much, much less addictive properties and potential for harm. I have heard from many that it has saved their lives from heroin addiction), and just how it puts you in a good mood. You dont smoke it, you dont shoot it, you just eat it or make it into a tea. Some strains are more relaxing, others are very similar to caffeines effects - without the jitteriness. We must remove the stigma from drug culture, and kratom use, because ultimately alcohol and nicontine and marijuana and caffeine are all a part of it, but we fail to recognize that. We must keep kratom legal - because it is the right thing to do. It is the American way.. to have freedoms. Kratom is not some street drug and will probably never be sold on the streets. It is not trafficked by gangs. We should do more research on it instead of banning it. Its potential to help opiate addictions is reason enough as we spend millions in rehabilitation centers and even more in the drug war. Please keep this wonderful plant legal and maybe even try it for yourself. We must not stay ignorant - we must research and speak of only what we know - and from personal experience. Kratom is not causing problems, it is a good product of nature.

Your decision to reconsider the matter is a pleasantly surprising display of rationality. Kratom is not a substance of abuse any more than caffeine is, for it's effects are around the same level of severity. Even large doses of kratom produce only mild sedation, like a shadow of the effect of hydrocodone. It is not habit forming, and you really should conduct objective research into a substance before making it a controlled substance. It is useful in reducing the symptoms of opiate withdrawal, without a replacement dependence. I have a DDS degree, am able to prescribe controlled substances, and have been physically dependant on opiates in the past. I have familiarity through both education and direct experience, how many of the people who made the decision to classify it more severely than cocaine have that kind of knowledge on the subject? Please try to be educated on the subject rather than displaying a Puritan-like mindset that anything that provides even mildly pleasant effects should be banned. Overdose is practically impossible and it is less habit forming than caffeine if it is habit forming at all.

I have found that using kratom supplement in tea has been effective (for me) for being able to relax, focus, and allow me to produce work on hobby software development.  The difference has been notable. Some coders enjoy a cup of coffee, but I prefer kratom tea.  I am familiar with many supplements and this fits in nicely with other similar ones such as ginko biloba, gotu kola, and chamomile tea.  I can't understand why it would be banned.  Not only would a ban be a shame because of the many people that find benefit with it--but banning seems like excessive, expensive government overreach.  Because of the benefits I personally have found with it, I am strongly opposed to any sort of ban and therefore felt compelled to comment here.

I have been using Kratom for the past year and have the following input for those wanting to have this plant listed as a Schedule I.  I have chronic pain due to a torn ligament in my back and RA.  My orthopedic surgeon tells me surgery \"may\" help fix my back but he in know way guarantees this invasive surgery.  My RA will only get worse as I progress in age until I am possibly wheel chair bound.  Kratom allows me to run my business by lessening the constant pain I feel without giving me that feeling of being high.  I am in now way running marathons because of it but I can function day to day knowing I can still live a somewhat normal life and get the things done, and do the things I need to do in my life without suffering. I have to be active and don't have the option of sitting behind a desk all day.  I run a property management business and I also work full time as a crisis specialist for an in house, girls youth home which requires long hours on my feet each and every day.  This allows me to actually contribute to the betterment of our society by helping to give these girls a new focus on their lives to become productive and not just strung out addicts, selling their bodies for their next fix.  I couldn't do this job without the benefits of Kratom and the pain relief it provides me.  Plus I also sleep amazingly which I was never able to do unless I doped up first. \n\nI used to cry daily, partly due to the frustration of not being able to find any relief and because of the pain, some days not getting out of bed.  Often wanting to end my life because of it.  Now I can function without being doped up because it works so well.  If you list this as a Schedule I it will lead to disastrous results.  Instead of focusing your efforts on herbs that actually help you should be focusing your efforts on Methadone Clinics feeding Heroine addicts still using, you should focus on Meth and Heroine dealers selling to grade school and high school age kids, not Doctors who are constantly harassed for simply trying to treat their patients who have the real need for pain relief.\n\nPlease don't take away the only thing so many of us suffering with depression, chronic pain,or severe anxiety due to PTSD use.  Many of us will die without it.

Kratom has never got me high or caused withdrawal symptoms. I used kratom to get off of a prescription medication called Suboxone (Buprenorphine) that was supposed to help me get off prescription painkillers. Suboxone was one of the most addictive and horrible drugs I have ever taken. It was basically impossible to stop using until I found out about Kratom. Kratom literally got me off of Suboxone without experiencing crippling withdrawal symptoms. I used kratom for about 2 months and then stopped using kratom and I had no withdrawals from this wonderful leaf. \n\nIf you guys make this leaf illegal you will be pushing millions of Americans who are using Kratom to get off prescription painkillers back on to deadly & addictive drugs. This ban is obviously being pushed by big pharma and people who do not understand that Kratom is helping and has helped millions of Americans get off of these addictive drugs. Please reconsider this ban. Banning this natural supplement will create a public health crisis in the fact that it will push millions of people in the middle of their detoxes back to deadly & addictive drugs.

I ask that the DEA reconsider classifying kratom as schedule I substance and look into ways to better regulate the kratom market.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10859","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am FOR the ban/ regulation of kratom but do not want it criminalized - if that makes sense.

That is what has happened to me. My life is now like groundhog day just using daily with little motivation to do other things.\n\nI think it should be made available (via whatever means/ similar to methadone programs) to people addicted to opiates as a way to ween them off their addition to heroin, Oxycontin, etc. This would be a highly effective use but like methadone probably not a long term solution.

I am going to quickly discuss the science behind Kratom,  and then discuss my experiences with Kratom, why I use it, and what it does for me. \n\n1) Kratom is a natural botanical native to tropical Southeast Asia that is part of the coffee family. It's also known by its scientific name, Mitragyna speciosa. The people of Southeast Asia have used Kratom leaves as an herbal supplement and traditional remedy for hundreds of years. When taken in appropriate amounts, Kratom can provide increased energy, minor pain relief and many find relief from a variety of other mental and physical ailments. Today, people in the U.S. are consuming Kratom, as they do other herbal supplements and traditional remedies.\n\n2) Kratom is not a drug. Kratom is not an opiate. Kratom is not a synthetic substance. Naturally occurring Kratom is a safe herbal supplement thats more akin to tea and coffee than any other substances. Kratom behaves as a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and is used for pain management, energy, even depression and anxiety that are so common among Americans. Kratom contains no opiates, but it does bind to the same receptor sites in the brain. Chocolate, coffee, exercise and even human breast milk hit these receptor sites in a similar fashion.\n\nAs I previously stated, I am a Canadian engineer. I am an educated adult who has never used any recreational drugs. I don't drink or smoke, and I take my health very seriously. \n\nThroughout high-school and university I trained, competed (and later taught) Taekwondo and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Unfortunately, while competing,  I suffered a number of serious back injuries, that have resulted in pretty severe chronic back pain. \n\nEvery doctor I have gone to see regarding my injuries has wanted to put me on strong pain killers, or prescription steroids. I tried the painkillers ,and they were a nightmare. I spend two months in a constant daze before I decided to stop taking them. I had read out the negative side affects associated with certain steroid compounds that my doctor wanted to prescribe, and decided that they were not a healthy long term option. \n\nAfter spending years in constant pain and agony I stumbled across Kratom tea. I did my research, concluded that Kratom is completely safe, and decided to give it a try. \nAfter beginning to drink Kratom tea, I had started to feel like my old self for the first time in years. I don't get any sort of euphoria, or \"high\" from Kratom. It simply helps with my back pain, and by doing so, it allows me to live a better life. \n\nIn conclusion, I  strongly advice the DEA to reconsider the Kratom ban.\n\n( I have discussed Kratom at length with my doctor, and have asked him to research Kratom tea and give me his medical opinion. After doing so he told me he could not find anything dangerous about it, and that he views it as a safe and viable option)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3122","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Emir Hot","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please stop the Kratom prohibition.

This is a duplicate but I forgot to specify it was for Docket No. DEA-442W in my original comment.\n\nMy name is Jerry Kilpatrick.  I am Sr. Software Architect at an international company.\n\nI oppose the ban on kratom (mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine) as I do not believe that there is any harm that has happened, is happening, or will happen to anyone consuming the plant.  I do not think plants should be banned, especially if they help people.  Banning this plant will not be saving any lives.  If anything, banning the plant will cause loss of lifes.  Some have used this to help get off of heroin which could easily kill them.  I have talked to many Veterans that are near suicidal due to PTSD and pain and for them, taking kratom alleviates the problems while still letting them function.  Others experience a large variety of effects that drastically improve their quality of life.  Banning this plant will not save anyone and will hurt many many people who use it to make life manageable.  I believe banning, restricting or regulating kratom is not in the best interest of the American people.\n\nAs for me, I first learned of kratom two years ago.  I was on a handful of prescription medicines for various ailments.  I had decided that I wanted to try to stop taking those medicines and try to use more natural products.  After quite a bit of research I found that kratom was reported to help with nearly all of my ailments in one way or another.  I have an open mind so I decided to give it a try.  I found a local store that sold kratom and they talked to me about how to prepare it.\n\nI do not claim that my findings are in any way scientific.  This, however, is how it affected me and I believe this should go to show that it needs to be seriously studied before any decision is made.\n\nI started out taking it every once in a while when I would have debilitating anxiety.  Minutes after having a cup of tea made with kratom my anxiety would subside entirely.  To me it was a miracle.  I was still fully in control of my wits.  I was not dulled like I had been with my prescription meds.\n\nI had a spell where I was under a lot of stress and I began using kratom once a day.  That is when my eyes were truly opened.  As always it had entirely eliminated my anxiety but additionally I noticed that many other problems such as IBS which I have absolutely suffered from for decades had vanished.  This was even more important to me than my anxiety as this IBS discomfort is so constant and so miserable that I hadn't even realized how much it had wore down my psyche.  It was like being pulled out from under a dark cloud.\n\nNow I use kratom frequently.  I also suffer from cluster headaches and though it does not stop them, it does make the pain bareable.  I do not want to go back to a day where I am unable to consume this plant.\n\nThere are concerns that it is addicitve.  I can honestly say that it does have dependency that comes along with it.  I recently took a trip to New Zealand and did not take any with me.  I had mild cold-like symptoms for 2 days which I'm pretty sure were withdrawal symptoms.  With that in mind I also, recently, had to quit caffeine for a week.  That was some of the worst headaches I have ever had and I suffer from cluster headaches.  My caffeine withdrawal lasted for about 3 days.  So when it is said that kratom is addictive, it is no where near as bad as caffiene is.  Please keep perspective.\n\nFor the record, during my two weeks I was in New Zealand, all of my other symptoms also came back especially the IBS so it once again assured me that it was the kratom that was saving me from those symptoms.\n\nTo this day I still normally have a cup a day and my health has been better than ever.  I feel great.  I get out and do things that I never used to do.   Kratom has given me a whole new life.\n\nI am upset and offended that a government agency would threaten to take kratom away from me while simultaneously insinuating that I'm some lowly drug addict and marking me as a felon just for drinking a cup of tea.  A cup of tea that has drastically improved my quality of life.  This is just my story and I know that many others share similiar stories to mine.\n\nPlease, take the time to do legitimate research and you will find that this is not a dangerous drug.  It is a rather miraculous plant that could have even more to offer than we know about today.  Please stop trying to make plants illegal.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJerry Kilpatrick","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1950","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jerry Kilpatrick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I just heard about Kratom today!

Powell. I am a 45 year old cardiac monitor technician at local hospital where I've worked for the past 12 years. I hold a lead tech position on days. I work closely with cardiac RNs and cardiologists as well. I am admired and respected by my colleagues. They trust me when I'm monitoring their patients that their patients' hearts are under watchful, highly experienced eyes. My bosses like how I relate to those under me, and those under me are pleased that I am their lead. I work 60 hrs per week. I pay into the system. \n The purpose of this document is to express my disapproval, dismay, and deep concerns over this ban you propose on Kratom. This will undoubtedly have grave consequences for many Americans as you have already been informed by so many of us whose boots are on the ground and are certainly in a position to tell you so. So now the people know that you are aware, thus later claiming your ignorance at the time will not be a viable defense once this damaging policy goes into effect.  Scientists, professionals, and even a Nobel Prize laureate have weighed in on the issue of kratom telling you that they are opposed to this ban. An impressive number of politicians from both parties have sent you letters in support of the Kratom community.  Now the DEA's head has stated that he could live with his decision in the event that he has made the wrong one. Well good for you sir, but there are millions more who cannot and will not live as a result of your oopsie daisy decision. This poor decision will cause harm to someone's parents, spouses, siblings, ...someone's children. You can live with it, but with all due respect sir, life is much bigger than just you. \n At the age of eight my family was in a horrific car crash while returning home from a road trip that left me with a broken right jaw, bilateral broken femurs, and a broken left patella(knee cap). This was in the early nineteen eighties. I was in the hospital for over three months. I had numerous painful surgeries. I was prescribed IV hydromorphone(dilaudid). I became a clock watcher-  always watching the clock waiting till I could request my next shot. Every four hours round the clock immediately after surgery. Then every six hours after a day or two. Then every eight hours. Then off IV and onto oral oxycodone(Percocet). I became very eager to have surgical procedures performed on me because with them came the IV pain meds. Again mind you, I was an eight year old kid. I turned nine in that hospital. Fast forward to age twenty eight and I slipped on some concrete stairs landing flat on my buttocks. My left femur snapped like dry wood. The pain was excruciating. I begged the paramedics to medicate me before hoisting me onto the stretcher. IV morphine was administered. An old familiar rush of warmth quickly settled over my entire body. I was instantly whooshed back to the eight year old boy in the hospital. It would take over a decade to gain control over the opiates. A major part of that victory I owe to the Kratom leaf. Today Kratom makes it possible for me to use my medications sparingly and responsibly. In my experience, opiates create compulsion in me to take more and more. Kratom DOES NOT produce this compulsion. While it is true that Kratom can cause some physical dependence, this is really only seen in individuals who partake in larger amounts over longer periods of time. I would also like to remind you that coffee produces a dependency on caffeine. Kratom is no different, and do not forget coffee and Kratom are cousins. In my own PERSONAL experience, Kratom has never lead to clinical addiction(as I understand it), and the accompanying compulsions associated with clinical addiction. This distinction cannot be overstated nor overlooked. This is an enormous aspect that must not go without acknowledgement. This is my personal firsthand account with Kratom and the dependency vs addiction issue. Kratom for me was a godsend and you will undoubtedly hear this sentiment repeated over and over as you read the public's comments. So many lives in so many ways have been restored as a result of Kratom and its ease of acquisition for the common person. Take that away and you do a huge disservice to the public you are supposed to be protecting. Thank you for your time. \nSincerely,\nTerrence Powell","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4156","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Terrence Powell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After researching for natural alternative pain relief other than marijuana I discovered Kratum very recently.

I began using kratom as a substitute for coffee. As coffee causes me indigestion and makes me very jittery I had been looking for a safe and effective energy boost in the morning to replace caffeine. I have found kratom to be a healthy alternative to coffee that doesn't cause any gastrointestinal discomfort and I have had only positive experiences with it. I cannot say that for caffeine.\n\nIt frightens me that my government would ban any plant or supplement that has been useful to me and many others with only sparse and inconclusive reports of its dangers. More research should be done to decide what, if any, the negative side effects of a useful plant may be BEFORE any action is taken. If any negative aspects of a useful plant are found it would then be responsible to make laws regarding warning labels and age restrictions. Banning a useful plant or supplement based on the wishes of special interest groups, the actions of those individuals who irresponsibly misuse this substance, or any other trivial reason would be an assault on the very freedom I cherish as a proud American.\n\nMillions of Americans show signs of addiction in regards to caffeine. Alcohol and acetaminophen are responsible for many thousands of injuries and deaths every year. Nicotine is undeniably damaging to ones health with no substantial benefit of any kind. But these and other potentially hazardous substances are legal for adults to use at their discretion because it is a matter of individual choice and freedom. Why should kratom be treated any differently than these substances?\n\nI would welcome government efforts to set purity standards for kratom, require warning labels to disclose any potential side effects or health risks of kratom (if they have been proven by legitimate research), and efforts to keep it out of the hands of minors. Please do not ban kratom or any other plant, supplement, or substance of this nature as it would only inhibit our personal rights and freedoms.\n\nPlease do not make criminals of the users of kratom as they pose no greater risk to society than users of caffeine. I would conclude from my own experiences that kratom use has much less impact on society than alcohol. America needs education and legitimate information to make informed choices on an individual bases, not prohibition and more wasted tax dollars. \n\nThank you for listening,\n\nJason McCurry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9057","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason McCurry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I pray that you dont ban my leaf that has helped me get off of all drugs .

This natural plant helps many people safely cope with anxiety, recover from opiate addition and relieve symptoms of depression. It has been proven safe by hundreds of years of use.\nThe National Forensic Laboratory Information System, the DEA database that collects information from forensic labs throughout the country shows kratom appears in just a fraction of one percent of all reports for substances in 2013 (173 times) and 2014 (137 times). Contrast that with an over the counter pain reliever like acetaminophen (the main ingredient in Tylenol) which sends 78,000 people to the Emergency Room each year.\nKratom is non-habit forming, unless taken in high doses for extended periods of time. Users may experience dependence (similar to caffeine dependence) and discomfort on stopping excessive, daily use abruptly. Taken in excess it will cause nausea and vomiting; its own built-in safety mechanism.\nPlacing Kratom as a schedule 1 drug will do a tremendous disservice to the American public and only worsen the current war on drugs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21485","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Lee","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The therapeutic potential of kratom is too large to be ignored.

The experience that my husband and I have had is so powerful that I must speak out.  \n\nMy husband had 2 spinal surgeries within 6 months of each other, and recovery was very painful.  He became addicted to the prescription painkillers.  When his doctor cut him off from receiving more prescription meds, he turned to alcohol for pain relief.  This behavior almost resulted in the end of our marriage.  But then I heard about Kratom for pain relief.\n\nIntroducing my husband to Kratom for pain relief has helped to end his chronic addictions.  It relieves his pain without causing the mental imbalance that prescription drugs and alcohol created.  We were both astounded to find that Kratom could be this effective in relieving pain and enable him to stop using the other, much more destructive substances.  We've tried different varieties and found that some have a slightly stimulating or slightly relaxing effect, but this is no more than the side effects of OTC allergy medicines.  Our lives are much better since our discovery of Kratom.  It would be SO damaging to lose this valuable resource. \n\nPlease consider very seriously whether making Kratom illegal would be in our country's best interest.  It would NOT be in the best interest of our family.\n\nSincerely,\nJeanne Beebe","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17904","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeanne Beebe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Several years ago I herniated 2 discs in my back (L4-L5, L5-S1) that virtually incapacitated me. After seeing my PCP, it was off to the specialist, who then sent me for an MRI. \n\nFor the next year I was doing traction for an hour a day, taking Oxycodone multiple times per day and try to live through the pain. The pills stopped working over time, and I was dependant on them. The only 2 choices I had were to stay that course, increasing dosage or stop taking them. I chose the latter. \n\nIn doing so, I spent time researching options and found Kratom helped others in my situation.

My attitude was much improved, I slept better at night, I was able to focus on work again and I had more energy during the day. \n\nWithin 3 weeks of stopping Oxycodone and starting Kratom, I was a whole new person and the pain relief was on par. Even better, I was never \"high\" anymore. \n\nI've been taking Kratom for just over 3 years now, and in pretty moderate dosages. I take it 2-3 times per day, and other than the pain in my back, I see no side effects when I do not take it. With Oxycodone, I could not say the same thing. Within 3 hours I felt terrible and my back hurt. With Kratom, the back pain slowly comes back, but I never feel bad.\n\nFreedom to choose my own method of care, and take ownership of my life is one that I should be able to have.

I'm almost 68 years old.  I learned about kratom about four years ago after a lifetime of seeking energy and clarity of mind and a positive mood that didnt involve sugar or large doses of caffeine. Katom supports my energy and a healthy positive mood. It contains no caffeine and also has helped defeat the sugar and alcohol cravings, which were a poor source of energy and alertness, anyway.\n\n\nKratom may also be helping with my 40 year history of chronic back pain by keeping my muscles relaxed and supple. I give most of the credit for that to the high-quality nutritional supplements that I began taking about the same time I learned about kratom.\n\n\nI am semi-retired now and in very good health. After a long career of doing a variety of work to pay my bills while pursuing my deeper personal interests of health and athletics, I have settled down to write &\n\n\nWhy is the DEA trying to ban an herb that is mostly being consumed to help people permanently withdraw from narcotic addiction and habituation? All at a great cost savings to ourselves and our insurance programs!\n\n\nWouldnt it be a better investment of DEA funding to prevent heroin, fentanyl, and other synthetic drugs from entering the country on the basis of # of lives saved?\n\n\nWhy does the FDA and DEA both say that kratom causes respiratory depression? Several researchers have found no evidence of that in new experimentation or in reviews of the medical literature.\n\n\nSee this recent study: https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/americankratomassociation/pages/21/attachments/original/1467415534/Journal_Of_The_American_Chemical_Society_6-6-16_Report.pdf?1467415534\n\n\nPlease also see this review, which mentions the lack of respiratory depression produced by kratom: \nThe pharmacology and toxicology of kratom: from traditional\nherb to drug of abuse, 2015, Marcus L. Warner, Nellie C. Kaufman, Oliver Grundman\n\n\nSee also this patent by Drs. McCurdy and Boyer, who have done the most research into kratom of any American researchers, where they say in [0098], section (i) Kratom use has never been associated with respiratory depression. https://www.google.com/patents/US20100209542 \n\n\nWhat proof do you have that kratom causes hallucinations? No-one in the kratom community of tens of thousands of responsible consumers of kratom have ever mentioned having hallucinations.\n\n\nWhy do the DEA and the FDA always assume that the public is full of idiots who abuse herbs? Has it ever occurred to you that the majority might be taking kratom in moderate, even tiny doses because they have learned thats what works best and avoids the side effects that only appear at very large doses? \n\n\nI am not aware of anyone in the U.S. kratom community who has experienced hyperpigmentation of the face. Can you show me some proof of this in the U.S., where there is no other likely cause? I have met kratom consumers who have been taking the herb for ten years and they look and act happy and normal.\n\n\nHow did the DEA get the idea that kratom was a threat? Your agency seems to have a very negative perspective of the many middle-class people, with a surprising number of nurses and even a few doctors, who consume kratom to support their health and well-being.\n\n\nIf youre comparing studies done from the Ramathibodi Poison Control Center in Thailand and are expecting to find that level of multidrug abuse throughout the U.S. kratommunity, you will be disappointed. That was a very sloppy study, with no blood testing done on intake to determine what these wigged out patients had been taking besides kratom. No consideration of their diet or whether they had been eating or hydrating at all (which could cause hallucinations and delusions, by themselves). Very sloppy reporting of the facts.\n\n\nIn conclusion, it would be unfair and unwise to ban or otherwise schedule an herb that is being used successfully by millions of Americans to support & promote their health and wellbeing in order to protect the small minority who will always seek out and abuse virtually any available substance. In fact, the very language the DEA uses to describe kratom, portraying it as a drug of abuse causing hallucinations, delusions, and classic symptoms of opioids, only serves to invite abuse by this minority of chronic drug abusers.\n\n\nKratom is helping many people, including myself, to enjoy a better quality of life -- without impairment -- and producing few significant problems, even among those who intentionally misuse it out of ignorance or a desire to pursue the legal high that the DEA and the media have led them to believe it offers. Why not leave kratom alone and pursue the truly dangerous substances your agency was created to defend us against?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12248","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paul H Kemp","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Shannon Smith.

I had to take three 800 mg ibuprofen daily just to be able to get through the day in addition to antidepressant. The side effects from these drugs are many. My stomach burned, I had crashing headaches in addition to other side effects. Now I only have to take 600 mg of ibuprofen once a day and a very low dose of antidepressant and I only take 1/4 teaspoon of kratom. It has allowed me to move my body and alleviate over 50% of my fibromyalgia pain. Using it in conjunction with physical therapy gave me enough energy and pain relief to correct a neck injury which I had not been able to do because the pain was too much. I walked around in chronic pain daily and could not do any of the activities to stay healthy. Now my pain is 80% gone. When I do my physical activity I take only 1/4 teaspoon and that small amount has allowed me to move through the pain in order to make progress at healing. The side effects from the other drugs are gone as I do not have to take such high doses.  Believe me that the drugs I am taking are a far worse consequence on my health and very expensive as well.

I 1st learned of kratom nearly 3 years ago while researching how to quit methadone. I was on methadone treatment for nearly 9 years, and had been tapering from 200mg down to about 8mg. I was having terrible insomnia, RLS, depression & anxiety, so was looking into natural remedies.then after only 1 week on kratom, I was so happy and confident, I turned in ALL my remaining methadone (I was on full maintenance,& only had to go once a month), and haven't touched a narcotic since! I've been clean & sober for over 11yrs now, please don't make a criminal out of me! I strongly support regulation of kratom, and it be great to see it become an option to taper off rehab opiates like methadone or suboxon, or even as a buffer in between doses of prescribed opiates.

While I cannot personally attest to every supporter's reasoning as to their usage of kratom, I absolutely find it to be far more of a solution than a hazard as a supplement, with many positive benefits of use and reasons to be supported. The claims of kratom being destructive or addictive stem from a misunderstanding of its use and overall benefits. The simplest way to justify this is to compare one person's negative reaction to a cup of coffee, while coffee being another individual's morning perk -- or a supplement which benefits the user in a positive means, but in no way inhibits their health, judgment, or even their common sense. The casual use of kratom is not only compared to coffee for its slightly stimulating, relaxing, and comforting effects; it is also derived from a plant that is a part of the coffee family. Unlike coffee however, there is one benefit I have received from kratom that ultimately ensured my support of it from then on. Two years ago I had severe back pain, so bad that the nerves down my left leg would pull and nearly immobilize me, not to mention preventing my abilities to exercise, and work efficiently, due to the excessive walking, standing, bending, and lifting I was required to do in order to be successful. Because I don't like taking unnecessary amounts of Tylenol (acetaminophen leads to liver damage), Ibuprofin (fluid retention, gastrointestinal ulceration), prescribed painkillers and muscle relaxers (actual addictive qualities and serious negative side effects, not to mention impairing my ability to work and drive) which my doctors had prescribed large amounts of due to the displacement of my L1 spinal section, I came across kratom. Taking small amounts of kratom when any amounts of pain levels were present, from low to severe, improved my condition drastically. My energy levels raised as though I had just had a cup of coffee, and I gained my mobility to perform to adequate levels in ways i was previously accustomed to. Every day use is not necessary, neither is it limited to the effects I have benefited from above. But as an individual who deals with pain on a normal basis and opts not to pursue invasive surgical options, countless pills of prescribed narcotics, or just pain in general; kratom is something I'd recommend to such a strong extent; that it would be a literal waste of a resource and potential helping hand to those who are looking for the option. At the very least, extensive research should be done before any drastic conclusion is made, such as making kratom illegal or punishing those who find a helping hand in it via unnecessary narcotic classification or baseless assumptions of its potential. Please reconsider your stance on focusing on kratom as a negative resource, when it is so much more than something that's simply good or bad; it's an option for those where, in many cases, are unaware of its benefits to begin with. Give it a chance, and allow people to make their own choices regarding consumption and use. It is the fair thing to do, especially after further research is performed. Let's get some facts, it's well past time. Thank you for your time. I hope you can take what I have typed and let it help you consider the possibility of considering kratom as a positive ally, rather than on obstacle to overcome.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22899","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a tax paying American citizen, I sincerely request that more research is conducted on Kratom and its long term effects.

I'm twenty-two  years old and a person at trainer. I was also a heroine addict for a year. Since I've been a recovering addict I get extreme anxiety attacks, usually at least once a week. For those who don't know how anxiety attacks work I will explain a little. First, it gets very difficult for me to breathe. Then I get a huge head rush, it feels like my head is going to explode and I can't even think or get out a complete sentence. It literally feels like the world is crushing in on me. At that point it's really difficult for me to control myself. Most of the time I just start freaking out. Since I've started using kratom my anxiety has gone down tremendously. It doesn't really get me \"high\", but actually calms me down. Kratom is not a powerful drug or anything like that. It's a plant that help me out of anxiety attacks, similar to herbal tea. If kratom is made illegal I'm not sure what I will do to help me. I really don't want to be put on medication for the rest of my life that just makes me tired and is just another addictive drug. I would like to do it naturally with stuff that won't hurt my body and make me an addict again. So please please think about what you're doing if you make it illegal. So many people need it like i do and I wouldn't want to see someone go right back to using real drugs just because the DEA isn't making money off a natural medication (Kratom).

Recently I have discovered Kratom through extensive research on alternatives to prescribed anxiety relievers, which are easy for me to develop a tolerance with, and leave me impaired. I also use Kratom to get rid of all the anxiety and emotional challanges which come with Autism Spectrum Disorder, having been diagnosed since the age of five. Kratom does an excellent job in removing these symptoms, and has allowed me to go beyond my challanges and attain a job, make new friends, become a composer of music, and other social strides which would not have been possible if kratom was not in the picture. I have previously been in therapy, which has taken a toll on me financially (Each 45-minute session with a therapist which specializes in autism cost me 250$ with no insurance acceptance) and needed a way to move forward from therapy after attending it for so long. Kratom has allowed me to exceed what is normally expected of an individual on the autism spectrum. My grades have also significantly improved since my kratom use started, as the herb allows me to focus and stay alert without anxiety. \nA DEA ban on kratom would be detrimental to me, and my friends with anxiety disorder that have benefited from kratom. It will be detrimental to the point where I will be considering moving to another country (I am an American citizen by birth) where kratom is still legal. There should be time and resources given to researchers, including myself to further examine the effects on kratom to ones health, which I feel there is too little health effects when compared to drugs which are not scheduled highly as kratom is proposed to be on; such as nicotine and alcohol, to be justifiable by the DEA to put on the scheduling system.\nThank you for offering me the opportunity to comment; please keep kratom legal.\n\nSincerely\nCarlos Tapia","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2412","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carlos Tapia","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"A natural pain reliever would greatly benefit people with chronic pain and anxiety, without the serious  chance of addiction.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4904","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sheri Ryan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n     From the scientific American article I read on this substance, Kratom  doesn't seem dangerous.

A pharmaceutical company pick this up, break the plants components down into a much more potent drug. Then sell it to the people that are addicted to opiates, fixing the problem they created.

After learning opioid addicts were finding success in using Kratom as part of the recovery to prevent painful withdrawls and avoid relapse, I believe it should go thru the correct legal process to determine the potential benefits and risks to the public.

I implore you to make an informed decision by educating yourself on the relative safety of this plant compared to coffee, alcohol, tobacco, and prescription drugs, and I urge you to research the medicinal potential that this plant has ALREADY displayed. Please re-consider placing this plant in the most severe scheduling category and consider reasonable legislation that would restrict its use to 18+ like other states are already considering. The following are pertinent facts for your consideration:\n\n* Kratom is a plant, NOT a synthetic chemical or Street Drug \n\n* Kratom is in the same family as the coffee tree (Rubiaceae)\n\n* Kratom is no more habit forming than coffee see recent article by the cato institute, [URL REMOVED]\n\n* Kratom has been safely used for thousands of years as a medicine\n\n* No one has ever died from taking Kratom alone.\n\n* It is impossible to overdose on Kratom\n\n* Tens of thousands of Americans can attest to the beneficial properties of Kratom\n\n* The state of WI may reverse their ruling to ban kratom see [URL REMOVED]\n\nFurthermore, Kratom and its 30+ active alkaloids show tremendous dietary supplement potential. The legislation, as it currently reads, would place Kratom and its alkaloids in the most severe scheduling category, schedule I. Making this plant and its constituents schedule I, effectively makes it impossible for legitimate researchers to discover and develop valuable medicines from Kratom that could benefit the lives of millions! This is not a sensible approach to regulating this plant.\n\nCurrent peer reviewed studies on Kratom and its constituents have shown that Kratom has no acute toxicity1, displays powerful antioxidant and antibacterial properties2, assists with drug and alcohol withdrawal symptoms3, contains several oxindole alkaloids which have exhibited potent immunomodulation properties, and even contains constituents that have exhibited anti-cancer properties!4 A brief search in any scholarly database will present hundreds of peer reviewed studies andclinical trials that can attest to the medical potential of this plant.\n\nA few more facts for you to consider when making your informed decision:\n\n* According to the CDC, cigarette smoking causes 440,000 deaths in the United States every year; about one of every five deaths in this country are caused by cigarettes!\n\n* Alcohol causes more than 1.2 million emergency room visits and 2.7 million physician office visits due to excessive drinking each year!5\n\n* Pharmaceutical drugs are one of the leading causes of death in this country, killing one American every 19 minutes! 6\n\n* Prescription opiate pain killers account for more than 475,000 emergency room visits annually.7\n\n* Over the counter pain relievers such as Tylenol send over 56,000 people to the emergency room each year with liver related complications.8\n\n* The Mayo Clinic has reported a 28% increase in overall mortality in people who drink 4 cups of coffee per day.9\n\nIn summary, the current proposed legislation places the medicinal herb Kratom and its constituents in the Schedule I category which is reserved for highly dangerous, addictive drugs that have NO medical value. The medical literature has proven Kratom and its constituents to be quite the contrary; a useful, safe, medicinal plant that has been used for thousands of years without incident. Kratom does not present a significant threat to human health or safety, when compared to legal substances such as alcohol, tobacco, Rx medications, Tylenol, or even coffee! Scheduling this plant would prohibit any future research and criminalize tax paying, productive citizens in your state as drug users, who are simply benefiting from the use of this plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18566","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"BRETT LEIST","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"DEA:\n\nPlease keep kratom on shelves!

Previously, I was taking tramadol and Lortab for back pain, degenerative disc disease and arthritis. I ran out of my tramadol early one month and decided to go off tramadol cold turkey. Those were 7 of the worst days of my life. No sleep for 3 days, 1-2 hours for another 4 days, tremors, diaphoresis, dizziness, akathesia. I mostly just paced all night and day because I couldn't hold still while feeling like I had the flu. I decided that I needed to find a different solution that had far fewer side effects. That research led me to kratom. I read that the side effects were mild in comparison and decided to give it a try. Although the kratom is not as strong as the tramadol or Lortab, it does help take the edge off the pain. The side effects I have experienced are mild constipation and also mild akathesia for about 24 hours. After I have been off the kratom for 24 hours the side effects are gone. It's a minor inconvenience rather than a horrible experience. As to whether they can cause death in rare instances, I cannot be sure. What I do know is if I were to return to opiates under the supervision of a physician, my risk of death would be much higher than without supervision on kratom. Ultimately, if the drug is classified schedule I, I won't return to opiates as I don't believe they are a good solution to chronic pain. I will likely have to live a more pain filled life, sadly for no apparent good reason.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10709","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Benjamin Elder","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to submit a brief comment on how Kratom has helped me over the past several years:\n\nDespite any minimal side effects and negative history this old plant has had in recent history, it has helped me greatly to overcome my battle with Opiate/Opioid (namely Heroin) addiction.

A simple Saturday lunch turned my life into just that when I broke my foot. The break became exacerbated by CRPS/RSD. I lost a job and went from a healthy and productive life to one filled with searing pain, doctor visits, and, of course, prescription meds. With incredibly high tolerance to begin with, my natural resistance to the effects of medications led to higher and higher doses. I am 5'2 and 130 pounds, and was being prescribed doses that would knock people twice my size out so I could be minimally functional. I was refused dental and medical procedures because anesthesia could not be administered in high enough doses to become effective. I began to research alternatives and came upon my own personal miracle, kratom. A former runner, body builder, and martial arts enthusiast who has worked since the age of fourteen, I had become imprisoned by the pain of my illness, as well as the methods recommended for symptom alleviation. Kratom tea gave my life back to me. I have gone back to work and been able to help support my family again! This simple plant, related to coffee, freed me from the doldrums of pain and putting manufactured chemicals, legal ones, which cause profoundly dangerous side effects, into my body. A tree has given me a relevant and important life. With absolutely zero side effects! As a 56 year old woman, I can attest to the benefits of this plant and its ramifications on the lives of people who want healthy and natural living. Please keep kratom legal.

ADD, Migraines, and general tension headaches have also been diagnosed in my family. You could say I'm genetically hardwired/predisposed to Mental disorders and related issues.  \n\nUnfortunately I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder - With the possibility of Bipolar Disorder and Attention Deficit Disorder at the age of sixteen. However, issues had been noted as young as eight when I was placed in 'play' groups to help overcome my anxiety. \n\nThe disorders quickly became increasingly disabling and I was later diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after experiencing traumatic events over a four year period in my early twenties. I was suicidal, had trouble with sleep, drank too much alcohol, and self harmed (cutting and bruising). I had been unable to work or go to school since I was eighteen. I was nearly homeless on several occasions. \n\nMedically I've tried just about everything to overcome and cope with my disorders. I went through a long list of anti-depressants, mood stabilizers (e.g. Venlafaxine, Seroquel, Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, Lithium, Vaproate, etc.), and therapy (e.g. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Exposure Therapy, Relaxation Techniques, Group Therapy). Nothing was helping and I was becoming desperate. \n\nA year or so ago, in my desperation, I was looking online for other options. I found out about Kratom and after doing my research I purchased some from a reputable vendor online. Kratom has completely turned my life around. I take one gram of white veined Kratom in the morning by placing the powder on my tongue using a spoon and washing it down with juice. It has a very subtle effect that starts to kick in about fifteen minutes after. At night I take one to two grams of red veined Kratom which helps me sleep. I do this every day although I have gone a week or two without or a day or two here and there without issue. \n\nThe effect of Kratom on me is subtle, kind of like drinking a strong cup of coffee. The white veined kratom gives me better focus, energy, but most importantly a sense of calm wellbeing/contentment without the zombie feeling antidepressants tend to give. Red veined gives me that same sense of calm but makes me sleepy instead of energetic. It does not give a high it's more like it stabilizes me. The couple of times I took slightly too much I felt like vomiting. I can't imagine anyone could overdose on Kratom because of that.\n\nSince I started taking Kratom I've been able to work, enjoy my hobbies again, and attend social events. It makes me feel normal and I can finally live my life as a productive member of society. I believe that banning Kratom would take me back to the way I was before and that idea terrifies me because I don't think I could do that again. I think I would stop trying. \n\nI don't think the ban is warranted because the effect is milder than alcohol and the antidepressants I took before. It doesn't affect capability or productivity negatively (in fact it has the opposite effect). The change has made a huge difference in my life and has benefitted me enormously, in a medical sense. I'm no longer anxious all the time, not constantly depressed, it helps with muscle pain from stress, I get less migraines, I feel calm but productive, I sleep better. I wouldn't say it's a cure but it is the best medication I've tried and the only one that really made a difference without a disabling effect. \n\nI am 100% against the ban. I find the claims that Kratom on its own is deadly hard to believe. I think the evidence for it is lacking. Kratom should be studied more because I believe it could help millions in a safer way than a lot of other medications currently do. If it were to be banned it would be too hard for those studies to be done. I also believe that banning it would cause the deaths of more people than it claims to safe and cause the suffering of thousands of people, without good reason. The current reasons given are inadequate and not properly supported by evidence. \n\nI do support some regulation to ensure quality and that the Kratom is unadulterated; some oversight would be preferable, provided there won't be a huge increase in cost. Kratom should remain affordable and accessible. It's a natural plant and the pharmaceutical companies should not be allowed to patent it to make a profit and decrease accessibility. I don't see a need for going  through a doctor to obtain Kratom because it's just too mild to be necessary. It would be like going to the doctor to get a Red Bull, unnecessary. Better labeling would be nice however. \n\nI would like to say to those who support the ban to try a gram of Kratom for themselves before judging. You'll see how harmless and mild this medication truly is.

I use Kratom as a medicinal supplement to manage a bi-polar diagnosis coupled with acute complex post traumatic stress and I've found Kratom to not only be the most effective at helping me to manage the complexity of my diagnosis but also the safest. I have been prescribed many different pharmaceuticals for my diagnosis and they only served to further complicate the symptoms of my condition. Having a bi-polar diagnosis for me means difficulty balancing and tending to the most basic of self-care. Remembering to eat regular meals and being able to maintain regular sleeping patterns has been a lifelong struggle that has been made exponentially more difficult due to a serious trauma sustained in 2010.  Since that time, I have survived two manic psychotic episodes and am currently recovering from a major depressive episode that nearly took my life. I've found that Kratom, specifically the white and green strains, to be by far the most effective at helping me to balance my moods and my energy so that I can then maintain a healthier level of functioning and self-care so that I do not fall back into a depressive state nor spiral into a manic psychotic episode, which neither I can afford to traverse again. With Kratom, I do not experience any of the negative side effects that often come from western pharmaceuticals, I have never felt the need to increase the size or frequency of my dosage to receive the same level of effectiveness nor have I ever felt any kind of 'hook' that comes with so many other substances or 'drugs'. It is honestly quite frightening to me when I think of all the likely hazardous consequences that will almost certainly come if Kratom is no longer legally accessible, not just for myself in my own life, but for the many many other people who use Kratom to manage legitimate and serious medical conditions. I think it is already apparent that the DEA and the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT have done little to truly handle ANY of the drug crisis in America and it also seems glaringly apparent that many of the actions of the DEA and FEDERAL GOVERNMENT have only served to further complicate the seriousness of the drug epidemic in the US. It seems nothing short of insane to me that the DEA would attempt to control another natural substance using the same methods and practices that have already so clearly failed. Time, money and resources need to be directed towards the research and understanding of how Kratom and other natural substances can be used to help benefit the whole of humanity instead of this old and broken model that has clearly already failed. \n\nSincerely,\n\nErica R.

Long story short, I was a serious opiate addict over the course of 10 years. I was in a very bad cycle of getting sick from the opiates I needed to take in order to function, and the seriously debilitating dope sickness I would get without it. I was developing serious signs of distress throughout the course of my body from the excessive pills. Many nights I was afraid to fall asleep for fears of not waking up. My anxiety was at an all time high and I felt my life slipping away. I slept next to my bible many nights and was starting to give in to the fact that I was bound to be a statistic. I tried going cold turkey many many times, only to give in to pain of the sickness and the overwhelming cravings. Eventually I entered into a methadone program to help become \"clean\". This was the worst mistake of them all. I very nearly overdosed because of the mistake of the prescribing clinic over assessing the amount of methadone I needed. I was required to report to the clinic everyday and pay much of my money to take the \"liquid  heroin\" as I like to call it. We were herded into the clinic like animals and many days had to sit on the floor waiting to take the dose. One day I forgot to bring a cap back from one of my take home doses for the weekend and the clinic told me they were not going to dose me two days out of the week, every week, for punishment. So basically I could look forward to being dope sick every single weekend. This upset me very much and made me question the ulterior motives of the methadone program. I told the clinic I was done with them. They advised me not to stop because I would get extremely sick. I could care less what they thought because I realized at that point  they were really not there to help me to begin with. I left and attempted cold turkey. What followed was the worst month of my existence in this earth. Only a person who's gone through it could understand that hell. And Even though I persevered through the pain For that month, I eventually couldn't handle it anymore. It was too much for any sane human to endure. I relapsed back into opiates. I felt helpless completely and chained to my addiction for good. There were many nights I spent browsing the internet looking for some kind of help. Eventually I came across some forums that discussed a herbal leaf known as Kratom. I read about good things about how it had helped people with opiate withdrawal. At first I was skeptical of it, because after what I had been through I couldn't honestly believe anything could help. That was until I decided to take a vacation out of state one year. I knew I was going to get sick but I felt I could taper  down on the opiates and at least give it a shot. I was pissed that the opiates had taken my freedom and ability to do anything. I got on the plane and headed to Vegas. I was nervous the whole time because I did not not how sick I was going to be. I managed to spend the fist night in semi enjoyment of my new surroundings. I went to bed with my wife that night knowing I was going to be sick the next morning, I just didn't know how bad. I told myself I could make the best out of it. Fell asleep for about two hours until the first wave of sickness hit. Basically I was forced to be bedridden on my vacation. I was sitting in bed trying to encourage my wife to have fun and not to worry about me. It was horrible, because she could not even enjoy it herself knowing I was in hell. Out of desperation in that vacation I remembered about Kratom and started to search for it in Vegas. I found a head shop that carried it and bought some not knowing what to expect. I took a moderate dosage to assess it and see how it made me feel. Because of my tolerance to opiates I didn't feel any relief at first. I took a little more not expecting for it to really help. To my surprise and relief I felt the sickness subside. I really couldn't believe it at first but it literally took away 90% percent of the sickness easily. I was able to have a good vacation because of Kratom and was now excited to know that there was a natural cure for this demon that had stolen my life. I still didn't know much about Kratom at that piont but I was just so relieved that something at all could help. I researched anything I could find on it and found very few if any negative feedback from people who had used or were using Kratom to help with addiction. From the point forward I managed to find a good strain of Kratom (MAeng da and Bali) that worked very well for me. I continued with Kratom and my physical ailments stopped. I stopped having cravings and everything in my life went back to normal. There were many days I ran short on Kratom but I was honestly able to function with minimal withdrawal. Kratom withdrawals pale in comparison to opiates, and is almost laughable compared to synthetic opiates such as methadone. Kratom has literally saved my life. Please keep it legal to help others !","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13634","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Wade Brunette","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"With Kratom I have no constipation, no euphoric effects, no bleeding, and my blood pressure has lowered.

I say limited experience because I only recently discovered kratom during a quest for an alternative to opioid pain medication, which I have been prescribed for nearly three solid years. I do live in a state where medical marijuana is legal, but it is costly and requires time to obtain (I have many doctor appointments as it is). I also do not like the side effects from smoked marijuana and, until recently, edibles and alternative forms were not available to medical marijuana patients in my state. After doing some research on kratom I decided to give it a try and I am not exaggerating when I say it was nothing short of a god send for me. Let me tell you my story.\n\nI am a 38 year old woman born and raised in the great state of Michigan. I grew up in a middle class family and went to public schools where I graduated with honors and was a member of the National Honor Society. I earned an Associate's Degree in Business from a community college and graduated Magna Cum Laude. I've worked since the age of 14, starting out as a Subway Sandwich Artist and landed in a Customer Service role around the age of 21 and I am still in that field today as a CSR Trainer. Also around the age of 21, I was officially diagnosed with Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). A brief description of HS is that is an inflammatory condition which may be auto-immune related and causes painful abscesses, typically in the armpit, groin, back and abdomen. There are different stages and patients with HS can have varying degrees of severity. It is chronic. There is no cure, there is very little known about its cause and no consistent treatment...what works for one person may not work at all for the next. Many patients will have multiple surgeries, numbering into the hundreds. The best an HS patient can hope for is remission. I have yet to reach that point. \n\nOver the years since my diagnosis my symptoms have become progressively worse. I have severe lesions in my armpits and groin, continuous abscesses with tunneling and scarring. They are constant, they are numerous, and they are extraordinarily painful. The abscesses vary in size from that of a pea to as large as a lemon. They can become infected in which case the pain level is magnified exponentially. I've had a surgical consult. The prognosis is that I may lose all range of motion of my arms with no guarantee that the surgery will be successful in preventing recurrence. Every day activities are painful for me, starting with the simplest of tasks...like getting dressed. Therefore I've been prescribed anti-inflammatory medications (ibuprofen) and opioid pain medication. \n\nWith all of the recent publicity of opioid addiction, overdoses, and fatalities; naturally, I've become concerned about the long term use of narcotics. Also, there are harmful side effects to consider, such as liver damage, kidney disease, and heart disease from long term use of ibuprofen. I needed to find an alternative and I found one, kratom. From the first use I was astounded. The relief was almost immediate after ingesting a relatively small amount (about one and a half teaspoons mixed with juice). I haven't experienced any negative side effects, beyond the awful taste. I don't experience any dizziness, nauseousness, or sleepiness as I sometimes do with the opioid pain medicine. It doesn't always get rid of the pain, there are times when I still need the opioids; but since I discovered kratom I've been able to significantly reduce my use of prescription pain meds and ibuprofen. And I can function completely after taking kratom; there is no impairment like there can be with opioids. \n\nWhen I learned that the DEA was seeking to classify kratom as a schedule I narcotic I was deeply dismayed. I'm only one person but I know how much it has helped me and to classify this plant, a cousin to coffee, as a dangerous narcotic with no medical potential is short-sighted and arbitrary. It needs to be studied and researched and a schedule I classification will make it extremely difficult, if not impossible to do so. I urge you, I implore you...table this emergency classification and allow the scientific and medical community to continue its work regarding kratom. Discovering kratom was life changing for me; I know I'm not the only one. The community of Americans suffering chronic debilitating diseases deserve for every, and any, potential treatment to be fully examined. Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21155","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for putting off the emergency scheduling long enough to allow public commentary.  \n\nMy wife suffers chronic stabbing pelvic pain due to endometriosis. Her doctor had her on norco and it wasn't helping and after doing some DNA testing she determined that her body does not metabolize opiates very well. That is why it helps with some of her pain like toothaches, but doesn't even touch the stabbing sensation she feels every day of every month because of her incurable condition. Even hysterectomies do not always take away endo because it can spread to intestines, and even other organs like the lungs. It causes legions and scar tissue everywhere and is extremely painful. She had a surgery that didn't help at all.\n\nThis plant mitragyna speciosa (aka kratom) is a mild plant related to coffee. It's not an opiate although it acts similarly. It is much more effective against pain and it doesn't give her the high, fuzzyheadedness of pain pills. It leaves her clear headed, virtually pain free and she can take care of our daughter while I work and feel like she has a wonderful mother. Before She found it She was suicidal because she just wanted to enjoy her life with the baby we always wanted and not be curled in a ball in pain all day. She doesn't want to feel like a burden to me and our daughter and her other loved ones.\n\nPlease do not take my wife away from me.  I only just got her back from all this pain a couple of years ago.  Her doctor is aware that she takes this plant and is glad she found something that helps her.  Don't take her from me and our daughter.  She is so happy right now and so full of life.  She wants to teach yoga when our daughter gets in school.  Don't take her dreams away from her by forcing her back into her chronic pain and suicidal thoughts.  \n\nThis plant should be available for responsible adults.  Teens and children probably shouldn't have access to it until more research is done, but it has had no ill effects on my wife in the 2.5 years she's taken it or any of her friends that take it.  It's only given their lives back.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and thanks for letting us comment.  Please have some empathy for chronically ill people and don't turn them into criminals or take their plant away.\n\nSincerely,\nCasey","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1263","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"casey burton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello \nMy name is Robert Lopez and I recently started taking Kratom.

My daughter is much too young to get on the \"sedation train\" that many people with similar issues settle into during their adult lives.  She wants more out of life, now and in the future, and Kratom is helping her do that without side effects or feeling like a different person.\n\nI cannot say whether or not Kratom is abused or how dangerous it can be in high doses.  I can say that small quantities are beneficial, and intelligent people should be able to choose them after review just like other supplements.  I would welcome some research and endorsement from the FDA, but it should not be a schedule I substance.\n\nIf Kratom were unavailable, abusers would seek other, likely more dangerous substances, while those who benefit from Kratom would have little options.\n\nPlease consider allowing Kratom to be treated as a supplement.\n\nThank You, Carolyn Spence and daughter Sarah Spence","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4280","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carolyn Spence","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not make kratom a schedule 1 drug.

I would be detrimental on not just the issue of well-being, but economics as well.  Most people who use kratom are not teenagers wanting a quick and legal high, but functioning adults using an herbal supplement perceived and counted on to help them live and be productive, in the same way that a diabetic may need insulin to survive. \n\nIn our current economy with its limited employment prospects, job loss as a result of kratom being scheduled is another consequence that needs to be understood, including job loss within the kratom industry itself.\n\nI am allergic to seemingly every pain killer sold OTC or prescribed.  My throat closes up when I take aspirin, Advil, etc., and I started using kratom several years ago due to back pain and no cartilage in my knee as a result of gained weight from a thyroid condition, weight that I have since lost, but still have after-effects from when it was there.  A friend of mine at one of my churches told me about it after he noticed me limping from my knee problem.  He had a similar issue that I was surprised to learn about. and I was skeptical at first about its potential to be effective, but I was just as surprised that he could barely walk before he tried kratom.  He walked like he never had a problem.  I ordered some online from a vendor he recommended, and was pleasantly surprised to say the least.  I play keyboard instruments that use hands and feet, and could manipulate like I could before the pain made it more difficult.  A bonus was better state of mind, because I worried less about how my playing would be affected by my back and knee.  A ripple effect took place here, for the good, just like potentially a ripple effect from it being taken away could be extremely damaging to the mere existence of many.  As a musician, I do not make that much money, and I cannot afford to miss jobs and work because of medical issues.  Until I found kratom, again, nothing worked.\n\nLike I stated before, kratom is not a drug someone would take to get high, it is a dietary supplement taken to treat a chronic condition, something some people need to take to feel \"normal,\" productive and contributing.  I also need to take magnesium and fish oil to help with anxiety, and those are supplements that are seen as healthy for the body as well.  I believe kratom could be good for bodily health in general, and even though that idea has been communicated quite a bit, the published research is admittedly limited.\n\nAgain, the vast majority of people that use kratom do not use it to escape reality, as it does not make people \"high.\"  They take it to deal with their realities, whatever they are.  Kratom should not be seen as part of the problem, but a definite solution, especially now, especially today.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2323","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA, \nMy name is Ryan and I am 30 years old.

Clients could not get loans to do their big projects, and most were not choosing to spend funds on projects that were not absolutely necessary. I was one of the many who were laid off due to lack of business. \n\nI was out of work for a few years, and eventually was hired to work in a very busy customer service position.

I was moved to a less demanding position, but ultimately I had to leave the company, because all their types of jobs would exacerbate my injuries. \n\nI went through many months of physical therapy, and completed the program with a certain degree of daily pain remaining. At this point, I happened to find out about kratom. I tried it, and it has been a remarkable tool for me to help me be a lot more productive and to move more comfortably. \n\nSince the DEA moved to schedule this plant, I have learned of the amazing benefits that have been won for so many people with severe physical and psychological problems. I have made it a point to search out their stories, on YouTube (#iamkratom) and in print. Anyone who would do the same could not fail to be awed by the benefits of kratom, and happy that so many people have been able to move into their futures with renewed hope and health. \n\nWhile my pain and injuries are moderate to minor at this point, I truly hope that for my sake, but even more for the people with severe conditions, that kratom is NOT scheduled, and that everyone is able to continue ingesting this plant that has literally given so many back their lives.\n\nThank you so much for reading and considering our comments.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5221","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 52 year old married woman.

I was in a bad car accident when I was 17 and caused 3 slipped/bulging discs and a pinched nerve in my lower back, on top of vertebral sclerosis that I was already beginning to develope in the exact same area.  I believe I also sustained some injuries in my neck that weren't as severe,  but I don't have the extra money to get more MRIs and costly regulard doctors visits to find out.  At such a young age,  the doctors all wanted me to take narcotic pain killers workout having any long term solutions to deal with the pain, other than surgeries that have many potential risks and more drugs. I was adamantly against the idea of relying on drugs for any extended period, but after a few years the constant pain caused me to eventually give in to their recommendations. After only a few months I experienced myriad of negative effects ranging from depression to lethargy and mood swings,  along with feeling the need to take them regularly.  I stopped taking them shortly thereafter because I felt it becoming extremely detrimental to my overall wellbeing. I dealt with the pain for a few more years until being introduced to kratom by a naturopath doctor.  The first time I took it I felt such relief it was amazing.  It didn't cause any impairment or lethargy,  I just felt relief and almost a bit of energy.  It has made such a positive difference in my life and my ability to be productive and work harder without pain than I'd been to in a long time with no side effects,  I can't imagine why anyone would ever want to make such a miraculous plant illegal. I've consumed it when necessary on a regular basis for the past 5 years with no ill effect, I've had my liver and kidney function along with all my blood levels tested yearly and my doctor has seem morning but improvement in my overall health.

They aren't kids or drug addicts looking to get high (you can't get high from it, if you over consume it, you will become nauseous and most likely throw it up in a sort of self regulating fashion), they are everyday people,  a lot of which are very productive members of society and you'll do them immeasurable harm by talking away this amazing natural herbal remedy.

The condition is generally treated with opiate drugs and surgery. Since my initial diagnosis 7 years ago, I have been on several rounds of drugs including Neurontin (gabapentin) and Tegretol (carbamazepine) as well as Oxycontin. All of these drugs have profound side-effects and great potential for abuse and addiction. In my search for more effective, less addictive treatments, I began using kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) extract. To me, it has been a blessing! Brewed in a tea or taken in extract form, it is no more addictive than a cup of coffee and has almost zero side effects. It effectively kills pain without impairment of any kind. The only side-effect I have noticed, based upon long experience with this plant, is nausea or vomiting if one takes too much (an effect which makes \"recreational use\" of this substance in high doses frankly ridiculous--unless projectile vomiting is somehow cool now?). \n\nWhen used correctly, the plant is well-tolerated, essentially non-toxic and highly effective. So naturally, the DEA needs to ban it? As a sufferer of chronic pain, I can tell you that would be a tremendous mistake! As an American, I cannot help but reject the DEA's war upon Nature as it attempts to declare yet another plant illegal as it has done with marijuana (another plant whose medical benefits are now well-known). It is not in the purview of any government agency to determine how something that can be found growing in your own garden can be used by a citizen. In other words, one does not ban grapes because they can be made into wine which can then go on to have adverse effects in the world. This concept is called \"freedom.\" I note the DEA has never moved to ban tobacco (a substance with proven detrimental effects on the body), neither would I suggest it do so despite the overwhelming evidence to that effect. Why? Because if people choose to smoke tobacco they should be free to do so. There's a warning label on the product indicating the negative health effects. That should be the limit (along with some common sense measures to protect people from second hand smoke) of the government's involvement in this. Or is the DEA's real agenda here to keep people like me dependent on Big Pharma's expensive and dangerous remedies?\n\nYour submission guidelines say I should give factual accounts and scientific evidence to support my views. I could well ask: How much scientific review has the DEA done on this or frankly almost any drug it has seen fit to ban in the public interest? Apparently little to none. So just to review, if alcohol (which killed 88,000 people last year) is legal and cigarettes (which kill approximately half a million Americans every year) are legal then kratom (which has killed no one) should stay legal and available. There has not been a single case of kratom by itself causing a death when not mixed with other substances. I'm frankly surprised that that simple fact has escaped the notice of the DEA, but perhaps I shouldn't be. After all the DEA does have a long history of ignoring well-established medical facts, as in the case of marijuana or even LSD (an alkaloid which was used quite successfully to treat chronic alcoholism and as an adjunct to psychotherapy for decades before it was capriciously banned by the same agency that would deprive people like me of virtually the only effective treatment for my particular condition). If any of what I have said about the history and medical benefits of any drug I have mentioned herein (cannabinoid or alkaloid) strike the reader as strange, then such a reader has either a) no experience with the substances in question or b) no knowledge of them. In either case, such a reader should not be in the position to make policy on such substances, plain and simple. Yet, the ignorance contained in the DEA's proposed ban demonstrates profound lack of knowledge and experience. One is forced to question the wisdom of an agency that would permit the sale and consumption of truly toxic and dangerous substances (because it fears the economic backlash from a ban on such substances) but would ban a plant that, like marijuana, has never been shown to be toxic when taken by itself.\n\nTherefore, on this scientific basis and for the benefit of everyone that uses this plant for pain relief and overall health and well-being, I urge you to dismiss this proposed ban.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1843","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Leporati","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14794","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Becca Greenstein","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is one of the most amazing plants on this Earth. It is completely natural, has been used for over 2000 years, and by containing natural alkaloids it can help reduce pain and help ween people off of prescription opiates. People die every day from opiate overdoses prescribed by doctors who think they are doing people a favor and then these people become addicted to these drugs. Kratom is non-addictive, and even when people with addictive personalities use more than an average person would, it is never in excess because no one has ever overdosed on Kratom.\nBanning the plant because pharmaceutical companies want a monopoly on certain alkaloids is protecting an industry and wants Americans to become addicted so they keep making money. \nI use Kratom, not because I am an opiate addict or have chronic pain, but as a mood elevator much like coffee. A small amount will make me focused and slightly energetic which helps me be more active, and therefore healthier, and also more focused on the job I am doing. I am fully in support of it and only wish that more research be done on this plant so we can help as many of our fellow Americans as we can.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9178","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jairek Maholm","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"}],"totalNumRecords":23226}
