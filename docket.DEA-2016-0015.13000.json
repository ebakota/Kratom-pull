I am writing you today to express my sincere concern over the potential regulation of the alkaloids found in Mitragyna Speciosa (Kratom). I do not believe these compounds warrant a Schedule I classification for many reasons. Kratom is in no way in the same category as heroine and cocaine. I am actually quite shocked that the DEA was planning on giving this herb such an extreme classification.\n\nI have been personally using Kratom intermittently for about five years and have found it an invaluable resource. My job requires me, at times, to work incredibly long hours for several days in a row, particularly when we are producing an event. Using kratom has proved to be the most effective way to sustain long hours of work, especially when physical exertion is required, with no unwanted side effects. \n\nI am also an extreme athlete and from time to time I sustain an injury during these activities. I have had two knee surgeries, a serious back injury and a hip flexor strain which have all proved to be quite painful. Traditionally I would be prescribed an opiate pain medication for severe pain which was quite effective for killing pain, but made me feel uneasy, nauseous and on edge. After discovering Kratom, I was able to replace these opiate medications and not suffer from the side effects that traditional pain medication often created for me.  \n\nKratom and the alkaloids found therein are not addictive in my experience. I have been able to use kratom for extended periods of time (up to three months) when recovering from an injury and been able to stop using the herb with no withdrawal symptoms. This was not the case after my back injury when I had to use percocet for three months and went through a one month weening and withdrawal period. \n\nI must also mention that my wife suffers from chronic fatigue and was able to find remarkable relief from her condition with one of the strains of kratom available for energy, a green strain from Sumatra.\n\nKratom is in the coffee family, it has miraculous properties that treat a wide ranging scope of conditions. in my experience it is non addictive, affordable, and readily available. To ban this herb would not only cause me to lose an incredible resource, it would severely impact hundreds of thousands of U.S. Citizens negatively. \n\nIt is also my understanding that the red strains of kratom help heroin addicts stay off of heroin. In a time when heroin and opiate addiction is affecting so many lives and killing so many people, banning Kratom and the alkaloids contained therein would be, in my opinion, incredibly counterproductive. Please keep Kratom legal and available to those who need it. And please keep it legal and available for those, like myself, who find it very useful in raising the quality of my personal and professional life. \n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nMarshall White","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15038","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marshall White","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom to me is a wonderful plant that I can take in place of many different pills that,in my opinion,can be far more detrimental and costly to the body and the wallet.Kratom for pain and for anxiety,among other far more serious ailments,is a wonderful alternative to pharmeceuticals and otc medications that one would have to consume in sometimes large amounts depending on an individual's situation.As a safe and non toxic alternative,and so many less side effects,it is a natural wonder that needs to be given a fighting chance before uneducated and just ignorant individuals take this away from people who can benefit so much from it!

The side effects of Kratom are nearly non-existant from my experience. I have gone weeks without it after daily use with no issues or side effects. From my experience Kratom is very similar to Coffee, although Kratom has a mood enhancement element. I ask that you please listen to everyones stories about how this plant has saved their quality of life in one way or another and do not take away the medicine we need. I feel that pharmaceutical industries are perhaps putting pressure on your organization to take some of these low cost healthy natural alternatives out of our society. I believe this is a crime and would ask that you do not succumb. To say that Kratom causes death is false. Any of the 15 or so cases people refer to involves pharmaceutical or other elicit drugs. Kratom on its own is not harmful. Leave it up to the states to decide if they want to ban it or not. Without Kratom I would not be as healthy, happy, or productive of citizen.

During that time, I was misdiagnosed with countless diseases and ailments, undergoing unnecessary testing and even surgery, in an attempt to figure out what was wrong with me.  I have been prescribed with both short and long term narcotic pain medications for much of my life, along with many other pharmaceuticals that I was told would \"fix\" me.  All any of this ever did was steal life from me, making me more unhealthy and much, much sicker.  At one point, I was prescribed pain medications that are used only for terminally ill patients - this is how bad off I had become.\nBecause of my health, I have lost my career, my life savings, and even my family.  Instead of giving up, however, I chose to take matters into my own hands, learning about diet and natural remedies for dealing with pain and suffering.  One of the natural remedies I was introduced to was Kratom, something that has undoubtedly improved my life by leaps and bounds.  \nI use Kratom to help me deal with a number of different medical issues I suffer from, including pain, insomnia, lack of energy, and depression.  Kratom works based on the strain used and the amount that is consumed, all of which can yield different results for the user.  \nIf Kratom becomes illegal, I will lose the only substance that helps me with break through pain, energy, and helping me sleep.  Nothing else works.  I will be forced back into the western medical system to seek help, likely at a pain clinic where I will be given the same narcotics that have caused so much pain and suffering in the country already.  I see this as a huge freedom being taken away from me - the right to treat myself and my disease with the remedies I choose.  \nMaking Kratom illegal makes absolutely no sense.  It is plant medicine that actually works, with no side effects present what-so-ever.   I have been using the herb for over 4 years now, and have never felt addicted.  When my Lyme Disease is an inactive state, I may go a week or two without even thinking about Kratom.  When I do need it, though, it makes ALL of the difference in the world.\nPlease reconsider the proposed scheduling and ban of this substance.  It would harm for more citizens than anyone realizes, making the opiod and heroin epidemics we now face even worse.  Much worse.  This would be taking the only thing away from people that could actually help them.  \nThank you for your time.\n\nSincerely, \nNathan N.

I lost my house, my car, my friends, my girlfriend, stole from family and turned into a Devil. Opiates and addiction defy logic. Opiates are not a cure long term. I went to rehab and after I fell back into heroin. The three years ago I found Kratom. It made me feel normal enough not to ache and made me feel just normal enough to be happy and not think about drugs. Kratom has saved my life, saved my family, saved me as a person. Kratom is a gift from God. I am a very smart person. I know how the government works and who controls the government. If The DEA bans Kratom, its for money and big pharma.

I am a law-abiding citizen and have never been arrested.  I have two daughters, ages 25 and 28.  My 28-year-old daughter has struggled with an addiction to heroin for the past five years, first starting out with pain pills and then progressing to heroin.  It is indescribable the heartbreak, pain, stress and feelings of hopelessness my family has felt with watching helplessly what heroin/opiates have done to our beautiful, precious daughter and sister, as well as the despair and stigma she has felt for herself.\t\n\tAs a mother of a child with a substance use disorder, I have done everything in my power to help her in any way I can, without enabling her.  I have spent hours upon hours researching everything I can to help my child with her illness. Towards the end of last year, I came across an article regarding the benefits of Kratom in helping with opiate addiction as well as chronic pain, anxiety/depression, and multiple other ailments.  I spent months researching all the information I could get my hands on regarding Kratom, both the positives and negatives, as well as joining some groups to get a personal perspective on this plant.  I eventually made a choice to purchase some Kratom from a vetted vendor online.  I originally got it in the hopes of helping my daughter with her addiction, but in learning more, I decided it may help me with the anxiety/PTSD that I deal with on a daily basis as a result of my child being addicted to heroin.  I am not someone who has EVER used illegal drugs or been one who likes to feel \"out of control\", not even with alcohol.  I choose to always be aware of myself and know my surroundings.  I now take Kratom on a daily basis for anxiety and it has helped me immensely.  There is no out-of-control feeling, but rather a calmness, yet good-mood benefit that allows me to think clearly and not be afraid to leave my house and do everything required in day-to-day life.  As a mother of an addict, we are constantly on a rollercoaster cycle of hope, fear, grief, loss, hopelessness, and then hope again - depending on where in the addiction our child happens to be.\n\tThis past March my daughter came to me desperate for help with her addiction.  At that time I was able to help her detox in my home with me by her side, as I had the Kratom and was just waiting for the opportunity.  This was the second time I have watched my child detox.  The first time was a horrendous experience for both her and I, and she then shortly after returned to her addiction.  This time, with the help of Kratom, my daughter detoxed with very little opiate withdrawal symptoms other than some mild sweating.  It was amazing watching my child slowly come back to us, in fact with a good, positive attitude and mood and actually talking about and looking forward to her future; not the usual depression and fear that comes with beginning life after opiates.  She has now been clean and sober and returning to a normal life since that first day in March.  She has become productive and self-sufficient once again and not a negative influence on society.\n\tMy comments to the DEA are that Kratom has been a God-send plant for my family in so many ways and I feel it would be a huge mistake for the DEA to place this on the schedule 1 list of drugs/substances.  With the current opiate addiction epidemic in this country and the precious lives we are losing daily, this would be disastrous!!  There are so many more benefits to this plant without the negative effects that you (the DEA), have claimed.  There is no \"getting high feeling\" or passing out, no overdosing, and no suicidal thoughts with this plant.  I, personally, have stopped taking Kratom three different times this past year with absolutely no withdrawal feelings whatsoever.\n\tPlease do not place this plant on the schedule 1 list, but instead allow it to be studied further and left accessible to the many, many Americans taking this on a daily basis for help with addiction as well as anxiety/depression and chronic pain, etc.  There are many lives at stake with your decision.\n\tThank you for your time and consideration of my opinion.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nB.

Do you have someone in your family who struggles with addiction?  If not now, one day you will, and it might even be you.  Until you've seen or experienced what chronic illness can do to a person, you really can't know how important this issue of scheduling Kratom is to a huge group of people who just want to remain productive and live full lives.  Let the gentle kratom plant remain a choice for people who suffer everyday, whose lives would be misery without it.\n\nI am writing to strongly recommend and request that Kratom remain a legal substance, available from trusted vendors, to be used as a supplement the way it has been for thousands of years.   I think there is a lot more to learn from this plant and I hope it will be studied and I hope it can remain an available and  affordable option for people with addiction as well as people who already depend on it for pain relief.   \n\nI am a 56 year old mother of five children.  I also have a genetic disorder called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.   It is not curable.  And it is very painful.   When I tried to explain the pain to doctors years ago, no one wanted to help me get out of pain.   I tried physical therapy, anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxers and more, but my pain only became worse.   I begged for pain relief and I was called a drug seeker.  \n\nWhen I found out about kratom and decided to try it, I found that I could get through my days  and nights almost completely without pain.   Kratom is not a cure but it is helpful to the symptoms of pain and fatigue.   It does not affect my ability to drive, care for my family, make decisions, and most importantly, I have not suffered any harmful side effects.  \n\nKratom tea is a part of my daily routine, no different than my morning cup of coffee.   I do not believe it needs to  be regulated or scheduled.  If there could be a compromise, I would suggest that Kratom not be sold in gas stations or smoke shops, and not be packaged as if it is some type of drug.   I think that gives young people the wrong idea.\n\nKratom is a drug to be respected, learned from, and it needs to be available to everyone through vetted vendors.   In this time of chronic illnesses that no one in the medical field really has answers for, please do not take away the one thing that is giving hundreds of thousands of Americans their quality of life back.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1205","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sherri McInnis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello.\nI don't know who will read this and I don't know if this will make a difference.

Since nothing else worked I decided 7 years ago to do research to find out effective ways to leave opiate addiction behind so I could straighten out and live my life addiction free.  Considering that addiction is essentially a life sentence, on occasion I'll buy Kratom to drink in substitute for my coffee.  Since my years of wasting my life wallowing in heroin addiction & After I got straightened out (and it wasn't easy), I went back to college and obtained a baccalaureate degree in engineering. I'm enjoying a clean lifestyle drug free while making an honest living.   \n\nRespectively stating, I feel your ban on Kratom will eliminate positive outcomes for others like the one you just read.  Kratom gave me 0 withdrawal symptoms, and I was able to function normally after I drank a cup or two.  I would ask for you to kindly reconsider your ban for people like me who finding Kratom basically saved my life.  There is no need to take away the crutch some people use to keep themselves from playing Russian Roulette with 6 bullets also known as Opiate/Heroin addiction.

I have suffered for years with Post Polio Syndrome. No Rx pain med helps and the side effects are so destructive to my health even if they helped I would not take them. I am a 59 year old woman, disabled due to severe chronic pain, fatigue and mobility issues. I used Kratom for about a year prior to it becoming an illegal drug in Arkansas. I went from horrific daily pain severely limiting my quality of life to regaining an acceptable level of pain relief and function. Now I am back to the horribly painful, low quality life, and if I choose to use Kratom I can go to prison for 10 years, be charged with a felony, go broke paying fines, loose my passport and ability to even vote. All because I found a natural herb that controls my pain and fatigue that is perfectly safe with no side effects. Do you think that is fair or even reasonable??? I am extremely sensitive to all medications but have had no side effects at all from Kratom, but, I did not overdose or abuse it. I have never used any illegal drug in my life, never even been drunk, never smoked a cigarette. But if I use this herb as a medicine I am labeled a horrible drug addict. This makes no sense at all. It is easier to die from an overdose of Tylenol then it is from Kratom. It is totally unfair and extreme to ban this wonderful natural herb for the vast majority of people who don't abuse it and can benefit from it because a few idiots take extremely large doses and suffer the consequences. You do not consider banning Tylenol because some foolish people overdose and die, why then ban Kratom? (Acetaminophen overdose is actually the leading cause for calls to Poison Control Centers across the USmore than 100,000 instances per yearand, each year, is responsible for: More than 56,000 emergency room visits. 2,600 hospitalizations. An estimated 458 deaths due to acute liver failure.) NSAIDS cause many deaths from strokes and heart attacks, even the OTC ones like Aleve. But you don't ban them. (\"Conservative calculations estimate that approximately 107,000 patients are hospitalized annually for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-related gastrointestinal (GI) complications and at least 16,500 NSAID-related deaths occur each year among arthritis patients alone\"). Using OTC cold medicines for longer then a few days can cause Guillian-Berre syndrome, addiction or death with overdose, but your not planning to ban that. Make it a law not to sell to anyone under 18, but please do not ban it. The potential to save thousands of lives, improve the quality of life for millions is what Kratom offers. Banning Kratom is a senseless action that will be perceived as another overbearing move to remove the rights of many who are law aiding honest citizens who want to live a normal life without pain.

I have been prescribed everything from Tramadol to Hydrocodone for my pain. At one point I became addicted to Hydrocodone and had to stop taking it completely. The only medication I could take was Ibuprofen, which helped only dull the pain. About two years ago, I read about Kratom and decided to give it a try. For the first time in many months I was able to sleep through the night without waking up with back pain. Kratom has kept me off of prescription pain killers for two years.  I was very upset to see that there was a potential ban on Kratom and can't understand why the DEA would want to ban such a beneficial plant.  From what I have read, it appears that the reason the DEA is considering a ban has to do with a few reported deaths, all of which seemed to also have involved more other more potent drugs.   I cant imagine any deaths being cause solely by Kratom. When you consider all of the thousands of people who die as a direct result of alcohol, tobacco and prescription pain killers, it seems completely ridiculous to ban a substance like Kratom that helps so many people with pain.

Before that,  I was barely hanging on by a thread. I was exhausted and in a constant state of anxiety almost all my waking hours. I was (and am)  working 60-90 hours a week in my career field to barely support my family. However, I made too much to qualify for medicaid,  but couldn't afford my company's insurance in order to seek the proper medical treatment i needed for my mental health. \n\nMy husband, who also uses kratom,  introduced me to this life-saving herb. He had been taking it for a couple of years before to get him clean from his decade long addiction to prescription painkillers. \n\nThe tea he made for me made me feel like an actual person again. I was no longer scared to go outside or make a phone call or even have a conversation. Do any of you making this decision understand what it feels like to be terrified of everything around you for half of your life?  To truly be paralyzed with fear to do the most simple tasks?  That was my life from the ages of 10 to the age of 27. My fear of everything ruined my chances of finishing college and furthering myself to become a more productive member of society. It forced me to stay in an unhealthy relationship for several years because I was afraid of leaving. Anxiety ruined my future,  but kratom is giving me another shot at a happy life. \n\nI've tried all the anti-anxiety meds and antidepressants in the past. Most of them just made me feel like a zombie, if they didn't give me aggressive tendencies. Kratom is the only thing that works for me,  and gives me no side effects. \n\nThis is a plant. Not even as harmful as marijuana. I might only have antidotal evidence, but it has been a true lifesaver. Please use your time and resources for something that truly needs your attention. Leave kratom legal so millions of us can lead normal lives. \n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16000","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alyssa Thomas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"How is it possible for you to ban natural remedies while drug companies are allowed to prescribe us legal poison.

All research currently available on kratom has shown it to be extremely safe, with no deaths whatsoever attributed to kratom alone. The safety profile of kratom has been consistently shown to be safer than that of acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and I believe placing this botanical on Schedule I would be detrimental to society. This problem was demonstrated empirically when kratom was banned in Alabama, causing opiate overdose deaths to skyrocket (thealternativeexaminer.com/lawmakers-alabama-cost-citizens-lives/). It would halt all research into its beneficial effects, of which there are numerous showing highly beneficial which could help a significant portion of the population. Stopping research on this plant and arresting those who need its benefits would not only be harmful to the population, but would send a message that goes directly against and undermines modern medicine, science, and common sense.

I was seeing a doctor for 15 years who prescribed pain killers. Many pain killers and these were helpful though I did not like having to take so many. I went through MRI's, physical therapy, trigger injections, saw specialists who said there was too much damage for surgery so my only choice was to take the pain killers to manage getting through day by day with this exhausting pain. When I moved to Tennessee I went to see a new doctor with a 6 inch stack of my medical records showing all I have been through already. The firs thing the doctor told me was that he wanted me to start the whole process all over again, MRI's physical therapy, specialists. Mind you now I had no insurance at the time. I told him I could not afford to do all this again, and really should not have to. His reaction was to treat me like I was a criminal and order a drug test on me. The doctors have been intimidated into treating everyone like they are addicts, and will not prescribe narcotics to anyone. Where pain is involved everyone is under suspicion for being an addict. I am disheartened by how this country has become so paranoid that even people who genuinely need help dealing with pain day in and day out are just placated and denied medicine that actually helps. All because people abusing prescriptions I am made to be in constant pain. With all that said I am ever so hopeful that this Kratom I am going to try can help me to get through a day and alleviate the pain I deal with all the time. It seems that every time I discover something that I might be able to get that could help me is taken away, denied and banned. If this works I can save myself from beginning all of what Ive already been through with xrays, MRI's and all the other steps Ive already taken, and not bankrupt me to go through again with A $6,500 DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE. I implore you to please not punish people who deal with constant pain that are productive tax paying citizens of this country to let us get the help we need without feeling like criminals. Thank you so much for your time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4370","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Bianco","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a veteran of the United States Army and have been using Kratom for a little over a year.

I am 45 years old.  Putting kratom. In schedule 1 will do more harm than good. Hurting many people who use this safe plant to ease there pain and suffering. With this as schedule 1 many would be forced to use prescription opioids.\n\nBack in 2009, I was having terrible gastric problems.  I had tried many different diets to try to get control of the pain and discomfort I was feeling in my abdomen.  I tried lactose free, gluten free and many others, with little to no results.  The only time I felt halfway okay was when my digestive track was empty.  I was hungry, but not in pain.\n\nI made an appointment with a gastroenterologist and had both a colonoscopy and an endoscopy.  The doctor informed me that nothing was wrong, but my digestive tract was inflamed and irritated. She then informed me that I had Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\nI tried everything I could to get it under control, from probiotics to candida killer pills, even drinking straight Aloe Vera juice.  Any concoction I found from an internet search that didnt sound too crazy, Id try it.  They would fail, and Id move on to the next.  IBS affected my life.  It made me miserable, it made me cranky and it made me angry.  The ones closest to me got to see the bad sides of how IBS affected me.\n\nFast forward to August of 2014 when I started researching a plant based supplement that would give you energy, increased productivity, significantly less anxiety and a perpetual sense of well-being with minimal side effects.  I read all I could on the subject, and decided to give it a go.  I had no idea it would have such a profound effect, and no idea that it would basically put my IBS into remission.  You see, I didnt take it for that reason; it was just a side effect.  I took it a few times, and what I noticed was that when that its effects would wear off, my IBS symptoms would return.  I could not believe what it felt like to be free of IBS, and I also could not believe what IBS felt like when it returned!  I had been living with IBS for 5 years, and that feeling just became normal.  It was like being reborn, a new awakening to just how good I could feel.  All the pain and anger disappeared with just a small amount of plant material.\n\nPlease do not make this schedule 1. This will not help anyone.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11592","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Leonard Hodgdon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir or Madam,\nI would like to begin by expressing my appreciation for the comment period given for the evaluation of kratom.

My personal experience with jratom is that it is fairly harmless, certainly less so than alcohol and tobacco, and any withdrawal effects from its use are on par with those of caffeine.

I've use it occasionally like I do coffee.  It gives a bit of energy and makes you more social without fogging your mind. I know of businesses that serve this everyday thousands of times without incidents. You are trying to take rights away from people based on hearsay and media claims made by lying mothers tied to a drug treatment centers agenda.   You claimed it was an immenent public danger, wrong!  Half the people listed weren't even Americans and they drank a concoction of many different things.  The others all had polysub use/abuse. So, if I drink coffee after I shoot heroin and Overdose the caffeine killed me? Not to mention we all know alcohol kills someone every ten seconds but that's available everywhere, along with tobacco that kills every six. Kratom related deaths ZERO. Kratom overdoses ZERO. Ask trauma teams how many Kratom Overdoese they tend to-ZERO!  First responders-ZERO! \nI question the validity of labs shown. I have yet to see any convincing evidence to make these erroneous claims! What are the accreditation of said labs involved? They need to specify cause of death COD-r/o.  They need to explain what types of labs they do to reach any conclusion COD r/o. They are just reaching and cannot blame Kratom. \nI have been looking to have just one question answered-what is definitive medical answer to What Kratom OD - causing death would look like/present with on autopsy? No satisfaction in answering this question..There is individuals with Polysub use/abuse..No medical evidence to blame Kratom.

I've been struggling with chronic depression and anxiety for over 30 years. I couldn't hold a job for very long, I couldn't keep friends or relationships for very long. I had tried counseling and just about every medication for depression there is, but to no avail. I started using drugs, especially opiates to 'treat' my depression but it just made things worse.\nI eventually went to a methadone clinic for a couple years then switched to suboxone once it had been approved. I took suboxone for many years which did actually help keep myself clean for a while, but relapsed many times during that period. I had not sought more treatment for my depression and was desperate for help. I felt that it was time for me to get off suboxone and tried weaning my self off slowly. When I got down to 2mg my doctor said it was safe for me to stop. Well, it was not. I went into to withdrawals about 36 hours later. I tried to go cold turkey but after the second full day of withdrawals I decided to search online for something to ease the suffering. That is when I found out about kratom. I researched it for about an hour before I decided to purchase some. The next day when my package arrived I measured out the recommended amount and within a half hour the horrible withdrawal symptoms subsided. I actually felt good. Not high, but clear. I noticed that my depression was gone as well. I actually had an urge to be social. My insomnia disappeared and I was able to have a good nights rest. I finally felt like I had a 'cure' to my depression. I was able to feel normal. I felt what it might be like to see colors for the first time.\nThat was eight years ago. I was able to stop taking suboxone without any discomfort. And after a couple weeks of taking kratom I decided to take a break and see how I felt without it. There was no discomfort, but after a few days off I felt depression creeping back. So I only medicate myself with kratom a couple days a week and no withdrawals after abstaining. Yes, I do get a really nice relaxing/energetic feeling from taking kratom, it is no way a 'high'.\nBack on Sept 30th when I thought kratom, the plant that changed my life, was going to be scheduled right alongside heroin and LSD, I was stunned and depressed. I really didn't know what I would do. Then when the ban was postponed I was grateful and really happy that the DEA would actually listen to the people. I really hope you would consider not banning this miracle plant. I have read countless similar stories and know that there are others who suffer physical pain that depend on kratom for an easy, healthy alternative to addictive pain medication. Let researchers study this plant so we can use it to treat others.\n\nThank you again for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19978","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My boyfriend was a drug addicted, alcoholic mess due to genetics and dealing with chronic pain.

As a PhD biochemist, I value decisions and policies that are logically deduced from evidence, and I am writing here now because I believe the DEA's inclination to schedule kratom as a class I drug is scientifically unfounded and premature. Admittedly, I am likely not as well-versed in the specifics of kratom's side effects as are the outstanding members of our law enforcement community, but a cursory internet search turns up no evidence for death/serious injury and the most \"negative\" side effects I could find are related to withdrawal symptoms from long-term consumption of large dosages. Now, there seems to be some anecdotal evidence (once again, found on websites) to the addictive properties of kratom - I do not contest these claims as I have no evidence against them. However, this finding encapsulates the fundamental problem with kratom: there are not enough or any peer-reviewed investigations and clinical trials into the effects of kratom on the human body. Because this plant *does* provide health benefits to some people, particularly those dealing with addictions to legal drugs (such as oxycontin and vicodin), and does not seem to outright destroy the lives of responsible users nor those in the same community as users, I believe scheduling kratom as a class I drug would not fit the current definition of a \"drug, substance, or chemical...with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" I am grateful for the work the DEA does to keep our country safe from the perils of drug trafficking, addiction and abuse, but outlawing kratom may actually exacerbate opiate addiction and fuel a black market. I implore the DEA to first allow the generation of rigorous, peer-reviewed data concerning kratom's side effects, potential for abuse, and medical benefits before outlawing this plant.

I learned about this site from a podcast that I watch regularly.\nI have not used kratom. \nI used to smoke marijuana, and it improved my mood and gave me a thoughtful vacation from the stress of normal conciousness. but because of the harsh legal consequences, I had to give it up. It was unfortunate, but not something I couldn't live without. That was 5 years ago. \nSince then I've had to turn to legal methods of perturbing my consciousness, such as alcohol. The result has been that I am more likely to say and do unstable and aggresive things, and this has adversly affected all of my personal relationships. I am also prone to eat and drink other foods that are extremely bad for my health in the long run, because all caution goes out the window, even with diet, despite my extensive knowledge on nutrition. I have tried to stop, but alcohol has proven to be more psychologically and physically addictive to me than marijuana ever was. There was even a point, I remember, where I could smoke too much marijuana and think to myself \"okay, that's enough for today\". But with alcohol, unless I am so intent on regulating myself that it becomes hard to enjoy the \"buzz\", I can, and do, easily just keep drinking until I run out or pass out. I wake up with my kidneys hurting. \n\nMy point for writing this letter is that I know from personal experience what it is like to have one substance,  whose benefits to myself vastly outweighed any drawbacks, demonized and outlawed  into criminality. All  in the name of satisfying some sort of forced mass histeria, whipped up by propaganda and a few anecdotes of individual stupidity or irresponsibility.  The result historically, intentional or not, is that an adult loses the natural right to alter their consciousness or physiology through self medication, and giant pharmaceutical industries, tobacco companies, and alcohol manufactures, sell the individual a substitute that is more toxic, socially harmful, and/or addictive. And benift massively, I might add. \n\nThis is not a question of abuse, either. People abuse things. People abuse the right to drive, or eat fast food. Abuse is not the decision making issue. That crucial issue would be adult human autonomy and freedom. This puritanical and often supersitious feminization of naturally occuring substances, especially those with little to no history of harm overall, HAS to not only stop, but be reversed. \n\nIt can start here. If individuals feel they are benefiting from this substance (Kratom), and aren't harming others as a direct result of using it, I believe it is their birthright to do so. \nScheduling this substance would be a transgression on that right.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11951","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a kratom user for roughly the past year and a prescription opioid addict 3  years clean, I want to assert that the effects of each may bear SOME similarity, but to regard them as remotely equitable substances is way off base.

He is a registered nurse, and I work in the dental field. I have found kratom to help with my pain due to ankylosing spondylitis. I am unable to take opiates for my pain because I have sleep apnea & I am susceptible to respiratory depression. I drink kratom tea specifically because it absolutely does NOT cause respiratory depression & it seems to take the edge off my pain when Tylenol & ibuprofen aren't enough. After supplementing with kratom for over three years now, my blood work & urinalysis are healthy & normal. I also have insomnia, and it's one of the few things that can help me sleep without causing me respiratory problems. I find it to be safer with regard to respiratory depression than even valerian root & causes me less mental impairment than Benadryl. Also, I sometimes run out of kratom before buying more & I have noticed that I have literally no withdrawals when I am without. Not even a headache like I get when I miss my morning coffee.  However when I do skip my coffee, kratom does help with my caffeine withdrawal. It's important to understand that because kratom has been blamed for being mildly addictive just because it resembles addiction when people use it as a temporary crutch to get off of more addictive substances. I have found that people who use kratom for that purpose are no longer \"addicted\" to the kratom once they are passed the physical & psychological addiction to the original substance. And unless they get some other health benefit from it, like pain relief or anxiety relief, they are likely to stop using it after a time. Just because someone seems to \"need\" kratom while they break a drug addiction doesn't mean it's addictive in & of itself. Kratom is being labeled as an opiate but it's crucial to understand that there are deep & outstanding differences between the effects of kratom as an \"opiate\" & the effects of actual morphine or pharmaceutical opiates. Specifically, the side effects. Opiates are long known to cause respiratory depression, addiction, etc. & in spite of the insistence that kratom is an opiate, the vast majority of people using kratom know that it does NOT share these qualities with morphine derived opiates and pharmaceutical opioids. So if kratom is going to be classified as an opiate, we are going to have to re-define what constitutes across-the-board side effects for \"all\" opiates. Just saying that since kratom has an effect on opioid receptors, therefore it shares the dangerous qualities of other opiates, is completely unsound logic. I know that there have been reports of nausea and other negative side effects when people take too much kratom. It's important to note that the side effects that people experience from kratom are strikingly similar to the effects of drinking too much caffeine. After using kratom for a few years now, I am certain that the negative effects people complained of were most likely due to people who were trying to use kratom to induce some kind of high and they completely failed, because kratom is only effective in low to moderate doses. At best, it feels similar to having drank good coffee, but beyond that, like when you drink too much caffeine, it's going to make people feel icky. That is why you hear so much about kratom's built in prevention from misuse or abuse. If people take enough to feel very \"high\" (the ammount varies significantly from person to person), it's a VERY similar feeling to when you drink too much caffeine. But unlike even alcohol poisoning or taking too much opiates or Tylenol, it's far from an emergency situation. Just because there have been calls to emergency services due to unexpected side effects doesn't mean those who call are truly experiencing an actual emergency situation that threatens their health in any meaningful or lasting way. In fact, kratom seems to have more in common with caffeine than it does opiates & is far safer than opiates or alcohol. The only difference I can tell from coffee is that kratom has a mild pain relief quality that caffeine doesn't have, and ANY effect, positive or negative, is very short lived. It seems to lose effectiveness after 1.5 to 2 hours. The best thing that we could do for the public at this point is to educate them on how to use kratom, not to ban it altogether, which will cause pain patients to just rely more heavily on the opiates that actually DO have dangerous side effects & are KNOWN to cause harm, even with short term use. Please do not schedule kratom in any way. Just like coffee or kava, it is not an herb that needs any form of government regulation or medical supervision, whatsoever.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20410","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah LaFountaine","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"See attached file(s)Re.

Ever since a young age around the age of 16 I started to experiment with drugs. I started out on weed. Then progressed to pain pills, then progressed to cocaine powder form,then progressed to ecstasy, then progressed to crack cocaine, then tried heroin. My life spun out of control for over 10 years. I was in and out of jail and rehabs. Nothing ever worked to get me off of drugs completely. I would make it sober and clean for 4 months at the most. Then relapse, and let my whole family and myself down every time. You can look up my record in marion county florida court system. My record is long.  I am not proud of the stupidity of me all those years. Most people would say theres no way to fix that many mistakes for that long of a period.  I tried methodone clinics  for years. And not even that stopped me from wanting other drugs. Untill, one day I stumbled/ heard of this wonderful miraculous herb and plant leaf that was saving so many people. I tried it, IT DID NOT GET ME HIGH! But it brought me just enough relief through a better outlook on life that nothing ever has been able to do. As soon as I tried kratom. It COMPLETELY TOOK AWAY ALL MY DRUG URGES.  Nothing has ever been able to make me not crave a drug, except for kratom leaf that I make in a tea. And drink one little cup. It is not even close to adductive. I forget to take it all the time, so it cant be addictive.   Plus ive went  days without it no problem. Kratome saved my life. This NATURAL PLANT LEAF got a crack head off of drugs completely! Have you ever heard of any medicine or herb in the world that could do that? No,and I thought no to. Untill I tried it. Kratom has truly been a miracle . It saved my life. Most of my friends died because of addictions just as I have. Now kratom gave me a more than fighting chance. I HAVE BEEN SOBER NOW FOR A LITTLE OVER 6 YEARS NOW!!! Its amazing. This plant leaf COMPLETELY  HEALED ME! Thank  GOD that I have found a new start on life. And days get better and better every day.   P.s. - u am now  6 years plus a hard working construction worker in the villages Florida. I am making more money than I ever have. I have a pocket full of honest made money paycheck to paycheck. Because of Kratom, I can have a pocket full of money and still not be ever tempted to ever go back to drugs. Please dont ban Kratom. It has been a GOD send to me, lifesaver,  and miracle. I have tried thousands of things to get me off of drugs. And ONE PLANT WORKED for me which is kratom. Kratom has CURED ME 100% from drugs and alcohol. Take in consideration this plant us what will stop all those overdoses. It saved my life for one and know many others that say the exact same.  Kratom CURED ME and freed my completely from addiction. AND will testify and fight for this wonderful plant everyday. Because I speak the 100% honest truth.  I am Kevin Allen Keith of ocala florida.  Just know the power to save millions of people from drugs, to save lives, and turn around peoples lifes around for the better are in your hands. I hope and pray you make the right decision. The ban of this plant would mean the addicted will never get better. They will continue to die. With kratom, it saved my life for good. I hope more people can have the story I have now . And put away drugs forever. And never see them again.   Do the right thing please.  I dont ever want to go back down the road I was on for to long . This natural plant leaf saved me!

This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin.

I was skeptical at first since no one I asked had ever heard of it before. I used to be a smoker but quit 11 years ago. Since then, I have just learned to cope with my anxiousness and hide it from everyone. It never kept me from working but my hands were constantly sweaty and I was uncomfortable most of the time. In addition, my allergies were out of control. I probably sneezed 30 times a day at work and went through boxes of tissues and bottles of anti bacterial hand gel very quickly. I felt bad for my co-workers seated in my general vicinity.\n\nI started using kratom 1.5 years ago and it greatly improved my anxiety as well as my allergies.

If I were to argue for any type of regulation, I think Kratom should be regulated as an herbal supplement; that is, to be fit for human consumption, as long as no claims are made on its efficacy in treating or curing diseases.  If it were treated as such, vendors could be held legally liable should they add to or substitute a harmful ingredient for the claimed product.  This being said, there have still been no notable examples of any Kratom vendors taking advantage of its current unregulated state.  \n\nBecause Kratom does not have a notable record of causing harm to the public, it is unnecessary to add this substance to any federal drug schedule.  In fact, doing so could greatly reduce access to Kratom-- not just legally, but also financially.  Even if Kratom were placed in a lower schedule than C1, having to regularly visit a doctor in order to legally purchase a product that could potentially prevent them from addiction or relapsing to hard drugs, could prove to be an unnecessary obstacle that ultimately does more harm to the patient than good.  Having to visit a doctor is costly to most people, especially those that are uninsured or under-insured; fear of facing embarrassment of their addiction to a doctor, or having addiction on their \"permanent (medical) record\" could also prevent access to those most in need of Kratom.\n\nPlease listen to the people of this nation that are pleading for the DEA and FDA to allow Kratom to remain freely available.  DEA interference is not necessary, and because Kratom is not an imminent public health concern, there is no mandate for the DEA to get involved.  Kratom is fine as-is.  Please respect the sovereignty of citizens to their own bodies, and leave Kratom as-is.

Thousands of people die everyday from Tylenol  because it causes liver failure over time. Check the research. It's poison but kids can buy it from any drugstore. Ibuprofen tears up your stomach, intestine's, and kills your kidney's over time. If you don't believe me then do some research. The big pharma companies lie and say it's safe for everyone in small amounts. Of course they don't do studies on people that have taken Tylenol or Ibuprofen off an on for 50 years because they don't want to spend that kind of money on the tests and if they would not like the results from the studies. I have used both for pain and they destroy our bodies. Big pharma doesn't like herbal supplements because it cuts into their profits. If you ever want to know how bad %90 of all drugs on the market are just read the actual drug data. Not the sheets the pharmacist gives patients, the actual drug tests on animals and humans. If the pharmacist showed people the real data people would freak out and pharmaceutical sales would drop tremendously. So they do whatever they can to push their drugs on people. Through commercials, doctors, media, etc. They are legal drug dealers and so are the doctors that prescribe poision to people. They may do some tests on one blood pressure medicine but have you ever heard of them doing tests on patients being prescribed 15 different medicines over a long period of time. They killed my grandmother by over medicating her and my uncle as well. The doctors said they were helping him as their advice and medicine killed his kidneys. Now you want to ban an herb that helps thousands of people. The only reason I can come up with is either your getting paid by big pharma to ban Kratom or your scared of losing your jobs because your services will no longer be needed. Without a war on drugs you wouldn't have a job. If the war on drugs was over tomorrow you would be drawing unemployment.  The war on drugs has ruined millon's of lives, cost millions of taxpayers dollars, and made you guys lots of money. That's why your banning kratom. There is a pharmaceutical company that's coming out with a product similar to kratom so you ban it to help them out. Thank you for destroying another helpful herb. Maybe next you can ban cilantro.

I was abusing opiates to the tune of several hundred dollars per day. I had lost my mother, best friend, and my wife within a year. I couldn't beat my addiction and was seriously considering suicide. I couldn't imagine my life without pain pills and didn't see the point of going on. Kratom not only helped with the depression, but also helped me kick opioids and take my life back. \n\nI still use Kratom regularly; usually once a day. The difference is that even though it may be somewhat habit forming, (literally everything is) it doesn't take over your brain the way real opiates do. I can honestly say I've never craved Kratom. There are days when I don't take it, because I forget. That would never in a million years happen with opiates. I use Kratom and am a completely productive member of society. There's no getting high on Kratom really; it just makes you feel energized and hopeful. I use Kratom regularly, have a great full-time job, making well above the median income for my state (KY), I work out 5 times/week, have pets, and a serious girlfriend. I have a life, a good life. I truly believe I owe a large part of that to Kratom. If it is banned, I worry for the future. I'm an addict; without a little bit of help, I believe it's likely that I will relapse at some point and ruin my life...again. With Kratom, that's not really even a concern.\n\nThank you for your time. I hope you can see that Kratom is a life saver that should be utilized to fight the greatest drug epidemic this country has ever known. It helps so many and most people are not even aware of it. Think of all the good that could come of it with increased public awareness.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDave in Louisville","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13827","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dave Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I wanted to note that Mitragyna Speciosa-AKA Kratom, has helped me tremendously. I am 61 yrs old and I have had back issues since the 90's, which was the beginning of receiving pain medications such as; Codeine- Percocette-Morphine- Methadone-Fentanyl-that ultimately, almost killed me. After years of tolerance and strong medications I wound up having to go into rehab where I was for two months. After I left rehab I knew I could never do any opiates, or opioid form of pain medication again. My experience with them made me that wary of them, so there wasn't really much i could take that could really help. Then, I ran across an article about the leaves of the tree of the Migragyna Speciosa species, which, by the way, is in the same family as coffee. \nAs a result of my struggle with the opiates, I went back to school and I have obtained a degree in addiction -and alcoholism treatment. This plant Kratom, would not lead to the type of overdose a person might experience taking too morphine for example, because The therapeutic level of Kratom only works at a certain dosage, and if you take too much it makes you feel terrible! So, even if someone wanted to abuse it as someone who is taking oxycodone for example, and who would take additional tablets to increase the euphoria, does not work with crate them! In other words, someone trying to do too much Kratom, will only make themselves feel very uncomfortable- and maybe panicky! \nI cannot begin to get into how affective pray to miss me, and I only take it once a day in the morning. That means, even if I wanted to do it several times during the day, trying to recapture the initial feeling at the beginning of my day, does not work, so I am fine with taking it once a day in the morning, and I don't become overly sedated, so I can function much better because of the benefits I get from this plant!\nIf there are any questions that you need to get clear on, please feel free to contact me.

For many years I simply took over the counter aspirin, Excedrin migraine, for example. After a period of a few years, I was taking 4 to 6, sometimes 8 aspirin every day, and feared what I might be doing to my filters! I'd also tried numerous holistic remedies, meditation, massage, bio feedback etc...nothing was helping.  Eventually I happened on a neurologist who helped me find a workable combination that includes Sumatriptan for the bad days and Hydrocodone for the unbearable days. With the type of headaches I get, taking pain pills is very risky, as it is easy to develop \"rebound\" headaches, that is, headaches forming almost out of habit, seeking the pain relief it is accustomed to getting. Those headache loops are extremely detrimental to my life! I work in the airline industry (prior to this I was a college instructor, prior to that a Middle-School teacher), and I became useless on the days the headaches won out over medication. When I read about the analgesic properties of Kratom, I ordered a small amount, made the tea, and it changed my life. While I still take Sumatriptan for the bad days, I can't remember the last time I needed Hydrocodone...less than once a month. To be clear - I never needed or used Kratom to wean off of any type of addiction - My situation is simply that it took this long to find a maintenance plan that worked for my chronic headaches, that doesn't involve ulcer causing pills, and I don't want to lose it!

I have been employed for 27 years\nMy story begins about 5 years ago when I started feeling hip and lower back pain.  I attended a rehab center for Alcohol abuse 6 years ago and I saw so many others there that were addicted to opiates and heard about their struggle.  I saw several Dr's, massage therapists and chiropractors to try to find out what was wrong with me.  The Doctors told me that my frame was shifting because of my overcompensating for the pain and that it was causing spinal compression.  In trying to stay with my commitment to not take any harmful drugs or alcohol I tried to \"deal\" with the pain.  It became unbearable after 3 years.  The Doctors could not determine what was going on and were recommending spinal exploration.  Under their urging they gave me Oxycontin, Tramadol and a few other drugs that I don't recall.  That just masked the pain but didn't get to the bottom of the cause.  I felt lethargic and not wanting to get out of bed.  A colleague of mine suggested kratom tea to maybe try to reduce the pills that my Dr's wanted me to take.  After 3 days I was only taking 1 pill at night.  After 2 weeks I wasn't taking any at all.  I started exercising again.  My muscle structure came back.  My Massage therapists was able to finally work out the solid mass that was preventing my chiropractor to adjust me properly.  My Chiropractor was amazed to finally see after 3 years that I was progressing.  My Dr. finally noticed something in my MRI that the possible problem was osteoarthritis.  A specialist confirmed and I ended up getting a hip replacement last year.  My pain is gone and I rarely take kratom anymore.  But without Kratom I may be another statistic. My Father has a similar story.  He is finally living again and active in his community after years of staying at home bedridden because of his many surgeries.  He is a Mormon grandpa that is anti drugs and alcohol. Kratom has saved his life.  We have a grandpa again.  We both assure that we have never gotten \"high\" off of Kratom.

I've suffered from chronic back pain for years. I was constantly at the doctors trying to figure out how to fix the problem. I saw specialist, received x-rays, received MRIs, had rounds of spinal injections. Nothing fixed the problem. So in the end (and during) the doctors decided the best route for me was to manage my pain with prescription opiate pain killers. In their defense, they were very hesitant about sending me down that path. Particularly because I'm fairly young, I'm in my late 20's, and they are well aware of the dangers of these drugs. \n\nI fairly quickly become addicted to opiate pain killers. I was in denial about it for a long time, but when the prescriptions ran out and the withdrawal kicked in it became apparent. I was completely addicted. I tried many times to quit, usually cold turkey. I've had withdrawals more times than I can count. I can't begin to describe the complete and horrific unimaginable suffering that is opiate withdrawals. If you haven't experienced it, you cannot understand it. Every fiber of your being is in complete agony. There is no sleep, no escape, and no break from it for weeks. After that, you feel like an empty fragile shell for months. It is hellish. \n\nNo matter my efforts, I couldn't escape my addiction. Once you are an addict, it never leaves you. You now know that feeling of amazing relief and comfort exists. From now on there will always be a voice in the back of your head telling you it can take away all your pain again. I couldn't always get prescriptions and because the low dosages wouldn't last my high tolerance very long, I had to turn to buying scripts off the street. I started spending amazing amounts of money on far more potent prescriptions, and I was dealing with dangerous people to get them. This put me in a state of financial desperation, and since I was constantly having withdrawals I was barely working at all. I became extremely despondent making me very depressed about my situation and only strengthening my reliance on my opiate escape. I started using heroin on occasion since it was cheaper and stronger. My life was falling apart. \n\nI started to watch as everything spiraled downward. I couldn't keep a job. I had no money for food and was losing weight rapidly. I behaved erratically around my friends and family. I lost my girlfriend of three years. I did and said things I'm still ashamed of. The worst part was that I hid all of this from my friends and family. I even hid it from my girlfriend. She left because I couldn't get my life together and she didn't understand why. I was too embarrassed and too ashamed to ask for help. I couldn't put my family through that I thought. I didn't want to bring that kind of disappointment to them. Plus, I knew people don't have sympathy for drugs addicts. They see it as weakness and selfishness. So, apart from a couple very close friends, I suffered in silence.\n\nI was going to die if I didn't get away from this addiction. I had overdosed more than once already, and I was also mixing any other drug I could find with the opiates to attain a more intense effect to cope with my now severe depression. I was being extremely reckless and dangerous. Honestly, part of me wanted to die. It felt like the only way I could truly escape. It felt like what I deserved. There were too many mornings that I was surprised that I woke up. I decided I had enough. I couldn't exist like this anymore. If I was going to live, it wasn't going to be like this. \n\nI weaned myself down the best I could off the remaining pills I had left, and I proceeded to battle through withdrawals. This time I couldn't go back. I had absolutely no money, and I had severed ties with my supplier. So I fought hard. I exercised and did yoga daily, I ate as healthy as I could, I spent time with friends, I took whatever natural supplements I could. This included kratom. I had read about kratom, and upon trying it I was absolutely amazed. It was the only thing I've ever taken that gave me some real relief that wasn't just trading one addiction for another i.e. suboxone or methadone. I couldn't afford a lot of it at the time, but it gave me hope that there was real help out there. \n\nAfter 3 months of being clean I started craving opiates again. But this time I turned to kratom instead. It's far more affordable, it's way safer, and it's currently legal. I think it's worth mentioning that there is no romance with kratom like there is with other drugs. It tastes pretty horrid, so choking back a tbsp isn't exactly something I look forward to. kratom has kept me from sliding back into addiction. It helps my pain, and it completely robs me of my desire for opiate pain killers. It has some addictive qualities, but they are akin to the addiction dangers of coffee. My life is back to being wonderful and I owe a lot to kratom for helping me get here.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1595","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Criminalizing drug use is useless. 1/ It is a massive expense. 2/ It is not effective in  reducing drug use. 3/It destroys peoples lives for ever. 4/ It only serves to put money into private prisons. 5/ It leads to whole countries in South America becoming the new mob making money out of prohibition. 6/ It, at times, takes out of circulation drugs that are useful. e.g. psychedelics and substances such as marijuana that have a number of beneficial medical uses.

I'm an IT administrator. While going to college for IT Security, I was in a car accident and began using Norco and other opiates to deal with the pain. That quickly became an issue for me. I stopped going to college, began using more and more Norco from the streets, and although I always held a job, I didn't have any extra money to put back into the community. I began using Kratom two years ago and was able to EASILY get off the 8-norco-a-day binge that had consumed my life for 5 years. Since then I have completed my Bachelors Degree and am quickly advancing in my carrer. I very rarely even use Kratom anymore, however I'm writing this because I FIRMLY believe without it I would still be stuck on Suboxone or some other harmful replacement. I believe Kratom can provide relief much safer (although we truly need more studies done to confirm) than syntetic drugs like Fentanol or Suboxone.\n\nIf this were a Schedule 1 drug when I tried to kick the habbit, I don't know that I would have per the mulitple failed attemps before Kratom.

I have been using Kratom for approximately a year-and-a-half. I in no way feel that I am addicted to this wonderful plant. Matter of fact I have stopped using it 3 times and I had no ill effects from stopping such as withdrawal symptoms. \n\nKratom has done several things for me. First and foremost it has allowed me to completely stop drinking alcohol which I may have been close to having a problem with. Secondly I truly believe it has helped my depression. While I do take a prescription for depression kratom is a great add-on supplement to decrease my depression. Lastly it helps me to relax in the evening after a difficult days work.\n\nI am a regular law-abiding Natural Born US citizen who takes this matter very seriously and ask you to seriously reconsider your proposed ban of Kratom. I pay my taxes and also vote regularly and I will use any pressure I can to help this cause. It would make it very difficult if not impossible 2 research all the positive effects that Kratom may have if your ban goes through\n\nReading and listening to the news I hear how bad the narcotic addictions or in our society. And also from what I understand kratom has the possibilities of helping addicted people quit. Why would you ban a substance that could possibly help tens of thousands of people? And from everything I read Kratom is extremely safe and the supposed 15 deaths caused by kratom are actually easily attributed to other substances found in the deceased systems.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6453","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Sic","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My mother has sever nerve pain and is weening off of opiates.

I am writing to plead with you to not make kratom a scheduled drug.  Myself like many others would suffer the consequences of such action.  I was addicted to prescription pain medication for fifteen years and upon discovering kratom I was able to stop taking opioid pain medication with little to no withdrawl symptoms.  I have not taken any prescription pain medications in two years, the kratom helps keep me balanced, takes away the pain and I have no desire to take opioid pain medications.  I am a healthcare professional and have seen the ravages of drug addiction, I believe that kratom is and has the potential to help many people who suffer from addiction.  In closing I would just like to ask one question, what now? What now for all the people that kratom has helped? It would be a tragedy if even one person relapsed and started taking dangerous narcotics because they were not able to get kratom anymore if it becomes a scheduled drug.  Thank you for taking the time to read my story and the many others.  Please consider keeping kratom legal so we can continue to thrive and be productive members of society free of the ravages of drug addiction.

High dosages produce a similar unpleasant experience like too much caffeine.\n\nI am in favor of funding research that will lead to dosage control knowledge of the various beneficial alkaloids, and potential mitigation of the unpleasant effects such as queasiness, over stimulation, and wobbliness.\n\n Any substance can be abused. Anyone can walk into a drug store and buy enough aspirin or acetominophen to cause death. Kratom should not be restricted as a Schedule I substance just because some people take too much of it.

It helps me with energy, anxiety and motivation. It is more mild that caffeine in my experience with less side effects. \n\n It is impossible to overdose on on it's own as it DOES NOT cause respiratory depression. \n\nThe claims of kratom related deaths made by the DEA, under close examination, do not prove kratom itself is fatal as there were multiple substances in the blood of every death save one. There is no evidence that this death was caused by kratom as the person had a history of unrelated health problems.\n\nAlso, with hundreds of thousands of known kratom users, the 428  calls to poison control related to kratom over a 5 year period the prove that kratom is SAFE not dangerous.\n\nCompare these calls to the following substances over the same period.\n\nCaffeine = 23,203 calls\nEssential Oils = 66,300 calls\n\n\nEchinacea (1,464 case mentions, with 1,149 single-substance reports), \nGinkgo Biloba (681 cases, 413 single-substance reports), St. Johns Wort (1,173 cases, 717 single-substance reports), Valerian(1,499 cases, 778 single-substance reports), Kava Kava (342 cases, 196 single-substance reports), Ginseng (638 cases, 412 single-substance reports) and Yohimbe (1,246 cases, 985 single-substance reports).\n[Kratom only = 428 calls to poison control]\n\nFlorida discussed banning Kratom in 2014, 2015 and 2016 but after thorough examination elected not to restrict it in any way. Several other states chose the same. ONLY in states where there was no opportunity for public comment and no thorough examination was kratom banned. \n\nI realize that the DEA is wanting to alleviate what it thinks is a danger. But if they were to ban it, there would be far-reaching unintended consequences. \n\nMany use kratom tea to help their chronic pain as an alternative to prescription opioids (which killed over 28,000 in 2014) and nsaids (acetaminophen killed over 1500 over a ten year period). If kratom were scheduled, many would turn to substances proven without speculation to be deadly and addicting. \n\nAlso, kratom provides jobs to thousands of tax paying American entrepreneurs who will be put out of work. Our economy needs more of these people NOT less.\n\nWorst of all, a schedule 1 ban will HALT ALL RESEARCH on a potential plant based supplement alternative to deadly prescription opioids and the street heroin epidemic. \n\nThe evidence is clear. Kratom must remain an unscheduled plant supplement. We have much more important things as a nation to handle. We must stop spending our tax money putting people in jail for the use of natural plants. \n\nThank you.\n\nMarc Hlavac","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16254","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marc Hlavac","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Harmless plant I like to use when I'm sore from workouts.

I've recently started taking it the last couple months. I started taking it almost daily. There were so many positives I've seen from my boyfriend taking it that I wanted to check it out. Due to my job, standing on my feet all day and stressful work situations and day to day life stressers and having majot back pain most  of my adult life. I couldnt believe after my first dose of Kratom that I felt so much more calm but still energized and was able to focus better on tasks. My back pain slowly went away. It felt like the pain didn't even exists anymore. My ability to handle people and situations became so much easier, it took the anxiety away just like that.

It's that feeling you have when you are in horrible pain and want it to stop and think the United States would be a place where freedom consists of freedom from pain. I do not think human beings were given Kratom just to make it illegal. How many times do we hear that someone used Kratom and proceeded to shoot up a school? For heaven's sake, lawmakers please remove your heads from your rectums and ALLOW AMERICANS FREEDOM FROM PAIN.  What if it was your mother or grandmother suffering, your father or grandfather or God forbid your CHILDREN!?  You would deny them Kratom yet let them drink their livers into a coma? C'MON! Lawmakers stop trying to play God and let Him freely give us Kratom. This is by far the STUPIDEST thing lawmakers could do while they go home and drink three martinis after work.

I currently work from home in freelance photography, but when my children are old enough to go back to school I will return to the commercial photography field in which I was a commercial retoucher. I have been using Kratom (green leaf powder) in place of 3 to 4 prescription drugs that I decided to get off of upon becoming pregnant with my first child almost 4 years now). The drugs really seemed to change my personality and make me very dependent and I had also become addicted to prescription painkillers at one brief point which was complete and total hell. My now husband did some research and told me about a plant that is supposed to take away withdrawl symptoms and I tried it and loved it. It really takes away all of my anxiety for which I have been taking a benzodiazepine, a sleep aid, a beta blocker, and an antidepressant for. I am so proud to say I am on zero pills right now! I take Kratom in capsule form once in the morning with a glass of orange juice and then once in the evening before I go to bed. This plant has helped me get my life back and it is in no way unsafe and cannot cause harm to anybody. Worst that can happen is your eyes get a little blurry and if you are the type to get nauseated easily that can happen... but it's really hard to overdose on this leaf because it is so mild and so therapeutic and beneficial to your health. taking this away will show a sizeable increase in the number of opiates and heroin related deaths and overdoses. I urged the DEA to do more research into this safe alternative plant that so many people like me rely on. I will be crippled and absolutely devastated and depressed if they should become unavailable to me. I'm not ashamed to admit that I am extremely anxious and scared right now and I don't know what I would do without Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5390","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Taraj Randall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do some more research before blindly putting it up as a schedule I.

My husband then lost his job and with it went our health insurance. There \nwas no way we could afford the medications and doctor visits without the insurance. I was scared and unsure what to do so I began searching \nonline for alternatives. I found that a lot of people with chronic pain found relief with a plant called Kratom.

I am a former U.S. Army Infantryman, 911 Paramedic and currently work as a Registered Nurse. Over the course of time I have had quite a few injuries and surgeries for these injuries. I was prescribed a multitude of medications including strong narcotics. The narcotic medications worked for a while but my tolerance grew. I needed to take more and more to get relief. The medications took a toll on my life and my family. I have been diagnosed with Degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis and was in constant pain. The medications stopped working but I was addicted. The last medication I took was Tramadol and the withdrawals were horrible to say in the least. My family was at a loss and I couldn't function. I was off these horrible drugs but still in chronic pain that NSAIDS couldn't help. I searched and searched till I ran into Kratom. I tried it and it helped with my chronic pain issues, helped me sleep, and I could fully function with my work and family responsibilities. It was night and day. I could exercise, go to school and work full time without any problem. It saved not only my life but my family. As a medical professional I have researched and from experience that kratom is safe as long as it is unadulterated. In my experience, there is no respiratory depression, the main killer from narcotic medications. Placing Kratom in schedule one would be a mistake. This plant has been safely used for centuries in southeast Asia. The research into this plant, in my opinion can really save people from addictions and can help stop the scourge of opiate abuse deaths in the United States. Most of us with experience with authentic Kratom are older, Educated and have truly done our research and can be an asset to anyone who has had to deal with chronic pain and or addictions.\n\nIn conclusion, Kratom has been a life saver and has helped make me able to function without the horrible side effects that narcotic medications can cause. I am a better Father, Husband and RN without chronic pain. Kratom hasn't made me better but brought out the real me. Please take my account into consideration and thank you very much for your time.\n\nRespectfully, \nLouis J.Parra, RN","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0868","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Louis Parra","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"See attached","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23206","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"m.2111-2115"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not take away this plant from those of us who find it beneficial.

It is highly beneficial to pain management and helps break addiction.  I personally use it for my anxiety as well as lower back pain that I suffer with.  I choose not to take pain medicine because pain medicine kills people every day and i choose not to get on anxiety medicine because anxiety medicine changes the person using it mentally.  I choose kratom to help me because it does not change my personality and I can manage my issues without being overly sedated and remain healthy.  I know so many who benefit from this plant and pray that you just allow the american people to deal with their struggles the way they see fit for their bodies.  Kratom has an opiate agonist in it which basically makes people sick to their stomachs if they do take to much. this is a built in safety mechanism preventing people from overdosing! It is important to really understand what you are taking away from people before you do. many people have used kratom to get off prescription pain pills.  When kratom is removed from the market those people will have to get back on their opiate prescriptions again and they could overdose from them because their tolerance for opiates have dropped.  for example if somebody was taking oxy 80 before kratom and kratom allowed them to quit taking their oxy prescription and they may think that once kratom is unavailable they need their oxy 80's again. They may even have left over medicine and start back where they left off. Well an Oxycontin 80 could kill them because they have no tolerance for prescriptions any more.  Kratom is extremely safe even though some may have died but this is due to other contributing factors.  If for example somebody was taking medicine that speeds up their heart and they decided to drink some energy drinks and had a heart attack. Does this mean we ban all energy drinks?  Well that would be silly wouldn't it?  Kratom by itself has never killed anybody ever.  If you decide to restrict it then at least consider the option for only allowing so many venders to order it in and that way it can be pure and tested.  You could allow these venders to have a specific license to import. Then those vendors pay their taxes on the product and provide a safe product to the united states citizens.  Just please don't take this plant away entirely because this plant truly fights and beats the opiate epidemic America faces every day.  Last of all consider this. If kratom is taken away and people cant get it may go back to using heroin off the streets.  They could overdose and they would not have if kratom was still available!

I am commenting to voice my opposition to classifying Kratom a schedule 1 drug. Kratom is a harmless botanical that clearly poses no danger to the public. I have been using Kratom for about six years now for my chronic back and neck pain due to arthritis. Between that and the tremendous allergy relief I get it has greatly improved my quality of life. It has helped me tremendously without any adverse effects at all. My sister and our 69 y/o mother also have been taking it for several years with no adverse effects. My mom started taking it for stress relief and allergies and got the added benefit of keeping her blood pressure under control. My sister has severe scoliosis and has had several back surgeries. She has a lot of chronic pain and was dependent on dangerous narcotics until discovering Kratom. Though it is mildly addictive (about on the level of coffee), there is a definite ceiling to it's effects making a dangerous overdose impossible. Being a healthcare professional for 20 years I have seen the terrible and dangerous effects of pharmaceutical pain killers and drugs such as heroine. Even NSAIDs have a host of bad side effects, from renal failure to heart disease, when taken reguIarly. I believe it would be a travesty to ban something like Kratom that has helped countless people get off of these dangerous drugs, in favor of a natural alternative. Also as a conservative I am naturally opposed to more unnecessary government spending to combat an imaginary problem and actually harm people in the process. This plant has been a \"godsend\" to us and many other Americans and is causing no harm to anyone. It is like banning coffee, which would probably also be on the docket if it was just recently discovered by Americans.I believe that banning/regulating Kratom would do nobody any good (except for maybe pharmaceutical companies) and will actually cause a great deal of harm and unintended consequences. This would be unfair and unnecessary and I ask that the DEA reconsider it's planned prohibition.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6675","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Barker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After hearing about the Drug Kratom  becoming illegal,I am deeply  saddened  to hear that the individuals who were making progress  from opiate dependency  with the aid of kratom,are forced to seek  further  help.

I feel there should be extensive research done on this and If there is anything wrong with it then it should come with a warning. As far as I'm conserned this is a wonderful thing. I have never felt druged when I take kratom. I take the same amount every time. I have never had a bad reaction to it.

First off I would like to say thank you to anyone taking the time to read this. I am 29 years old and have lived through and seen the first hand effects of our current opiate epidemic. Thankfully I have always avoided said substances including Kratom. However, I work in management in a very physicaly demanding industry and have seen plenty of employees in the throws of opiate addition. Last year I was ask to question and ultimately drug test three separate employees. Of said three employees, all failed for opiates. Two of the three broke down and confessed to the miserable lives they have been living  (the third told me to get bent, and quit). The two remaining employees where allowed to keep their employment as long as they got and stayed clean. Employ one, chose the medical option. He was prescribed a opioid for maintenance use.  Employe two, realizing that he lacked all self control over opiates and fearing he would slip back into addition instead opted to try Kratom.. Fast forward to today; the employee that quite after the drug test is currently in jail (booked for possession / theft). The employee that sought medical options developed a massive dependency on his replacement opiate. Unfortunately, he was found dead in his apartment from a fatal overdose on said replacement opiates. Now for employe three, he began using Kratom daily. By the conclusion of the first month he was using Kratom 2-3 times per week. The following month he washed his hands of all substances and never looked back... This story has two sad endings, one man died due to the policy's I enforced and another is fathering an unseen child from behind bars (as a felon) thanks to your failed policys. The remaining man is doing quite well, only taking Kratom once a week tops and otherwise completely drug free... I don't do drugs, and to be blunt, don't care about there legal status. But I am here to tell you that Kratom  (in his words) saved his life.. Could he be the only man in the world with that experience? Absolutely! Even then, you've already done someone more good than you could ever imagine. Please ask yourself, should the fear of potential harm outweigh the possibility of saving even one life? As I previously said, I don't do any drugs and couldn't care less about their legality... But one quick gaze into my coworkers eyes inspired me to send this. Please honestly review his substance and freely determine if it is a helpful or harmful tool in this period of massive opiate dependancy. Thanks again for your time and have a splendid week!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21203","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zachary Schutz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm honestly not sure why this would even be considered to be banned.. obviously you have never tried it nor had the symptoms in which it is taken for.

Kratom was the only way I was able to beat this, and I have been using it for almost three years with no ill effects. I don't think it's hyperbolic to say that Kratom saved my life. I'm also afraid of what will happen if it gets banned again and remains illegal. I know many people who are in the same situation as I am. I have tried Suboxone in the past, but it was impossible for me to bear the cost of the expensive prescription and monthly doctor appointments. Additionally, it caused many harmful side effects such as chronic severe constipation and left me with an addiction just as bad, if not worse, than I originally had.\n\nFrom my own experiments I believe that it is physically impossible to suffer a fatal (or even dangerous) overdose from Kratom alone. The plant contains alkaloids other than mitragynine and 7-hydroxy mitragynine. At least one of them has been found to be an opioid receptor antagonist. When an individual consumes an exceptionally large dose of Kratom, these other alkaloids present themselves in sufficient amounts that they start to block the opioid action of mitragynine and 7-hydroxy mitragynine in addition to causing a number of unpleasant (but not dangerous) side effects which resemble a hangover from alcohol (headache and nausea being the most notable) and fade within a few hours.\n\nNormal Kratom doses range from 3-5 grams up to 15-20 grams. In order to show the relative safety of Kratom compared to other substances, I have consumed as much as 30 grams or more on multiple occasions. While I did experience headache, nausea, and mild dizziness at such large doses, there was not a single instance in which I experienced any respiratory depression whatsoever  or felt the need to seek medical attention. Based on my observations, I do not believe that Kratom poses any significant threat to public health and safety whatsoever.\n\nI think it is worth noting that the letter of intent published by the DEA cited 15 deaths and 660 calls to Poison Control Centers associated with Kratom use in the entire USA in two years' time. While myself and many others clearly find this number to be dubious and suspect the true number to be zero, for a moment let's assume that it is accurate. That would mean that in two years, 15 people have been harmed while thousands have used it to free themselves from addictions to much more dangerous substances. For comparison:\n\n- From 2013-2014 there were about 22,000 calls to Poison Control Centers due to ingestion of laundry detergent pods. \n\n- In 2014 Poison Control reported 112,412 calls for antidepressants, 66,058 for vitamins, and 31,903\nfor exposure to hydrocarbons such as gasoline (source: https://aapcc.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/annual_reports/2014_AAPCC_NPDS_Annual_Report.pdf)\n\n- Data obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that more than 300    people die annually as a result of acetaminophen poisoning. Acetaminophen is also responsible for roughly 100,000 calls to poison control and 60,000 emergency room visits annually in the USA alone.\n\n- The CDC reported 29,001 deaths due to alcohol in 2013.(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf)\n\n- In the USA in 2013, 1,182 individuals were treated at a medical facility for overdose of caffeine with 12 of them experiencing major negative health symptoms.\n\n- Cows kill 20 people per year in the USA (40 per 2 years = 2.67 times as deadly as Kratom)\n- Dogs kill 28 people per year in the USA (56 per 2 years = 3.73 times as deadly as Kratom)\n- Bees, Wasps, and Hornets kill 58 people per year in the USA (116 per 2 years = 7.73 times as deadly as Kratom) [all three of these sourced from CDC]\n\nI could go on but I think I've made my point. A good friend of mine just died from an opioid overdose a few days ago. It's time for us to start doing things a different way. The people being helped by Kratom are friends, neighbors, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers. It is inhumane to cut them off from the treatment that allowed them to regain a normal life, especially when doing so leaves them with no other options.\n\nIf Kratom is banned permanently, I guarantee that deaths from both illicit and prescription opioids will increase considerably. This isn't even speculation; it has already happened in the states that have banned Kratom on their own.

I was working as a nurse when I became sick in 2011. Since then it has been a struggle to find something that my body agrees with. I have 35 allergies/adverse reactions to FDA approved medication. With Kratom, I have no allergy/adverse reaction. Since using Kratom I have been able to stop the opiates my doctors had me on for pain, all of which I suffered some kind of side effect and had to take other medication to combat those side effects. While it hasnt changed the progression of my disease, it has assisted with pain relief. \n\nAccording to the FDA, However, whatever the true number is, ADRs represent a significant public health problem that is, for the most part, preventable. Link: www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm110632.htm\n\nFor me, this statement rings true as indicated by list of allergies/adverse reactions. If you take Kratom away from me and others, you will have not prevented something that according to the FDA is preventable. \n\nIn my 9 years in the medical field, I have never seen one person experience anything bad from Kratom. \n\nI do not think Kratom should be scheduled or banned. People should be allowed to have natural options available to them. One option may work for one person but not for another. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my story.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14249","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christina Gunderson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please consider research for this plant for pain killing, anxiety assistance, ptsd treatment, opioid withdrawal assistance and other documented beneficial uses.

This was the worst thing to happen to me, i can not go anywhere without my meds, and if i do not take them i feel the worst pain in the world that i would not wish on my worst enemy. My wife is disabled so i have to be strong as i am the only bread winner in our family with 2 beautiful kids. I am tired of constantly worrying about my meds And if im in more pain 1 day and take an extra 1 then i am out before my refill, which means ill be in pain and withdrawl from the meds for a day. I have to work i cant just stop taking cold turkey and rest at home for a week. Hearung everyday more and more people dieing from perscription pain killers i knew i have to get off them. Then about a week ago i found out about Kratom from Joe Rogans podcast featuring Chris Bell where Chris discussed the pain killing properties of Kratom and the ability to help me decrease the amount of perscription pain killers I am on which is what i have been looking for. Then to find out the DEA wants to ban it before doing any testing, this cant be right. It felt like thers was a light at the end of the tunnel of me not taking pain meds to it all the sudden be snuffed out by the DEA. Please keep it leagal so i can try it. There is so many people who might or who are benefiting from it. We need to curb out opiate issue in USA and banning something that might help do that is wrong.

Anyway, that being said, I will start off by giving a little information about myself other then my name and address because of FEAR.  I am a 53 year old female consumer of kratom and this is how I became such.  I worked most of  my  younger life as a Physical Therapy Technician but doing my y later years I worked as a as a Para-educator for children with special needs.  I have most my life suffered from depression, so I know what feeling low in life feels like and I know what relief from this ailment feels like now thanks to Kratom.  I found Kratom after seeking a natural solution or should I say, something natural that might give me some relief from my depression/anxiety and some everyday aches and pains I was having at the time (I guess due to getting up in age).  I have always been a person to seek natural substances to give me relief, just like I take biotin for thinning hair or vitamins for women over 50, for menopause. That's when I did some research after many weeks and came across the herbal supplement Kratom.  My initial reaction was skeptical and for good reason because the first week of consuming kratom as a tea every morning> it did absolutely nothing.  I had zero relief and zero effect, anybody out there telling you guys \"you get high from kratom\", THEY'RE FLAT OUT LYING.  It was not until the second or third week that I actually started to feel a little relief, now I still had depression/anxiety (because it is not a cure for ANYTHING) but kratom helped tremendously to uplift my mood and I found it helped me be more productive with my activities of daily living.  I can't lie though, I still have pretty bad days even with this wonderful tea leaf(kratom) but mostly it HELPS ME.  Kratom is not some miraculous plant leaf like some folks might have you believe, for me anyway the effects of kratom were and or mild at best but I do believe its at best worthy of being a dietary supplement if anything.  But to remove Kratom from so many people that find some relief for what ails them is a travesty and who ever is pulling all the strings and calling the shots should be a shame of themselves. KEEP KRATOM LEGAL and KEEP KRATOM NATURAL, please.  If you truly want to ban something to save lives BAN ALCOHOL>that destroyed my father at the same age I am now, 53, he died of pancreatic cancer and alcohol was a major factor according to his doctors., ban that!  Anything else is under the radar of suspicion and a disregard for the people for PROFIT, I am sorry I had to say it.

I am a 29 year old male. I have recently completed a Masters Degree in Science of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. I am a huge proponent of herbal medicines. Ancient humans utilized all of the plant, animal and minerals they had access to as the central part of there medicine practices and healing ways. Just the fact that we are alive today is a testament of the effectiveness of the old healing ways, as modern medicine is a very recent development in comparison to how long humans have been alive on this planet. Every time a plant is banned or outlawed it is a huge failure for our species, especially sense, once a plant gets put on the schedule 1 list it becomes very difficult for adequate research to be done on that plant and its constituents and potential benefits and medical uses.  Kratom has been used in its native habitat for thousands of years, and has really caused no significant problems. I first came across Kratom back in 2008, and have used it from time to time over the years sense then. I have never had any ill effects other then some mild nausea if I took to much on an empty stomach. from my experience, and the experience of my close friends, kratom is very safe and easy to use in a responsible way. Any substance can be abused, tobacco, alcohol, or even coffee (kratoms relative) can cause adverse effects if used in excess. If someone drinks 12 shots of espresso they may end up in the hospital thinking they are having a heart attack. But if you drink a shot or two, or have a normal amount of kratom, without mixing it with other drugs, it is perfectly safe and effective. In my experience, kratom is simply a mild mood enhancer when used properly, similar to a cup of coffee, or a single glass of wine. In its Native setting it is mostly used by laborers as an aid for working long hours of hard physical work. It really helps the long days of work pass like a meditative breeze. In our excessive workaholic culture in America, I would think kratom should be praised and utilized as another aid to our working life. It could be regulated in the same way as energy drinks, with a warning label and common sense by the consumer. Thank you for your time and consideration. Please don't make the responsible users of a safe, time tested plant medicine become criminals, by outlawing yet another plant that God has given us to help ourselves.  Please use any resources that you would put into kratom to fight the real drug problems we have in America, like our Opiate epidemic and methamphetamines...","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2955","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Rueger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am for the scheduling of kratom.

I was prescribed Hydrocodone when I initially had the injury and was eventually discharged due to the injury. Within a couple months of arriving home I had moved up to OxyContin that I was buying on the street to feed the addiction that started with a knee injury I suffered during my service in the USN. From that point on things went sharply downhill. The addiction completely took over my life. I began living strictly for the purpose of hunting down and using prescription opiates so that I didn't have to deal with the unimaginable misery that comes with opiate withdrawal. I went from an honorable young man that volunteered to serve my country during a time of war to a pathetic, hopeless addict who cared about nothing but opiates. I began to steal from people I loved to feed the addiction. I would do almost anything it took to get what i needed and i hated myself for it. I knew what i was doing and how horrible i had become but the drive to fulfill the needs my addiction presented trumped all things. As is always the case with opiates I began to require higher and higher doses to get the same effect. Therefore there came a point where the pharmaceutical opiates got too expensive and hard to get. I started using heroin as it was cheaper and frankly easier to come by. This went on for some time until one of my closest friends in the world, who I took down this path with me, overdosed and died right in front of me. That's when I checked myself into rehab. I finished rehab and went back home with a new addiction to suboxone. Inevitably i relapsed and back to rehab i go. This sequence took place another 2 times before i decided to take action on my own as rehab rarely works in the long term. I decided i would do some research on other ways to kick the opiate habit that had destroyed my life and the lives of dozens of people i knew. i quickly discovered kratom and read all the wonderful stories of the lives people claimed it had saved.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11316","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Smart","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'd like to take this opportunity to share my experiences with the supplement kratom.

I've known many who have enjoyed coffee on a daily basis and this should be looked at just the same. It is from the same family and has the same purpose. Illegal drugs encourage the black market and making criminals out of hundreds of thousands of God fearing, non-criminals is in my honest opinion, just ludicrous. \nI found this herb at an all natural health food store and since I'm sensitive to caffeine, it has improved my daily life in more ways than one can count. I must say that while caffeine is addictive and makes me jittery, this does not. Again, to outlaw a plant with less effects than coffee is just ridiculous. I have done the research, many weeks and months prior to actually trying it and have seen no ill effects in research nor in personal use. Only positive results.\nWe have laws in this land that grant us numerous freedoms. I sincerely feel as though many of our freedoms have been traded in for an illusion of \"safety.\" There is no over doses based on kratom alone, no addictions, adverse affects, etc... I would choose safety first, but there just is no safety risk with kratom. Adults should be able to make decisions regarding themselves on their own and this is especially so when it comes to herbs and spices. Taking away this wonderful plant only opens the door to much more restriction in terms of our freedoms. \nI would sincerely hope that this proposed ban is reversed and that the millions of us who would like to continue our enjoyment of the freedoms promised to us by our forefathers, who fought and died for those freedoms, can do so without the impedance of our government who is there to uphold these laws for us, by us. \nPlease hear us all out and realize what a grand mistake outlawing kratom would be. \nThank you very much.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8179","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"S Nelson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not take this natural plant away from us.

I have used it off and on for the last couple years. From personal experience I can say that it is not at all like opioid derived narcotics that doctors prescribe to thousands of people on a daily basis. It appears to be MUCH safer and FAR LESS ADDITIVE. I am no scientist, but as these posts are simply our opinions anyway I figured I'd weigh in with mine.\n\nI have used it for back pain while doing manual labor and it has worked better for me than anything ever prescribed by a physician. I feel that more people should be aware of this plant and it's benefits. I also believe that it should be well researched as an alternative to almost all current opioid pain management drugs, which cannot be done if this plant is added to the schedule 1 list. \n\nI am truly sicked that the DEA would even consider scheduling this  plant that helps so many people (in the same category as Heroin none the less) with the utter lack of evidence of it's harm on the thousands of people who use it. They cited roughly 15 deaths in the last 6 years I believe, all of these people were using other drugs as well as Kratom. \n\nHow many people die of cigarette related diseases on a yearly basis? Or alcohol related accidents? Or overdoses of perscribed pain medication? They are a truly backwards organization, doing little to actually defend the public. \n\n-Tim","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9115","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tim Mcbarly","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jen, I am a 35 year old medical professional from Louisiana and I'd like to express my concern regarding the pending ban on kratom.  I found kratom almost 5 years ago after searching for a natural substitute for the many controlled substances I was prescribed for different symptoms that plagued me.  I was diagnosed with Chiari Malformation after suffering for years with debilitating headaches, vision loss, and other conditions of the disease.  My MD had me taking narcotics around the clock and my body was becoming dependent upon them.  At the same time, my physician was prescribing different drugs for insomnia, mood enhancement, and anti anxiety.  Being that I am responsible for patient care in a hospital I've got to function at my best everyday, and I couldn't do that on all the medications I was being told to take.  But my daily dose of kratom reduces the symptoms I fought so hard to stop all those years before, and doesn't compromise my ability to function clearly and operate appropriately.  If the ongoing research is allowed to continue I know that the information collected can and will change the life of so many people suffering from a wide variety of ailments.  This one plant transformed my life, alleviated my symptoms as well as my use of dangerous man made narcotics, and remains the reason I can live my best life.  If kratom were to be banned I would be forced to go back on the many drugs that held me back from living a clear, productive life, and again place me on the path of a deadly addiction. My life and so many others depend on it because while it changes many lives for the better it saves just as many from medically induced addiction overdoses.  Please help me remain the person I've become by keeping kratom legal.

Proponents for this plant - and I count myself among them - are not contending that it is entirely without risk. Indeed, as consumers and as citizens we must ask ourselves, what is? Calculated risk is the essence of life. Rather, I am contending that kratom carries with it substantially less risk than the substances from which it makes abstention not only possible, but eminently feasible. \n\nKratom has allowed me to live a productive life through successful mitigation of chronic pain and avoidance of the perils of addiction. Concerning the latter, kratom has assisted me greatly in completely discontinuing use of hard opiates and stimulants - as well as greatly reducing my consumption of alcohol. Without this plant I simply would not have had the resources, internal and otherwise, to do so on my own. Kratom has allowed me to be fully present and responsible for those who love and depend on me.\n\nEvery kratom advocate I know would restrict access by minors and the selling of potentially dangerous product. However, these entirely reasonable objectives need not be achieved at the expense of limiting access by all. The community has already shown significant capacity for self-regulation; in many respects it serves as a model for how free markets can - and should - function at their best. Any governmental action should assist, and not impede or run counter to, such a system of careful and conscientious use already in place.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20183","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been struggling with arthritis, fibromyalgia, and spinal stenosis for years.

If I found this before opiates I would have never became addicted. \n\n\n\nKratom cannot be abused, before you get to the threshold of getting a high, you become extremely nauseous! Its not possible to use for this purpose. \n\n\n\nI know for a fact it's not being used to get any kind of high, because it's simply not possible. Unlike opiates where you can continue to take a maintenance dose... If you attempt to take a maintenance dose of Kratom you will get so nauseous, you will be unable to move for 6-8 hours from being so nauseous. \n\n\n\nI hope you don't schedule Kratom and listen to the people, it truly has many medicinal purposes once your specific catered dose is found. It challenging finding the so called sweet spot between effectiveness and nausea. \n\n\n\nFor the first time in my life, I can drive comfortably, sit and read a book, sleep a full 7 uninterrupted hours and simply feel relaxation in my legs. \n\n\n\nIm happy I found Kratom. Its changed my life did a disorder that's not taken seriously age is very misunderstood. \n\n\n\nI have had no negative side affects from using Kratom thus far.

I do not accept the notion that Kratom is a highly addictive substance that threatens public health and safety. I am a 29 year old that has had his share of run-ins with the laws that preside over marijuana. I have an addictive personality and, for the longest time, it was very difficult to stay away from smoking weed and staying sober. I let my addiction take the best of my life and was soon looking at a prison term. Even then, it was in my head that I couldn't stop nor what I was doing was wrong. I was going nowhere in my job, thinking that it was just another phase and that there was no reason to apply myself or think of upper management.\n\nOne day, I started a conversation with a coworker who was working on the same task as I was. He soon disclosed that he, too, was battling with addiction and that he was taking Kratom to better control his urges. He offered me some capsules of Kratom and some insight on how it made him feel. Once I was introduced to Kratom, a whole new world came open to me. I was no longer bogged down with trying to get high or that I wasn't allowed to smoke weed. I was energized, motivated to do the best job I could each and every day.\n\nThat was nearly two years ago and I've been sober for equally as long. I am currently the lead in my department for the warehouse in which I work with the chance to actually make it to upper management. I was in the Air Force when I was younger, so I knew my work potential, but I let all of that slip away when I got depressed. Kratom has given me my spark back. I've been taking Kratom for 2 years and within those two years, I've climbed the ladder into the position I'm in now. It hasn't been detrimental to my health, nor has it gotten in the way of my work. I believe that it should be a viable option for those who wish for an alternative to prescription medications for depressions, anxiety, and pain management.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20700","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Sanchez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I use Kratom as a natural alternative to over the counter NSAID medications. I have found that nerve pain and inflammation due to several several herniated discs responds exceptionally well to treatment with Kratom, and otherwise does not respond to ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or other more habit forming prescription drugs. \n\nKratom has allowed me to go to and stay at work even immediately following a back spasm that without Kratom I would have no choice but to call in sick to work. Without kratom I spend multiple consecutive days bedridden due to incredible pain, muscle stiffness and sciatic nerve pain. \n\nKratom has only contributed to my ability to be a productive member of society. Since beginning kratom use, I have worked multiple simultaneous jobs for a total of 50+ hours per week, and also have returned to a 4 year university to complete my degree.\n\nKratom also lacks any form of habit reinforcing properties or withdrawal symptoms. I have consumed Kratom on a daily basis for 3 consecutive months, and was held to abrupt cessation due to news of a now withdrawn impending ban. \n\nUpon ceasing consumption I felt absolutely no negative side effects, especially those expected to accompany daily opiate or alcohol use for a consecutive 3 month period. I simply stopped taking kratom and resumed suffering from inadequate treatment of muscle spasms. \n\nThere also has never been a single death caused by kratom as the sole substance of overdose, ever. Every case has involved adulterated kratom, or multiple pharmaceutical or opiate related substances. Poison control receives infinitely more calls for over the counter medications such as tylenol or cough syrup and especially alcohol than kratom.\n\nPlease use factual research before forming opinions and keep Kratom legal. Even if sale regulations are required, making kratom illegal will have an epic toll in terms of financial enforcement costs and societal costs including the impact of family breadwinners being incarcerated for something less harmful than tylenol.\n\nI pay my fair share of taxes every year and enforcing an unconstitutional ban on a harmless botanical is not how I need my tax dollars spent.

I also empathize with people who are in chronic pain and who feel that kratom helps them manage that pain.\n\nIt is my opinion that the pharmaceutical industry does not want kratom to be legal because it could cut into their profits made by selling addictive chemical pain killers.\n\nPlease keep kratom legal but regulate it.  There need to be some rules.  For example, it should not be allowed to be concentrated and made into more potent forms.  But in its raw form, it is a God-send to people in pain.

I've been using Kratom exclusively for about two years now. Before I discovered Kratom, I was in and out of the doctors office with constant low back pain that would radiate down into my leg (herniated disc, pinched nerve). I've got two beautiful children and I couldn't stand to take prescription pain medications any longer. It was interfering with almost all aspects of my life and work. I decided to try kratom. Within two weeks I completely stopped taking pain medications and only used kratom as needed. \n\nTwo years later, I have my life back! I'm very exclusive to one or two trusted vendors and am very cognizant of my use of kratom. I am a director of information technology and have a very stressful job. I am successful in life and can honestly tell you that it would not have been possible without discovering this amazing plant. \n\nI'm very discouraged that this plant is illegal in some states. I don't feel as though kratom is any sort of a threat when used responsibly. Please reconsider this ban, not only on a federal level, but state levels as well.

I still remember how my mother would dilute a Bayer asprin in a spoon with water for me because I did not know how to swallow a pill yet.

I wear my seat belt and drive defensibly.\nAlong with attending to healthier practices I choose kratom to compliment my fish oil and multivitamins along with a reasonable amount of daily activity to stay healthier.

After struggling with the disease of addiction to heroin over the past several years, I've finally found an herbal solution that could properly satiate my craving for opiates while allowing me to integrate wholly with our society. \n\n\nThe FDA approved methods of medication-assisted therapy, such as suboxone and methadone, had left me with periods of intense insomnia and an even more crippling depression.  Although these pharmaceuticals have a clinically significant history in western society, there have been countless overdoses and complications from them.  \n\n\nThe withdrawal from heroin is far more moderate than from either of these medications, but the overbearing nature of its addiction and the inherent harm caused by its use make a copacetic agreement impossible.  While addicted to opiates, I was intermittently homeless and engaged in crime to pay for my addiction.  After an arrest for a DUI in April, I tried kratom for the first time.\n\nToday, I live in an apartment in the city that I love, using legal means to make my way.  Daily, Im making strides to improve my life in ways Id long thought were inaccessible.  Kratom gives me the courage to take life for what it is and engage with it directly.  Im no longer subverting, disengaging and conniving to improve my existence. I dont live with the anxiety of, getting my next hit, or having my life entirely derailed by arrest.  I live with my decisions, I reflect and find a new peace in active community engagement and volunteerism. \n\n\nWhen Id heard that kratom was going to be scheduled, I was dismayed.  As a young adult who saw her friends lose their minds to research chemicals (such as were in spice and bath salts), Id never had such a reaction.  The pain and human suffering was always apparent in these cases, but Id never known a soul to be lost to the void from using kratom - only those whod abated their opiate addictions or had tried it on a weekend, but were turned off by how difficult it is to use recreationally. \n\n\nAfter giving this comment a significant period of thought, I was hoping that I could use my voice to promote knowledge, not blindly.  Many of your comments may include claims that are overly protective, but Im hoping to provide a balanced perspective. \n\n\nFirst, kratom is psychoactive. Although strains vary in quality and effect, generally speaking, kratom reflects a caffeine-style stimulation and a level of mild opiate-like pain relief.  That being said, the drug has recreational potential, which is a valid concern, but with such mild effects, its unlikely that many will be overwhelmed by its effects or reach a level of inebriation that isnt conducive to maintaining their lifestyle.  Compared to other opiates, the effects are dismissible.  \n\nSecond, overdose is possible.  Although on its own isnt lethal, the impact of an overdose can be disconcerting.  Nausea, vomiting, heart palpitations and confusion accompany an overwhelming dose.  When combined with other drugs, in a way similar to how caffeine interacts with other stimulants, there is a possibility of cardiac anomaly.  This has already been observed in several cases of lethal overdose.  On its own, this drug remains innocuous, despite possible misuse.\n\n\nThis plant saves lives.  Its saved mine and many others from the opiate dependence that had once gripped us.  Although there is little history of its use here, I hope that my story sheds some light onto possible herbal applications, for recovery and otherwise.  As a citizen, a voter and one immediately impacted by this decision, I submit my support for a nation where kratom is still legal.  I had once been worried about purity, contamination and misuse, but throughout my use have only found hope and commitment to self improvement. \n\n\nThank you for your commitment to democracy,\n~Francis Mazur","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15250","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Francis Mazur","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The desire to establish regulations around substances for the protection of the public is one we can all get behind.

The pharmaceuticals narcotics and illegal drugs are overkill when providing that \"one thing\" that the drugs give them.

Kratom has about as mild of effect on someone as anything I, or anyone else I talked to, than anything else out there. I can tell you, if you ban this non-public threatening plant, I can tell you you will have millions more people driving up the risk of the drug and pharmaceutical illegal trades, driving up crime, more human rights violations in countries that supply the US, which I think you agency knows very well. If I were to drink alcohol, I would say that would be much more dangerous to my health, and the health of other I could hurt than this ridiculously mild plant. I respect the jobs of each honorable DEA agent and the officers on the streets, enforcing heroine, cocaine, etc. It is a tough and dangerous job in this world. I believe in my heart, by making Kratom illegal would be a great disrespect to all those agents and officers, since anyone can get the hard drugs on the streets because they don't have any \"mild\", and again, harmful, alternative to the hard drugs.\n\nPlease consider this before you decide to put millions of people on a more dangerous path for themselves, the public, and the safety of all the great agents and local law enforcement on the ground. \n\nThank you for reading this.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4419","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Billy Cain","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hey Guys, \n\nI'm tired of big companies running the future of how this planet progresses in science.

I have been using Kratom for a little over a year now. It has saved my life in so many ways. I suffer with anxiety and NO thyroid due to thyroid cancer. I was prescribed pain pills to help with my cancer pain and after all the pains that come with not having a thyroid. I took my prescription as the doctor prescribed. That whole 3 year's I was in such a fog. I blamed it on my thyroid. I kept taking pain pills. I got addicted. I needed them to wake up in the morning. I needed them to do daily functions like as simple as being a mother to my child. If I didn't have a pain pill I was in bed exhausted. I didn't want to live like that anymore. I stopped going to the pain doctor. I started researching natural resources I needed for anxiety, depression and energy. I found everything led me  to kratom. I've heard many say it is a synthetic opioid, wrong. I have  never felt high from taking Kratom. In fact I go days, weeks without it sometimes and never had one withdraw from it. I could never say that about my pain and anxiety meds. Basically, I use this plant, herb to get a sense of well being. A good mood, no pains or aches and no anxiety, at all! It's all gone. Whenever I feel my anxiety coming, I take a teaspoon of Kratom mixed with water. And in 20 minutes, I'm all better. It's a miracle plant! The fact that the DEA wants to ban this plant, makes me very furious. If it is banned, my sense of well being is gone. This plant has helped so many lives. There are so many whom use it for pain management and they need it. Banning this plant will effect so many lives in a very negative way. I feel for everyone who needs it more than I do. I just really don't understand the ban. It makes me think that the pharmaceutical companies are losing money or something, so they want to take nature's herb and ban it.  Anyway I hope this comment will help in the DEA's decisions . Please don't ban Kratom. Stop the ban on Kratom. Thank you for allowing us to comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1013","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Miranda Lopes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used krarom on and off for pain since 2011 so that I can stay away from the addiction potential of painkillers because I have a very good friend who was prescribed a high dose of prescription painkiller and he was left addicted after the doctors had stopped prescribing it to him.

This was an increase of 14% over 2013.  Articles I have read lately claim that there were 6 Kratom related deaths.  6!!  If it were not for Kratom, I most likely would have added to that overdose statistic.  I was a very heavy user of prescription pain medication (Hydrocodone) from 1991 until 2010.  It destroyed my life.  I lost everything and almost my life.  I was dying and my family was okay with that.  In 2010 I discovered Kratom and was able to get off of the opiates FOR GOOD!!!  My life has never been the same!!  I have ZERO physical side effects from Kratom.  ZERO!!  I have regained custody of my son, I am happily married, purchased a home, am gainfully employed, and have been for over 6 years.  In addition, I was able to go back to college and finish my accounting degree.  Something I was never able to do when I was out there using opiates.  \n\nLast October, I got the phone call that no one ever wants to get a 4am.  \"Lisa, mom died.  She overdosed.  You need to get over here and help me with dad\".  I will never forget those words.  I was born to a heroin addicted mother and watched as she spiraled downhill for the past 43 years.  That would have been me.  I never could get her to try Kratom, and I wish every day that I had tried harder.  \n\nI'm just one life saved.  There are so many others.  With Hydrocodone becoming a Sch II drug, it's not as easy to get as it used to be.  I see less and less \"pill mills\" in shopping centers around Houston.  What I do see though, are people dying from Heroin because they couldn't stop taking opiates.  These are mothers, and children, and sisters and students.  I'm tired of going to funerals.  \n\nKratom has saved my life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2130","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lisa Carpenter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a married 30 year old father of one. In 2008 I was involved in a car crash on SR-441 in Florida that nearly cost me my life. I suffered a right fractured femur, fractured and dislocated right ankle, cardiac contusion, 4 fractured ribs, and a degloved knee. After a year and a half of multiple surgeries I was mostly fixed up, the only problem now was I had turned into a full blown addict after being on opioid pain medication for such an extended amount of time. Doctors had become aware of my condition and suggested that I get on Suboxone, a drug to help with opioid dependence. Suboxone itself is an opioid and for me it just replaced one addiction for another, after a while I fell right back into a hard opiate addiction. I had developed new friendships with people for no other reason besides the fact they could help me get pain medication, I had become a drug addicted criminal that was approaching rock bottom faster than I could fathom.\n\nI couldn't take it anymore and after some research I found out about a life saving herb known as Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), a plant that can help fight opioid addiction by quelling the intense cravings. It can also help with pain management as it is also a natural non-opiate analgesic. After taking this herb for a short amount of time I had become drug free and my life was given right back to me and soon after I became happily married with my fiance, we had our daughter not long after. I am now working my way through college for a degree in Radiography. I no longer need to take kratom, it did it's job and saved me by breaking my awful opioid addiction. Now I hope it can save others in the future who struggle with the debilitating affliction of opiod addiction. If it hadn't been for kratom I really can't say where I'd be today but I know I would probably be in a very dark place, I don't like to think about it.\n\n-Kratom is not an opiate, it doesn't achieve any sort of opiate high, it cannot be overdosed on.\n\n-Overdose from prescription opioids in America is at an all time high. Kratom can be used to overcome opioid addiction and if it is banned more opioid overdose deaths are likely to occur.\n\n-It's habit forming in the same sort of manner coffee is habit forming. Kratom is in the same plant family as coffee.\n\n-The media has sensationalized kratom to be a dangerous drug because of synthetic chemicals like Bath Salts\" and Spice. Kratom is all natural.\n\nAll other individuals that suffer from chronic pain that choose to use this life saving herb in place of addictive and potentially lethal opiods all share the same sentiment towards this ban, outlawing kratom would be devastating to the quality of life and well-being of these individuals who're trying to use a more scrupulous way to manage their pain.\n\nAll I ask is that the facts be examined before any sort of law should be put in place, there is no evidence that kratom causes any sort of biological harm. Sending people to jail for kratom would be absolutely unethical and more research needs to be done before anything becomes final. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read about my concerns, God Bless.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1978","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA,\nI am an academic scholarship student at a top 20 university.

I have been on medical clearance from work, unable to, since last Nov. And over 2 of the past 5 years. I'm a recovering heroin and opiates addict, which started as prescribed Vicodin in my early 20s, increasing to heroin when diagnosed with crohns at the age of 32. Marijuana is a huge help, and plays a big part in me keeping crohns in remission, eating. And dealing with the anxiety and depression associated with crohns and PTSD. Kratom, however, which I was introduced to almost 2 months ago, is extremely helpful in not only the anxiety, but the physical pains stretching from my intestines to the daily, throbbing, aching joint pain I experience over my body. 5 yrs of different doctors, hospitals, have yielded nothing but failure, prescribed meds mixing causing seizure, further addiction and fear of even seeking help. Since I have started taking small doses of Kratom in late August, I have not touched, or even craved any opiates at all. Im able to get up and move easier, and accomplish physical and mental tasks with ease, that are paramount to any level of my recovery. It's that simple. I implore you to leave Kratom free for us to purchase and administer ourselves, as it is not addictive, is not a drug, and is extremely helpful in many areas including to and being an alternative to the opiates and other pharmaceuticals that merely make us sicker on transcending levels. I oppose Kratom being made a schedule 1 drug... Or any form of controlled substance for these reasons.

I understand how Drug Companies work. But I won't get into that.\n\nMy Profession is Irrelevant, however Degenerative Disk Disease(DDD), a herniated, bulging, ruptured L5-S1 lumbar disk has made any work difficult, if not impossible at times, due to the pain I have chronically been in. \n\nI've been aware of Kratom and its availability since 2010 or 2011. I had read a lot of anecdotal things about the use of this benign plant for various reasons. I never had any interest in it until last year, due to chronic dental/tooth pain. Then I started having Sciatica pain(neuropathic pain) out of the blue along with lower back pain. \n\nI know all about prescription opiates/opioids. I was once dependent on them physically and had horrific withdrawls when I quit taking them. I didn't know about Kratom back then. I had to go the cold-turkey route, abrupt cessation of high doses. I was incapacitated for a month, if not longer. I couldn't function at all and mentally I was miserable. I craved opiates and was suicidal at the time. \nJump forward in time to last year when I began to have extensive dental work done. I Never had the option of getting a narcotic painkiller prescribed to me. Not because of my personal history.The dentists as well as EVERY Doctor I have seen for my back problems has been completely against prescribing opiates/opioids to ANY of their patients. These healthcare professionals don't care about the discomfort of their patients as much as they care about the DEA watching them very closely and they all have fears of losing their licences for completely legal prescribing practices of patients with documented forms of acute or chronic pain. The only medication that took away my pain significantly was Lyrica(pregabalin), which has its own issues with dependence, and I am reluctant to take it anymore due to the profound strange, unwanted negative effects it has on my mood. I know Lyrica, like so many other prescription drugs, CAUSES SUICIDAL IDEATION. Kratom doesn't make me depressed like Lyrica. Kratom doesn't heavily intoxicate me at any dose, no matter what Strain or what Vendor I use. Kratom doesn't give me the urge to compulsively re-dose for a euphoric intoxicated effect like Rx Opiates all do. I take Kratom because I do not want to be in pain. Period. Not for a buzz.I need to be able to move my body, which is a scary challenge at times with Degenerative Disks and Sciatica/Radiculopathy.\n\nWith Kratom I'm typically suffering less than normal. I have tried all the OTC pain relievers, and had a epidural steroid injection(Epidural Steroid/Depo-Medrol Injections are NOT FDA Approved, yet my Dr wants me to get a second round of injections). I won't because I now know how common and severe the complications from this procedure are. Yet I can't receive a codeine prescription. Something isn't right with this picture. Too restrictive.\n\nLooking at and studying the arbitrary Controlled Substance classifications outlined by the Controlled Substances Act, Kratom and its alkaloids do not meet any of the criteria of a Schedule One Controlled Substance. I am not \"Self Medicating\" with Kratom any more than if I buy Tylenol or ibuprofen for my tooth pain or back pain. Kratom use does not mean abuse by default. Strange re-defining of key words was and maybe still will be used to portray Kratom as 1. Dangerous 2. Addictive 3. A \"legal high\". It is none of these. Not for me. \n\nCompared to the effects of say, 30mg of Codeine, Kratom is far more mild. There is some sort of demonization(maybe accidentally through lack of understanding) of kratom and its constituent alkaloids. With Customs and the FDA currently preventing Kratom from being imported in October and November, it seems that the FDA already decided how to mis-characterize Kratom, and to use the DEA to enforce laws making criminals out of otherwise law abiding, productive, harmless citizens.\n\nIf I wanted to drink bleach, I could legally. I wouldn't because it would be highly dangerous. I can take any high dose of Kratom and be just fine, physically and mentally, yet this would make me a Felon. I have taken high doses of Kratom on consecutive days. But I have had a Physical Exam and my Bloodwork was all within normal ranges. \n\nThere is no known toxic level of plain leaf powdered kratom. If there is, it must be too high for ANY human to ingest with out immediately vomiting it back up. \nKratom alone has killed NO ONE. The existing evidence that it is lethal is VERY sketchy and vague and most notably other chemicals were involved in these 15 deaths that get spoken of. Keep Kratom Legal. Allow Kratom Importation.\n ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10826","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ano ymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"do not make kratom illegal.  legalize everything.  addiction is a disease, not a criminal act!  the war on drugs is a f'n joke and the people know it.  it is only a way to make money.  put the money into helping people with addiction not locking them up for something that is self harm.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14036","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"charles king","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a plant not a drug.\nNo need for regulation.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8203","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sonya Sluss","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Patrick Lynch, I am 35 years old.\n\nA recent friend struggled with herion and pills.

I have been sick for about 15 years and have been through many medications to treat my symptoms for both of my incurable diseases. My last resort was to be referred to a Pain Clinic for my chronic pain. In the beginning I was prescribed low doses of Oxycontin and Oxycodone. Soon these drugs lost their effect and my doctor raised the dosage. Again, they lost their effect and the dosage was raised. I was dependent on these drugs. I couldn't just stop them because of the dangers to my health after being on the for years. \nOur country has a major opiate dependent and abuse problem. From the governments own website I quote: The abuse of and addiction to opioids such as heroin, morphine, and prescription pain relievers is a serious global problem that affects the health, social, and economic welfare of all societies.  It is estimated that between 26.4 million and 36 million people abuse opioids worldwide,[1] with an estimated 2.1 million people in the United States suffering from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers in 2012 and an estimated 467,000 addicted to heroin.\nI decided I would not be a statistic. I heard of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (known as kratom) and did my research. I was weaned off my opioids and began taking Kratom. I experienced minimal side effects once I started dosing with kratom. I am now opioid free. I found that kratom was a better pain reliever than the Oxycontin and Oxycodone ever was. Plus, I have not needed to increase my dosage to keep the effects of pain relief. This substance changed my life. I am no longer walking around in the world \"high\", but feeling more normal that I have in 15 years. \nIf these substances are put into schedule I it would be near impossible to have research that is so desperately needed. I believe this plant could change the world and reverse the opioid epidemic that plagues not only the USA but the world. Placing it as a schedule I substance would end that potential. You MUST give this a chance to be studied.

In 2010 I was involved in a major motor vehicle accident. The doctors idea of fixing me was to place in pain management and prescribed me 180 Percocet 10mg. a month. In the beginning they worked great. After a while I realized I was physically addicted to them, On days or at times of the day that I didn't have pain that constituted taking a pill an I tried not to take them I was throwing up, led cramps, insomnia, irritability and so many other adverse withdrawal symptoms that eventually caused my wife to leave me. \n They then got to the point that those were not helping at all so my script was changed to 180 15mg  Oxycodone per month. I knew I was in big trouble at this point. There was no just stopping or getting off of them. \n A good friend told me about Kratom. He gave me a bit of his own. When I woke up one morning I decided to give it a chance because nothing else worked. I wanted my life back, with or without pain. I was tired of always wondering if I had pills while out or at work. Tired of them controlling my life. \n I could not believe that after drinking a cup of Kratom tea in the morning (within 1 hour) I didn't have a single withdrawal symptom. NOT ONE!! I ordered Kratom for myself and within 23 days I was 100% PILL FREE!!  I couldn't believe after 6 years of those pills controlling my life, I was off of them. \n So now I'm off that I see that the Kratom helps a little with my pain that I'm still in constantly plus gives me a good bit of energy in the morning (instead of having coffee). \n If I don't have Kratom or I run out, it's not the end of the world for me as it would have been if I was missing just 1 of the 6 pills I was taking per day. \n I know a few other people that Kratom has helped in the same way. It truly is a great natural product that helps people vs the garbage the pharmaceutical companies and doctors want to give people. \n Kratom Has Given Me My Life Back Free Of Pills And All Other Perscriotion Pain Medication!!!\n\n Please!!! I beg that this product not be taken away. In fact I hope that more studies be done to see what other great qualities this leaf carries. \n \n Stop letting doctors and pharmaceutical companies get young people addicted to  opiates when this leaf, naturally helps. \n\n Thank you,\nAnthony Petrillo ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8718","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anthony Petrillo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have rheumatoid arthritis.

The tea if taken in too large a quantity only forces you to vomit, and it certainly is not capable of providing the urge that leads to abuse, it just doesn't give a high, at all. Those who claim it does are either a very very minor few, making it up, or are taking tampered Kratom. Please provide documented evidence of a serious addiction epidemic of pure Kratom, like that of opiates, meth, or heroin.\n\nThere is current research being done to prove Kratom's usefulness, many doctors and ordinary people who use the supplement, attest to its value as an analgesic and anti-depressant, not forgetting a natural remedy in getting off of opioids without the debilitating withdrawals. Why on earth do we want to put Kratom on schedule 1, or any schedule for that matter? because of a handful of people who ingested adulterated Kratom over the course of several years? Is this really good science? a few calls from the cdc? Calls that also came in were toddlers ingesting laundry pods, or people who felt they may have taken too much tylenol.  Do we ban everything? \n\nPeople, since the beginning of time, have looked for ways to enhance their mood (not sure why this is a bad thing) and people will never stop at finding ways to do so, even via a cup of coffee (a stimulant). Remove Kratom (which makes for a terrible recreational drug), and there will always be something vastly more dangerous waiting in line.\n\nKratom has enabled millions of people to carry on with normal productive lives after having little to no success with prescribed drugs.  I myself have suffered from injuries, joint pain, and depression with years of trial and error with prescribed medication that only ended up making things worse or adding to the problems with side effects.  When I was recommended this plant (by a herbalist three years ago) that like a camomile tea, i could make this into a tea, and it can help with pain and depression - it is NOT a cure.  Since taking this plant, i have been able to work, take care of my son and participate in all the activities i once enjoyed including exercising.   I am an ordinary productive person with a professional tech career, a degree, and a family. I am 45 years old. My 74 year old father, a retired engineer, has also tried Kratom and finds it helps with his leg pain and prefers to take the Kratom over the hydrocodone since he does not like taking acetaminophen.\n\nBy banning Kratom, it only expands the war on drugs and mass incarceration. Which will only be worsened by the fact that both sides of our borders, Mexico and Canada, have no restrictions on Kratom. By banning Kratom, it is government overreach and a government agency is restricting individual liberty just because it feels like it; it's also an issue of states' rights. Not to mention a terrible misuse of taxpayer money.\nI request your support in a fair review of this plant before any final decision is made as regards to its benefits and subsequent banning, and thus ruin the lives of so many it has helped.  Please instead consider regulation and better labeling as with other supplements. \nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSupporting Information:\n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2016/09/28/top-kratom-researcher-discusses-potential-medical-use-in-opioid-withdrawal/#4a20bbaa265b\n\nhttp://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-23/45-congressmen-ask-dea-not-to-ban-kratom-next-week?src=usn_tw\n\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/2109087-kratom-ban-rethink-is-a-hint-of-sanity-in-failed-us-war-on-drugs/\n\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2016/09/08/kratom-ban-hinders-research/\n\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b00360","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6159","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephanie Singh","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have always used Excedrin and Aleve for any minor aches and pains but I recently heard about Kratom an all natural plant that gives you the same if not more benefits.

Kratom grows out of the earth as a plant and like cannabis, ayahuasca, pscilocybin and peyote it is in my opinion immoral to deprive people of its healing power. These plants belong to all of us. Too many people have been labeled criminals and their lives ruined....not by the plants and drugs, but by our childish drug laws.  Regulate these compounds, make them only obtainable by adults to keep them away from our youth, but don't deny them to responsible adults, especially those who are using them to treat chronic pain or other diseases.\n\nI don't use kratom nor do I plan to, but I have found Cannabis to be very helpful for arthritic pain and to help me relax and enhance my spiritual awareness.  My cannabis use essentially deprives me of employment due to employer drug testing that is driven by your damaging laws.  My understanding is that kratom is far less addictive than the opiate based drugs manufactured by pharmaceutical companies and that you have deemed these pharma drugs less harmful than kratom or cannabis (by placing them on schedule 2 vs 1).  Anyone with basic knowledge of drug addiction data knows that the pharma drugs are the ones that really cause addiction and health risks (20,000 deaths per year).  I feel you need to transform your role into one of being a drug education organization instead of a criminalization/incarceration system.  Why not make an effort to actually help people and society instead of harming them as you currently do?  Addiction is a health issue not a crime problem.  We don't incarcerate obese people for over eating, yet they probably cause as much fiscal damage to society as a drug addict does.  Acting as the Drug Education Administration seems like a much more useful purpose for you rather than being a bureaucracy funded by our tax dollars that just throws human lives away in the prison systems, blackballs them to employers and lenders and drives them to use black market drugs of unknown purity and concentration that exposes them to needless risk.  Our current drug laws are nothing short of a crime against humanity.  You guys have been raging the drug war for 43 years now and guess what?  Black market drugs and addiction have not gone away; it has increased!!  All we have to show for this madness is the largest prison population of all modern countries.  That is nothing to be proud of.  It is time to take a different approach.  Banning kratom is another major step in the wrong direction:  It will only create more criminals out of people suffering from health problems.\n\nThank you for requesting feedback on your proposed scheduling of kratom.  You are at least going in the right direction by opening a dialog with the people whose lives you are jeopordizing.\n\nKonrad Kummli","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3967","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Konrad Kummli","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My journey with Kratom begin August of 2015.  I had ruptured disc L5 S1 and had two lamectomy /discectomy surgeries.  At that point in time I was addicted to Percocet.  I have gone through a few withdrawals prior while waiting for a new script.  In comes Kratom.  I got my first order and dosed with Kratom instead of my next dose of Percoset.   Amazingly,  it helped with my pain,  and I felt no effects of withdrawal from not taking Percoset.  Over Tim,  I found a few blends that not only helped with my pain,  but gave me a bit of energy and gave me a mood lift.   My primary physician was impressed and encouraged me to keep up the Kratom, especially since it is a natural botanical. I never looked at Percoset again,  until this looming ban put everyone on edge and Kratom become difficult to purchase. There is absolutely no reason to ban this plant.  NONE.  The only side effect that I have experienced was constipation.   Percoset caused me more severe constipation that about put me in the hospital,  and other effects.   I have never had a withdrawal symptom from Kratom.  Kratom helps me too be a better mom;  to be able to get a better handle on my disability and make it through the small amount of work that I actually do.

In short, the natural benefits from this dietary supplement have no scientific danger and thus should not be added to the Schedule One list at the very least until researchers can scientifically find and announce that there are in fact dangers. \n\nExperts in various international organizations whom I've spoken with believe that there is something very positive that the plant can possess which can help people stay off painkillers and this is of such great value now at a time where addiction is severe in the United States.\n\nWe ask you to please take this into consideration. \n\nExtract from one study analyzed: \n\nStudy: \"Inhibitoryeffectofmitragyna speciosa\" by Shingo Yano, Syunji Horie, Leonardo T. Yamamoto, 1997 (journal: El Sevier Journal)\n\nAbstract:\nEffect of mitragynine, an indole alkaloid isolated from Thai medicinal plant kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), on electrically stimulated contraction was studied in the guinea-pig ileum. Mitragynine (1 nM - 3 M) inhibited the ileum contraction elicited by electrical stimulation, and its pD2 value was 6.91  0.04 (n = 5). Morphine (1 nM  1 M) also inhibited the electrically stimulated contraction in a concentration-dependent manner (pD2 7.68  0.11; n = 5). Mitragynine was 10 fold less potent than morphine. Mitragynine (310 M) did not show any effect on the smooth muscle contraction induced by acetylcholine or histamine. Naloxone (10300 nM) reversed the inhibitory effect of mitragynine on electrically stimulated contraction. Furthermore, naloxone showed a shift of concentration-response curve of mitragynine to the right. There was no significant difference in the affinity of naloxone (i.e. pA2) in the presence of mitragynine or morphine. Mitragynine (310 M) inhibited the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal contraction following a brief (5 min) exposure of the ileum to morphine. Tetrodotoxin (1 M) and atropine (1 M) inhibited the withdrawal contraction. The present results suggest that mitragynine inhibits the electrically stimulated contraction of guinea-pig ileum through the opioid receptor.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6111","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Emiliano Reyes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Regulators:\n\nI am writing to you today about an organic herb that is the ground leaf of a tree in the same family as coffee. The media has recently begun portraying this safe herbal tea as some kind of \"new\" heroin or cocaine, or even a hallucinogen, which couldn't be further from the truth. And we all know about the 'hasty' ban that was narrowly avoided. Kratom should be viewed as an important tool in the solution to the opiate/opioid epidemic, not just another green plant for government agencies to vilify for profit.  Kratom has a 2000-year history of safe, responsible use as a detox from opium and alternative to dangerous drugs such as opium and heroin which is easily verified. The Botanical Education Alliance website (botanical-education.org) and Transnational Institute (TNI.org) have extensive medical and scientific papers available showing both its efficacy and almost foolproof safety profile.  Ithas greatly enhanced the chances of opiate addicts to achieve permanent recovery for the same period of time, inexpensively and unofficially. During the last 15 years it has become a staple of many successful Narcotics Anonymous participants, boosting long term sobriety rates by preventing PAWS relapses.\n\nThere is no respiratory depression associated with Kratom, an established scientific fact, making it impossible to overdose, since one simply upchucks a larger than necessary amount. There hasneverbeen a death associated with use of Kratom leaf alone --compare that with any prescription opiate/opioid, much less street drugs.\n\nI worked for a time as a legislative aid, so I understand that lawmakers and regulators have many demands on their time and sometimes only have time to scan the lobbyist statements before voting on some issues.Don't let that be the case with Kratom.\n\nYou wanted a silver bullet for the opiate crisis? --here it is use it!\n\nMany thousands, or more, mature American citizens have found kratom to be a safer alternative to opioids or western medicines' \"solutions\" and an entirely new lease on life without any of the harms or side effects associated with either street drugs or the tightrope of prescription substitutes.\n\nThe only connection that Kratom (mitragyna speciosa) has with opiates is its ability to safely block withdrawal symptoms of street drugs like heroin or dangerous Rx opiates/opioids and provide a safe alternative for pain management and/or mood support. It does not produce a \"high\" that users will chase, and is ineffective as a a recreational drug. It is actually quite subtle. Other than an absence of pain, no one would notice its effects any more than an espresso coffee. The rest is media hype and misinformation by mislead anti-drug groups and pharmaceutical companies who have noticed a drop in their revenues from the highly-addictive opiate/opioid Rx medications that are wreaking havoc on our society.\n\nThousands of older adults have been spared the horrid effects of prescription drug abuse by using this relatively harmless dietary supplement as a simple tea. If a ban on Kratom becomes law, responsible adult Americans will no longer be free to avoid the snare of chronic opiate dependence.Leave Americans a choice, don't become the drug pushers!\n\nAllow the many adult, responsible users of this herbal tea to educate you, and you will likely come to the same conclusion as the legislators in most States, that an age restriction of 18+ or 21+ is more than enough \"protection\" for consumers of this rather harmless herbal tea.\n\nThank you for allowing common sense to rule this issue rather than media hysteria and misinformation. I realize the war on drugs is always a high political priority, but don't shoot yourselves in the foot. Americans will benefit from your good sense. Good health to you.\n\nJohn Hilger\nPenacook, NH 03303\nhighwaterz2@gmail.com","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3314","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Hilger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have no personal use with Kratom but I have heard stories from a personal friend at my school who went down to mexico to use Kratom to get over their opioid addiction.

I quit drinking January 7th, 2013.  I had always turned to alcohol as an antidepressant, because within about 15 minutes of my first shot of the evening, I always felt so much better.  Happier, calmer, more socially interactive.\n\nBut alcohol has always gotten me in trouble.  I can trace every single bad thing that has ever happened to me back to drinking.  DUI's, break-ups with girlfriends, embarrassing situations .. all alcohol-related.  \n\nI knew I had to quit, but I had never succeeded before, despite multiple attempts.  In April of 2013, as my sobriety was already being tested because of depression, I discovered Kratom.  I was afraid of it at first, and would only take small amounts.  I still remember my reaction the first time I took a regular sized dose, \"This must be what normal people feel like!\"  I was not depressed any more.  I couldn't believe it!  I had been on 4 different antidepressants in my life .. Zoloft, Celexa, Wellbutrin and Paxil, with various levels of success, but never 100% successful.  They ALL came with side effects, from anxiety to sexual side effects and others.  In other words, none of them were completely without downsides in helping me deal with my depression.\n\nBut the Kratom was unbelievable.  My depression was completely gone, and as of now I have noticed zero negative side effects.  I can also say with confidence that I am NOT addicted to it.  How can I say that?  Because I am an addict, lol!!  I have gone without Kratom for several days and felt no withdrawals.  And Kratom has been proven to be non-addictive.  (If you need proof, see the University of Mississippi study.)  As a direct result of my daily kratom use, I am still sober as of today, November 19, 2016 .. Almost four years.  I would surely have failed in my quest to stay sober without it.  How do I know that?  Because when I quit drinking I was 52 years old.  I had tried to quit drinking at least a dozen times in my life, with zero success until now.  In the past four years I have not had a single drink .. Not one beer, not one shot, not even a sip.  I know myself, and I KNOW I could not have succeeded this long without it.\n\nI don't know why Kratom is under fire from the DEA, but I have my suspicions.  Any time a natural alternative to pharmaceuticals works this well, it's bound to come under fire.  Big corporations could lose some money if natural remedies become too popular.  I'm begging you, PLEASE don't take away the only thing that has helped me live a normal life.  If Kratom were to become illegal I would probably start to self-medicate again, turning to the only other substance that seems to work .. Alcohol.  Please don't do this!  Give Americans a choice!  Let them choose between a natural substance and harmful chemical pharmaceuticals!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8077","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anon anon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Seriously Kratom being my option for pain relief keeps me off opiate and opioid pain meds that I do NOT want to suffer long term addiction to based on chronic pain and continuous use.

My hope was shattered before it even had time to crystallize!\n\nFortunately for me and many MANY others there was enough noise made by enough people to push the powers that be to give the plan to schedule Kratom time for additional review and consideration. \n\nI promise, I grabbed onto that opportunity and ordered my first, a sampler pack of three ounces, one each of the three main strain categories, red, green, and white. Ive just placed my third order after discovering a strain that, for me, offers exceptional pain relief. \n\nFor the first time in several years I am able to complete light household chores and have recently sketched out a gentle exercise regimen to help me begin to repair and replace all the muscle mass lost over the decades. \n\nIt will be a slow journey. Too much movement too quickly sets me back for several days if Im not careful, so Ive learned to take it slow and easy. \n\nBut I finally have hope! I can see a light at the end of this very long tunnel and am definitely willing to put in the time and effort needed to have a life again. \n\nBTW, I experience no noticeable side effects from ingesting this plant material unless you count the significant reduction in the diarrhea that has always been part of my life with  IBS! Or that I am able to sleep for more than an hour at a time. Or that I no longer waken in extreme pelvic area pain and near paralysis of my lower body because Ive been able to begin regaining muscle mass which serves to hold my bone structure together more firmly. \n\nPlease, PLEASE, do not schedule Kratom!?!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5599","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mary Jane Ruffolo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, kratom has saved my life.

I suffer from extreme severe abdominal pain that has kept me bed ridden for a few years and Kratom is the only pain medicine I can take and not worry about my tolerance going through the rough like with Oxycodone. In fact, I have gone off very high amounts of oxycodone cold turkey several times in the past switching straight to just Kratom. Though the kratom doesn't treat my pain as well as the oxycodone when my tolerance to oxycodone is low, but when my tolerance has gotten too high in the past to where the oxycodone doesn't treat my pain very well if at all anymore, kratom works a lot better than oxycodone does for my pain then. \n\nEither way, Kratom still treats it well enough to be an oxycodone replacement, even if its just a temporary replacement. I have used it in the past to also help keep my oxycodone tolerance down and it really works! Kratom is the only thing I can take when my tolerance to oxycodone gets too high to where my prescription amount does not work very well if at all anymore, that's when Kratom helps me the most. I've been ok on my oxycodone for a little while now but this has been a repeating issue in the past so I need to have access to it in the future when my tolerance gets too high again. \n\nKratom does not suppress your breathing like oxycodone does at all, and you cannot take Kratom WITH oxycodone because the kratom blocks oxycodone from getting into your receptors. Kratom is extremely safe, even safer than tylenol! And millions of times more effective at treating pain. I honestly do not know what I would do without Kratom. I can't ask for anymore pain medicine as my doctor has me on the highest amount he is willing to give me, nor do I want to. Nor do I need to as long as I have access to kratom when my tolerance gets too high. Oxycodone is not meant to be used for long term treatment of pain because of the inevitable increase in tolerance preventing it from working properly. But kratom CAN be used for long term treatment of pain because, even though Kratom's tolerance does increase, it only increases to a certain point where it plateaus and will not increase anymore, unlike how oxycodone's tolerance will just keep increasing until it doesn't work at all anymore. So please, I beg you, don't ban Kratom, there's absolutely no reason to and it would cause me, and everyone else who's in a similar position as I am in, SO much harm!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7091","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please reconsider this decision.

Thank you.\n\nKratom has been effectively used as a remedy for those seeking to tame and then to withdraw from their addiction to heroin.  The vast majority of our new heroin addicts were introduced to Opioids via legitimate Rx.  It would be a cruel irony for the DEA to place Kratom on Schedule 1, withdrawing its use for reducing the dependence that originated from the governmental failures to restrict overprescription of legal opioids.  \n\nThe heroin epidemic was largely generated by the drug companies who deceptively promoted opioids both to the public and to physicians, and were not restrained effectively by Federal or State oversight.  It is incumbent upon  the DEA to facilitate addicts' recovery from this social and economic scourge-- and Kratom has been one substance that has been effective in achieving that goal, at least for some individuals. \n\nIf DEA lists it in Schedule 1, you effectively remove the ability to conduct meaningful research on its relative benefits and detriments for opiod addiction and for any other health or medical purposes.  That would be a serious mistake that would harm the public interest.  \n\nI recommend that it not be listed at all until sound research has been generated on its relative risks vs benefits.  If, as a temporary matter, DEA believes it important to list it while research is conducted, it should not be listed higher than Schedule 3.  \n\nAnother cruel and short-sighted decision would be for DEA to schedule kratom in a manner that removes access for those who need it for tapering off from opioids,  basically sending them back to the easy and relatively cheap supply of black market heroin.  It's far less dangerous individually and socially than heroin, and DEA should be wise about how restricting access to kratom may cause weaned addicts to return to heroin.

Actually, quite the contrary is true in that people use Kratom to end their addicting relationships with opiates.  Proof of this is readily found across the Internet by reading blogs and drug message boards.  If the DEA has not taken time to study this for itself, I suggest it do so before making a decision to ban Kratom and thereby cause more harm to the public than good.\n\nThank you for hearing me and the thousands of others, many vets, out on this important issue.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19671","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"D Lindstrom","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jonathon Bischof and I am a 25 year old college graduate working in the financial industry, and I would like to make my opinion known regarding the schedule I classification of the alkaloids in Kratom. I believe that restricting access to these substances will have strongly negative unintended consequences, particularly in the forms of encouraging further opiate addictions (already a huge problem in this country) as well as creating an entirely new swathe of nominal \"criminals,\" with little to no reasonable medical basis. The people most pushing this legislation are those who stand to make the most money from these consequences. However, the people who stand to gain the most from Kratom's continued legal status are average Americans. Personally, I do not use Kratom regularly, but in my experience, it is a viable alternative to ADHD medications which I am currently prescribed. As ADHD medications are derivatives from amphetamines and related stimulants, and because we lack long term science on their effects on the body, I believe that we need to continue to keep the marketplace of ideas open, and allow alternative treatments to be pursued. Relegating these Kratom alkaloids to the dust heap of drugs that are Schedule I is a virtual guarantee that any medical efficacy to be derived from them will be squandered in the name of \"the war on drugs.\" As we have seen, this \"war\" is unwinnable, and has resulted in huge portions of our population possessing criminal records that preclude them from fruitful participation in society. I implore you, as a liberty-leaning compatriot, to please take the side of freedom and liberty, which this country was founded upon, and continue to allow the use of these substances without penalty unless and until there is evidence based reasoning to do otherwise.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17861","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathon Bischof","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for your thoughtful consideration and for this opportunity to use our rights to voice our opinions. I am personally not a kratom user but I am close with several people who are. These people have had serious, long-term injuries and use it as a natural alternative to pain killers. My boyfriend shattered his tibial plateau into over 100 pieces early this year which will never return to its previous state and he will always be in pain. He is a recovering addict which made it extremely difficult to find a balance between pain management and not using unnecessary, extremely addictive and damaging substances. Kratom has provided him with a great option for after a long day at work (he's a chef so he's on his feet all day) without the hard come down or feeling like he needs more. Please reconsider the benefits of having this herb legal and easily accessible. If I were my boyfriend or any of my other friends who benefit from the effects of kratom, I would find it very difficult to not turn to the easily accessible underground drug market if I no longer had the option of buying kratom legally in order to manage my pain. I hope that you'll take these points into consideration and I hope a decision is made that will truly benefit the people of the country. Thank you again for your time and consideration.

It has DRASTICALLY improved several areas of my life, and as I'm sure you've heard, has saved many others from the grip of opiate addiction.\n\nI've used to treat chronic pain from a back injury, and it has helped me to the point that I have gone from a sedentary lifestyle to one where I am able to exercise 5 days per week. Which in turn has significantly improved my overall health and well being. I've also used it to treat my social anxiety, and in this role too, kratom has proved to be invaluable. I've gone from actively avoiding certain social situations to genuinely looking forward to meeting and getting to know other people. All of these wonderful benefits have been achieved without any negative side effects whatsoever. It's not addictive. It has zero psychoactive properties when used responsibly. The cases of overdose attributed to kratom have all came from situations where people were using other drugs in addition to kratom. Kratom is self regulating in that if too much is taken the user will vomit before any negative effects can be realized. \n\nKratom is incredibly safe. To deny people who are suffering access to this wonderful gift from nature would be a travesty and a testimony to the influence that the pharmaceutical lobby has over our government.

I wont go into much detail about my health except I had to quit my job and can function very little. I had my dream job, finally, for 14 years I taught kindergarten at an orthodox Jewish day school. I became more religious and more observant, keeping as many of the laws of the Torah as I could. I finally met an amazing man, got married and have two beautiful children. My illnesses have finally broken me and I struggle to enjoy my wonderful life. I had to quit work and just barely get by. Then I found kratom when I was searching for alternative ways to help pain. I have been taking kratom for about 3 years now (I just turned 43). It helps tremendously with my pain and anxiety. I had broken down and finally went to pain management. I wanted help but all they offered me were hard core pain meds. I tried them but they were horrible and I was afraid of addiction so I turned to kratom. It has helped me minimize the amount of pain meds I need to take and sometimes I don't need them at all. Kratom also helps me with anxiety.  For me, sometimes it will help with energy but not always. Kratom has helped me to be able to enjoy my family. I can now take my kids (5 & 7) to get ice cream or to the park. I can play games with them on the floor and actually be able to get back up! I am very grateful to have such an amazing plant, a non addictive alternative to all the nasty prescription medications out there. Please do not take this away from me and everyone else. It is just another supplement, all natural and not in any way harmful. If you take it away, I will have no choice but to go back on the harsh prescription medications that leave me feeling like a zombie and dependent on a pill everyday for the rest of my life. Please do not take away my choice, my right to choose a natural approach.

I have a husband and three children ages 14, 4, and 2. \nOur entire family is very proactive with our heath, my husband has Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and we have found that a healthy diet helps control it more than anything. So we eat totally organic with lots of fresh, local produce. We care very much about what we put into our bodies. I have severe migraines, back/neck pain (which frequently causes the migraines), and arthritis in one hip. My  Mom and all of her siblings have had hip replacements, I will eventually have to get one myself. The solutions doctors have given me (and my husband) for our painful, life-limiting health issues, are medications, usually opiates or drugs that I don't feel comfortable taking and caring for my young children, certainly not driving.\nI found kratom while searching for a natural alternative, something to help me be functional and avoid the drugs I was being offered and didn't want to take. I've only ever bought and taken the pure powder form (just kratom, no additives) and take it as a tea along with my coffee. \nKratom was fantastic for both my husband and I - we could take the tea, pain would vastly improve, and we would be totally functional, unlike the pharmaceuticals we tried previously. \nMy husband and I used kratom successfully as a supplement for over 3 years, and it was a fantastic supplement. Our pain was vastly reduced and we could be active, yet not sleepy or drugged. During that time my business successfully grew, I have grown revenue by 38% average year over year since 2010. My husband started his own business this past year, his work is quite physical, but with kratom and a healthy diet, he had no issues performing the work.\nUnfortunately, we are in the state of Alabama. Despite trying to call and email every representative I could, no one heard my voice. No one listened, and kratom became a schedule 1 substance this year. I disposed of the kratom I had, and we have been without for months now. \nThe difference is starting, and sad. I get migraines so terrible that I am throwing up and laying in a dark room, having to take medications that make me sleepy, and unable to work. I've had to reduce the amount of clients I take on because of my pain. My husband has hired several employees, also reducing his profits because he is in too much pain to perform the work himself. We are so hurt and sad that Alabama took a natural plant based substance from us. A plant that helped us be the business owners and parents we wanted to be with out ever being drugged or high. \nNo one listened to us in Alabama. They called us druggies. I've never been addicted to any drug, rarely drink, and take excellent care of my body.

As i stopped them all togheter at ones I flet no difference at all and I supose, they had no effect at all. I went surching Spices, Plants and Foods for anti-depressiv treatment. Then I discovered Kratom and it changed everything in my whole life: I am painfree and happy, relaxed and motivated to do things- eaven with real reasons to be down and sad. Kratom makes it all a lot easyer, and I do it singing along with a smile. I discovered my deep love to all beings and things in the world again. I consume 3 x 2.5gr. Kratom, every day a different sort (white, red, green, yellow, Thai, Sumatra, Borneo, Bali, Maeng Da). I develop no tolerance at all. I am using a scale to allways drink the same weight of Kratom with water, a dash of lemon and some pipali in an empty estomag and eat greasy things only one hour later. In freetime i combine it with ashwagandha, kanna, maca, guarana or kava-kava and i get a real productive, concentraded, focused energykick and I do all my projects and plans with joy. Ugly and awfull things, problems, failings or hurtful persons lose theyr dominance and importance in thinking. Kratom brings one in a state of the moment with a different feel of time, everything seems slightly floating in a soft pink cotton cloud. This moments could last forever and its very special to me. No place for anxiety, doubt or fear but very positiv, strong and hopeful. Past and future loose importance, I am just me right then and this being feels very warm, content and thankful for one's own living in a body full of satisfaction. It is a little wonderplant to me. I never ever take a big load at a time. Always 2.5gr or less max 4 times a day, usualy 2-3. I cannot recognise one single negative side effect by dayli use of 7.5 gr. Kratom. There is no adiction, no withdrawal when stopping some time.  I use public transport and only drive my race bicycle, no car.

My struggles with addiction have not been easy and have been marked by many failures.  However, 8 years ago I discovered Kratom while doing research for the company I worked for at the time looking for alternative, non-addicting analgesics.  I learned that Kratom had been used in other countries to treat addiction and so I thought it would worth trying.  I have been using Kratom daily for the past 8 years and it has totally removed any cravings for drugs or alcohol.   It is no longer a battle to stay sober, rather it just comes naturally.  I have no desire or craving whatsoever.  For example my wife can cook with wine in the house and I won't have to fight myself to not drink the rest of it.  Or someone in the family has dental surgery and I no longer steal the rest of their painkillers after they are healed.   I can be around drugs and alcohol and have no desire to use them, which is quite amazing for a recovering addict.  It has been a huge help to me in maintaining my sobriety.  In terms of safety,  I have experienced no adverse effects and my blood work has been normal so far.   In terms of addictiveness there is some physical dependence, similar to caffeine and nicotine,  both of which are legal, over-the-counter substances.  In addition it does not impair my faculties or effect my mood in any way.  Given the opioid epidemic in this country it would be a travesty to outlaw a safe alternative which helps people like me overcome addiction.  I hope you take this into consideration when making your decision.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4633","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Genesis 9:3 \nNew International Version\nEverything that lives and moves about will be food for you. \nJust as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.\n\nA few weeks ago, we told you about the DEA's decision to withdraw its plan for banning kratom, a plant native to Southeast Asia that is currently used medicinally in the United States by numbers estimated in the millions. Postponing the ban - thanks to a public outcry from the drug policy reform community - was an unprecedented move for the DEA, but it was only a delay. \n\nIn order to stop this ban, we need our community to come together again and submit public comments by tomorrow, December 1 at 11:59pm ET telling the DEA why kratom should not be banned. \n\nPlease consider submitting a comment, using these helpful talking points from our partners at the Drug Policy Alliance:\n\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nThe War on Drugs has had a catastrophic impact on the trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. We need to restore that trust, and allowing for research and regulation of drugs like kratom will be a significant step. \n\nPlease make your voice heard by leaving a comment for the DEA before the deadline tomorrow night. \n\nWe're counting on you!\n\nThank you, \n\n\nMajor Neill Franklin (Ret.)\nExecutive Director","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20189","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"richard moore","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Both me and my bother were diagnosed with muscular dystrophy  12 years ago .

I'm 41 years old. I'm a professionally licensed massage therapist with 15 years of experience. I'm a productive member of society who helps heal people, take away their pain and tension, and keep them from undergoing surgery.\n\nI started using kratom earlier this year. I was informed about it by a friend who and said how much it helped her. I suffer from severe depression, anxiety and headaches. From the very start, kratom has helped me daily by wiping out the anxiety and depression, and easing my headaches.\n\nI don't drink or do drugs. I have no need to get high. I use kratom medicinally, and I'm not addicted to it. I typically take it twice a day, then stop in the later hours of the night when life calms down.\n\nI firmly believe that it's my right  to decide what goes into my body. People are killing themselves and/or destroying their bodies with alcohol and cigarettes, which are legal and readily available. I believe that the individual should be punished for any crimes related to what they consume, and not the public.\n\nPutting kratom into the schedule one list without any kind of testing is something I'm firmly against, and a decision that I believe would hurt many, many Americans. I personally do not want to even think of a life without kratom. It would severely hurt me, and make me less efficient at doing my job of helping others also be productive.\n\n At this point, I don't even think my life would be worth living without kratom. I'd gotten to such a low point this year that I was considering suicide. I then was very timely introduced to kratom, which turned things around for me, and spared my loved ones a lot of pain. I have to take care of my elderly father, mother and stepfather. Kratom has helped me do so in a better manner.\n\nIn my opinion, kratom should be readily available to anyone 21 years of age or older. It has a myriad of health benefits, both mental and physical, which I've experienced firsthand. I believe denying it to the public and making productive members of society criminals for its possession is completely wrong and unfair.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0824","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyra Pearl","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am currently not on Kratom, but have chronic pain with an auto immune condition.

This to me is a freedom issue.  People should be allowed to use any substance they choose, so long as it does not impact negatively on others.

When you do not understand something, should you avoid discussing it?  Should you avoid testing it and learning about all it's side effects?  No.  You should keep it away from the schedule 1 status and allow people that are curious to perform the necessary tests to learn more about it.  \n\nIt is our goal as a country to allow people the access to these plants when they may need them.

We have seen numerous times in the past that scheduling a substance before proper research has been conducted results in disastrous effects.  It is crucial that we let our scientists do their job, and research these compounds before we make a rash decision and prevent them from doing so.  There is not a single case where scheduling a substance has the effect that it was intended to have- it simply wastes our society's money, time, and resources trying to enforce laws that are unjust.  On a personal level, I have many family members who struggled with opiate addictions who found Kratom to be a very safe and effective way of getting themselves off of the more dangerous and unsafe opiate drug options.  \n\nThe original scheduling of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine was pushed back because the country spoke out against this move and insisted that it would be a mistake.  In addition, many scientists and social scientists have agreed that scheduling these compounds would have adverse effects.  The role of government is to represent the people in which it governs, and the people have spoken.  We must withdrawal the notice to classify mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as a scheduled substance immediately.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21652","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Pardington","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The Thai government is probably going to be legalizing kratom in the near future.

I am not looking to get high under the radar, but instead looking to get through life without the government interjecting itself into my decision to  injest a plant (which just so happens to be high in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [according to the very little research there has been]) that allows me to stay away from pain clinics and anything with the synthetic alternatives.\n\n All that I ask is that you consider each human involved when you make a decision on this planet& For those of us who use and enjoy and are improved by crowd him, it would be a very big change in our lives& And that seems just unfair.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15304","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mario Kelley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 59 year old construction worker, father, and law abiding citizen and reside in California. As a result of years of hard physical labor I have degenerative disc disease, spondylosis, and spondolioysis, which has caused chronic pain for years.  As a result of these conditions, I was prescribed opiate pain medication for many years. Eventually, I became addicted, which negatively affected every area of my life. I ultimately got clean, but the pain and depression returned worse than ever. Faced with the dire prospect of returning to opiates, I discovered kratom. Taken as needed as a tea this plant manages my pain, without producing any impairment. Since it does not produce a \"high\" I am never tempted to take it excessively. Since it does not cause respiratory depression, there is no chance of death from overdose. It has been used safely in SouthEast  Asia for thousands of years and has never caused a death when taken alone. Since it also partially suppresses withdrawal symptoms, many addicts have used it to get off of much  more dangerous hard drugs. This herb has given me my life back. I am now able to work and be a productive member of society. Please take the time to examine what this plant has done for so many.

I managed to get of Drugs but struggled with depression, anxiety as well as ptsd  due to a very abusive and tramatic  child hood. I was able to hold a job and do fairly well, however I was often depressed sleep deprived and struggling with my past, I begun to seek out  holistic ways of remedying these issues. Kava , Valerian and Blue lotus where a fewI used in tea. I hoped on line and eventually found a site that explained and carried a hundred or more herbs,Kratom was tea I tried and was not happy with the outcome  my first time using it. I took to much and felt clouded . I did the same with kava my first use. I then tried a smaller amount and I was totally shocked . Within a few days I had realized this was going to help me, It did. I don't believe this is addictive. Having been addicted to heroin I know I don't have to take this, I know when I don't my deep seeded issues return. I ask you to please consider the many people like my self who are able to stay off of hard drugs toxic pharmaceuticals and worse, ( Methedone) Ive seen a lot of abuse  in my life time.

Placing this substance in Schedule I immediately prevents any research from being performed to determine whether it may have a legitimate medical use. Kratom has been used for hundreds of years to relieve symptoms of pain and stress, and promote relaxation and sleep. It is a unique substance that acts on the opioid receptors but does not have the same addictive potential as substances like heroin and morphine. Also, it is nearly impossible to overdose on kratom, making it a much safer alternative to more dangerous opiate drugs. I hope that the DEA will see the light on this issue and consider scheduling it at a lower level. I strongly believe that more research needs to be performed on this very interesting plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2776","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephen Sienknecht","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been dealing with Chronic Lyme Disease for quite some time now.

I felt like such a zombie on all the medications I was prescribed by my former neurologist. I began to look for natural remedies for the severe pain, migraines, and confusion I was experiencing. I came upon Kratom on the internet. I researched this plant for eight weeks before I decided to try it. It was so nice to take some Kratom and not feel anything other than better. I had less pain and less confusion. I only experience a sense of well being from taking this. I am currently taking Kratom, not only for chronic pain, but to help relieve the withdrawals i'm having from getting off the so addictive medications I was prescribed that have way too many devastating side effects. I am able to focus better with Kratom. I have more energy when I take Kratom, unlike like with the way I feel while taking the medications. This country is facing terrible opiate addiction, heroin addiction, benzodiapene addiction. Kratom helps with all of these things. In my opinion, it should never become illegal or listed as a Schedule 1 drug. It isn't addictive and has not proved to be harmful to anyone. Millions of Americans now take Kratom to help their ailments and have been for many years. I plead with you to keep this natural supplement legal.

There can be little argument that America is in the midst of an deadly opioid epidemic that is still on the rise.  In 2010, there were 13,652 unintentional deaths from opioid pain relievers (83% of unintentional deaths from all prescription drugs), and there was a five-fold increase in treatment admissions for prescription pain relievers between 2001 and 2011 (from 35,648 to 180,708). Compare that to the meager 660 reports of exposure to kratom US Poison Centers received between 2010 and 2015.  In the US in 2014 alone, 30,000 people died from prescription opioid and heroin overdose -- four times the figure from fifteen years earlier in 1999. Kratom, on the other hand, has been linked to 14 deaths between 2014 and 2016; however, in none of these cases was kratom the sole factor, and it is not clear what role if any kratom had in these deaths.  Furthermore, kratom could very well be a critical tool in the fight against opioid dependence, as (anecdotally) many use the substance sparingly to ween themselves off prescription painkiller, heroin, and alcohol dependency.\n\nThe 'recreational' potential for kratom also remains small.  In low doses, kratom produces a subtle stimulating effect, similar to its relative coffee; in larger doses, it creates a subtle relaxing effect.  At all levels, kratom produces some pain-killing properties.  It is not psychotropic or hallucinogenic in nature, nor does it produce the typical dangers of opiates.\n\nIt is true that kratom has addictive properties.  It's surely prudent to keep kratom out of the hands of minors who may not possess the discretion to make use of the botanical responsibly.  The biggest danger kratom in its current form poses to the public lies in the fact that it is wholly unregulated.   There are no purity standards, no standard dosages, and no checks and balances for manufacturers and vendors of the product.  I have no problem regulating kratom, ensuring dangerous synthetics do not make it market under the guise of pure ground leaf.   I am in favor of adopting purity standards.   There is no evidence, however, that mitragyna speciosa should be scheduled.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23014","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"none","postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cody Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I personally know of four different people who used kratom to get off of opiates two of those people were on methadone.

It does not discriminate. They gave her at one point 20 trigger point injections, that did not help at all.

I ask that you keep nature legal for those who chose to use it for it's benefits so that they and myself do not have to turn to debilitating drugs such as vicodin to handle the pain and all the side effects that come with pain and then the drugs own negative impact on our health both physically and mentally. I can function perfectly fine while under the effects of kratom, I cannot while on vicodin. While on vicodin or any such similar drug, I become a danger to myself and to others as I would essentially be intoxicated. Please consider that. Kratom allows people like me to work safely and not impact others, if we have to turn to prescription drugs, we become a danger to not only ourselves, but others.

For some reason, the DEA and Congress believes themselves to be professionals in the field of medicine, and time and time again blatantly ignore the simple facts shown by doctors and patients across the nation. In the eyes of the DEA, the only thing that can be considered a medicine is a synthesized molecule that allows the private corporations who lobby Congress to profit. Because plants couldn't possibly be valuable medicines by themselves... the only thing that the DEA is showing is is their own ignorance, not their \"understanding of medicine.\" What also infuriates me is how trigger happy Congress and the DEA are when it comes to psychoactive substances, and medicines in particular. Just because a substance is psychoactive DOES NOT MEAN that it is not a valid medicine, and that's something Congress, the DEA and the public at large need to understand. By adding more natural medicines to the Controlled Substances Act, the DEA is only fueling the utter failure that is the war on drugs, and wasting billions of taxpayer dollars. I'm glad to see that the DEA is willing to listen to the public.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3984","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Kimmey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Perhaps not to be listed as a truly dangerous drug","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2600","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Loma Griffith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 59 yr. old mother and homemaker.

I'm 35 years old. I'm a professional artist by trade and I live in sunny Florida. I suffer from chronic pain and depression, all my life. Last year it got so bad that just surviving took all the mental focus & energy I had day to day. I've tried a lot of natural remedies & vitamins, but nothing provided actual relief. I was starting to consider harming myself, ending it all. A friend recommended kratom tea and I knew the first time I tried it that there was something  special about it. It eased my back pain and my depression in a way that nothing else has. I bought a supply and I use a small amount every day to keep me pain free and in a good mood, able to face my work and social life. I recently started getting psychiatric treatment as well, but I still consume kratom almost every day after a year.  I have not developed a tolerance to it.  The same small amount is still just as helpful as the first time.  Nor have I developed a dependence of it.  I go for days sometimes without kratom if I don't  feel a need for it & don't notice any withdrawal symptoms at all.  Its effects are noticable, but not distracting, powerful but not overpowering.  I don't feel at all intoxicated when I take kratom, if anything I'm more alert & present in the world, more myself.  When I heard the news of the DEA wanting to ban kratom I was pretty upset and baffled.  It seems like, if the DEA really wanted to protect the public from harmful drugs, that they'd outlaw the opiates and addictive substances that kratom is such a safe alternative for.  How could anyone in a position of power live with themselves knowing they outlawed something that makes such a positive difference in people's health and happiness? \nPlease open your minds & hearts. Do the right thing.  Keep kratom legal and easy to access for all the people out there trying to make a difference in their lives without turning to expensive drugs that just hurt us in the long run.  The difference between kratom and such drugs is so obvious  that a DEA ban on kratom would only make it obvious that the DEA has some kind of conflict of interest and actually wants people to be hooked on disgusting pain pills.

Sad as I was in perfect physical condition - luckily I'm alive they say and I agree. \n\nJust discovered Kratom a month ago and it totally gives me a break from the pain, and I do not take it all of the time. I live in Colorado and marajuana is legal, but I do not like it and have a job that does not allow for a foggy mind - I operate three franchised motels. This Kratom substance is the real deal, and my understanding is that it causes your body to enable it's own pain relief response - it's not a narcotic in any form.\n\nJust like the government to regulate something natural and that works - just when I found relief. I hope the government fails at this because this substance has really improved my quality of life, when cronic pain would cause one to feed the drug industry and risk serious addiction. Or worse, many pain sufferers are denied narcotics from their doctors and seek them on the street.

I am also the mother of 4. I am writing in protest of the DEA's plan to place kratom on the list of schedule I substances.\n I began using kratom in 2013. At that time, I had been in recovery from alcohol dependence for over 10 years. I also had been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder since the age of 16. My symptoms had been manageable without medication for  a number of years. In February of 2013, something happened in my life that triggered my PTSD. I began to experience panic attacks which had been dormant for in many years. I was prescribed Ativan (a benzodiazepine with high potential for abuse for someone in recovery from alcoholism) in addition to both Zoloft and Wellbutrin. I used the medications as prescribed, with limited success in coping with hopelessness and suicidal ideation. I was desperate to feel better, I was having urges to drink and I began searching for alternatives to the medications. That is when I discovered kratom.\n The kratom has enabled me to live my life free from those symptoms. I also strongly believe that without kratom, it is highly likely that I would have returned to alcohol abuse in my desperation. Kratom allows me to be successful in my career and to remain a positive role model to my children.\n I suspect that kratom would be extremely helpful to my opiate dependent clients although without an approved medical use I am not able to suggest it to them. In an era when so many are dying from opiate overdose it is crucial that we as  a society explore everything that may potentially be helpful in treating addiction.\n\nSincerely,\n Susan Wilk, CAC","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13303","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Susan Wilk","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom.

The opportunity to speak to you about this is a great joy and freedom and makes me proud to be an American.\n\n      The premise of my story is lengthy but the conclusion is quite simple.   As a father of three I have an un-diagnosed condition which is baffling modern medicine.   With symptoms synonymous with Crones disease, Lupus, adrenal failure, and much more, I continue the journey of discovery.  \n\n     My career and family lost me for about 1.5 years.  A revelation did occur after having under futility tried everything doctors prescribed and advise given by well-meaning people in my circle of influence..   That revelation came from a simple blog site of people suffering similarly.  It is that Kratom can restore my function.   \n\n     Although Kratom was no cure, it was the only God given medicine that got me out of bed and and able to function even returning me to nearly 100% capacity and without side-effects that all other medications gave.   Kratom still allowed me to drive safely and even fight in martial arts which is my life-blood.   It allowed me to return to all activities not only offering pain relief, but clarity of mind.   It was then that I determined that I could return to corporate America and return to providing for my family.   \n\n     Your announcement to schedule this herbal remedy halted that.   After your announcement, I made effort to return to other remedies but with no success.   I therefore am in waiting to see what will come of your investigation.  \n\n      I realize that you have our best interest in mind.   I realize that Kratom has the appearance of being a harmful substance yet it seems the abuse is by those who combine Kratom with other substances.   The metrics on Kratom appear that it is less harmful than items with allergic responses.  I don't mean to tell you how to do you job, but it seems that Eggs, Mill, and peanut butter have a far higher degree and incidence of harm.   I add this reminder to hopeful gain consideration in how you weigh any benefits to Kratom against the harm.   \n\n     For 42 year old responsible fathers, like myself, Kratom is an outstanding solution to my debilitating situation to which doctors have no solution.   Scheduling this substance will not only transform my life, but the lives of my kids and wife.   Scheduling this substance will make even studying this more difficult as well.   Liberty and reasonable rational discovery can trump the abuse by some.  Having discovered that millions are on this substance, it has to be shocking that not more harm has been reported.       \n\nHerbs do in fact have very dangerous properties, and some require regulation I am sure.   Here is a list that I am sure you are already privy to that remind us that misuse of anything can be harmful and that different people have different responses to perfectly natural substances.    Take Yohimbe bark for example, it can cause death as well, but not even labeled warning.       \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_herbs_with_known_adverse_effects\n\n    I know that it is presumptuous where I sit to pretend to know the challenge you face.  Your purpose is clear and noble.  My ask is that you take the time to review all the stories and come to a very rational conclusion before knee-jerking and affecting my life and other lives.  Again though, I cannot thank you enough for giving us the opportunity to share with you our experience and wisdom in this matter.   I will be praying that the result of your inquiry becomes favorable to my challenge.    \n\nFrom a Patriot and Loving Father Who Will Never Risk Breaking the Law.   \n\n** I have attached just a few sample of my blood tests to show that my issue fluctuates and attacks different organs at different times to prove that doctors cannot isolate my condition.    I am to have my adrenal glands tested shortly.**\n\n      ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22293","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David M.

The anti-anxiolytic and anti-depressive qualities are also prominent.\nThe real harm from this comes in unregulated extracts which take this nearly harmless drug and make it 100 times stronger.  I believe that these extracts are what should be regulated further.  The raw powder/leaf itself poses no threat to public interest, and should remain available on the free market for its medicinal benefits.  \nMitragyna Speciosa (Kratom) is in the coffee family, and it would be ridiculous to ban something that is related to this drug.

We have a member of the family who has gone through a severe pain on a daily basis 24/7 non stop. Doctors have not been able to diagnose the source of the pain, and the only supplement that has helped is Kratom.  It is extremely unnerving to see a loved one who is suffering with so much pain and not be able to help in any way. It is even more frustrating to be seeking medical attention, and have doctor after doctor telling you that nothing shows up as being abnormal and everything is normal, when in reality, we know that this is not the case.\n\nIf Kratom is considered part of the family of opiates and has not the same negative effects as prescribed opiates, why on earth would you want to ban it!  If anything, it should be allowed to be studied by scientist, and be formulated in such a way\nthat doctors can prescribe it to patients who are experiencing severe pain.  Patients, who are looking for safer alternatives to meds, need to have healthy options that they can rely on.  This plant needs to be given serious consideration before making any decisions by those that have not experienced the type of pain that Kratom users are going through. To ban it on a whelm, or just arbitrarily would be inhumane and unjust to those that are receiving some relief ,and, at the same time, getting it in a much safer manner. I say again--- Please reconsider. Do not ban this plant from the market. Lets agree to do some clinical studies and see what doctors and scientist have to say about this promising method of treating severe pain.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5048","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Maria T.","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It has now been three months since the DEA first declared kratom an \"imminent threat\" to public safety based on dubiously-collected data and, in some cases, outright propaganda. \n\nConsider, in the months that have followed, the epidemic that has occurred due to the scheduling delay. The deaths, the pain and suffering, the familes torn apart because of this plant.\n\nOf course none of this has happened. On the contrary, the kratom community, politicians, scientists, journalists, doctors, lawyers, teachers, nurses, addiction specialists from all over the country have all galvanized to save kratom from becoming criminalized.

It is keeping families together, allowing good, hard-working people to remain at their jobs and be productive members of society.\n\nWhat a tragedy for these people if Washington bureaucrats make them criminals.

I have had corrective surgery on my neck and had to have a disc fusion back in 2010.  To get through the pain, I was prescribed strong opiates and was on them for quite a while.\n\nA friend told me about Kratom a few years ago, and I was skeptical (to say the least) that it could touch the pain I was in.  I gave it a shot because I did not want to be 'that guy' who got hooked on Percocet - I was well on my way- and I was desperate to reduce my dependence on opiates and Advil.\n\nThe difference was shocking.  Withing ten minutes of taking a spoonful of it, my pain and discomfort was distinctly subdued.  In two weeks, I was no longer on opiates or Motrin. For me, it was a silver bullet that reduced my pain and allowed me to wean myself off the Percocet without having massive withdrawal. I cannot imagine having to go back to other pain management methods now.

They find another natural, plant-based medication that shows promise in helping people get rid of their opioid addiction (can't lose that as well as pot, what would they do all day?) as well as pain management- a remedy that no one has ever heard of- and they think to themselves \"Wow, once word gets out about this, it could be as popular as pot!  If we make it illegal now, we could have years of busting people in front of us!  We have to make sure that as many people as possible know about this so we can gear up and start a new drug war. Let's go ahead and publicize it, so that everybody knows about it, and when they start using it instead of real drugs [the harmful kind], we'll be all set.\"\nThe DEA needs to be reigned in big time.

At first, my doctors prescribed tramadol to help manage the pain. Occasional doses, along with yoga, CBT and time management, allowed to me have a better quality of life than I'd had in over a year. Then, one of my doctors realized that the tramadol put me at a higher risk for seizures and since I have intractible epilepsy, it was decided that I could no longer take that medication. I tried a couple of other non-opiate medications, such as a low dose antidepressant, but because of my extreme sensitivities to medication, I was unable to continue with those. That was when I discovered Kratom. I started with a very low dose then notched it up just a bit and I found that my pain was greatly reduced and my energy and ability to remember things improved. It was perfect. I noticed no side effects and have stayed at the same dose for the last 8 months. When I heard that the DEA was going to make it a scheduled substance I was devastated. My oldest kid, who is 16, said, \"but mom, without the Kratom, it's like you're not here. \nWithout the Kratom I will be unable to manage my fibromyalgia adequately. My doctors have no more suggestions for treatment. I don't want to go back to not being able to be present with my family. I don't want to lose my already limited social life. \nIf the DEA makes Kratom a scheduled substance, thousands, maybe millions, of people with fibromyalgia,CFS, and chronic pain will be left with few options for managing their pain. Doctors are less and less willing to prescribe narcotic pain killers, even when patients use them responsibly. \nKratom has never made me feel high and when I don't take it for a few days I don't notice any withdrawal symptoms. I am a 44 year old mother of 3 kids living on disability because of my seizure disorder.

I am a 26 year old college student majoring in Engineering. I would like to share my opinion regarding the DEA's intent to schedule kratom. I have been taking kratom on a daily basis since 2012. In 2006 I had a motorcycle accident in which I had to have my leg amputated and extensive reconstructive surgeries. After leaving the hospital I developed an addiction to prescription painkillers and also started having really bad depression and pain due to the loss of my leg. I spent several years battling my addiction and depression. In 2012 I found out about kratom. I tried it and was surprised to learn how effective it was at treating my leg pain without the overly sedating and intoxicating feeling I would get with prescription drugs. After using kratom for several weeks my depression also got increasingly better and I was able to start to be social again. My relationships with my family and friends were stronger and I started to once again feel like my real actual happy self. I use kratom daily because it completely changed my life for the better. Kratom helps me to wake up, focus, study on homework, deal with anxiety and leg pain, and also helped me to stop abusing dangerous prescription drugs. Since I began to use kratom, I have never once been in a situation where I needed urgent medical attention from taking too much kratom. If I ever did eat too much kratom, the worst thing that happened was feeling nauseous, vomiting, then feeling absolutely normal again. I have never felt labored breathing, extreme drowsiness or any other symptoms, common with prescription drugs that could lead to the hospital, while taking kratom. Kratom was a lifesaver for me. It turned my life around by helping me kick a drug habit, ridding me of my depression and anxiety, eliminating the pain from surgeries, returning my social life, and helping me be successful in returning to college. I do not agree that kratom presents an imminent hazard to public safety because I have personally used it for years and have never had it present a threat to my health. Kratom has actually made me healthier than I was before. I should not be considered a criminal or thrown in prison for ingesting a natural herbal substance that does nothing but help me and thousands of other people across the country. Criminalizing kratom would actually have a negative effect on a lot of people across the country and would also destroy the lives of the people who have been saved by turning to kratom. I would like to ask the DEA to do what is morally correct, and to refrain from scheduling kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1182","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andre Nunez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not take away out hopes and dreams of living a healthy unaddicted lifestyle.

It has tremendous potential to be made into medicine as well, but much more research is needed, research unlikely to be carried out if it is illogically scheduled.\n\nAs to it's safety, there is not a single fatality linked to Kratom ingestion by itself; the 15 cases mentioned were all associated with mixes of substances, something that can be inherently dangerous with all manner of supplements and foods.  For reference, more people die every year from grapefruit interactions every year than have died ever from Kratom.  The drug caffeine is also more dangerous than Kratom, with over 50 deaths attributed annually to energy drink overdose alone.   And by comparison, acetaminophen is orders of magnitude more dangerous, killing and injuring ten's of thousands a year.  \n\nIn short, please ignore the hyperbolic hysteria regarding Kratom, and allow it to be studied and used as a supplement like the many other herbal products currently available. Hype and strangeness are not sufficient grounds for scheduling and banning an herb with such potential to help in the fight against opioid addiction.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22160","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Woodman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It's been 4 years ago that I've started using Kratom, I take a small amount once a day to help me concentrate and stay focus at work and within my personal life.  One of the biggest benefits that I've had it help with would be my depression and anxiety.  I've always had a problem communicating with people due to locking up in conversation (anxiety) or lack of initiating relationships with friends/family (part of my depression).  It has done wonders to help alleviate it all together.  I've also been very successful with my job in insurance making more money and helping other families than I ever had in my whole life.  It has most definitely brought me closer to my friends and family, staying more active in their lives.  I couldn't imagine the horror it would bring to my life if this wonderful plant wasn't made available to us anymore.  I could not tell you one negative thing it has done to me.  I've stayed extremely healthy while working out more and eating better the past couple years, while taking Kratom.  I've heard from the news lately weak things about poison control claims and addiction problems.  Erroneous, is all I have to say!  The amount of calls for Kratom is a very small fraction to the amount of calls for much more common, OTC medications that have been called in on.  And as far as the addiction, it's not anymore addictive to me as would a daily B12 vitamin.  First off there's a ceiling on how much makes sense to even take.  You can't continuously increase doses every day because your tolerance goes up.  If you take anymore than a spoonful or two a day, you're just wasting it-you can't keep getting higher and higher...doesn't work that way with Kratom.  Your tolerance plateaus which is another great benefit over other methods of medication for depression, anxiety and pain.  More importantly, I've seen Kratom change many other people's lives around me for the far better!  I've seen pain pill addicts completely ignore or no longer mention taking pills any longer-Kratom leaves no desire for any other opiods or even alcohol, because it's a cure all.  There are many more ailments that this medication does take care of.  I would be extremely upset and hate to see this go away do to ignorance of it's abilities.  Please reconsider another ruling, maybe one that regulates instead of prohibits.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20276","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Blake Thompson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI want to let the DEA know my story involving Kratom.  I have had TMJ for 15 years and struggled for 10 of those years because I did not want to take OTC painkillers on a daily basis because my father died of liver cancer, and I know how bad anti-inflammatories,  NSAIDS, and analgesics are for the liver.  I also have a history of opioid drug abuse in my family and have seen the devastation it caused, so I also refused to go that route.  Besides acupuncture and dental guards while sleeping, I had little other way to relieve the pain.  When I began taking Kratom, it was the happiest moment of my life, besides giving birth to my children.  I finally had a natural way to relieve pain and could sleep through the night without waking up in pain.  Before taking this dried PLANT (nothing else added), I did plenty of research and found that this plant has pain fighting properties that other pain fighting drugs do, yet isn't addictive and does not create a high.  It's much safer than any other option on the market.  I take my health very seriously and I don't say that lightly.\n\nWhen I heard the DEA was thinking of making it a scheduled substance, I must admit I was furious!  I could see no other reason for taking this away except for pure greed on the government's and pharmaceutical industry's part.  I, and many other people, saw this as a way to remove competition or further control every aspect of our lives.  The DEA is not an unelected body and it is unconstitutional to impose laws that haven't been put through the normal voting procedure. What right does any agency to tell me what plants I can eat?   Big Government has a Big Image problem right now and pushing for a ban on Kratom, which is just a plant, nothing else, will look very bad and will serve to expose the DEA's overreach.  \n\nPlease consider that this is a no win issue for the DEA.  Also, please don't let Big Pharma Lobbyists persuade the agency to remove Americans' basic rights.  I understand that the Affordable Care Act has hurt the pharmaceutical  industry's profits, but taking away the Kratom option and our liberties is not the way to make the difference up.  There is a sales tax  on Kratom, so there is some revenue in it for the states at least.  A ban will just further the notion among the public that the government could care less about us and only cares about increasing it's own wealth and power.  I'm not trying to insult the agency, just trying to let you know that is the way it will be perceived.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19574","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mac Edwards","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA's recent desire to schedule kratom may come from legitimate concern, especially with a plant that acts on the opiate receptors of the brain.

I started having some anxiety again.  I had been on an anti-depressant for two periods, many years ago, and had some crazy side effects from them.  When it came up again this time, I started looking at prescription medicine.  I researched every drug I could find for anxiety, plus some for other things that are sometimes used for anxiety, and I found nothing that I feel good about taking.  Some of them have crazy severe side effects (like possible retinal detachment with one of them), and they all have at least some side effects I don't want to deal with.  I briefly tried taking one of them at a small dosage and had horrific nightmares.  I had this before on the anti-depressant and don't want to deal with that again.  I was forlorn to realize there was nothing I felt I could take.  But then I tried kratom, and I have been so pleased.  I have only used it a few times since I discovered it, as I don't feel the need to use it often, but every time it has been amazing for taking away my anxiety, without any side effects.  I did NOT feel altered in any way, except more calm.  I am so relieved!  I am so grateful.  I am an elementary school teacher and I try very hard to have a wonderful attitude around the children, and having relief from anxiety helps me be at my best.\n\nPlease do not take this away from the people.  There are so many prescription drugs that people take that are seriously dangerous, but yet they keep getting prescribed.  There's no way that this plant should be made illegal.

I began to fall apart physically.  I have dealt with spinal issues for a long time, have Epstein-Barr, Fibromyalgia, Migraine Disorder, and the list seems to get longer each time I see a specialist.

I hope the comments of thousands of people of people don't go unheard. This drug helps people. I can see first hand how this drug has changed my husbands life. I have taken it and had positive effects as well= I can focus better and overall have a better sense of well being. I do not take it regularly because I don't have any pain or addiction issues. However, my husband has struggled with alcoholism for years. He moved to Colorado so that he could have access to marijuana to help. It didn't. He suffers from depression and MJ was just not enough to combat it. Other medications such as anit-depressants caused him to have horrible side effects. So,  back to the drinking. We started fighting more. He lost his job so he could even keep going to therapy appointments. He has no insurance for medication now even if Anti-depressants did work. So, I started looking online. I found Kratom and he gave it a try. Since first day he tried it he stopped drinking LITERALLY OVER NIGHT!!! He woke up with alcohol withdraws but once that was over, he kept using Kratom and has not had a single drink since and it has been 4 months. If Kratom gets banned now, I don't know what we will do. This is the only thing that has helped him. Even his depression is better- we laugh every day! This has changed our lives and I can't imagine going back to the life we had before this. I can't see any negatives to taking this drug. \n\nThank you for your time,\nChelsea","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22173","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chelsea Nielson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14683","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Karen Laakaniemi MSN RN","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello all,\n\nI am going to keep my comment brief and to the point.

I am an Executive Chef from Sunbury, PA. I\"m 36, have a wife and 5 children. I have been using kratom for more than 2 years now, and am opposed to banning any of its chemicals or regulating it in any way. \n  Let me start by saying I am a recovering opiate addict. I've battled with heroin addiction, morphine, methadone and suboxone addictions, too. I've been through rehabilitation centers and outpatient care. It worked for awhile, then I would always turn back to the drugs. I was also diagnosed with anxiety disorder and prescribed Buspirone. \n  About 2 years ago, when I was struggling with a heroin relapse, a friend of mine introduced me to kratom. He mixed some of its ground leaves with some hot water, added some honey and made tea for me to try. I responded very well to it. I felt like,\"wow, this could really help me.\"\n  After researching and learning as much as I could about kratom, I decided to buy some for myself and use it as a daily supplement. I was then able to quit heroin, stop taking my anxiety medication, and get my life back on track, all from the help of kratom.\n  I have now been clean from heroin and all other drugs since Semptember 2014. This plant has truly changed my life. When I use kratom, I have no desire to use anything else, it satisfies me. Making it illegal would be devastating to me, I would probably go back to taking narcotic painkillers, which would have a huge negative impact on my life. Right now I'm able to hold down a job(currently 7 years with the same company), raise my kids and be a good husband, all from the amazing plant Mitragyna Speciosa.\n  Please do not ban the active ingredients in kratom, or regulate them. Leave it just the way it is , it has helped so many people like me. The testimonials are endless. This plant has many benefits, and scheduling it will stop any research into it. There are some stories out about calls to poison control from kratom, and even some deaths. But with all incidents, there was always other drugs involved. It doesn't even compare to all the accidents and deaths from alcohol, which remains legal in this country. \n  So please don't ban kratom, or regulate it. Also with the opiate epidemic going on in our country, there's alot to be gained from further researching this plant, which can and does save lives. It would be a huge mistake to take it away from the thousands of people, like me, who use it. \n  Thanks for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21590","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Bartholomew","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I found Ktatom in 2012. It changed my entire way of life. I live with multiple scleroais,  Spondilosis , degenerative disk disease, and scoliosis. Before 2012 I also found myself a slave to pharmaceutical pain medications that did not work. I was on SSI and literally did nothing everyday. My existence was miserable as the prescription pain meds did not work and only killed my motivation to be a productive memeber of society. I reached the point that I hated the pain pills. They ruined my life and what a life it wasn't. When I tried coming off of the pills I found I couldn't. I tried methadone and suboxone and failed. Then I found Ktatom. Kratom helped get me off of the highly addictive pain meds that were ruining my existence and I discovered at the same time Kratom managed my pain. I now use 2 teaspoons a day. One in the morning and one in the evening. I am off of SSI and back working full time contributing to society again. I am concerned for all the people who are like me if Kratom is made a schedule 1 drug we will be forced to return to our former existence. When I was on the pharmaceutical drugs I wanted to die. I no longer feel that way. So many lives will be destroyed by this action. Please don't make Kratom a drug. Kratom is not a drug. Its a God given tree, an herb, that has many used and can not be abused, even if you try. The millions of Americans need not suffer or pay for using Kratom responsibly because 15 People chose not to.

I feel like anyone who thinks it does belong in that category is ignorant of the facts.  I've take kratom for extended periods of time, and noticed no withdrawl symptoms when I quit.  If it is addictive, it's far less than coffee, cigarettes, and alcohol!  It's effects are not like any of those things.  It gives an energy boost that's less jittery than caffiene (which is addictive) and it does have slight mood boosting effects, but I wouldn't qualify it as a \"high\".  I can take it and still safely drive myself to work, mainly because I am more awake and alert!  Anyone considering banning this substance should be required to try it, just so they know and understand how ridiculous a ban would be.

I was born with a bone disorder called spondleodiphaseal dysplasia , it effects the way the bones grow, in the back, legs, neck, and arms. And it makes you very short it statue. It can be pretty painful. I've had 15 surgeries starting from the time I was 5, and my latest was this past February. I've had to take pain medication off and on my whole life, and I just don't really like how it makes me feel. That head fog, tired feeling, so I was looking on the Internet for something natural that's how I found kratom. I probably researched for about 7 months, and I talked to my physical therapists about it, and she thought that it would be worth a try, so I ordered some. And it really did help the pain, without that weird feeling that the narcotics would give me I've been using it for 8 years now. I can use it, and I feel like I can do a little more without the horrible pain. Like getting down and playing with my grand baby, being up making dinner, or going shopping, sometimes I can even walk around the store without an electronic chair!!! (That's big stuff to me :). Kratom really has changed my life for the better. If I'm having a good day, and I don't feel the need to take any,  I can do that without any kind of side effects! I'm begging for this wonderful plant not to be banned. I've heard that it can also help people through getting off hard drugs. That's wonderful! I feel that it would be wrong to take this away from people like me, to people who need help getting off off something that could kill them!

Kratom has been my answer to this. I am a normal contributing member of middle class America and I absolutely endorse the use of Kratom. I don't want to have to pay into pharmaceutical companies just to get relief from pain. I want to have the freedom to choose, and our freedoms are slowly, one by one being taken away. I don't understand why it's legal to drink alcohol which is CLEARLY detrimental to people (and kills a LOT of people), but things that are not hurting anyone (I think your reports show maybe 15 possible deaths, which I can't even understand!), like Kratom, become illegal.

I appeal to you to please do everything you can to fight this ban, on behalf of the people who obey the laws, even when they don't agree with them!\n\nIt should be noted that kratom is a plant and is natural and is NOT an opiate and because it's a natural pain remedy, it's so much weaker than anything pharmaceutical.

I am very worried about the DEAs decision to make Kratom a Schedule I substance. I was in the US Army infantry for many years and went on several combat tours. After those years of service, I was diagnosed with chronic PTSD and also severe and chronic pain. The VA put me on a cocktail of different drugs to combat the PTSD symptoms, and also put me on opiate painkillers to treat my chronic pain. Those drugs didnt really help me. They made it impossible for me to concentrate, which made it impossible for me to work. I had lots of trouble leaving the house, let alone finding and keeping a job. At that time, I was at the lowest point Ive ever been in my life. My anxiety and depression and chronic pain were making it impossible for me to live anything like a normal life. I couldn't leave the house, let alone hold a full-time job. My ability to think critically and concentrate -- two very important skills for a computer programmer -- were nonexistent during this time. And my medications werent helping very much, and came with their own set of problems. After some time, I heard about Kratom, a plant from Indonesia in the same family as the coffee tree. I decided that it was worth a shot and ordered some. My life began to turn around almost immediately. I took my first bit of Kratom and within a couple of hours, my pain subsided like it never had before. After the first couple of weeks of using Kratom, I noticed that my depression and anxiety were also beginning to fade away. I have now been using Kratom daily for about five years to help with my depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. I have started my own business. I provide for my family. I am pretty much a fully functioning and productive member of society, and its all thanks to Kratom. When I take Kratom, I pay my taxes. If the Kratom ban goes through, I really am afraid of what my life will be like. I dont want to see myself returning to opiate painkillers, but I will likely have no other choice, because of the pain. It may very well be that I am unable to hold my regular job, or keep my business going. In fact, that seems most likely, considering my past experience with the pharmaceuticals used to treat those conditions. Without Kratom available to me to help with the depression and anxiety of PTSD and with chronic pain, my life will be a living hell.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17733","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"C ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":7,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"SURVEY OF ER/TRAUMA HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS FINDS NO EVIDENCE OF EITHER KRATOM DEATHS OR EPIDEMIC OF ABUSE\nPosted by Angela Ross 122sc on November 29, 2016\nFindings of American Kratom Association Poll Submitted to DEA Before December 1 Comment Period Closes; Zero Support Found Among ER/Trauma Professionals for DEA Banning Natural Herb\n \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  November 29, 2016  If the DEA is correct in suggesting that there is a kratom epidemic going on in America, then it is somehow happening without our nation's front-line medical professionals knowing a thing about it. A random online survey of 115 emergency room (ER) and trauma health care professionals across the U.S. found zero reported cases of deaths related to kratom. The new poll also uncovered precisely 0 percent support among those surveyed for a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) ban on the coffee-like herb kratom.\n\nAvailable online at http://bit.ly/kratomdocpoll and conducted via SurveyMonkey, the American Kratom Association (AKA) poll was carried out between November 23-28.\n\nAKA is submitting the survey findings as a formal response to the request for kratom-related comments from the DEA, a process that closes at 11:59 p.m. \n\n\nAmerican Kratom Association Founder Susan Ash said: \"We conducted this survey after ER doctors and other medical professionals told us the notion there is some kind of kratom epidemic going on in America is a hoax.  In fact, our totally random online survey found no evidence of kratom-related deaths and zero support among America's front-line medical professionals for a ban on kratom.  We are not going to stand idly by and let the DEA or anyone else whip up a phony panic about a nonexistent epidemic to try and ban a legal product that's being consumed responsibly, with no major problems, by three-five million Americans.\"\n\nKey survey findings include the following:\n\n93 percent of those surveyed are aware of kratom.\n89 percent of those surveyed have a favorable impression of kratom, including 81 percent with a \"very favorable\" impression.\n87 percent said they would \"not classify [kratom] as a problem compared to heroin and prescription painkillers.\"  Another 5 percent said it was a \"somewhat smaller\" or \"much smaller\" problem.  0 percent said was a \"somewhat bigger\" or \"much bigger\" problem.\n90 percent say kratom is not a \"major issue or concern\" in their work experience.  More than nine out of 10 ER/EMT professionals say they have never dealt with any major case involving kratom.\n0 percent said \"a ban on the herb kratom is justified based on your professional experience.\" About 9 percent said they did not have enough experiences with kratom to form an opinion and another 2 percent said they did not know.\n0 percent reported deaths due to kratom and only 1 percent related any kind of health-related issues associated with the herb.  According to the poll, the vast majority of times (86 percent) that kratom arises in an ER or EMT situation is when someone asks for information about kratom or reports that they consume it.\nThe random online survey conducted via SurveyMonkey focused on panel of ER/trauma doctors, surgeons, nurses, related health care professionals, and EMTs/paramedics.  Invitations to participate in the survey were extended directly through LinkedIn groups (including EMS Leadership and Administration, Emergency Room RNs and Management, Emergency Medicine and EMS World) and Facebook groups (including Paramedics on Facebook, FRCS Trauma & Orthopedic Surgery, First Responders, Trauma, Critical Care, and Acute Care Surgery, and Emergency Medical Technician).

I also have panic attacks and generalized anxiety. I have spent about six years searching for some answers and relief. My doctors always chalked it all up to my anxiety and put me on medicine such as Prozac. After years of suffering with not a single day without pain, exhaustion, and anxiety, I was at my wits end. I began drinking heavily and eventually became addicted to heroin in a desperate attempt to stop the pain and feel relaxed for once in my life. I am now four years sober but after getting clean my pain and anxiety returned with a vengeance.  With no answers, the doctors finally labeled my problems as fibromyalgia. Not wanting to return to a life of addiction and dependence, I turned to the internet and did research for natural and herbal remedies. About a year and a half ago I discovered Kratom. After years of not being able to work because my pain was so chronic and my fatigue so crilppling, I finally found relief! Without being prescribed pills or medicines that could become harmful and make me addicted, I was instantly able to function again like a normal human being. Without Kratom my life would be a living hell again, trapped in my room in bed and unable to work or have dreams or aspirations. Now using Kratom, I remain drug and alchohol free, and feel amazing! If they make this wonderful miracle plant illegal, I am afraid of how dark dismal and worthless my life will become again. Kratom has given me my strength back, my energy, and my ability to live each day virtually pain free. It has truly been a blessing. I have my life back because of Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12578","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Wisniewski","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA,\n\nPlease reconsider all Schedule 1 drugs, such as marijuana and other plant based natural medicines such as this particular substance.

I also listened to a radio program about kratom and people who's lives have been healed by kratom. It's amazing to me that our government wants to make kratom a criminal substance. Too many people benefit from this plant and too many people suffer from the addiction of prescription drugs, it's obvious to me that the government is influenced by large scale medical companies for profit. Kratom is a plant found in nature and if that plant can heal me then it should be an option for me, rather than being forced by the government to take highly profitable prescription drugs. I'm sick of the DEA telling America that plants are bad, as prescribed medications kill  hundreds every day. Luckily we the people have the Internet to check facts ourselves rather than relying on the crooked  government. Social media will bring truth to the masses. DONT MAKE ANOTHER PLANT ILLEGAL.

Mitragyna speciosa (aka kratom) is a tree native to Southeast Asia whose leaves have been used in traditional medicine practices since the 19th century to treat chronic pain, withdrawal from opioids, diarrhea, cough, and other ailments. Although regulated clinical trials have not been conducted to show safety and efficacy of kratom, an overwhelming number of anecdotal reports indicate a strong potential for use in treating a number of conditions. \n\nCurrently, I work as a Clinical Trial Leader on FDA regulated clinical studies of cannabis and MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of anxiety-related disorders. Being placed on the schedule 1 list has impeded research into the therapeutic potential of MDMA and cannabis for many decades by creating extremely difficult circumstances to gain approval for studies (FDA/DEA/IRB), obtain the drugs for clinical trials, and acquire funding. The first Phase 2 clinical studies of MDMA in the USA commenced in 2004, 19 years after being placed as a schedule 1 substance even though psychiatrists and therapists reported its effectiveness in a therapeutic context based on approximately 500,000 doses administered in therapy sessions prior to 1985. Of great importance, recreational use of cannabis and MDMA has not declined as a merit of its schedule, only research efforts were halted. \n\nWe cannot continue to create situations where potentially life-saving drugs are banned before they can be adequately tested in controlled clinical settings. Federal funding is obsolete for Phase 2 investigations of schedule 1 substances and pharmaceutical companies generally hold no interest in conducting studies on non-patentable plant material. The burden of drug development should not be left to nonprofit research organization who have very limited resources to fund and run the expensive trials needed to bring a drug to market. I implore the FDA/DEA to consider the history of schedule 1 substances (MDMA, psilocybin, cannabis) currently being brought through the drug development pipeline and other potentially effective plant-derived substances (DMT, ayahuasca, and ibogaine) that are not because of the above noted points.   \n\nPlease allow researchers to evaluate the safety and efficacy of kratom before deciding on where it fits on the list. With an opioid epidemic in full swing in this country, we should be pursuing any avenue that could help people overcome this deadly addiction and testing alternatives, such as kratom, to prescription pain medications. \n\nSincerely, \n\nAllison Feduccia, Ph.D.\nClinical Trial Leader\nMAPS Public Benefit Corporation (www.maps.org)\nalli@mapsbcorp.com\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0528","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Allison Feduccia","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban Kratom or put it on the schedule.

I am a chronic pain sufferer of at least 6 years now due to damage to my spinal column via car accident. As someone who witnessed his only sibling pass away due to opioid toxicity in April 2011, I have never been interested in taking such narcotic substances to manage debilitating pain. For five years, I merely dealt with the ever-worsening spine pain to the point of it coercing me to quit working altogether. Although it was in some level of pain ceaselessly, I stuck it out as long as I could until I could not stand for more than an hour at a time without the pain evolving into something crippling. Worse is that once the pain had started, it was staying even if I had laid down. With the combination of unbearable pain and the lack of income due to not being able to work, my quality of life spiraled downward into the worst low of my entire life thus far; I was hopeless and losing faith in the possibility of an enjoyable life. Enter March 2015 when I discovered mitragyna speciosa, commonly known as 'kratom'. I tried it very doubtful that anything besides prescription pain killers would be effective and was met with what I can only describe as the most relieving moment I have ever experienced. \n\n     The kratom didn't lessen the pain - it removed it entirely. With that came tears of joy that I had finally found something that I surmised would let me lead a more normal, happy existence. The pain had stayed unnoticeable for quite some time, as well. Gone were the days of writhing in agony and looking for work that I could perhaps do at home without much movement or labor. Since that very day in March I have used kratom to keep my pain completely managed. I am able to work and exercise again at full speed, so to speak, and it's entirely because of the ever-so-small amount of kratom that I take when the pain gets out of control. Please do not revoke me or my Fellow Americans the right to suppress our real physical pain in a responsible way with something natural and so benign. It has transformed my life into a place better than where it was before kratom. I fear that something horrible will happen to many chronic pain sufferers if kratom indeed gets banned. Opioids are not for everyone, especially one who watched his own brother die in his mother's arms five years ago by using them. Please, keep kratom legal.

My friend, who wished to only be identified by his first name, Mike, suffered a multitude of injuries sustained from an IED blast in Panjwai (Kandahar Province). Mike's injuries took him out of the fight and left him depending on opiate based pain killers to help him deal with the immense pain he was in for several months afterwards. While the doctors said his injuries were improving, he was still dependant on pain killers and after his doctor \"cut him off\" after much public pressure on the medical community for prescribing narcotics, he began to see other doctors. By 2013, he was using heroin and vicodin or other pills bought on the street. I heard about Mike and intervened. I'd been taking Kratom since ~2011 as it had helped me live a better quality of life after some injuries (both seen and unseen) that I sustained in Kandahar. I was able to enlist the help of Mike's sister and his ex-fiance and we introduced him to Kratom. Mike still experienced an awful withdrawal from the heroin and pain killers and suffered for several days, but introducing the Kratom helped him by giving him energy and a sense of well-being. Fast forward to present day, Mike has been free of Heroin since 2014. He got back on the right track, got his life together, is married, has a decent job and a little boy. Kratom helped make this possible. There are literally thousands of stories out there very similar to this. I ask you on behalf of myself, Mike and all the other Veterans whose quality of life has improved since finding Kratom to leave it unscheduled. We are not criminals, we are people. We do not get high off of Kratom nor do we use it as medicine. For thousands of years humans have used naturally occurring plants to help improve their lives.

I am also in close relation to a few other kratom users as well.  In my experience, kratom is a mild opiate replacement.  I have experienced many different types and volumes.  I have had mostly positive experiences and a couple of negative ones.  My positive experiences include anxiolytic effects, and moderate pain relief.  I have had some negative side effects.  These include; 'the wobbles' <a slightly to highly disorienting feeling sometimes including nausea>, and a sever dampening of my amorous feelings even at my peak sexual time of cycle.  I went months without feeling the need for, or even wanting to go along with amorous pursuits.  The 'wobbles' are most definitely due to ingestion of higher volumes and are alleviated by reducing the amount used.  What is more important is lack of other negative side effects.  There is no constipation, no hot-face, there seems to be no reason to take more than a small amount as it seems to have an 'n' shaped dosage curve, there are almost no 'withdrawal' effects, and in my case, I have no residual need to re-dose.  I have read post from people claiming to need to 'recover' from long stints on kratom.  The only effects that I experienced upon suddenly stopping taking kratom was a runny nose and a bad attitude for about 3 days.  There was no fever, no diarrhea, no vomiting, no chills, no flu-like symptoms, no nagging need to re-dose.  I find these statement from 'addicted kratom users' laughable.  I would be willing to bet that upon closer inspection, the people who made these statements are attention-seeking, and prove to have an alarming lack of self control in the rest of their lives.  Much like the woman who is 'addicted to couch cushions' these people need an excuse to allow themselves not to self moderate.  I used kratom for months, and I would recommend it's use to ANYONE <of age, or a minor in pain with the supervision of a doctor>.   I believe that it should be available over the counter, but restricted to those above the age of 18-21....probably 21 as we are a nation of children.  I do not believe that the unwillingness of the few to control themselves should stop those of us that are responsible from partaking in a completely safe activity.  These people do not need rehab they need to be cutoff and given REAL consequences....not the attention they are seeking!  Just to be square...I have experienced REAL withdrawal from prescribed opiates after a moderate accident.  This is not conceptual for me. Kratom is better and safer than opiates.  Although, opiates have their place as 'heavy-hitters' and end of life pain relief.

I live in rural northern Virginia with my husband and two amazing special needs kids, and work from home as a transcriptionist. I'm also a hobby farmer and raise chickens, take care of rescued dogs, and love to hike the woods around my house. \n\nThanks to my love of being outdoors, in June of 2015 I was diagnosed with late disseminated Lyme disease. Although I was treated with antibiotics, unfortunately my symptoms have continued, and on an almost daily basis, I have severe fatigue, tingling and numbness in my limbs, and migrating joint pain. At times I've also experienced problems with my short-term memory and other neurological symptoms. \n\nOn the advice of my doctors, I did my best to treat these symptoms with a healthy diet, and exercise when possible. These measures didn't really help at all; although I'm sure they made me healthier in the long run, my Lyme symptoms continued the same as before. Finally, I met another Lyme sufferer who told me she had been using an herbal supplement called kratom. I decided to try it, and I've been taking it ever since. \n\nI am not a scientist, but I can speak with authority on my personal experience with kratom. I mix the crushed leaves with water to make a tea, and then drink it. Within half an hour, I can feel my joint pain dissipating. I feel a subtle increase in energy, similar to a cup of coffee, but without the \"jitters\". The effect lasts for several hours, and without any other effects. No \"high\" feeling, no mental fog. Just alleviation of pain. \n\nOn the subject of addiction, in my personal use I haven't seen any indications that I am addicted. On days when I don't have pain, I don't take kratom, and I don't feel anything that could be classified as \"withdrawal.\" I also haven't increased my dosage in almost a year of nearly daily use. I take the same amount now that I did then, with the same effects. Like so many other kratom users, I feel that scheduling it alongside such dangerous substances as heroin and MDMA would be simply ridiculous. The potential for harm, in my opinion, is incredibly low.\n\nAdding kratom to my health maintenance routine has had only positive effects. Please consider keeping kratom a dietary supplement that is freely available to all who could benefit from its use.

As a result of the injury and following surgery I experienced severe pain and was prescribed several types of medication.  I was concerned about developing dependence, but pain from a rotator cuff injury is hard to manage because it is intense, and is worse while laying down, which eventually interferes with sleep.  After a month or so, I began looking for natural pain remedies and learned about Kratom.  It was effective treating my shoulder pain, but I noticed several other benefits.  It relieved arthritic type pain and stiffness in joints.  It helped elevate my mood and energy level, similar to coffee but without jitters and stomach upset.  And most notably, it relieved symptoms of anxiety and depression.  Because of these other benefits, I continued using Kratom after my shoulder pain subsided.\n\nI have experienced anxiety and mild depression for about 25 years and tried several prescribed medications, including Alprozolam, Sertraline, and Bupropion.  With each medication I experienced significant and even debilitating side effects, so I stopped using them.  I also want to point out, my problems with anxiety and depression are not the result of an unhealthy lifestyle.  I eat a very healthy diet, have a rigorous exercise routine, and keep myself lean and fit.  Over the years, I have researched and tried many natural remedies such as Valerian Root, Saint John's Wort, Melatonin, and L-Trytophan.  Kratom is the only natural remedy that has provided consistently noticeable relief for my symptoms.  Losing access to Kratom would have a significant negative impact on my quality of life.      \n\nI have confirmed for myself that Kratom is not addictive.  I periodically stop taking it to ensure I am not developing a dependence.  The only withdrawal symptom that I have noticed is restless leg syndrome which subsides in a day or two.  While being treated for my shoulder injury I experienced the withdrawal symptoms from discontinuing use of opioid medication, and I can tell you first-hand, Kratom does not have the same effect.  \n\nI read the document \"DEA 3 Factor Analysis for mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine August 2016,\"\nand it is far more supposition and assumption, than objective analysis.  It seems like the DEA found out about Kratom, decided it was dangerous and put together a document to show how it could be dangerous.  \n1) It assumes increasing use = abuse, rather than simply greater awareness of it's benefits. \n2) It provides evidence that Kratom is more widespread, and that more people are calling various organizations to learn about it.  This evidence is considered cause for alarm, but only because of the flawed premise that Kratom is bad.  \n3) It provides many anecdotes and six pages of references, and refers to information as \"documented,\" but apparently did not investigate a single case among thousands of people, probably tens of thousands, who are using Kratom responsibly for a specific heath related purpose.  \n4) It concludes Kratom has no medical use because it dismisses any use as \"abuse,\" or an attempt to mimic the effects of a controlled substance.       \n\nI hope the FDA will study Kratom, and perhaps regulate it so that people like me can be sure we are getting pure Kratom leaves and nothing else.  This would be a benefit to the public.  Making Kratom a controlled substance would be disaster, creating an illegal market with products that are  tainted and dangerous, and making criminals of people who just want to continue getting a safe, effective herbal remedy.

I believe that it can be a helpful herb, and is far from a \"drug of abuse.\" My personal view is that the current effort to ban this substance is likely a result of unscrupulous marketing of the plant as some sort of \"legal high,\" which some vendors have done to try to increase sales. My recommendation is that you focus any regulatory efforts on this misleading and unethical marketing, rather than attempting to ban a substance that undoubtedly helps thousands of responsible citizens.\n\nNow I will provide a little background information. I was seriously injured in a car accident that occurred in 2006. Over the next two years I underwent four major surgeries, but was told I would likely be in serious pain and require prescription opioids for the rest of my life.  These drugs made me a zombie, and a shell of my former self. I eventually resolved to stop taking the prescription drugs, and manage my pain as best I could. At this point I was not aware of the kratom plant.  This left me in the difficult situation of trying to cope with chronic pain without prescription drugs, which led to depression, difficulty sleeping and other hardships.\n\nI began a period of serious introspection and effort toward self-improvement around the same time I discovered the kratom plant. As I improved my diet and began exercising and meditating regularly, I also incorporated the kratom plant into my regimen.  I found that it helped with the pain and depression I had been experiencing, without the severe drowsiness and mental impairment that presciption opioids caused.  I have been using the kratom plant for several years without noticeable negative side effects.  During this time I have stopped using it for several weeks on multiple occasions, and I have not experienced difficulty doing so.  As someone who has at times regularly used both prescription opioids and kratom, I recognize that kratom does not cause the severe impairment and physical dependency issues that prescription opioids are notorious for.  \n\nIn this time in which which our country is in the midst of a serious opioid and heroin epidemic, I believe it would be unwise to ban a plant that may help many people.  Please reconsider your decision to schedule kratom, and instead think about regulating any unscrupulous marketing of the plant. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14334","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing in regarding the DEA's modified public comment period regarding the proposed scheduling of the herbal supplement kratom.  I strongly believe that no emergency scheduling is needed because there is no imminent harm.   \n\nI am a psychiatrist who is board certified with the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and is currently certified with the American Board of Addiction Medicine.   I have worked for 14 years in private practice primarily in an inpatient hospital setting.  I work on a daily basis with clients who have co-morbid substance use disorders.  To date, I have not seen any admissions into psychiatric services, under my care, due to kratom misuse or complications, and I have yet to encounter a physician who has seen clients present for treatment due to kratom related problems.  \n\n \nI was surprised when the DEA announced it's intent to schedule the kratom and it's active component Mitragyna in late August 2016 citing avoiding an imminent hazard to public safety as their motive.  The DEA cited 660 calls to US poison control centers between 2010 to 2015 and 15 deaths between 2014 to 2016; in which Kratom was one of the substances consumed as justification for declaring this urgent action.\n\nI was alarmed that the DEA would make such claims based off of such a small number of cases.  In comparison, when reviewing the 2011 Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) report data approximately 2.5 million emergency department (ED) visits were due to drug misuse or abuse.  Of these visits, the ED visits resulting from heroin and pain medications were as follows: (1)\n\nHeroin\t\t\t \t\t       258,482\nPain relievers\t(total)\t\t573,497\nAcetaminophen products\t \t  39,783\nAspirin products\t \t\t          11,074\nNon-steroidal anti inflammatories \t  33,034\nOpiates/Opioid's \t\t\t       488,004 \n\tBuprenorphine products\t 21,483\n\tCodeine products\t\t    9,927\n\tTramadol products\t\t  20,000\t\t    \n\nIn addition the National Institute of Drug Abuse cited the following date concerning drug and medication deaths in 2014: (2)\n\nHeroin\t \t\t\t\t10,574\nCocaine\t\t\t\t          5,414\nOpioid Pain Relievers\t\t18,893\nBenzodiazepines\t\t\t  7,945\n\nThe above data highlights the scarcity of documented adverse events attributed to kratom.\nI spent some time reviewing the 2014 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers (3).   The number of calls related to kratom over a 5 year period were not particularly alarming compared to the frequency of calls for numerous commonly found household items.\n\n\nSince the DEA's announcement at the end of August, I have had the opportunity to communicate with hundreds of individuals who have used kratom as a dietary supplement.  In general, the individuals I have talked to have reported positive benefits from their use.  If there is a change in quality of life, people have generally reported a positive benefit.  A number of people have reported a reduction of need for opioid pain medications.\n\nOverall, kratom appears to be a plant with relatively low risk.  It appears that some people have use kratom as a harm reduction measure, resulting in a reduced use of potentially riskier medications.  I would assert that the DEA's stated intention to schedule kratom is misguided, unnecessary and may lead to unintentional harm to individuals who have found kratom to be helpful for functioning.  Further studies and research would be beneficial to further clarify potential benefits and risks.\n\nIn summary:\n1. Kratom should not be scheduled unless at some time clear evidence that Kratom use presents a public health risk emerges.  This has not yet happened.\n2. Access to kratom, should not be restricted/limited unless there is clear evidence of public harm necessitating this.\n3. Restricting access to kratom may cause immediate harm to individuals who are using this in lieu of prescribed opioids or other substances with a higher risk profile.  Restricting access could result in increased risk of death and disability for a significant number of people currently deriving benefit from kratom.\n4. Scheduling of kratom would create further wide spread harm if such scheduling leads to arrests and imprisonment of otherwise normally functioning individuals.\n\nThank you for taking my views into consideration.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nRusti T.

I have a 56% disability for a work related lower back and foot injury. I was using Hydrocodone a narcotic to help with the chronic pain for 5 years. I am also a recovering alcoholic with 20 years of sobriety and I feared the long term addiction of any narcotic drugs. With the chronic pain and depression, I lost all interest in everyday life and social events. I was so depressed that my body weight shot up to 400 lbs.I could barely walk or do anything that required any physical excursion. \n\nBecause of that fear I talked to Holistic Medical Professionals and they recommended Kratom Powder. I have been using this herbal  remedy for 2  years and I have not needed any narcotics and my life is enjoyable once again. I have lost 130 lbs and started a walking and exercise program. In 2 years I have walked over 5000 miles and climbed 2 of the highest mountains in NY.\n\n  I work in a Law Enforcement related field. I have seen the scourge of Bath Salts, Designer Drugs, Crack Cocaine, Heroin, Marijuana  and Alcohol. I fully support the laws and regulations governing them.

I discovered kratom roughly five years ago at the recommendation of a friend.  I've been using it regularly since then and it has given me a new lease on life.  Although it tastes awful, it helps give me energy and focus throughout my day and takes away all of my usual aches and pains that prevented me from living an active, full lifestyle.  I used to get terrible malaise and anxiety-- I would hole myself up at home and feel like I wanted to pass out whenever I was in public, but since I started taking kratom, I've felt much more at ease. I'm able to get out of bed every day and go live life.  I can't say enough how much this simple, safe plant has improved my way of life.\n\nWhile I've been using kratom, I've recommended it to several of my friends and family members, and they have all started using it, too-- some of them have even given up using opioids for their pain since they no longer feel like they need to take them.  Others have even been able to stop abusing pills/heroin or living stuck on suboxone.  It's truly miraculous. My city is completely overrun by this heroin epidemic...I've had many friends die as a direct result of opiate overdose...to see, not just one or two, but several friends/acquaintances stop taking these harmful drugs and be able to get their lives together is one of the happiest things I have ever witnessed.  This plant is miraculous.  I've seen studies that suggest it's nearly impossible for people to abuse kratom, and even if they manage to take such a large quantity, they won't die like they would on heroin.  This plant absolutely needs to be researched! Our country has been completely swallowed by opiates/opioids, and right here we have a possible solution that isn't jsut as harmful and addictive as the medicines we currently use!  Not one person I know that has been put onto a methadone/suboxone treatment has managed to get clean successfully. They spend thousands of dollars (or taxpayer dollars) taking these drugs (which, quite frankly, are even worse than heroin itself in some ways) for years before finally going back out and getting high again.  Each and every one of them falls off the bandwagon-- they can't afford to continue treatment, they aren't tapered off correctly by shady doctors....but with kratom, that just doesn't happen.  It's incredibly cheap. It's very effective. It doesn't get them high.  They don't get cravings and they don't go back out into the streets looking to score.\n\nI'm sorry that I can't provide anything more than anecdotal evidence for my claims.  However, seeing the people around me that I love being able to be freed from their awful addictions is all the evidence I'll ever need to believe that kratom needs to be researched thoroughly and made widely available.  The DEA wants to place it under Schedule I, making research extremely difficult.  Even if it is only for a few years, how many more people will die in the streets that could have been saved for $50? The DEA should be protecting people from things like heroin and promoting kratom as a way to get back on your feet and get your life together.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16603","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Myers","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep KRATOM LEGAL for all the people of this great country.

Like many others, Kratom has saved my life!  Having access to this magnificent plant to alleviate pain gives me the ability to function normally.  I am able to lead a happy, productive and effective life on a daily basis.  Doctors cannot find the reason for the pain I experience and suggest NSAIDS.  After 7 years of taking NSAIDS, my body cannot tolerate the side effects any longer.  Kratom produces no harmful side effects. Within minutes after taking it, the pain begins to subside and I can get on with my days responsibilities.  Unless one personally experiences that kind of pain, it is difficult to understand how depressing it is to not be able to function to do simple things in life that most people take for granted.  For example, activities like going to the grocery store, going to your granddaughters recital, meeting friends for dinner, are severely limited for a person who is in pain constantly.   This herb has helped hundreds of thousands of people like myself who otherwise could not function in their daily activities.  This country has a big enough opiate and heroin use epidemic without adding more to those numbers.  This beneficial herb relieves pain, helps us to be responsible tax paying citizens, and allows us to contribute something back to our families and communities.   \n\nIn the words of Dr. Christopher McCurdy, head researcher at the University of Mississippi (where Kratom has most recently been studied in the U.S.): Based on the information available in the scientific literature, we know that Kratom has been utilized for centuries by people in Thailand, without stigma associated with its use. In traditional medicine, Kratom has been used as an antidiarrheal and as a treatment for opioid dependence. Although there are suggestions that Kratom has a risk of addiction, there is no solid scientific evidence available to support or refute this idea. \n\nKratom is safely improving the health and well-being of responsible adults all across the United States. I support further scientific study of this plant and regulations like age restrictions. But, I strongly oppose legislation or action by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to make it a schedule 1 controlled substance.  This would cause hundreds of thousands of responsible Kratom consumers to become criminals overnight. Scheduling this plant will also cut off promising ongoing research into its many benefits.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17145","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was involved in two traffic accidents in a period of three years, and have been living with limited mobility since the first accident, and even moreso unfortunately since the second. After being legally prescribed a muscle relaxer, which didn't work, to chiropractic therapy, which didn't work, to steroid shots, which definitely did not even help, I honestly gave up hope. Then, on Thanksgiving of all days, I discovered the completely scientfically harmless, completely natural and worshipped for centuries plant, currently known by Kratom. Within about a half of an hour, the muscles in my neck and back not only relaxed, they deswelled to normal levels. Not only this, my social anxiety, which has existed my entire life, instantaneously disappeared. I was able to climb flights of stairs, bend over to pick up things, and live my life painlessly for about a day.\n\nTwo days later, and after having only one treatment, I am now having to take a muscle relaxer pill, and the worst thing about it is that it will probably help about one tenth, and harm my body ten times worse, and make someone out there richer off of it. \n\nI'm sick of that. It's time we face the absolute truth about EVERYTHING as a nation. EVERYTHING. Especially this. This will save lives. If we want to be the country we tell others we are, we will look at things like mature adults, instead of gossipy preteens, and face the truth on matters such as this.\n\nThe truth is, Kratom saves lives, and is completely natural.

I am 30 years old professional in the health industry.  I strongly strongly appose the action the DEA has made regarding making the dietary supplement/tea a scheduled 1 drug.  When I heard this I was blown away and almost in tears.  I am a professional that works around medications all day every day.  I personally don't like taking medications but suffer from generalized anxiety that can sometimes be debilitating.  I have had anxiety so bad it causes my body to have nausea with severe vomiting,  heart palpitations, and unable to think straight or focus. I have gotten professional help and have been prescribed medications for this such as xanax.  These anti-anxiety medications put me into a drowsy state, numbs my emotions depressing me and makes my memory extremely bad. I have been told I say certain things after taking xanax that I have no recollection of saying and this is terrifying for me.  So I quit taking the prescribed anti-anxiety medications because of this, and just suffered and dealt with my anxiety, which was an everyday battle.  I started using kratom about 1.5 years ago after a friend told me about it, and it could be a very effective natural remedy for anxiety.  I tried it out, and it has changed my life!  The anti-anxiety effects are amazing, with out putting me into a drugged out, drowsy, forgetful, numb state. It helps with anxiety, and actually helps with my energy as well.  I don't forget things and it helps me focus.  I also like going the more natural route. I have never had a bad experience with kratom,  and my life  in every aspect has just improved more and more since starting taking it.  It is my miracle herbal supplement! It has made my anxiety manageable and significantly has increased my  everyday quality of life.  I am much happier, stable and more productive.  If it becomes a scheduled one drug, I am going to be at a loss and not know what to do.  Please don't continue forward with making it a scheduled 1 drug. Many, many lives will suffer, and believe me , the country will not be a better place.  It will in fact be the opposite.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2408","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"stefanie schiener","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello.

I am 47 years old. I am a professional Welder. i oppose the DEA proposal to ban Kratom. It is not something to be likened with the list of harmful and fatal drugs on the list of schedule 1 narcotics. It is a harmless tea leaf from a tree in the coffee family .  I started using Kratom 4 years ago, when i was 9 years clean and sober. I found it looking for a natural way to relieve anxiety and depression from an herbal, tea,  and metaphysical bookstore in my city. Their herbs and teas are from all over the world.  This ABSOLUTELY should not be compared to some pathetic head shop or smoke shop!!  I go there for my tea as well as my spiritual pursuits.\n    As said, I was 9 years sober at the time , so i could not be using something that will engulf me in addiction and therefore propel me into the obsession of more and more, i can not be on any narcotics. I was, and am, well established in a program of spiritual development that keeps me sober and alive. I WILL NOT HAVE ANYTHING COME BETWEEN ME AND THAT.  I am not saying Kratom is a substitute for anything I was addicted to, I substituted that with spirituality. Kratom is a supplement to my life that i needed to get from antidepressants and anti anxiety meds. They gave me very harsh side effects and I grew psychical and mentally dependent upon them.\n     I think it should remain available to responsible adults. I have it as regular as i do my coffee. It has not triggered any addictive behaviors and has not lead to an obsession for more. It has no side effects. If by chance you take too much it is uncomfortable and you don't let it happen again. It IS NOT fatal or harmful in any way. I know this from my years of exposure to it.  Kratom has been a beautiful thing for me because of the natural energy focus and relief i get from it.

Once the pain would finally diminish, it would happen again.\n\nI have had 3 surgeries on the shoulder -- 2 which had failed to prevent the dislocations.

I have chronic back pain and have had surgery in 2006. Since which time my back pain due to arthritic conditions post surgery has affected my life negatively on so many levels. I have been on pharmaceutical narcotic pain medication for quite some years now, and although it helps deal with the pain, it presents many, many side effects. A few years back I took a vacation to my wife's home country of Thailand. While visiting her home Village,  one of its residents introduced me to Kratom. This was my first experience with these particular leaves of this plant. Within 2 days my back pain almost vanished to the point where I did not need to take my narcotic medication, except to help taper off the withdrawal symptoms from such. This plant has many medicinal purposes from what I understand, but for me personally, just because of the way it greatly reduced my pain, and my need for these dangerous narcotics. Was enough for me. Please do not ban this plant. People should have a right to grow and consume a plant which enables them to carry on with their daily lives without the need for prescription, dangerous, pharmaceutical narcotic medicine. I am completely convinced that the DEA should hold off, at least for now, and hopefully in the future do not decide to make this illegal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0758","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin Fitzgerald","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please dont allow them to make kratom a scedule 1 .\nI know many people including  myself  that benefit from this plant \nPlease keep kratom legal","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8056","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Snider","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I got in a car accident and my Dr prescribed me oxycodone for relief.

I'm greatly opposed to the DEA scheduling kratom because I have found it to be nothing more than a mild medicinal plant that has greatly reduced my chronic back pain and social anxiety better than any medications I have tried in the past.  I first tried kratom a few years back when I was having a lot of trouble with my back pain and anxiety, and heard about its properties to treat these symptoms I ordered some online and tried a small amount.  I was very surprised with how well it worked on both my ailments, without introducing severe side effects or inebriation.  Because of this, I think it would be harmful to myself and others who use kratom to schedule it and effectively turn us into criminals.  I'd like to back up my experiences with a link to this study on the pharmacological effects of kratom:\n\nentheology.com/wp-content/uploads/kratom-research/1988_std005.pdf\n\nI'd like to thank you for reading my comment, as well as the comments of many others like me.  Kratom has benefited my quality of life so that I'm able to enjoy it without constant anxiety or agonizing pain.  Hopefully people such as myself can continue to legally benefit from kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2320","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Spencer Smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a decent, responsible, 33 year old, contributing member of society with a masters degree, a good job in healthcare, a mortgage, and two young children. I am also a recovering alcoholic and someone who suffers with bouts of debilitating depression and anxiety. Since I discovered Kratom three years ago my quality of life and overall level of functioning has significantly improved. Believe me, I have tried the gamut of psychopharmacological options over the years with no relief. In fact, I found the side effects, withdrawal symptoms, and addiction potential to be much greater among benzodiazepines and antidepressants as compared to Kratom. Unlike sedating drugs like alcohol or Xanax, Kratom (even in large doses) has not caused me to have memory problems, respiratory depression, impaired motor skills, or impaired decision making. I can take it when I need it and stop when I don't. Stopping completely after prolonged use has resulted in minor withdrawl symptoms on par with quitting caffeine, while taking too much at once has resulted in only temporary stomach upset.\n\nKratom has helped to virtually eliminate my urges to drink alcohol. I am no longer crippled by social anxiety and I actually look forward to the day ahead of me when I wake up in the morning. All this is a result of my hard work in improving my lifestyle choices and the wonders of this herbal supplement. Contrary to many of the false claims made in the media, there is no intoxicating euphoria associated with Kratom; only a relatively mild lift in my mood and a boost in my overall sense of well-being.\n\nShould I chose to continue to consume Kratom following this hastily proposed ban, the police will be forced to convict me as they would a heroin addict. There are literally thousands of other hard working, contributing members of society like me out there that stand to potentially lose everything by being branded as illicit, drug-abusing, criminals. A ban on Kratom would surely result in a sad continuation of a long list of failed drug policies in the US, much like we have seen with marijuana prohibition and the over-prescription of opiates within the medical community. I urge you to look deep into your conscience, withdraw this proposed ban, and allow this plant to be utilized as the miraculous herbal supplement that it is. Take a step back and truly appreciate the magnitude and impact this decision will have on the lives of people like myself. Don't allow them to turn me into a criminal overnight. Thanks for your time and attention in this matter.\n\nSincerely, \n\nKevin E.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9075","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin E","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has saved me from long time opiate use.

I am a teacher with my Masters in Education.  I am kratom.  The happiness in my life is made possible by kratom.  I suffer from and been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and fibromyalgia.  Kratom helps me live a normal life. \n      I have taken kratom every day for 4 years.  Before I discovered kratom I was so crippled by the pain of my fibromyalgia that I could do nothing without pain and my husband would say I would cry out in pain while sleeping every time I would try to turn over.  I suffered with this pain for 10 years and since taking kratom regularly I now have zero pain from kratom.  I have lost 50 pounds because I was suddenly free of pain and was able to start exercising.  I took up running and have since completed my first half marathon.  I couldn't even walk without limping before.  If kratom is banned, I will revert to the pained existence I had before which was a life focused on pain.  My life now is focused on my family, my students and a healthy lifestyle.  \n     The other amazing thing that kratom has helped with is my severe depression and anxiety.  I have suffered my whole life from this and have been taking Prozac for this for 17 years, which helped to a degree, but not enough.  I was still suffering and my anxiety would have me in the fetal position in bed, crying and with a crippling knot in my stomach. Irrational anxiety is a horrible way to live, but kratom helps reduce this dramatically.  Since taking kratom I have been the happiest I have ever been in my life.  I finally know what \"normal\" people feel like.  Kratom does not affect your decision making abilities or impair your function in anyway.  The best way I can describe it is to say that it just gives you a general sense of well being which is the ultimate gift you can give someone with severe depression and anxiety.  \n     I have been taking kratom for 4 years with no side effects.  The amount I take has not increased.  I take the same now that I did when I started, its effectiveness has not decreased, nor do I feel the desire to take more.  There is no benefit from taking more than your optimal dosage.  \n     I have stopped taking kratom several times when going out of the country on vacations, as I didn't want to travel with kratom (not knowing the legality in other countries).  The \"withdrawal\" is comparable to how you feel when you start to feel a little rundown or feel a cold coming on.  A little achy and under the weather, but very minimal and it only lasted 1-2 days.  In fact the pain once I was completely off it was 100 times worse than any so called withdrawal effects as my fibromyalgia pain and depression/anxiety came back in full force.  In fact, when I got pregnant with my first child I stopped drinking soda, coffee, or anything with caffeine, but just stopped cold turkey and I had the worst migraine of my life for 2 days.  So caffeine withdrawal, in my experience, is much, much worse.  \n     If kratom is banned, my life will alter forever.  I will be thrown back into pain and depression/anxiety again.  I will feel anger and resentment that I am being made to suffer needlessly, when their is a safe, natural and effective supplement I can take.  I challenge anyone from the DEA or the FDA to try a teaspoon of kratom while it is still legal.  You will laugh at the absurdity of this plant being placed in the same category as heroin.  I promise you will laugh.  If this plant is banned it will ruin many lives and those responsible for banning it will be on the wrong side of history.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4819","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have worked with Kratom as a scientist for 4 years.

On the date of 13 Oct 2007 while on patrol in Kirkuk, Iraq my vehicle was struck by an IED. Then I was hit again on 7 Dec of that year. Due to this I have severe back pain and chronic headaches. I've been prescribed numerous medications yet they all seem to have terrible side effects. I began taking Kratom to relieve the pain associated with these conditions and it worked miracles. The opiate grade, highly addictive pain killers were the alternative. This is not an option for me. I have found a medication that helps more than any pharmaceutical grade drug has. If, for some reason that I am not understanding, the government decided to make Kratom a schedule one with other drugs such as heroine, which is absurd because they are not comparable, then they would we prescribing so many to a life of pain and addiction. I fear for the day when the government forces people such as myself off of the medication they found to be so helpful. This will not help the opiate crisis in America, it will increase the problem.

And deciding that a particular plant helps with your physical or mental condition is a decision that I should make.\n\nRespectfully,\nSgt Kitchen, Joseph\nUS Army Infantry.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19239","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Kitchen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be illegal!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11315","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jacki Webb","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Nichole and I am a mother of 7.

It helps stabilize my depression without forming habits and dependency, or being needed everyday. I can live as a manageable version of myself rather than perpetually under the influence of other psychoactive drugs and as a living breathing sentient human being you have no idea what that means to me. The people of the United States have had many of our natural psychoactive tools stolen from us to be replaced with synthesized version and this is one of the most valuable remaining legal natural psychoactive medicines. Kratom keeps the kids off of dope, hell it even gets the kids off dope, please please please do not steal this from us. We need to have freedoms we need to be able to live according to our needs, trust me i am the people. I have many piers and friends who benefit as i do from kratom and it just breaks my heart to think that this may be stolen from us. What people fall to are crutches like cigarettes, alcohol, processed and fast food, or even worse things like oxycontin and heroin. If you want to help the people do not strip us of our few remaining healthy tools. And if you want less crime and bullshit STOP BANNING DRUGS. NONE OF US STOP DOING THEM THEY JUST GETT MORE EXPENSIVE, MORE DANGEROUS, MORE SHAMEFUL. THE PROBLEM IS THE PAIN NOT THE SUBSTANCE. WE ARE HURTING AND THE RESPONSE IS A BLOCK OF CAGES. STOP IT. PLEASE EXTEND A HAND OF PEACE AND LOVE, WE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS. YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE ME, I WOULD NEVER TELL YOU WHAT TO DO TO STAY HEALTHY BECAUSE ITS NONE OF MY FUCKING BUSINESS.  I'm sorry but honestly, truly, how could the man have the audacity to claim it knows what is right and what is wrong, for all in all circumstance? Its a cripplingly arrogant perception and has created a world of imbalance and pain for its inhabitance. Trust me, the day i know how to, i'll leave this country and this western societal system but until then please stop killing me. And in conclusion- you read this and it is hopefully one of many things you read today on the subject, but i am not an email. I am a living person. Im 20 years old, this decision is likely going to impact the rest of my life. If Kratom is banned that means every single time i continue to use it i am risking my freedom. All the sudden i go from a regular dude having a glass of kratom, as you might a coffee or maybe a glass of wine in the evening, to a criminal. All the sudden I'm part of the illegal drug trade. All the sudden what had been a harmless part of my routine is now means to put me in a cage. How would that make you feel? And how angry would you be if someone you'd never met in your life just decided you could never drink coffee again, because some one told them it was bad, and if you want to continue drinking coffee you are now a criminal, and enemy of the state. I hope that this gives you some perspective, and i truly hope you have the peoples best intentions in mind, because the question is not what is best for the people, that is obvious, the question is will you take action for freedom, even amidst whatever personal gains may come from trying to destroy it.

I'd like to offer my experience with it.  A brief snyopsis of me:  I'm a 44 year old white female who is a licensed nurse. I've had debilitating chronic pain for almost a decade. I take prescribed hydrocodone for it. Two years ago, I spontaneously started with chronic nausea & vomiting. They have not been able to discover a cause or a cure. I went from 236 lbs down to 116.  I asked my three doctors to trial me on Marinol to see if it would control my symptoms. Each refused, saying the other one would have to do it. In an attempt to save my life, I sought & was granted a legal prescription for Marinol from a local doctor who does certifications for medical marijuana.  I cannot smoke and the edibles did not help but the Marinol worked perfectly. Upon discovering my prescription for Marinol, my primary doctor said I broke my pain contract and would no longer prescribe my pain meds. At the time, I had not taken a single pill as I was going to discuss it with him first.  I offered to submit to a drug test and pill count and was still denied.  Desperate for LEGAL pain relief (as I cannot take NSAIDS due to gastric bypass surgery), I researched Kratom and decided to try it.  Without a doubt, it has made my life much more comfortable. And it even helps with my nausea so I no longer need the Marinol!  The Kratom does NOT give me the fuzzy headed effects of the opiates. It does not affect me negatively in any way. It is NOT a gateway drug. It is very difficult to explain.  I feel \"normal.\"  I prefer it over the opiates.  It is my hope that you do not change this to a schedule one drug.  Every single person who has tried Kratom in my support group raves about a.what a life-saver this plant is!  And there are many of them that use heroin, cocaine, suboxone and methadone including other hard illegal substances. This plant is preventing over-doses. The worst that will happen if you take too much is that you will vomit.  I have been on both sides of this coin now and Kratom is the way to go.

Currently, I'm suffering from multiple lumbar disk herniations so I will most likely be having surgery to repair that. My back injury is the result of a car accident in October of 2015 so I have been dealing with this pain for over a year. When I asked my doctor to give me pain medication, he not only refused but acted as if I was asking him to do something illegal. As a result, I looked elsewhere to get my pain meds. This was a poor decision for many reasons- First of all, it is highly illegal and I like to consider myself a law abiding citizen. Second- I am unable to work because of my injury so money is very limited. Third- the propensity for addiction in my family is very high and I am well aware of the addictive nature of opiates. Fortunately, I discovered Kratom. I have been using Kratom for a few weeks and am happy to say it has greatly increased my quality of life. Kratom helps me manage my pain and allow me to enjoy doing things I have not been able to do in over a year. This plant is literally a god send. Please, do not take away my, and many others, best option for pain management. This is a plant that, while bee it anecdotally, can be studied and potentially help people in a real way. This country has a massive problem with opiate addiction. Why would you not seek alternatives in an effort to reduce the drug epidemic and still allow people to manage their pain? This is an opportunity for the DEA to do something that can help thousands of people. Do not put this plant with the potential to save lives on schedule 1. Please, do not take away our chance to manage pain and not become a drug addict.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12608","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chacon Chacon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Re: Docket No. DEA-442W\nMy son's life has been ruined by his addiction to Kratom. Three years ago he began taking it for knee pain and generalized anxiety disorder. Within a few months he was hooked; within a year he was taking increasing amounts in order to maintain the same level of relief. He tried unsuccessfully to quit but by year 3 he was so addicted that he was living out of his car, in debt, spending every penny of his paycheck on Kratom -- and ingesting over 120 pills a day. This year, when he no longer had money, he stole Kratom, was arrested, became suicidal, spent nearly 2 weeks in a mental hospital, and is now in a residential rehab facility trying to overcome his addiction. He is in the horrible situation of being as addicted as a heroin addict to a substance that's as accessible as alcohol and touted as \"healthy.\"  Excuse my language, but this is a fucking mess. PLEASE remove this extremely dangerous drug from circulation. The fact that you can't overdose on it and therefore it won't kill you should NOT be our only criteria. Any support for Kratom comes from levels of ignorance that are insupportable by those of us who have witnessed the destruction it wreaks first hand.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. \nMeanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

I have had two back surgeries and also live with chronic back pain. My pain makes it difficult for me to do all of the things that I need to do for normal functioning, like work full time and fully care for myself. For the prior 2 years, I had managed my pain with Vicodin, but it makes me feel foggy and I wanted to stop using it. With kratom, I can use a small bit, enough to control my back pain and allow me to function normally, without feeling foggy or 'high'.\n\nKratom should not be scheduled unless extensive research into its medical benefits has been conducted and it is shown to have no value. Scheduling it prior to such research will prevent that research from being done. Kratom has helped me be a productive member of society. Its medical benefits and risks should be researched so that we can use it most effectively and with minimal risk.

I have a chronic pain condition, Fibromyalgia, since age 5.  The only thing doctors had for me was opioid pain killers which I started taking at age 9: codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine.  I would alternate among them.  They sapped me of my creativity, my vitality, and my ability to function, and they did not always control the pain.  At all.  \n\nI found kratom.

Banning Kratom will decrease my quality of life significantly, and it will ruin countless others.  Not only is banning Kratom a terrible idea, but doing it in the middle of a heroin epidemic will catastrophically increase the death toll.  There are so many people who use this to get off opioids and other addictive drugs.  Kratom can give addicted people their lives back, largely without withdrawals.

As well as myself. I can tell you many of us have used Kratom regularly for years with minimal side effects. Several universities are studying the effects of Kratom on opioid withdrawals. These people are not criminals, at least not yet. Please don't place a ban on this plant orbits active alkaloids.  This plant saves lives, let me tell you my story, and try for a moment to imagine yourself in my shoes, I am a father, a brother, a son, and a good man. I broke my neck, and my back in an accident as a young child, and for 10 years I spent my life dependent on opiates, those 10 years were a sad, sad story, I was prescribed them by my family doctor for the chronic pain, and severe nerve damage caused by my injury as a young man. This injury caused an incredible amount of pain, and spontaneous uncontrollable debilitating muscle spasms throughout my body. Before long I was a full blown addict, and an alcoholic.. It wasn't until I found Kratom through a friend about a year ago, that my nightmare ended. I am not going to say that I use krarom to treat my condition, but what I will say, is that it allowed me tobwalk away from am addiction that I am sure would have killed me by now. Kratom saved my life, and the lives of many of the people I care about. I have had absolutely no side effects from taking this herbal supplement. And the benefits of taking it have been many for my particular case. And now I would like to talk about the evidence you have presented as to why a ban on the plant known as Kratom is necessary. Firstly on the reports of deaths involving Kratom, it would be biased and unethical to assume as your agency has done that simply because Kratom is in someone's system when they died, that the kratom is responsible for that death. That would be like saying the cookie he ate before a man died is to blame for his heart attack. Secondly on the matter of it being addictive, I say that it is no more addictive m, and no more dangerous than coffee, which comes from the same family of plants. Coffee also affects the opioid receptors in the brain just like Kratom does. Would you ban coffee? The caffeine in coffee kills hundreds of individuals a year in this country, does that not make it a more valid threat than Kratom? I understand it is your sworn oath to protect the public at large, and that affords you privileges, and responsibilities to try to aim to help the most people. This plant isn't hurting anyone, please just try it yourself, it is just simply not dangerous to public health any more than a chocolate bar is, or a cup of espresso. And the benefits far outweigh the damage. People are able to put heroin down just by drinking the tea made from this plant. It literally is saving lives right now, and you are trying to ban it. Think about that for a moment. Would you want to be the person to tell that family that their son died by a heroin overdose, when there is a tea leaf out there that could help that young man put away the pills, without the risk of an overdose or a relapse? Please consider the facts from both sides. Your original letter of intent stated a number of deaths associated with Kratom, I ask you to look up the data from the poison control database, look up how many people were poisoned by laundry pods, or Tylenol, or caffeine... You will see that there is a disproportionate amount of cases between these legal substance, and this plant that you would have banned. It may not be perfect, but it helps people. Real people, good honest hard working Americans, I have never seen it hurt anyone whatsoever, in my research I was unable to find any conclusive evidence to support the claim of an immediate threat to public health, yet hundreds of thousands of Americans die every year to heroine, and this plant is being researched for the ability to help these people stop the pills that are killing them.. Please take this into consideration. What if it were your childs life that could be saved by drinking a harmless herbal supplement.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration,\nTimothy Biondollo","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18820","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Timothy Biondollo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My story in short goes like this-  In 1993 I suffered a severe back injury. I spent years with doctors, pain clinics, etc., with no real results except losing all my teeth from the narcotics they were feeding me. On December 20, 2001, I had enough and stopped a 7 year morphine addiction cold turkey. The doctors were fine with the addiction, I was not. I started taking the max dosage of ibuprofen to deal with my pain, but over years of taking it, the otc meds weren't doing anything but messing up my digestive system. I did some research to find something natural to help me, and found kratom. It's been a little over a year since I started drinking the tea, and I have never felt better. To say it's addictive is just a lie. To say it's killed anyone is just a lie. It is a natural herb in the coffee family that's been used for a long time in other parts of the world. I am a successful business owner with a daughter in college. To see what the DEA and the government are doing really opens my eyes to the fact that their actions are driven by money that pharmaceutical companies stand to lose. Nothing more, nothing less. I am for regulation of purity and age restrictions on the sale of herbal supplements, but other than that, the DEA needs to keep their nose out of law abiding tax payers business.

After alot of pain and suffering I managed to find several medications that help including Tramadol/Ultram for my pain.\n The downside to taking Tramadol is that no matter how many you take YOU WILL go through Withdraw from it and It can; depending on the person, render you useless and laying down in bed for hours or in my case days from the Withdraw Sickness.\n For me nothing and I mean nothing helps other then Tramadol; Vicodin/Norco, percocet, or even Oxycontin help but make me sick to the point that I can't function and have to lay down for hours to recover. When I found Kratom, it became a game changer in my life.\n When I run out of my Robaxin, Bentyl, and/or my Tramadol the only thing I could do was wait it out for the withdraw to go away. Now with the kratom I don't have to fear my withdraw  symptoms.\n Kratom for me is like having extra medication on days were I would normally take extra Tramadol due to a \"flair-up\" from my Crohn's or on days were I'm in constant pain due to intestinal cramps and general body aches and pains. Now that I have found Kratom, My pain became more tolerable and as a result I became more active due to my increased energy levels because I'm not as tired from my medications that I have to take just to function.\nNow I know Kratom is not a \"Wounder Drug\" or \"The Cure\" to fix any and all medical issues. I still need my Mesalamine for my Crohn's and my Ventolin/Flovent for my asthma...BUT it has made my life easier and I don't have to go back to smoking/eating Cannabis which is illegal. Kratom is legal and I hope that my words won't no I hope my words DO NOT fall on def ears.\n I don't need Kratom in my life, BUT...like I said it makes my life so much better now knowing that when I get up in the morning wanting to scream because of stomach pain, intestinal cramping, a migraine, having to run to the bathroom because of said cramps and I see a low or even EMPTY prescription bottle all I have to do is make a nice LEGAL cup of kratom tea and relax.\n If Kratom becomes Illegal, I don't want to keep something Illegal like Cannabis or Kratom in my house. I would be putting my families life and my very own in danger and I don't want that. I also don't want the hassle of spending so much \n It makes my life easier knowing that I don't have to resort back to Cannabis (I haven't smoked/eaten cannabis in over ten years as of 12/3/2006) or other things like alcohol or even going to the ER.\n Knowing that I can get Kratom, something innocent...a Coffee plant cousin and use it to treat my pain is amazing.\nPlease, from the bottom of my heart...\n\nPlease, Keep Kratom LEGAL.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1946","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Gardner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Leave kratom to the people.

He has had the disease since he was 10 years old, now 25, and has had numerous surgeries both major and minor.  At least 7 or 8 times he has had minor surgery to lance fistulas, extremely painful infections that result from waste products entering the glandular systems and manifesting as large pustules that necessitate surgical intervention.  Furthermore, he has had two major surgeries, ileocolic resections removing essential portions of his intestines.  He has always had a severe case of Crohns disease, with a wide range of symptoms such as pain, nausea, excessive diarrhea (sometimes beyond 15 times per day), and extreme fatigue.\nRecently, within the past three years, Alan told me about this plant called Kratom and how since he has started using it, his symptoms have subsided and have even reached remission.  Though probably not the sole cause of his remission, the Kratom took care of his diarrhea, pain and fatigue, allowing him to eat a healthier diet and to exercise frequently for the first time in his life.  Over the past two years, his grades have even reflected his newfound health, going from a mediocre student with a 3.1 GPA to an honors student with a 3.8 GPA.  The only side-effect he has reported thus far is a slight increase in acne, but the benefits clearly outweigh the potential negative effects.  And despite possible side effects, he is constantly getting bloodwork and scans to check on his overall health as well as to prescreen for Crohns flare-ups.\nI implore you, for the sake of my brothers health and well-being, please dont schedule Kratom at all.  It seems pretty clear that Kratom itself is not much of an issue, but the misuse of Kratom by mixing other much more extreme street drugs and prescription drugs that result in adverse effects and even death.  If anything, it should be required of vendors to provide proper and safe estimations of how much Kratom to use, how to use it properly, and what not to mix it with, along with other safety warnings such as to consult a physician.  Kratom needs to be researched much more by the western world before we start making judgement calls and stripping away an effective, relatively safe treatment from people like my brother, as well as others who use it, such as those battling cancer.\nThank you in advance for your consideration,\nSincerely,\nMark DePasquale","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23116","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark DePasquale","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have needed the help of Kratom to manage severe chronic recalcitrant  pain I have suffered from for years. I tolerate this well. I am able to be effective at a full time professional job as I continually battle a severe autoimmune disease. I am taking natural approaches and although not well I am functional and alive.  I cannot tolerate other pain medications for the most part. I am very ill and Kratom has allowed me to manage the pain that leaves you unable to stand, unable to sit, unable to lie down. I cannot tell you how much this pain has affected my life, my emotional health, my well being. I am not a drug addict or alcoholic and have a very respectable career where I help many. Kratom just helps my pain lessen and I only get the uplifting feeling because the pain that plagues me has lifted.  I am working on healing myself of systemic scleroderma with the help of others. This has been the biggest challenge of my life. I know so many others who suffer and wish this plant was more understood and available. Banning Kratom would take that and so much other possibilities away.  This is too harsh a judgement on a plant simply because it works. I feel it is sad I have to keep this anonymous because of fear of repercussions. Kratom is one of the great remedies in actual pain relief. Please consider the suffering of those more fully. Realize people with this kind of pain are chronically ill and death is possible in the chronically ill. I firsthand know the limits of our medical system. Prednisone will not cure me. Prednisone only slightly helps my pain and has so many intolerable side effects. Aspirin and other NSAIDs literally would kill me. Narcotics help but I use all pain meds sparingly and do not want to crave the medicine. I just want to feel closer to 'normal.'  I wouldn't wish a painful condition on anyone. Please do not take away something that assists my pain management as I continue to fight this illness. I have too many loved ones and talents to give up. And I would if I could not have a way out of severe pain. I am not suicidal. I just know when the pain is 8-10 level if I cannot stop it I will not keep trying to survive this condition. I am not giving up and this is a tool to allow me to maintain a functional life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21182","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I just found out about this whole controversy with kratom.

At one point, even after the extant of oxycodone abuse had been highly publicized, as well as a estimation of the horrifyingly high amount of abusers, the pharmaceutical company announced it was rolling out a 100mg time release of oxycodone, a pill with the ability to kil anyone who broke it into smaller pieces. What were they thinking? And, I believe it was approved by the FDA. Not good! At any rate, I have taken Kratom for pain, and I find it to be wonderful. I had no side effects, I was not impaired, and had no desire to attempt to abuse it, nor any drug hangover when I took it before sleep. Such is not the case with oxycodone and other related pharmaceuticals: headaches, constipation, lack of alertness and awareness, impairment, insomnia, are all symptoms of even legitimate use of those drugs. I have had no such symptoms with Kratom. I suspect that the pharmaceutical companies have much to do with the FDA attitude towards Kratom\nAnd any efforts to have it banned. It has minimal side effects, helps people kick opioid addiction ( whereas many treatment programs replace opioids with other narcotics, such as methadone, which has severe withdrawal side effects. I know, my daughter was prescribed it for chronic pain and the symptoms of withdrawal are horrifying and debilitating. In addition, why should this country create a whole new class of criminal? Look at the amounts of people sentenced to years of imprisonment for possession of one marijuana cigarette. Please keep this abuse from happening, keep Kratom legal. I completely researched it before ever using it, and Kratom is relatively harmless, except to the psyche of those who want to make a lot of money off drugs, either by selling drugs they manufacture as pharmaceutical companieS, or those who feel people should just suck it up, and not use anything for pain. I encourage you to not place Kratom on schedule 1 or any similar designation. It is so much safer than 1000's of legal drugs. I have friends and family who have to cope with chronic pain, and Kratom is the safest effective treatment they can use, with the least likelihood of abuse. The pharmaceutical companies certainly have failed to provide safe care, and not just with opioids, read all the side effects of these drugs, you'll see. And, as such, schedule designation will only create criminals, Furthermore, if Kratom is scheduled, the pharmaceutical companies will find a way to synthesize or refine it, which means it will be elevated to a position of danger to those who use it. Please keep it legal, the alternative is unsavory, unsafe, and causes people to lose rights when prosecuted and convicted to excessive prison time, and creates a ridiculous burden upon the taxpayers, as we have an amazing % of our populace locked up for victimless crime, especially when compared to other countries.

I loathed the thought,but looked for other options .Found out about kratom and started using it daily. I've ramianed sober off pain pills thanks this medicine. Its nothing like other opioids.

I have a daughter and consider myself to be a contributing member of society. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for almost ten years. Naturally I sought medical help for these issues and never have found anything medicinally that helped with so many other side effects that rendered those pharmaceuticals useless. I have been struggling to stay off of benzos for almost three years now. I have succeeded in that aspect but not without many complications. Including seizures and a lasting withdrawal syndrome that leaves me suffering from mild symptoms of withdrawal every day despite the fact that I have not taken any benzos in two years. There is nothing to be done except take something else. Couple those issues with a 5 year battle with opiate addictions stemming from prolonged doctor prescribed use of opiates due to sports injuries. Every day is a struggle, crippling anxiety can almost render me useless for days on end. Lately, I have turned to the only readily available and legal CNS depressant, alcohol. It's no stretch of my imagination to see where this path will lead me. In a desperate search for an alternative therapy of some sort I found kratom. I have found it to be very nearly a miracle drug. I experience mood stabilizing, pain relief, anxiety relief and an uplifting overall experience. I have been able to completely stop drinking alcohol as a form of self medication. I would beg the government to proactively research kratom more, join me and many others in seeing how much good can come from this plant.

All arguments against the use of this plant are centered around a lack of knowledge and lack of information. It seems absolutely insane to me that you would even consider banning a substance that is helping so many people without doing the proper research. If your concern is the well being of citizens you will not pass this. If your concern is the pharmaceutical companies being able to profit off this in the future, then you will go ahead and ban it. As a concerned citizen, it truly disgusts me to see the DEA make decisions without any regard to science , facts, or the  wellbeing of US Citizens . Again if you are in the business of protecting American people you will not ban this substance. If you are actually concerned about its negative effects you would do some more research on the topic and make it safer  not just take it away from people that need it to function properly in their daily lives. I have never used Kratom but I have the capacity to empathize .. what if it was your child that this substance was helping? Get over the stigma of \"drugs\" that is so deeply rooted in your organization and start using facts and research for gods sake.

After the time when it was deemed \"no longer necessary\" for me to be on pain meds, I had to find something alternative and preferably natural as I could already feel my dependency to opiates being solidified after 2 weeks of not having any. I discovered \"kratom\" and it has honestly helped me for almost 6 months of on and off use (never regular, as my pain is mostly gone; I just get occasional pain above my knee from excessive walking or any excessive amount of physical activity that involves my legs).\n\nPretty much what I'm saying is that kratom helps my pain when I need it, and it's natural... and not an opiate. I despise opiates honestly and would rather burn a joint or take 2-3 grams of kratom to help my minor-medium pain I feel sometimes due to my previous accident.\n\nI disagree with listing kratom as a controlled subtance.

I am grateful to have the opportunity to share my experiences.\n\nPlease allow me to share my own story. In 2009, my wife of 27 years was diagnosed with Mantle Cell Lymphoma. I was her caregiver and medical advocate. At the same time, I needed to continue my job as a laboratory director for a regional environmental laboratory; there were responsibilities of protecting public health and our environment that I could not simply walk away from.\n\nIn the 3 years from diagnosis, to her eventual death in 2012, I was prescribed a variety of prescription drugs by my family doctor to help me function, while I dealt with the trauma that had entered our lives. After her death, as I picked up the pieces I set about putting my own life back together; part of that was stopping the medications. I systematically and carefully reduced each drug gradually. I was able to stop all of the medications except for one. I was taking substantial dosages of tramadol. This is technically a prodrug; the compound, when metabolized, produces an molecular analog to codeine. Despite repeated efforts, I could not get below 200 mg/day without becoming so ill that I could not get out of bed and stand up, let alone go to work and take care of life.\n\nAt that point I decided to try Kratom to see if I could use it to help in this goal. I purchased some and began taking small daily dosages. After a week, while continuing to use the herb, I resumed my attempt to reduce the tramadol dosage. To my delight, I found that I was able to continue to reduce my tramadol dosage without suffering withdrawal symptoms; within 2 weeks, I was able to stop the tramadol completely.\n\nI am 61 years old, and have my share of significant pain on a daily basis. When they are too severe to be helped by OTC medications like Advil, Tylenol, etc. I find Kratom is extremely effective in pain relief. In addition Kratom does not cause me any functional impairment or sedation, while providing pain relief. I am able to do my job, take care of my house and loved ones, and live my life wholly and productively.\n\nThe scheduling of Kratom, and its subsequent unavailability for my use would impact my life significantly. I would have to turn to opioid based drugs to achieve the same level of pain relief. This would also cause me impairment, impact both my functioning at work and home, and result in having to deal with the resultant addiction issues I had resolved through the use of Kratom. The quality of my life would truly suffer as a result.\n\nI have read the stories of many, many others in this country, who have used the herb successfully to; wean themselves from opioids and other medications they were addicted to; for both minor general and severe pain relief; for anxiety issues; for PTSD. Kratom has been a positive help in our lives, and for some, a genuine lifesaver.\n\nI implore you to help me and the many thousands of Americans who are able to live better and more productive lives thanks to this herb. Please intercede on our behalf to halt the proposed scheduling of Kratom.\n \nAgain, please allow me to express my gratitude in your taking the time to listen to my story, and for caring about our concerns.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4329","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I overcame alcoholism with the use of kratom.

I have seen hundreds of testimonies stating how kratom has been used as a tool to help aid in sobriety. So many individuals use kratom to get off addiction prescriptions and illegal substances. Kratom has helped me greatly improve my quality of life. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety. Due to my depression I never have energy and spend more time in my bed sleeping rather than living any type of productive lifestyle. I learned about kratom on a support group and began to research. I started ordering from a trusted vendor and since then my life has improved. Those close to me notice a positive change in my life, and I continued to use kratom. My boyfriend suffered from illegal drug usage and had zero faith in a plant matter to help him wean off those nasty drugs. Two individuals who have been using kratom for over a year. Both of us have stopped occasionally so we could reset our tolerance and had no issues with withdraw or dependency.  \n\nThe DEA scheduling would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown the primary alkaloids in kratom to be beneficial without causing respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.  studies strongly support that individual kratom alkaloids have significant analgesic, or pain-killing, effects while causing minimal risk of respiratory depression and physical dependence. kratom had the potential to ease withdrawal symptoms due to morphine addiction in mice.Kratom is not a lethal substance- all the reports of deaths related to kratom have been due to toxicity of multiple substances, often a mixture of opioids and benzodiazepines (which can be deadly) and mitragynine was also present.

I started taking Kratom in powdered leaf form about 2 years ago. I am a substitute teacher for K-12 and a substitute bus driver. After a vasectomy gone bad, I was using narcotic pain relievers to the point of abuse. I did not like the way they made me feel. I researched on the internet into ethnobotanicals and found Kratom in the same areas you would find St Johns Wort and Valerian root. I feel it has helped lesson the symptoms of fear and anxiety along with minor aches and pains. I have never felt like it controls me. I have gone days to weeks before taking a dose with minimal to no withdrawal type effects. If placed on Sched 1, I would be forced into the healthcare system with no insurance and placed on a waiting list to see some doctor that cares nothing about my individual needs and sees me only as another addiction patient and be stigmatized. They want to prescribe a pill that I've read causes as much pain as it supposedly cures. Anti depressants make my skin crawl and I will never take another. I believe that in America, we should be free to heal ourselves with natural remedies. If snake oil makes us feel better without causing any dangerous side effects, then by God we should be allowed to drink it! The only side effect I've noticed with Kratom is nausea when you take too much (6grams+) at one time. I have felt energized on a few occasions but more calm other times depending on the strain, but I would not describe the effects as euphoric or high. If any regulations should be made towards Kratom, I would support making sure it has not been mixed or sprayed with dangerous chemicals, and that extracts that make claims to being 40-50X normal strength should be regulated or banned.I have introduced this tea leaf to 4 other people who were pain pill addicts and it helped reduce their withdrawal symptoms and helped them lead better, more fullfilling lives. Thank you for the consideration of taking public comments. \n\nSincerely,\nSamuel Ryan","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21424","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Samuel Ryan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir/ Madam,\n\nI would like to begin by saying that I appreciate the work you as members of the DEA do for our country. My name is Adam Horning and I am currently employed as a Biomedical Technician who works on dialysis machines and medical grade water purification equipment. Prior to my current employment I was an Infantryman in the United States Army. I served my country with distinction and was honorably discharged. After the Army I began taking prescription opiates for pain management. I slowly turned from using the medication as prescribed to craving my next dose before I was supposed to take it. Slowly I turned into an opiate addict who's life was completely controlled by a small pill. Eventually my prescriptions were no longer enough to produce the effect they once had. I eventually turned to heroin because I could not afford to buy prescription pills on the black market. I had no criminal record, had received numerous awards from my military service and had turned into a shell of my former self. I was using heroin and prescription pills around the clock to prevent going into withdrawal was my only task and purpose in life. Nothing else mattered. My relationship with my family had completely fallen apart. One day a concerned friend asked me if I had ever heard of Kratom. I had not. I didn't believe that there was any plant out there that could possibly relieve my suffering and help me get off of opiates. I did not want to become a methadone addict or a suboxone addict. I took Kratom and it helped get me through my withdrawals. It didn't make me high but it did prevent me from craving opiates. That was two years ago. I no longer use any opiates to control my pain. I use Kratom. I am now married, have rebuilt the relationship with my family and have a very good job. I am a responsible adult and I choose to use Kratom. It helps alleviate mental and physical pain caused by my service to this nation. I have used Kratom daily for two years and have not experienced any side effects. Kratom offers a natural solution to our countries explosive opiate epidemic. I had never used drugs before in my life and eventually started using heroin due to my prescription pain killer addiction. Sadly this happens to hundreds of people each day in this country. I plead with you to leave Kratom unscheduled. It is not harmful and you would be taking away a natural alternative that could save lives. Kratom saved my life. I am here writing this letter to you today because of Kratom. I ask that you treat it as a dietary supplement, as Canada does, sold without any claims as to its ability to prevent or cure diseases. Regulate it's sale to those over 21. There is no morally justifiable reason an adult should be prevented from using this plant if he or her so chooses to. Taking away the right to access Kratom would undoubtedly turn many people back to harder drugs. I respectfully ask that you leave Kratom unscheduled and available to everyone. This plant is a godsend not a demon. Thank you for taking my thoughts into consideration.\n\nRespectfully,\nAdam Lynn Horning\nHarrisburg, Pennsylvania\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0097","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adam Horning","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Noelia Chahalis and this news of temporarily not classifying Kratom as a schedule 1 drug is horrifying. Yes Kratom like so many other drugs have been used for medicinal purposes. Yet so was heroin and cocaine in our great nation's history. \nIt does have some benefits that have helped people but here is the truth. Drug addicted who cannot get their drug of choice, specifically opiate addicts, purchase this drug for cheap and at their local gas station and abuse it. They use it to get high and it most definitely gets one high and addicted. It has addicting qualities similar to that of heroin. I know this to be true. \nI am sober for 11 years and over the past five years Kratom has destroyed the lives of my friends and family. It has destroyed my own family as my husband used Kratom to help him detox from opiates because our insurance would not cover another treatment facility. His addiction to Kratom happened pretty immediate. He has even taken out daughter to purchase Kratom telling himself and me that it's legal so it is ok. I have also had many other loved ones go down the same path. Thankfully my husband is now sober but seeing it at Exxon when he goes to get a drink or at the local smoke shop is incredibly tempting and dangerous. I implore you to please do more research. There are even detox and rehabs in a Florida and California focused on helping those with this addiction. Please reconsider this decision.  It might change when your child one day is stealing from you to get kratom. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0095","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Noelia Chahalis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have read widely on the internet many hours a day, for years. The first time I ever heard of Kratom was the article that said the DEA was putting it on Schedule I because it was, apparently, such a huge danger to society. How much of a problem could it be, if I never even heard of it before it was going to be restricted?\n\nI have suffered from depression and anxiety most of my life. I have avoided street drugs because they are illegal and said to be dangerous. I have avoided most natural supplements, because the FDA does not test or regulate them at all, and the ones I have tried have been ineffective at helping me. I have gone the \"Big Pharma\" route, trusting that the FDA and the medical establishment were doing the best possible to help me.\n\nBut after a lifetime of these legal and regulated anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs, I feel I've wasted most of my life living in a fog and feeling like crap. My libido has been killed, I have no energy, my memory and concentration are bad-- and I'm still depressed and anxious.\n\nWhen I read the effects that Kratom is supposed to have, and that the majority of people have taken it safely and with good results, my first instinct was to look into buying and trying it myself. It seems to still be available. I'd like it better if it were tested and regulated as to purity. But since there's a risk it may be put forever out of my hands if I wait that long, I'm very inclined to just go ahead and get some and try it to see if it helps my quality of life improve.\n\nPeople seem to have found this substance to be a life-changer in a positive way, after struggling with chronic pain and PTSD. To take it away from them just because some minority of users are idiots, and overuse to harmful effect, seems senseless and cruel.\n\nI hope you will keep access to this substance free from unnecessary restriction, while also encouraging testing and research into scientifically usable data about its risks and benefits. Especially the Veterans who use it for pain and PTSD deserve that consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0383","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"LISA MAJERSKY","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Rochelle Garcia.

Then i would run out before my jext appointment and end up in more pain go through withdraws. So i started talking to a friend of mine and she said she had been using this natural product called Kratom for her back pain. And she kept going on and on about how much better she was feeling. So she came to my house the other day and i tried a cup of her tea with the Kratom in it, and i could literally feel the pain easing up after just a few minutes. So i had her help me place an order right then and there. I don't like taking pain pills. They addicting and harmful. I would rather take something that is all natural and does the same thing only better. I have read many reviews about it and there were so many good positive reviews and comments about Kratom that i was amazed. I'm not one to just purchase something online without researching first. And i did alot of that. And i am really glad that i did. I didn't think i would ever be able to sit or stand for more than 5 to 10 minutes at one time. But i have been able to since using Kratom.

These are all people who would mostly likely be dead by now if it were not for this miracle plant. Instead they now  hold jobs, and contribute to our society. Making this plant illegal to access will not only result in the death of many American citizens, but will also lead to a increase in abuse of \"real\" opiates such as morphine and heroin.

To take away a botanical plant that has helped so many of us have some quality of life, would be like taking insulin away from a diabetic or like taking blood pressure medication away from someone with hypertension.

For years, my wife was prescribed Xanax, three a day, to treat her Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. While the medicine had minor benefits, it also had serious drawbacks. It's a habit forming drug with very dangerous withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, severe anxiety and nervous tics. Withdrawal from Xanax can be life-threatening, if for example users have a seizure while driving, or have one severe enough to kill them. Even medically supervised withdrawal is extremely difficult, because there's not a lot of research on effective rehabilitation strategies for Xanax dependency. Users have to slowly wean themselves off of the substance, which is extremely difficult for a drug the user is physically dependent on. My wife went through Hell trying to fight her dependency, but she had to because her large prescribed dose made it impossible for her to work or lead a normal life. Xanax also causes long-term problems such as memory loss, blackouts and erratic behavior. Tragically, benzodiazepine dependency and addiction are common problems in our country today: My wife is neither the first nor the last to struggle with this problem. \n\nKratom has been an absolute godsend for her. By substituting Xanax for kratom she was able to completely wean herself off of Xanax (even though she had previously tried several times). She didn't have any seizures, cravings for Xanax or severe withdrawal symptoms. More to the point, once she was completely off of Xanax, she was likewise able to cease using kratom without any withdrawal symptoms whatsoever. She has not had any health problems from her use of kratom. She is now a hard-working, active person whose health, both physical and mental, is back. I know, because I've seen it with my own eyes, that she was able to quit Xanax because kratom was legally available. \n\nWhen I heard that the DEA was considering scheduling kratom as a drug more dangerous than Xanax, I was aghast. First, it clearly has some medical benefits if it allows users of drugs like Xanax and heroin to fight dependency. Secondly, it's simply not more dangerous than Xanax. The side effects of Xanax are far more detrimental, obvious and disruptive to the user's quality of life. Likewise, the withdrawal symptoms from Xanax are hellacious, whereas my wife had none from kratom. In sum, I think that kratom has the potential to be an effective tool when addiction to prescription drugs like benzodiazepines and painkillers are a widespread epidemic. Scheduling it as a dangerous drug makes no sense, and might even make other social problems from drug addiction even worse because many people use kratom to fight addiction. For the DEA to consider it on par with heroin is short-sighted, irrational and harmful. My wife was given a new lease on life because of this substance, and I don't think the DEA should deny that opportunity to others who are suffering.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4493","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern.\n\nI am a 51 year old elementary school teacher and single mother to three teenage boys. My oldest son is an Eagle Scout, fraternity member, and full time university student majoring in neuroscience. My middle son has very serious medical conditions requiring him to be tutored at home. My youngest son is an athlete and honors student currently pursuing his dream to climb the tallest mountain on every continent.\n\nI am writing to respectfully ask the DEA to stop the ban on kratom. I fear what will happen to my family if I can no longer use this leaf. As a result of two very serious accidents, I was prescribed several strong pain killers which I took for three years.  The medication took some of the pain away but it also took me away from my boys and my career. I became depressed and was unable to sleep so my doctor prescribed several more medications to address those problems.\n\nWatching my children suffer because they no longer had an active, happy, or productive mother became too much to bare so I began to research natural products. I was determined to find a solution and I did!  That solution was kratom. I found drinking kratom tea helped with the pain so I required less pain killers. I realized I was sleeping better which gave me the energy to become more involved in my sons' activities. The depression lifted so, with my doctor's encouragement, I stopped those prescription medications.\n\nKratom tea has substantially changed my life. I have consumed it for almost four years with no problems.  It has helped me eliminate almost all prescription medication and, most importantly, allowed me to be a positive role model for my sons again!\n\nPlease research kratom, as I did, and listen to the thousands of people that have improved their lives with kratom. If it is banned, I can ensure you the number of people applying for government assistance and disability will sky rocket. Suicides and overdoses will also. Kratom is safe and effective. My family and thousands of others do NOT deserve to suffer from an unfair ban on kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9225","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Audrey Fitzsimmons","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a veteran I have served my country 8 years.

I dont drink. I dont smoke. Unfortunately I have been in several car accidents in my life. One serious. I have been on painkillers for at least 10 years. Completely ruined my life. I lost a lot. Started taking Suboxone to get off the pain killers and ease the withdrawal symptoms. That was just another drug that I became dependent on to get off the painkillers. I felt hopeless that I would never ever get off of the drugs. I tried every herbal supplement I could find which was a difficult task. No luck. I was still a slave to the drugs. With no end in sight I fell into a downward spiral of depression. Until one day I came across a meme on Facebook about how the DEA was trying to ban Kratom. So then I did my research on Kratom and was pleasantly surprised. For the first time in a while I had high hopes. I have been taking 2 grams of Kratom a day since September 14th..That day is very special for me because it was the last day took Suboxone.  Ive never thought I would see the day that I would get off pills. It is a amazing plant.... Thanks to Kratom, I get my life back. So please, do not ban Kratom. It is a life saver. I do not get any kind of high. There are no euphoric feelings or buzz. It simply takes away the pain and suffering from withdrawal. It is a miracle plant. \n                       \n                                 Thank you for your time.

Mostly during the transition from fall to winter and then in mid winter when temperatures dip well below zero. In taking Kratom, so far this season I've had no shooting pain and very little ache. I also have some pain from diverticulitis and have had much relief from abdominal pain as well and never felt any kind of extreme euphoria. I was just in a good mood. \n\nI just feel as though this is something that should be researched much more extensively before steps are made to make it illegal. I believe it should be left legal based on my experience and the positive feedback I've received from others that have tried it. I would also like to see some research and experimental studies on Kratom to find other possible health benefits from it. I believe it is a positive thing that should never be criminalizing.

Since the move, I have tried to find legal alternatives to kratom that would be as effective in dealing with back pain and as a sleep aid.  I have yet to find anything that comes close.  Since I am basically living in an environment that is the same as would be under a ban on kratom at the federal level, I am seeing all of the downsides to such a ban.  \n\nI argue against a federal ban on kratom, not for myself, but for my friend who suffers from diabetic nueropathy and my brother-in-law who suffers from ankylosing spondylitis.

I'm 45 years old and mother of 6 children. My problems all stemmed about 17 years ago with a horrible abscess in my mouth. The dentist prescribed me Vicodin which I find to be a perfect reliever without putting me out. Everywhere I went, I was prescribed narcotics for minor too moderate pain. So it was no wonder that I became hooked on them. Of course I finally got cut off and getting it prescribed was now terribly hard. I tried to quit cold turkey but couldn't, so I continued to try and ease this discomfort by consuming alcohol on a daily basis, and by daily, I mean all day. I put on 65lbs within 7 months and was known for being a 'drunk' by my family and neighbors. I was introduced to Kratom by a co-worker and have been talking it as needed since 2015. I've lost the weight and my marriage is great. I can go to my children's functions without being in pain, intoxicated or having a panic attack. Kratom is a miracle, it's all natural and requires very little to keep me balanced. I'm proud to say that I've not had a drink or taken ANY prescription drugs since discovering this. Please, please, for the love of humanity, do not put a ban or control on this substance.

What is not mentioned is whether or not there were other drugs (legal or illegal) involved in these fatalities. Furthermore, from a numbers perspective, 15 deaths in 2 years is basically negligible. For some perspective, there are an average of 51 deaths from lightning strikes every year in the US. In 2014 there were 47,055 deaths caused by opioid overdose in the US (more on this later).\nThe filing also mentions an uptick in calls to poison control centers about kratom. It mentions 660 calls to poison control centers over a period of 6 years. Again, from a numbers perspective, 110 calls per year is negligible. In 2014, poison control centers logged 2,890,909 calls. So 110/2,890,909 = 0.003% of calls about kratom; hardly an epidemic. For some perspective, in 2014, poison control centers received 66,058 calls about vitamins.\n\nThe filing states \"Kratom does not have an approved medical use in the United States,\" but then (paradoxically) goes on list the medical uses of kratom:\n- \"Kratom has also been used to self-treat chronic pain and withdrawal symptoms from opioid use\"\n- \"users have turned to kratom as a replacement for other opioids\"\n- \"kratom is misused to self-treat chronic pain\"\n\nIf kratom can be used to treat chronic pain, how is that \"misuse\"? Furthermore, if kratom has similar effects as opioids, then either kratom *does* have a valid medical use, or opioids do not. You can't have it both ways.\nFinally, with basically zero deaths due to kratom alone, it might be a safer alternative to opioids. Opioid overdose is very serious and very deadly (as illustrated by fatalities in 2014). If people suffering from chronic pain or opioid dependence can safely treat their pain with kratom, why is that a bad thing? If kratom can be used as a safe alternative to opioids, then banning it is being complicit with -- and partially responsible for -- every single opioid death going forward.\n\nThe only people this may be dangerous for is people profiting from opioid sales. They are certainly in danger of making less money. But the drug war should not be extended to protect their bottom lines.\n\nMy wife and I both deal with chronic daily pain. Her, from Rheumatoid Arthritis and Fibromyalgia, me from brain surgery from two years ago. Her pain is much worse than mine.\n\nOpioids help with the pain, but doctors are reticent to prescribe it and (as mentioned above) opioids are dangerous.\n\nWe recently discovered kratom as an alternative. It's not quite as effective as real opioids, however it is far easier to attain and far safer. Initial research indicates that users might not develop tolerance in the same way as opioids, because it is only a partial agonist for opioid receptors. Additionally, there is little to no risk of respiratory depression because kratom does not activate a protein called -arrestin, which is associated with the respiratory side-effects of opioids.\n\nIf you're not currently in pain, or haven't recently been in pain, it's difficult to fully appreciate the impact it has on your quality of life. With no real treatment options and no prospects for relief, hopelessness sets in quickly. If kratom is banned, you will be taking people's hope. Not only will people go back to opioids, and many will overdose and die, many will simply commit suicide. The national suicide rate is 2x the homicide rate.\n\nIt's difficult to imagine someone in D.C. deciding that my life should be significantly worse, for no good reason. It makes me wish terrible things to befall those misguided souls in the DEA. May the people pushing to ban kratom have chronic migraines. May they have a headache that never goes away. May they stub their toe and get complex regional pain syndrome.\n\nBut really, I don't wish them pain. Really, I wish they could see how their decision to ban kratom will actually hurt people. It will hurt far more than it might protect. I wish they'd see the errors in their calculations, and revise their approach. I wish I didn't suspect that they were motivated by kickbacks from opioid manufacturers along with a desire to maintain current DEA funding with the advent of marijuana legalization. I wish the filing to ban kratom had actually made sense. I wish there were better answers from medical science.\n\nBut I don't have any of that. I have kratom. Please don't take it away.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5772","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steve Hull","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Betty I'm a Severe Domestic Violence Surviver and on top of the life long damage from that I also have Fibro and CFS I have seen at least 25 Dr's near and far and was given every pain medication that is available most left me dazed or caused me to sleep for Days I had to close my Daycare Business of 20 yrs because I could not function ...I found Kratom and my life started again it was like waking from a nightmare and starting over ..I now can visit with my Family , play with my Grandchildren and even have a Hobby I feel alive and relevant again and its Kratom that allowed this to happen Please don't ban Kratom and force those of us to return the nightmare of big Pharma \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5050","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Betty Dowler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W\n\nI am writing to you today to voice my concern over the potential scheduling of Kratom.\n\nI am a responsible Kratom user for about 2 years now, and currently use it a few times per day to help me deal with my difficult mental and physical symptoms.  During my life I have been diagnosted with depression, PTSD, and fybromyalgia.  Kratom tea helps me deal with the symptoms of these conditions, and scheduling it would absolutely have a detrimental effect on my personal well being.\n\nThroughout my life I have been through the full cycle of doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, and have been prescribed all types of medication for depression and pain management.  The side effects of these medications are too extreme for me to be comfortable with taking them on a regular basis, and being physically or chemically dependent on them is not a solution that I consider rational or sustainable.  Since taking Kratom I have stopped drinking alcohol completely, and have not had the desire to use any synthetic drugs at all.\n\nEven if I was not a personal user, I would be opposed to it being scheduled.  It is currently and for the foreseeable future legal in Canada and Mexico.  Scheduling it here will just create another black market for the cartels in Mexico, and organized crime like the Hells Angels in Canada.  The hundreds of thousands of people that use Kratom responsibly will still want it even if it becomes restricted.  If the leaf itself is difficult to import, the home made extract business will thrive in its place.  This type of product would just serve to further deregulate what is currently a healthy, self-regulating market.\n\nScheduling it will also effectively cancel current research on it.  If it can be shown to be effective at treating drug addiction or depression, it could save countless lives across the country.  It is definitely worth looking into considering there is a growing opioid epidemic.  Banning a healthy and safe alternative to classic opioid medications is only going to lead to more deaths and abuse of synthetic opioids, which nobody wants.\n\nThank you for reading my thoughts.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14637","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Aaron Bush","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"   Given the rapidly expanding opioid epidemic and the increased use of synthetic opioids like hydromorphone and fentanyl outside of medical settings, there are several potentially unintended consequences of restricting access to mitragina speciosa alkaloids. \n   As a natural product with little scientific research showing the dangers of its use, mitragina speciosa is often used as a substitute for people who are going to use opioids anyway and would otherwise have easier access to stronger and more addictive opioids that can be cut with much more dangerous substances. It is arguably safer for drug users to chew or drink the natural leaf than to buy heroin of the street that is laced with carfentanyl. As a recovering addict myself, I've often thought that if I'd had easier access to less powerful opioids like 7 hydroxymitragine or buprenorphine after my surgery, I might not have been driven to buy fentanyl online and would have had an easier time managing the physical dependence.\n   Also, many opioid abusers have found success in using mitragina speciosa as replacement therapy for stronger opioids. It is still very difficult for the majority of the population to find buprenorphine-based MATCH programs where they live, or are unable to afford the appointments or suboxone with their insurance. Until the day that they are able to get medical assistance, it is important for them to have access to a natural and less dangerous replacement. \n   If \"the war on drugs,\" specifically marijuana, has taught us anything, it's that the restricting of natural substances without the scientific evidence to prove they are dangerous can have massive unintended conciquences that land a lot of US citizens in prison for non-violent drug offenses. The DEA should be very careful in considering whether or not the result of this regulation will actually save lives, or imprison them.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7279","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nicholas O","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it may concern,\n\nI'm writing to ask you to stop the listing of kratom as a schedule 1 drug.

I will give you an example of my soon to be criminal activities with this safe herbal remedy.  \nHere are my future criminal activities:  I woke up this morning with crippling menstrual cramps.  Before I was lucky enough to discover the herbal remedy kratom I would fruitlessly try to medicate myself with damaging NSAIDS, to not much effective relief.  I would typically lose a couple of days of work each month (adding up to 24 days a year) because I was too much in pain to go.  Today I remedied my pain with my choice of natural herbal supplement Kratom.  I was able to get up, take care of my three young children, wash the car and tend to the myriad of responsibilities as the mother of young children.  There is no difference in my demeanor, other than not being in pain, and a mildly uplifted mood.  When I go without this herb I have not found that I suffer from any sort of withdrawel symptoms whatsoever.\nWithout your help I will be turned into a criminal for this choice.  The intent of the DEA to move kratom to schedule 1 alongside heroin and ecstasy is absurd.  This is a natural growing leaf that has been introduced to Americans in chronic pain decades ago who have been relieving their suffering, depression, anxiety, PTSD, opiod dependency, arthritis, and much more.\nThe DEA has already been responsible for ruining countless lives in the course of arresting non-violent citizens who choose to medicate themselves effectively with cannabis.  The choice to continue cannabis on schedule 1 has been a way to justify their own sinister actions as they have destroyed lives creating criminals out of suffering people. Instead of admitting the ridiculous failure of the War on Drugs, they are doubling down on safe non-lethal medicinal plants that humankind has been safely using for a millenia, cannabis and kratom.\nThe idea of raids on grandparents with chronic pain, soldiers, mother and fathers, etc. who are all simply wishing to live their lives and pay for their taxes is appalling.\nTo justify the insane decision to place the simple cousin of the coffee tree to schedule 1 the DEA plays a trick when citing kratom related calls to poison control centers that the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention published in July.  From January 2010 through December 2015, The DEA notes, U.S poison centers received 660 calls related to kratom exposure.  It adds that during this time, there was a tenfold increase in the number of calls received, from 26 in 2010 to 263 in 2015.\nAn average of 110 may sound like a lot, but it is not.  It represents 0.004 perecent of 3 MILLION calls received each year.  By comparison, analgesics accounted for 300,00 calls in 2014, while cosmetics and personal care products, cleaning solutions, anti-depressants and anti-histamines each accounted for more than 100,000.\nThe DEA fails to put this number in perspective and does not mention that two thirds of the cases were described as mild or moderate.  The CDC noted a single death in six years, reported in a person who was exposed to medicines paroxetine and lamotrigine (an antidepressant, anti-convulsant, and mood stabilizer) in addition to kratom.\nThese numbers are reassuring, but the DEA comes to the opposite conclusion.  Experts have confirmed the two main alkaloids in kratom the DEA wishes to schedule (effectively banning the whole plant) are safe, effective and have many positive benefits.\nKratom is a safe substance that has many very important medicinal uses and has helped me greatly while giving me no bad side effects or any withdrawel symtoms after more than a year of choosing this remedy.  I fear this decision will lead to deaths of victims of the tragic opoid epidemic and the suicides of people suffering from chronic pain who cannot and will not go back to harmful prescribed pharmaceuticals.  I know my own quality of life as a tax paying law abiding productive member of society would be drastically diminished.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJessica Chipman","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7872","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jessica Chipman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep this medicinal herb legal.

I have personally chosen to consume kratom in powder and powdered leaf tea form as a supplement recreationally for about 2.5 years now. I've worked in a kava bar in south Florida and have met hundreds of people who also choose to consume the supplement on a daily basis. The people I've encountered have all been intelligent, responsible, adult citizens who are hard working and contribute to society; everything from single working moms, lawyers, nurses, personal trainers, to police officers and military. Throughout my experience I've met people consuming kratom for various reasons. Among those are physical/mental illness (ie: MS, cancer, fibromyalgia, anxiety, PTSD etc)  chronic pain, leisure, for energy (like coffee), addiction, and alcoholism. This plant has positively affected 100,000's of people in this country recently and has been used medicinally in its country of origin for millennia. To have found a natural substance that so many consume for a myriad of reasons with no negative side effects is a gift and should be treated as such.  These kratom consumers are everyday people who have the right as Americans to choose a natural herb supplement over many crippling or \"zombifying\" pharmaceuticals. There's yet to be any autopsy evidence showing that kratom has been the actual cause of death to any of the 15 \"reported kratom related deaths\" many of which were due to mental illness and drug cocktail induced suicides. To label this plant an imminent health concern for the public based on 15 unproven deaths- ever- is ludicrous. Compared to average statistics of regularly consumed products such as Tylenol: Each year, acetaminophen overdose is responsible for more than 56,000 emergency room visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and an estimated 458 deaths due to acute liver failure- the claims of the DEA are seriously questionable. Schedule 1 means that the product has no health benefit and a high potential for abuse. Alcohol and tobacco should be in this category many times over than kratom. There is no evidence that this plant has either of these qualities and an abundance of real people that have been consuming it for years claiming otherwise. If the DEA and FDA are truly concerned for the public they should take note of the massive positive feedback on natural kratom and ban synthetic kratom. They should put an age restriction on it and let competent adults keep their right to choose their own herbal supplements. \"If people let the government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take, their bodies will soon be in as sorry a state as are the souls of those who live under tyranny\"         -Thomas Jefferson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20984","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Katrina Oakley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In Reference To Docket No. DEA-442W:\n\nKeeping the active ingredients in Kratom legal is beneficial for the government and the People of the United States of America.

If Kratom became illegal it would be less money for the government. Most importantly it helps people who suffer from chronic physical pain and/or mental pain such as PTSD, God made people and God made kratom. This plant keeps people off of drugs that do serious harm, for example opioids, cocaine, and heroin. The government needs to listen to the People of America. IF Kratom became a schedule 1 drug then it would be nearly impossible to research the plant, which would show the People of America that the government is discriminating against a God made plant and Our God given rights as free people. The dea has no scientific evidence that the ingredients in kratom are harmful to people. There needs to be much more research into the plant from multiple credited institutions to show the positive benefits and multiple medical benefits. Therefore, in conclusion, the government needs to keep kratom off of schedule 1 banned substance list so that it can be researched without biased negative judgement.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17209","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Colton Ankrom","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm 31 years old and I work at an herb emporium/apothecary that sells kratom and other natural herbs.

My comment is as follows: \n\nThe DEA should refrain from placing Kratom under any sort of ban. Without any significant scientific data concluding the substance would result in substantial harm to the general public, any federal restriction would encroach on constitutional balancing of powers. It remains the duty of federal and state legislature to decide the legality of non-hazardous substances; by allowing the legislative branch to handle the legality of Kratom, enabling the people a far more direct method of self-governancethe very foundation of the Constitution since its founding. Any action by the DEA, without further compelling scientific evidence, would supersede the founding principle of the constitution and the delicate balance of power shared between the branches of government both state and federal. \nUndoubtedly, the DEA serves a vital role in protecting the general public by regulating dangerous substances, whereas the legislature may be unable to react sufficiently in time to prevent dangers. Any execution of executory powers should be carefully measured and used solely to the benefit of the people to avoid an imminent hazard pursuant 21 U.S.C. 812(h)(3). Therefore, if evidence of abuse cannot be substantiated, or any existing abuse is not substantially harmful to users and public health is not at risk, regulation is beyond the DEA's allotted power. Any further action, if desired, is the duty of the federal and state legislatures, which provides the greatest representation of the American public's will. \nThusly, any action by the DEA should be highly measured and reserved, only taking action to protect the general public from a clear danger. Otherwise, any issue on the legality of Kratom must be left for the legislative branch of government, both federal and state levelsfor the DEA duty to uphold and protect the Constitutionally-created balances between the branches of government. The law in and of itself does not uphold the Constitution, it is only by the careful actions of each individual making up the government that our freedoms are protected.

Which lead to counseling and of course more medicine. I didn't want to take pain medication and decided to try a natural alternative.  My brother suggested Kratom to me and said it would help. I did my research and made my first purchase. That's when my life changed forever! I did not experience any withdrawals from stopping the prescription medications while taking Kratom. Kratom enabled me to continue working as a Paramedic and discontinue pain medication use. Kratom helped with all of my previously diagnosed medical issues. Kratom is a natural alternative to prescription medications and does not need to be placed on the Schedule 1 list of controlled substances.\n\nThank you,\nJenny D.

I have been taking kratom for over two years and have had my life changed by it in nothing but positive ways.  The long time social anxiety and depression I have suffered from has completely gone away.  I've been given many medications by doctors over the years to treat this, but nothing has come even close to curing my symptoms as kratom has.  My experiences have mirrored those of many people I know and countless others.\n\nIf kratom is made illegal, it will only add to our growing opiate pill abuse and heroin addiction.  From my personal experience, I believe kratom to be a key to freeing many of these addicts from their life devastating addictions.   I do however believe that  kratom should only be able to be purchased through responsible licensed vendors.  As a regular kratom user, I want to be sure what I'm buying is what it's supposed to be.  Personally, I only make my purchases through one well known vendor that I trust.  Head shops selling what they claim is kratom under names like \"Vico-den\" haven't done the image and preconceived notions about this already misunderstood leaf any favors.

Please help keep this plant legal, it has helped me through my life and I know nothing else could ever replace it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16768","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeremy Beaver","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, hoping Kratom is given more time to be examined for benefits ..while some drugs (flakka , synthetic marijuana ,etc are extremely detrimental to the safety of the public and I applaud the quick regulation of these substances I feel Kratom needs more research especially in a time when opioid addiction is at a crisis point in this country. \n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on this \n\n\n\nDerrek Radabaugh","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11385","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Derrek Radabaugh","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My addiction to opiates started when I was 17 and gradually destroyed my life over the next 5 years.

Kratom has more beneficial medical purposes and actually saves lives.  It helps with anxiety, depression, pain and energy.  I have too wonder why the government would not want to study this?? Thousands of people have successfully taken this and been able to stop taking harmful pain medications!  Pain medications such as opiates are prescribed to thousands and thousands of people. Thousands and thousands of people OD on it every year!!  So DEA if you are truly looking out for the best interest of the people and whats \"good\" for us, why haven't you stopped the use of opiates?  Kratom is a safe alternative that has given people their life back! Back from mental illnesses and from deadly opiates. Yet before you even research it and look into it, you want to put it on a list that makes it un-researchable. I have used this to help with my anxiety! I do not use everyday nor have I ever felt the need to. I do not feel \"high\" when i use it or intoxicated like alchol.

Likewise, individuals suffering from chronic pain should not be forced to use prescription medicines they are not comfortable with, putting them at risk for the same opiate addiction. There is no reason to schedule 1 Kratom, other than the money pharmaceutical companies will lose when patients stop buying their highly addictive drugs.

I have a college education along with over 12 years in the financial services industry. I am a responsible kratom user, and I have been using kratom for over 7 years now. To this day I have never had one bad experience or adverse reaction with this natural plant. I make sure I only buy from online vendors who are responsible & sell quality product. What lead me to kratom was years of being on an emotional rollercoaster filled with anti-depressants & being broke from all the Dr. visit co-pays filled with high dollar prescriptions pills that offered no relief. Middle class Americans cannot afford expensive medical expenses. So after being sick and tired of jumping from one anti-depressant to another every few months, visiting another new Dr. full of disappointment, and tired of having to spend money on co-pays with expensive prescription, I decided to do a lot of researching online for something all natural and inexpensive. I received my first supply of kratom, I never turned back. I went full steam ahead with motivation, a sense of balance, and thriving in life to my full potential. \n\nI am not a criminal, I am not a junkie, I do not get high off kratom, I do not abuse kratom, it is not the dangerous plant that the media makes it out to be. Unfortunately , head shops and dirty marketing have ruined kratoms' name. Kratom is not a legal high, it is not spice , it is a natural , safe & very effect plant for millions of people. I defiantly feel regulations should be placed on kratom such as age restrictions and only allowing kratom to be sold online by trusted vendors, but not making it illegal all together. Yes there are irresponsible vendors & users, however that will be with any product sold anywhere. More people die from cold medicine , Tylenol, alcohol , & tobacco combined, but yet these products are legal, however they are now restricted. The DEA & the Kratom community have one thing in common and that is to keep junk kratom out of the publics hands. Keeping kratom from head shops where junk anything along with kratom is sold is a great start. Allow responsible users the chance to report irresponsible vendors would be helpful.\n\n Kratom has been used for thousands of years with no threat to humans. In fact, you cannot find one verified , reliable case of a death caused solely by Kratom toxicity. The only published kratom deaths are those in which the individuals ingested other substances in combinations with kratom, however kratom got the blame. We cant generalize a few incorrect stories to reflect the positive power this plant has on millions of individuals. \n\nResponsible kratom users rely on this plant on a daily basis to help maintain a healthy life. I can vouch for kratom enhancing my life. A son & daughter got their mother back, a company got one of the top employees in their company, a mother got her daughter back and a woman got the best of me and we have been happily together for over 2 years now,  Users of kratom rely on it to manage various conditions such as pain, depression, anxiety, skin disorders and remedies for opiate or alcohol addiction. Please do not make kratom illegal, it has given so many peoples lives back, and quality of life is and always will be priceless.\n\nThank you for allowing me to share my story and thank you for taking the time to read it. \n\n\nSincerely, \n\nJessica Dennis","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1612","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jessica Dennis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please as a veteran I am partial to this because if it is something that can help vets deal with ptsd than we cannot possibly imagine making it illegal without and information on it being harmful.

I want to start out by saying that I think this substance should be legal. However, in the interest of helping the DEA truly understand what it is they are dealing with here, for what it's worth, I will be honest about my experience and not sugar coat it.\n\nI am altogether a happier, more productive member of society because of this substance. I have had issues with depression, anxiety, and ADD for my whole life and Kratom gives me a sense of focus and well-being that has allowed me to produce some of my finest work in both my job and in my personal artistic life. It helps me remove myself from the anxious, sometimes obsessive thoughts I often experience and focus on the task at hand. I am often more social and generally more optimistic about life when I'm on it. I honestly feel if I had discovered it as a younger man, the darker times I have experienced would have been brightened somewhat and could have prevented me from falling into some of my deepest ruts. I may have even gone to a better college (as my depression and lack of focus held me back) and would have a better job today. In this regard, I regret not finding it sooner.\n\nThat said, as a 29 year old in the highly competitive entertainment industry (I work as a creative treatment bidder working in commercials) I'm doing pretty well for myself and I do owe some of that success to Kratom. My employers are very satisfied with my work (recently got a a significant raise after 8 months on the job) and (as far as I know) me as a person. \n\nI should note that as a younger man, I was put on many different medications. Overall, this has probably worked better than any of them. \n\nNow, for the downside. Some people say it's not addictive - that's simply not true. At least for me. Then again, I have an addictive personality to begin with, so bare that in mind. Being someone who has gravitated towards substances since I was young (alcohol, marijuana, legally obtained prescription drugs), I do think in some ways I've used Kratom as a crutch. Perhaps without it I would be forced to confront my demons head on. On the other hand, I might be in the clutches of something much more dangerous - something that was a net drain on my work and my health.\n\nSide effects? Sometimes nausea (but depends on the brand, good quality Kratom it's usually not a problem) and if you do too much (which I avoid) you can get a little foggy.\n\nThe truth is, I wish I didn't have rely on Kratom as much as I do, but the fact of the matter is, other than the cost, I can't see many areas of my life where it's really harmed it. It does have some downsides (addiction, cost, avoiding getting to the root of problems) but you know what? I'm a healthy as a horse (as far as I know) and I contribute to society in a meaningful way. And on the whole, Kratom has helped that, not harmed it. I do believe that people should be allowed to use this substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17525","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Max Fisher","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 48 year old mother, wife, Omi and jewelry designer!\nI am using Kratom for menopausal issues and it has enabled me to not be on any pharmaceuticals and have a normal life! \nThis product is necessary and needs to be studied , NOT labeled as a drug like pain pills!\nStop this nonsense, this natural leaf is amazing and aides so many issues in society! \nNo, I do not drink nor do I take any type of drug...Kratom as a tea has made my life as it should be and I would appreciate you not taking it away so I won't have to go on traditional pharmaceuticals, and become unwell with all the serious side effects ....Kratom has NO side effects of any kind! \nJosie","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3885","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Josie Lockwood","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I listened to the Joe Rogan podcast.

I don't know how to make this any more clear or profound other stories I've heard over the past month or so with regards to how Kratom has saved thousands upon thousands of Americans from agonizing pain, depression, PTSD, social anxiety, a kond most importantly the fact that it has helped so many scores of people overcome their dependency to powerful addictions to heroin or other opioids. My story with Kratom begins on the night of September 23rd 2013, when I became a victim of violent crime and my life was changed forever. I was stabbed multiple times and left to bleed to death. I received stab wounds to my chest, femur, and the most devastating of all the wounds, a severe laceration to my left forearm which nearly amputated my arm and severed my Radial nerve. I lost six pints of blood and had to be placed on a ventilator for several days due to the damage done when the knife pierced my lungs. In the following weeks once being released from ICU, I underwent 4 long nerve graft surgeries and had appliances implanted in my arm in an attempt to regain some use of my left hand. My recovery was slow and painful and I was prescribed some of the most powerful killers available to try and combat the pain that was at times unbearable. I was diagnosed with RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy) and CRPS (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome). I have since been diagnosed with PTSD as well. I was on 60mg of Oxycodone 3 times daily and 300mg of Gabapentin twice a day. These drugs completely wiped me out and I was unable to function at all. I applied for Disability Benefits because I knew I would never be a productive member of society with the drugs I had to take to thwart the agonizing and debilitating pain. I joined an RSD/CRPS support group on the internet made up of mostly war veterans and wounded warriors. They suggested that I try Kratom to fight pain. Of course I was skeptical about there being something natural, non addictive, and safe that would even begin to fight the the pain that powerful narcotics hardly touch. Well after trying Kratom once I was a believer. I immediately began feeling the pain subside and my fog that I lived in was lifted. It gave me energy which motivated me to go full throttle on my rehabilitation and physical therapy. In just weeks I had my life back. During my recovery on narcotics I began a non existent member of my family and was unable to provide my children which often left me feeling hopeless and borderline suicidal. After discovering Kratom I returned to being the Father my children deserved. I even able to go back to work and abandoned my quest for Disability Benefits. When the DEA announced its intent ban Kratom I was devastated and mostly terrified of what would become of me without the one and only treatment that worked and continued to work.   I didn't know what to do but cry and reach out to my support group for support. I am an example of just one of many thousands of people whose lives have been improved and saved by Kratom. Taking this much needed medicine from us would lead to devastating results. The number of accidental overdoses skyrocket, and the nation's opioid epidemic would get even more out of control. I would be the very dark category of sufferers that wouldn't have anywhere turn. Please reconsider your intent to ban this truly life saving plant and please consider all the lives and families that would be adversely affected by this decision. I appreciate the opportunity the DEA has given myself and so many others to let our voices be heard. Please let us keep our quality of life. #IamKratom #Kratomsaveslives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0113","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Boineau","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, I have been using Kratom occasionally over the last year and a half.

I have never had a long-term job because either I would be unable to withstand the pain associated with sitting or standing for long periods of time, or my general emotional instability would cause me to go home and cry and contemplate suicide.\n\nKratom gave me the ability to be productive. Kratom helped numb the pain (although, not enough for my worst job), stabilize my mood, and give me motivation. It reduced social anxiety, gave me a second wind without the heart-bumping effects of an energy drink. Anecdotally, the side effects included: lowering of natural libido (which as a religious man, I didn't mind) and trouble sleeping for a few days after quitting from regular use.\n\nNo other prescribed, OTC, or 'natural' medicine has been able to improve my life in such a way (including therapy). Since hearing of the \"impending\" ban, I decided to quit. Since then, all my previous symptoms have returned causing me to go in rut, without work, without productivity, without any motivation to improve myself. \n\nI am awaiting to hear what the DEA is planning on doing. Of course I think it is a crazy and dangerous move that the DEA wants to make this plant Schedule 1 of all things.

Kratom has helped many with anxiety, depression, ptsd, pain, and addiction. The two alkaloids in question are being investigated for their properties to manage pain without the dangerous side effects and overdose risk of currently available pharmaceutical pain pills -- Some of these research compounds are known as MGM-9, MGM-15, MGM-16, PZM21, and Oliceridine which is in phase III clinical trials. Scheduling the plant would put a halt on this scientific research in the near term.\n\nKratom was banned in Alabama on May 10, 2016. From that month to the next, overdoses on opiates both FDA approved and illicit doubled:\n\n\"Birmingham Fire and Rescue Service responded to 101 overdoses last month alone, said Capt. Bryan Harrell.

At the time, the government was levying taxes from users and shops involved in the opium trade. Because of the increasing opium costs, many users were switching to kratom to manage their withdrawal symptoms. However, the launch of the Greater East Asia War in 1942 and declining revenues from the opium trade pushed the Thai government into action to curb and suppress competition in the opium market by making kratom illegal.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitragyna_speciosa&oldid=732653479 \n\nSo, here we are again.

Ive held this job for 17 years. I have had numerous scenarios in which previously high-functioning, stable clients have been in a car accident or suffered a sports injury, underwent surgery, and became addicted to painkillers. One 23-year-old boy was a high-spirited and positive leader in his community, one was a responsible and kind working mom with two young boys. Both clients could not seem to wean themselves off of their painkillers, dispite enormous efforts. They both ended up as heroin addicts. Neither client had a history of any drug use. The 23-year-old became homeless and isolated before finally managing to get clean 8 years later. The single mom lost custody of her children as well as her corporate career.  \n\n\nAddiction to drugs, whether legal or illegal, has been something Ive always seen in less people around me that tend to be more emotionally troubled, insecure, or reckless. Ive found it very troubling to see so many clients that are mature, stable, and thoughtful suddenly find themselves addicted to drugs. In every scenario involving clients, friends, and relatives, the original source of addiction is always prescription drugs. I have two teenagers and have spent the past few years reading extensively to understand whats happening. Nearly every study, every article, and every investigation leads back to prescription drugs. People dont see the addiction happening until its too late, or theyre simply unable to tolerate the withdrawals. In my opinion, the healthcare system and the pharmaceutical companies are solely responsible for this phenomenon. We need the support of the DEA in order for a change to be made at the level of the healthcare system and the pharmaceutical companies. \n\n\nWe need a solution to the problem of addiction to painkillers, and from the research Ive been doing, Kratom provides that solution. It is irresponsible and senseless to create a debilitating nationwide problem, let it get so wildly out of hand among the highest-functioning population in our country, and threaten to forbid the only viable solution that exists.\n\n\nAccording to research, enough painkillers were prescribed by American doctors during one month in 2010 to medicate every American around the clock for an entire month (for the full article, click here: www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/08/19/the-heroin-epidemic-in-9-graphs)\n\n\nDoctors are actively promoting an addiction epidemic which causes people like my clients to become addicted to painkillers, run out of refills, are refused more refills by their doctor, and turn to heroin because its easy to get. For a 1-hour program on a sample US town suffering such an epidemic, see Anthony Bourdains Parts Unknown Season 4, Episode 7: Heroin in Small-Town USA. \n\n\nI can only assume the doctors and pharmaceutical companies have their own agendas that obscure their ability to care about the people whose lives are being ruined. Kratom is the only solution I can see that actually works. Given that the healthcare workers and pharmaceutical companies dont seem intent on solving the problem at the source, addicted patients need a way to get their addiction under control. Im asking that you please do not make this plant-based, and very promising solution illegal as we have no other options and cannot fight this epidemic if you cut off the only treatment that works. The DEA has the power to help our addiction problem. Please do not put Kratom on the list of Schedule 1 controlled substances. \n\nSincerely,\n\nErika Bugbee","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21212","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Erika Bugbee","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 43 yo mother and fiancee.  I am very against the attempted banning of kratom to schedule 1, 2, 3 or any ban whatsoever; the only thing I would support are  rules  making kratom  for adults 18 or over.  I have rheumatoid arthritis, A.D.D., IBS,  scoliosis,  bipolar,  depression and endometriosis.  For decades the endo had me losing countless jobs from the pain,  then when I got Rheumatoid Arthritis in 2010, it progressed and cost me tons of jobs,  ultimately leaving me bedridden.  My son had to do almost everything for me.  We got evicted many times as I would lose jobs due to pain etc.,  and wouldn't be able to pay rent.  \n\nWhen I found kratom  in 2014,  it literally gave me my life back.  I now work over 40 hours a week in a factory  running heavy presses and driving forklifts,  (I utilize kratom while on the job and have NEVER had any accidents via forklift or otherwise),  my ability to eat almost anything is back to pre IBS levels,  I can hike,  jog,  exercise, lift weights,  camp,  etc etc,  when I was bedridden and incapable of opening bags or doors,  get myself dressed,  etc.  My depression is just gone,  I am beyond optimistic.  Because of kratom  the old me is back fully; the hard working , happy,  driven,  joyful and pain free me.  Please don't take this coffee plant away.  I can't stomach the idea of losing my job,  my mobility,  the joy of life I feel or another home again.  Kratom does not make me high or mimic heroin or cocaine, it can't be overdosed on,......  Technically hundreds of thousands die yearly from rx pain killers.  There have been zero deaths from kratom alone.  Those who did unfortunately pass had other toxins in their systems.  Kratom alone does not harm.  Period.  Banning kratom is as silly as banning coffee,  tea,  soda,  chocolate or bacon.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5290","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Rohr","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern;  Through many years of treatment, medication, and suffering from rheumatoid arthritis I have finally found something without side effects, limiting effect/dangerous effects I have finally found something that truly helps help live my life.

My doctor informed me I would be on pain medication for the rest of my life. I have tried back injections, steroids, oxycodone (15mg tablets prescribed 6 times a day), muscle relaxers, etc. I took these for the better part of a year. Yes I was addicted to them (obviously) and aside from pain relieving effects which by the way make you really high, they also have serious mental affects as well. I was extremely short tempered and it could have easily cost me my marriage however it did not. I found Kratom a short time later and decided I wanted to make the switch. I told my doctor I did not want to be on them any more and wanted to try a natural remedy for my pain. I was told that they could put me on smaller dosages (obviously not acknowledging that it wouldn't matter what dosage I was on it would still impact my attitude). I decided to stop taking them cold turkey because well enough is enough. I have been using Kratom daily in a small/medium dosage (3-4mg twice a day) to control the pain. Other than the pain relieving effects I have absolutely no other impact neither mental nor physical. I do not get high on Kratom (I don't even think it's possible), like the Oxycodone used to make me, I do not get irritable taking Kratom. It has been an all around win for my family and I and the others who I have talked to which take Kratom. I implore the powers that be to act rationally. If you want to invest real medical dollars into doing an unbiased study on a natural herbal remedy then do so and then make a decision based on unbiased data.

I'm  44.year old suicide survivor. On Jan 17th 2016 this year I was a complete mess. I was on antidepressants for over 16 years and anxiety meds ( they me feel like an emotionless walking dead) I was also injured working a 20 year job taking care of the most profoundly disabled people that couldn't walk or talk so they depended on me and my 21 staff to take care if all their daily needs. The agency I grew up in from the age of 18 to 39 decided I wasn't able to continue to provide the physical care they needed and terminated my job. I gave them my back and they took my world and turned it upside down. I lost my identity because that's all I knew was talking care of my 12 residents that I considered my family. I ran the home and worked my way up to becoming the top paid supervisor of the hardest home in the agency ( over 1000 employees) anyways I was put on Vicodins and given 9 shots every 2 months to get through my day. This went on for a couple years. I seen I was depending more and more on pain pills to function and asked the dr to help me find a different way to function. He told me about a suboxone program and I never head of it but trusted him so I ended up on 1 and 1/2 strip's a day of suboxone not realizing it was synthetic herion and became a daily cycle of taking it just to get though my day. It was a 3 year rollercoaster taking a mix of pills and strips that I lost my mind and tried to OD. I don't remember that night but I remember being on the other side trying to fight to get back to my girls. They never left my side. I was on life support for  a week and considered brain dead or a vegetable. Well I was on the other side begging for a second chance and my kids said I sat straight up in bed and the Dr's called me a one of a kind miracle. I vowed to never let pharmaceuticals control my mind and body ever again and by fate I came across an alternative way to get my life back without suffering. Its been 10 months that I found an alternative way to live by using a beautiful leaf that helps me emotionally, physically, and mentally be who I'm supposed to be. My journey in my second chance has been amazing and the thought of losing kratom scares the hell out of me. I will never go back to being under the pharmaceutical spell. Please feel free to share my story, I just didn't know how to put it in words. I need Kratom..It saved my life. Much love to you and your amazing team.

I discovered it when I was trying to find an alternative to other analgesics, which were either inadequate in helping my arthritis pain, or presenting side effects which I found intolerable. Analgesics such as Tylenol, ibuprofen, and naprosyn, pr  those that were as powerful as oxycodone and hydrocodone. The opiates were, of course, quite adequate in their analgesic effects, but I knew that long-term use was not an ideal situation to find myself in. \n  I'm almost 65 years old. If I had been using opiates since 2007, I'm quite certain that the dosage would by now have become unsustainable for my overall health as well as for decreasing effectiveness. I have essentially been using the same dosage now as I did when I first started using kratom, with no decrease in effectiveness nor in its negative effects on my overall health. Some days, of course, are worse than others, but a slight increase in dosage is quite adequate and I have no fear that my overall use will increase on a day-to-day basis.

I  have permanent nerve damage in my left leg. My normal pain level is a 5, but on any given day I wake up at a 9. I am 44 years old. I was under the care of a pain management doctor for several years, and the opiate pain killers did good job of getting me through the day, but the side effects were just too much. On a good day, I couldn't stop taking the medications because of how quickly the debilitating acute withdrawals settle in. I was stuck. \n\nI managed through opiate withdrawals, but found that my ability to help around the house, sit in a chair, and go to work had been significantly diminished. My head was straight, but I was constantly reminded how broken my body is. I was participating in a pain suffers' support group and learned about Kratom. \n\nI take a small amount of Kratom (1 teaspoon) in the morning and 1/2 teaspoon in the afternoon. My head is straight, and my body doesn't hurt as much. Its not as effective as opiates, but I stopped thinking about going back to the pain management doctor. I have been taking it for several months now and I haven't built a tolerance, and when I have a good day, I don't have to keep taking it. There are no withdrawals to be had. I can do chores around the house, and I haven't missed a day of work since. \n\nI understand that some people may abuse this, but some people will abuse anything. People sniff glue and gasoline. Take away one product and they will just find another. People like me should not be punished because of the irresponsible acts of a small few. \n\nIf you make Kratom illegal, I will have no choice but to return to pain management and opiate pain relievers. I do not want to go back there, but I must manage my pain to live my life. Kratom hasn't affected my thinking, my bowels, or my ability to feel emotion like opiates do. \n\nI have opted to include my name and not submit anonymously so you can check out my story or contact me for additional details. I am a law abiding citizen, and if it is outlawed, I will dispose of what I have, so I am not worried about you knowing who I am. \n\nPlease reconsider your position on making this a schedule 1 narcotic.

If you choose to make Kratom illegal, the decision will unnecessarily kill some people and criminalize others while serving no positive purpose, and will also end up costing taxpayers lots of money.

Generalized anxiety and ADHD are just 2 of them.  The third and most debilitating was the skin picking (OCD like) disorder that I suffered through for 15-20 years of my life.\n   \n      For over FIFTEEN YEARS I had a severe acne skin picking disorder from my teenage years through my mid 30s.  I was physically unable to leave my face alone.  And of course I tried many different treatments including 3 rounds of Acutane.  I would squeeze and pick at my acne until my face was permanently full of bloody, scabbed, and puss filled legions, permanently.   I attempted to cover it all up with makeup, which just made it that much worse (gross) and umm yeah, I'm a guy....   If you saw what I looked like or had any idea of how I suffered you would feel for me, you really really really would.  I was a recluse, a hermit, I could never look anybody in the face.   It was atrocious.  I was suicidal.   \n\n        In 2008 I spent a year in specialized intensive behavioral therapy to rid me of my living hell,  (which cost 10 thousand dollars) and tried numerous different types of RX medications and drugs including Paxil, Prozac, Effexor, Xanax, Clonazepam, Valium, alcohol and marijuana all in attempt to rid me of this behavior; yet it was all in vain.  That was until I found Kratom.\n\n       Not only did my use of Kratom enable me to COMPLETELY STOP my skin picking disorder, it also rid me of the depression and anxiety that went along with it.  It was literally a blessing from G-d.  Kratom literally saved my life.  Both psychologically and physically.  \n\n      I was able to stop using the Kratom over the course of 3 weeks with NO withdrawal symptoms.  \n\n      Currently I use Kratom on and off to combat my ADD.  It enables me to focus and concentrate on both menial and complex tasks in a way similarly to caffeine (which I cannot handle).   I am astonished that drugs like Ritalin , and Adderall are Marijuana (a truly inebriating substance) are even legal to prescribe when there is a natural alternative for these and MANY OTHER disorders with no side effects  \n\n     Thank you so much listening.

The only reason the DEA wants to make it illegal is because it is a threat to big pharma. The government wants people to stay hooked up their prescriptions. This is a sad, sad country that we live in. And if kratom becomes illegal, I will have to go on disability, as I am sure many others will, because our chronic pain will be unbearable and our mental disorders will run rapid. And I refuse, just like many others, to go on prescription opiates for my pain or anti-depressants for my mental disorder, because they are DANGEROUS and RISKY to our physical and mental health. KRATOM IS NOT. I have already begun filling out the paperwork for my disability assistance just in case. If the DEA makes kratom illegal, there will be thousands and thousands more people going on disability, using the tax payers money, because the government will not allow us to use mother earth's plant kratom that gives us all the ability to live a happy and productive life. Shame on the DEA.

For several of those years, I was prescribed prescription pain medicine to help me manage the pain. After an extended period of time, I developed an addiction to these pain medications. My doctors had a lifelong plan to steadily increase my dosage to continue managing the pain, but the addiction eventually made me a problem for society. I saw multiple physicians and bought even more of the medications on the street. It was never enough and I no longer could engage normally in society. I got in car accidents, lied to everyone I know, and became a strain on the society I love so much. Managing my pain and addiction could at times even replace my duties as a father in terms of priority.  Eventually, I checked myself into a rehabilitation facility. I got off the opiates for a while, but the chronic pain persisted, which started a cycle of getting on and off the medication. I saw no happy ending to my problems. That is, until I discovered kratom. Since being introduced to kratom, I have been managing my pain without the horrific side effects of prescription painkillers. I am able to control my pain without having to constantly take more, and when I am between doses I do not crave the substance to the point of being willing to forego the more important aspects of my life in favor of getting more of it. It is truly the solution to my problems. I have become a better father and a worthwhile member of society thanks to kratom. I'm back in school and maintaining employment without any issues. If kratom is to be taken out of my life, I worry about the need to return to prescription medications, which would again make me a strain on society. It is a natural solution to the biggest problem of my life, and I pray that I will not be forced to return to the nightmarish cycle that ruined my life when I did not have kratom to help me. Please consider the enormous benefits of kratom, because they far outweigh any problems it causes, and for my part I can say that I have found no problems caused by kratom. The problems and side effects of prescription pain medications are too numerous to list, and I dread the prospect of life without the benefits of kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19689","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Clayton Bainbridge","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't ban Kratom!

I was diagnosed when I was in my mid 30s after a long battle woking alongside doctors to determine what was wrong. In my younger years I was dx'd with PTSD, uterine cancer and melanoma as well as having 6 surgeries for endometriosis. My pain management doctor was diligently working to help me survive and work through my day. I've worked in Healthcare for 15 years suffered with pain throughout my day. I had a plethera of medications Which included 10 different daily meds as well as biweekly receiving 20 to 30 nerve injections in my back, neck, and head. Not taking my pain away but numbing the pain and spasms slightly which are consistent, and radiating. My doctors titrated my meds multiple times due to the different compications from taking these particular meds which while necessary it created pain syndromes. I was introduced to kratom about 2 yrs ago and since then while working with my doctors I have completely stopped taking my nerve meds, blood pressure, anti-depressants, ant-anxiety, insomnia, indegestion, the list of diagnosis continued to increase the more I took those meds. After finding Kratom I have a life again with functionality.  This one herbal remedy was able to replace all of those expensive meds and medical costs in general.I am heathier I'm more productive in my life now.  For so many many years I relied highly on my physicians for help. Kratom which I take only 2 small doses each day is effective in reducing my pain.

I am a 35yr old mother. I am on disability because severe depression and I have really bad seizures due to an anxiety disorder. It's because I was seriously abused growing up mentally, sexually, and physically. I also injured my back when I was younger. I have a herniated disc L5, S1 also sciatica problems as well. Anyway I was prescribed by a pain management dr. A lot of pain pills. Roxicodone, and oxycodone even methadone for my pain. Well I happened to like pain pills way to much! I noticed it helped not only my pain but my depression. At least that's what I thought! In the end I became a huge addict for several years, and got more depressed than ever, even attempting suicide several times! The end of it for me was when I literally died from a methadone overdose, and my mom found me with brown liquid coming out from my lungs! I realized I needed help! I got the help I needed but I realized my back was in worse shape than I thought. It would go out for 3 weeks at a time, and it didn't take much for it to go out. I realized that I needed something for my pain, but obviously not pain pills. So about 3yrs ago I found kratom. I did a lot of research and I thought this could really help me! Boy was I right, you don't get any kind of high like pain pills, just a sense of well being, and pain free!!! I also was able to get off of my anxiety meds, and my sleeping meds! I also can see there is a serious epidemic right now with people dying everyday from heroin overdoses, and I think banning this will only make that number rise! So please hear us!!!

This plant is beneficial to millions of people and has no legitimate need for schedule 1. It had never directly been linked to the death of anyone unlike the medicines and opiates pushed by the pharma companies and lobbyist. This fed action must not go forward. Non-prescription natural remedies must remain legal for those of society who do not want to rely exclusively on lab created drugs. True it can have euphoric qualities but so does alcohol, tobacco, and an entire array pharmaceutical drugs. The only regulation that is needed is that an individual must be 18 years old to purchase. I stress again, this overstep by the DEA and the call for an \"emergency scheduling\" screams lobbyist influence. The DEA must present to the public legitimate reason for the need to schedule this natural remedy drug. It is a direct threat to the rights of Americans who before this executive action were not criminals. These drugs, Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, are not what is consumed. The plant is called KRATOM and is taken as a whole, not broken down into chemical substances. The need by the DEA to refer to kratom this way is dishonest to the citizenry who may not be familiar with these substances by this name and are tricked into believing that these chemicals, \"Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine\" are anything other than just kratom plant leaf.

Kratom takes the edge off of the withdrawal experience, just a little; however, it is very helpful during the later occurring post-acute withdrawal, which is when I was at my weakest.  Maybe I could've done it without kratom, but it definitely would've been much harder.  \n\nI also suffer from an anxiety disorder.

His pain started when he was 18.  Doctors have never pin pointed the cause of his pain.  He has a cyst in his spinal column in his lower back and a couple of bulging disks in his neck.   Doctors swear the cyst is not the cause of his pain and refuse to look into any options of removing the disk.  When he was 20 his neurologist stopped seeing him and referred him to a pain management specialist.  We were exited to see the pain management specialist.  We were naive and thought they would provide alternatives to pain meds.  In the beginning he had a wonderful PA who was interested in finding the cause of his pain.  Each appointment she had a new plan and more information on his condition while helping him control his pain without drugs.  Or limited drugs.  Physical therapy, exercises to strengthen the muscles in his back, burning the nerves, and even spinal blocks. \n  Then one day this PA was gone and he was assigned a new PA.  Burning the nerves continued every 6 months depending on how quickly the nerves grew back.  This helped a little, but not enough.  Then came the Oxycontin.  As he built up a tolerance to the Oxy he dosage was increased.  He could sleep because of the pain.  Then came drugs for night time use.  I wish I could remember the name of the drug that cost him $500.00 a month after his insurance.  After begging his PA to change his night time medicine he was prescribed Morphine.  Morphine!  5 years later this 25 year old programmer working in the Health Care industry making $80,000 per year is taking 120 mg of Oxycontin and 30 mg of morphine everyday.  He notices when his misses his appointment with his PA and he is out of meds he goes through withdrawals.  Cold sweats, flu symptoms, horrific pain not related to his back problems, and convulsions.  We realized he was an addict.  This intelligent, wonderful, good kid with a promising future as a programmer was a drug addict.  He DIDN'T do drugs when he was a kid.  He DIDN'T shoot up with heroine or meth, but yet he was going through the same withdrawals as a damned heroine addict!!!!  My son WAS a drug addict.  An addict created by a PA who is licensed to prescribe LEGAL drugs to treat his pain.  We started researching other options for pain management and found cannabis was a wonderful and effective way to manage his pain.  With specific strains he could control his pain and function better than when he was on the Oxy.  He let his PA know he was trying to reduce his intake of Oxy while using Cannabis.  His PA ignored the monthly drug test when then came up positive for THC and then suddenly he receives a letter in the mail telling him he has been kicked out of the pain clinic because of the THC.  No mention of helping him detox from the medications they made him dependent on.  Just kicked him to the curb and said seeya!  Have a good life.  Sorry we turned you into and addict.  Heroine is cheap become a junkie.   This is how we felt.   Now what?   Now the withdrawals start.  He thought his symptoms were bad when he still had Opiods in his system.  That was nothing compared to what was to come. Trying to control the pain AND the withdrawals with Cannabis.  Contrary to what I have read the Cannabis is not great for Opiod withdrawal.  We research how to detox at home and the same thing came up over and over again.  Kratom.  At this point what did we have to lose?  He was already on his way to losing his job and everything he had worked so hard for.  We did not want him to lose his life to possible heroin use. Mix it with water and drink it as a tea.  09/13/2016 was when I ordered my first /batch of Kratom online.  At this point he still had some Opiods in his system.  He was trying the spread out the doses to minimize the withdrawal symptoms.  And then I get a call at work on 09/17/2016.  His withdrawals are bad.  He hurts so bad he wants to rip the skin off of his body, he is crying curled up in a ball in pain and told me he is willing to do almost anything to get what he needs to make the pain go away.  The Kratom had not arrived.  I got online to see what I could find and that is when I realize the DEA is planning on banning Kratom.  I cannot get what I need to help my son.  I went from smoke shop to smoke shop buying every gram of Kratom I could.  I took what I had to my son and watched in terror as he drank the tea praying this was going to be the solution.  It worked!  I saw the convulsions subside.  We started with small amounts at first.  Unsure of how much was needed and not wanting to over do it.  I saw his sweats stop and his withdrawal pain subside a little.  He is now clean and moved to Colorado where he can manage his pain with Cannabis. Please DO NOT ban this.  It helped my son overcome Opiod addiction. Don't take this option away from other people.  He could not have done it without Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5702","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tiffiny Malo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I expect the DEA to perform due diligence when considering any action, including reviewing evidence and opinions from within other government sources.

Kratom has been very effective at helping me manage my conditions without the horrible side effects and without having to keep increasing the amount needed.  2 teaspoons as a tea are all I need for the whole day.  It also does not make me feel like I'm in a drug fog like pharmaceuticals do.  This is incredibly important as I am a full time care giver to my mom who has moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease.  Kratom has allowed me to function and keep up with the physical and emotional demands that come along with Alzheimer's. I am 52 years old.  Kratom does not produce a high like some are trying to suggest.  It simply let's me function, For my moms well being and makes it possible for me to keep her home instead of a nursing home.  Please do not schedule this plant as a dangerous drug.  It is a plant that makes a great herbal supplement , like many others that people have used to take care of themselves.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8475","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carla Valecko","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The so-called war on drugs is really better understood as a war on consciousness and which maintains, supposedly in the interests of society, that we as adults do not have the right or maturity to make sovereign decisions about our own consciousness and about the states of consciousness we wish to explore and embrace. This extraordinary imposition on adult cognitive liberty is justified by the idea that our brain activity, disturbed by drugs, will adversely impact our behavior towards others. Yet anyone who pauses to think seriously for even a moment must realize that we already have adequate laws that govern adverse behavior towards others and that the real purpose of the war on drugs must therefore be to bear down on consciousness itself.\n\nIt is interesting to note that our society has no objection to altering consciousness per se. On the contrary many consciousness-altering drugs, such as Prozac, Seroxat, Ritalin and alcohol, are either massively over-prescribed or freely available today, and make huge fortunes for their manufacturers, but remain entirely legal despite causing obvious harms. Could this be because such legal drugs do not alter consciousness in ways that threaten the monopolistic dominance of the alert problem-solving state of consciousness, while a good number of illegal drugs, such as cannabis, LSD, DMT and psilocybin do?\n\nI have tried Kratom several times & it's effects on consciousness were harmless to me & others around me.  To classify Kratom as a \"Schedule 1\" drug is asinine & a step in the wrong direction.  End the war on consciousness & please make a rational decision when it comes to keeping Kratom a legal substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13992","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathan Merwin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom an akloid got me off all my prescription drugs and Cures all my pain medications including oxycodone and hydcodrone and half my blood pressure.

I'm writing this letter to explain how Kratom has helped my life! I have been using Kratom for almost 2 years. When I was 20 years old I had an accident from semi driving. I ruptured 2 discs in my low back, 3 bulging discs, & 3 damaged discs in my neck. That started a long life of pain medication use. I went through years of on and off physical therapy, and epidural injections. I finally had an anterior fusion in my neck 2 years ago, but by that point, I'd been using pain medication for over 15 years! And then I found Kratom! I still have pain, but have not used pain medication since using Kratom. It helps me with pain relief tremendously! I am married, and a father of 2. I work 6 days a week, usually 55-60 hrs a week. Something I know I could never accomplish without Kratom. I've never been high, stoned, or tripped on Kratom. It's not a dangerous drug in my eyes. I have more of a chance of harming myself from the chewing tobacco I use, and I can pick that up at any store across America. Same goes for beer, whiskey, or any other type of alcohol, even though I do not drink. I'm asking please, do not ban this life saving plant. It has changed my life for the better, along with many others.

I suffer from a variety of chronic diseases including type II diabetes, interstitial cystitis of the bladder, gout, diabetic neuropathy,  chronic kidney disease, arthritis, and acute back pain. Four of these conditions cause chronic pain. I was introduced to kratom approximately four months ago by a friend who was successfully treating her post surgical pain. Like my friend, I find kratom gives me very significant relief from the interstitial cystitis, arthritis pain, the pain from the diabetic neuropathy, and the acute lower back pain I experience. Once I started taking kratom I soon discovered it also lowers my blood glucose levels by 20 to 30 points from what I would expect given the insulin dosage I take and the carbohydrates I consume.\n\nBefore I started using kratom I conducted research, including scientific articles, and anecdotal evidence introduced by other users of kratom. I find uses testify that kratom helps them with anxiety and depression, panic attacks, multiple sources of chronic pain, restless leg syndrome, PTSD, the discomfort of Lyme disease, arthritis, and finally that kratom has been used to treat diabetes in Indonesia for many decades.\n\nIt is true that kratom produces a mild stimulating effect, and also some mild euphoria. These characteristics, I freely admit, make it slightly prone to recreational use. Although kratom may be slightly addictive, physiologically so, anecdotal evidence indicates it is not nearly as addictive as traditional opioids now prescribed to millions of Americans. Despite assertions by the DEA, that there have been several deaths here and abroad due to kratom, almost all of these deaths involve a drug cocktail, where kratom was consumed along with other potentially dangerous drugs, or kratom which has had synthetic chemicals added to it.. Additionally, those who have experienced withdrawal symptoms from kratom report those symptoms as very mild compared to traditional opioid withdrawal symptoms. In fact, many are using kratom to 'kick' a narcotics addiction!\n\nI have read the notice issued by the DEA and find their arguments and assertions specious. To begin with, the DEA states several times that the two primary active ingredients in kratom are opioids, which is true They do bind to the opioid receptors in the brain, which are the same receptors that traditional opioids bind to. However, the most current research indicates this binding is different from traditional opioids, and may be more beneficial.\n\nLet me be blunt. If I, as a credentialed scientist, attended any scientific symposium and presented an argument similar to the rationale and argument presented by the DEA, to schedule kratom as a schedule one drug, I would expect, at best, a cold but polite silence from my audience, and at worst to be laughed off the stage in derision!\n\nI also find it peculiar and upsetting that the DEA has decided that no public hearings, or public comments need be entertained before this action is taken. Apparently they feel no discussion is necessary because they continue to maintain, falsely, that kratom poses an imminent and great danger to the public.\n\nI find it frankly incredible, given the number of deaths caused by traditional narcotics, whether legally or illegally obtained, that Americans who suffer will be deprived of a safer, relatively inexpensive, completely natural and anecdotally, an extremely effective remedy for their various conditions!\n\nAmericans using this natural plant will be criminalized if they continue to use kratom. Those who try to 'stock up' will be treated the same as distributors of dangerous street drugs! I beg you to take action to delay this move by the DEA. Lives are literally at stake. Many addicts will go back to their old narcotics, and overdose deaths will rise.\n\nFinally, I was taught as a researcher to always 'follow the money.' Banning kratom will benefit the big drug companies, who can't profit from a natural cure. I sense their influence behind the DEA in this matter, as do many others!\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7300","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-26T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Natural plants are not regulable by law.

With the opiate crisis in this country, this herb has potential to assist many in overcoming the dependence on opiates/opioids in a safe and natural manner.\n\nI have been using this herbal supplement for over two years to help with Restless Leg Syndrome and major pain issues resulting from neck and back surgeries.  Utilizing this herb has allowed me to be a productive member of society.  I work every day, own a home and vehicles and I am active in our local community.  When I was on five different prescriptions for RLS and pain, I was not able to contribute at all to our family or our community.  I was miserable and had horrendous side effects from the pharmaceutical drugs that required more drugs to counteract the side effects.  After joining  a support group for RLS, it was suggested to try the herb, Kratom.  I was referred to a reputable online store and purchased my powder.  Within 3 months, I was able to end all medications with minimal withdrawal issues.  Just that fact, ending opioids that I had been taking for many years without having major withdrawal is a reason to keep this herb available for public use and further research.\n\nI have found that this herb does not cause any euphoric effects.  It takes away the pain yet leaves one feeling normal.  It has stopped the RLS in a far superior manner than the dopamine agonists and without the side effects.  My blood pressure is back to normal.  I have lost over thirty pounds and hope to lose the last twenty pounds that I had gained while on the prescription drugs.  My overall health has and is excellent.\n\nThis is an herb that has the ability to help many, many people that are trying to get their lives back after having their lives destroyed by pharma and the medical community.    Please do not take this herbal supplement away from the us.  This is a plant that has not caused one drug by itself.  How many deaths are happening daily due to opiates/prescription drugs?  Way too many.  Do not take a supplement away that has the potential to help so many.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2768","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeanette Toombs","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sirs\n\nFor nearly twenty years, I was a daily drinker of alcohol.  My addiction to alcohol progressed to a point where I was losing weeks of time to blackouts.  I'm not proud of this.  I had tried many times to quit drinking unsuccessfully.  AA didn't work for me, nor did anything else I tried.  It was already taking a heavy toll on my health, and I felt helpless to stop.  I heard about kratom and decided to try it.  It completely removed my desire to drink.  I used kratom anytime I felt compelled to drink and in twenty minutes, the desire was gone.  It made quitting drinking, not quite, but almost effortless.  After a year of abstinence from alcohol.  I decided to stop using the kratom.  It was no more difficult to stop using it than it was for me to stop using caffeine.   It has now been 18 months since I've had a drink and six months since I no longer needed  the kratom.  I no longer use this herb, but I worry about all of the people who will not have the same opportunity to help themselves that I had if you place kratom on the schedule 1 list.  If you decide to make the concentrated extracts illegal, that would be a perfectly reasonable decision, but leave the untreated leaves off of the scheduled lists.  It is an herb.  It is safe to use in its natural form.

It has helped me to deal with my aches and pains, it helps to lift my mood when I'm feeling down, and it helps to motivate me in the morning, much like coffee. I have never had ANY negative effects from Kratom in the 2 years that I've used the plant. Not so much as a headache. \n  Every day in America, we have people die of opioid overdose, be it from prescription drugs or Heroin. We do not have people die from Kratom everyday. not even every week, or every month. In fact, there is not 1 case where Kratom, and Kratom alone, has taken a life in the United States. It is actually saving lives, by helping to ease the discomfort of people that are trying to quit opioids. There are thousands of good people that have stopped using opioids, and instead choose to take this NON OPIOID plant, Kratom. If you make Kratom a Schedule 1, what will happen to those good people? Jail? or back to the heroin or prescription drug that is ruining their lives? It would be a terrible injustice if you take this safe and helpful plant away from the people who want it.

I perform my professional responsibilities without interruption.

I would like to express my opposition to the schedulingn of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (AKA \"Kratom\"). I have been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a painful and debilitating, inherited condition. There is no cure for my illness and I have struggled to manage the symptoms throughout my life. About a year ago, Kratom was recommended to me as a possible treatment for pain and other ailments. It allowed me to begin living my life again without strong and addictive controlled substances. Kratom is not any more addictive than caffeine, and I can say from personal experience that using Kratom regularly does not lead to tolderance or a need for increased amounts. It also does not produce a \"high\" like prescription painkillers. Kratom has a mild, relaxing effect that is similar to drinking chamomile tea. Restricting Kratom will undoubtedly block patients with real health concerns from finding alternative treatments to opioids, including myself. Kratom has allowed me to work full-time, care for my child, and function in society. Please do not add the only thing that has truly helped my disorder to the controlled substance list.\n\nThank you,\nLaura","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13540","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I just started using Kratom for knee pain.

I learned about Kratom by doing a google search \"natural way to help with pain.\" When I was 20, I fell and cracked my tailbone and never had it taken care of. I have been in several to moderate pain over the last 19 years. I can not stand for more than several hours without medications. But I have always worked my whole life and will die before I stop working. I have been diagnosed with several different conditions and even had back surgery 2012 to try to relieve some of the nerve damage. It did not help much. I have never used heroin in my life or a needle. And I am not on opiate medication right now. Twice in my life I had to go to the methadone clinic and lie to them about being addicted. This, only so I could manage my pain and continue to work. Both times I left those jobs I quit going to the clinic that week because I'm not addicted. I just suffer from debilitating pain. Opiate pain medication is already nearly impossible to get, and the people who need them will suffer. I'm not on opiates now partly because of Kratom but that doesn't mean I might not need it in the future. Even though I have health conditions that are visible in tests, I still get told I'm too young to be on opiods, or they're not for long term chronic pain. The only reason I use Kratom now is because it is legal. I pray that it stays legal, because I feel it helps me a lot. I also feel it is not a drug that gets people high like other drugs and is not a danger to anyone. Again, I am trying to do all the right things in my life and live sober.

I'm a senior in high school, and prior to finding kratom, I was destroying my life. I started using opiates with my friends and what began as just a little bit of fun turned into an all out dependence. It caused my grades to fall, my athletics to suffer, and my relationship with family and friends became second to my addiction. I was at the lowest point in my life, and then I came across kratom while searching for help with my addiction and decided to give it a try. It was the single best decision I ever made for my own health and wellbeing. I was able to stop taking pills on the first day of eating this plant. It completely rejuvenated me, and not only did it completely eliminate  my withdrawal symptoms, but it also gave a lift to my mood and motivation. I now use kratom as a daily supplement for my depression, and in the few years I've been using it I have never experienced a withdrawal symptom. I now feel that I have complete control of my life again. I don't think I would be alive without this plant, and I certainly would be devastated to see it become a schedule 1 substance because it truly does not deserve that. I know so many people who have been helped in multiple ways, and have never experienced a negative side effect. I pray every day that kratom will remain available for the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are helped by it. I hope my story will help you with your decision.

He googled Kratom and found out what it was and the many people it had helped with their pain. He was amazed at how Kratom helped relieve his pain without the woozy feeling opiates give you and he was able to function normally as well.\nI have had many surgeries including four brain surgeries for Chiari Malformation. I still go to a Pain Mgmt. Doctor who prescribed Percocet for my pain. I'm really afraid of getting addicted to opiates as I've heard and seen people who this happens to. The 1st time I took Kratom, I couldn't believe how it wiped out my pain while keeping my head from getting woozy - I was amazed. \nRecently, I have been having pain in my right knee and was told by my Orthopedic Dr. that I needed knee replacement after he took x-rays. My knee pain is with me all the time, but seems to worsen at night. Two nights in a row, I took one Percocet before I went to bed, but it didn't touch the pain I was having. The following night, I took some Kratom and, once again was amazed, it took my pain away and I could get a good night's sleep.\nI don't take Kratom every day - only when I need it and it relieves the pain and I can function normally. \nI understand that Kratom is all natural - it's from a plant related to the coffee family, and made from its leaves. This is God-made not Man-made and contains no chemicals. After reading many stories of people like me that found Kratom, I don't know why the DEA would want to ban it - it certainly isn't like Heroin or any of the hard-drugs or prescription drugs people get addicted to - it's from a coffee plant. Hope they don't ban coffee next!! There is a war against Opiate Addiction in the US and I feel Kratom would be very helpful to people in pain.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15077","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joy Barby","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to have Krantom legal forever..\n\n  Sincerely, \nKelly B.

I have been in construction for over 40 years.  Besides having my body beat up from that, I also was in a motorcycle crash, horse accident and broke my back.  I sustained a traumatic brain injury from my motorcycle crash, which causes me to have a lack of focus and concentration.  I have pain in most of my body; legs, arms, back, shoulders, neck, wrists, hands, and migraine headaches.  Every time I sustained a different injury, doctors would always prescribe pain medications, to the point of addiction.  Only this past spring through the discovery of kratom tea was I able to find relief of chronic pain, increased focus/concentration, and motivation.  As a natural substance, I have come to believe kratom is beneficial to to me in a way that the medical industry has not.  My fear of placing kratom as a schedule 1 substance will create an underground drug like atmosphere.  This would increase the price and there would be no regulation to it, as there is now as a dietary ingredient...I can only image what would happen to those of us who rely on the natural pain relieving properties of kratom.

I have gone over the literature I could find cited by the opposing side and I think the arguments are weak. Long-term habituation and withdrawal are issues for some, yes, but the withdrawal symptoms are about on par with caffeine or prescription anti-depressant withdrawal.

Of course it IS the pharmaceutical industry's NIGHTMARE to find a drug that deals with chronic pain, social anxiety, insomnia, depression, ADD, amongst many other disorders, as well as the synthetic, damaging chemicals that they have to push to make money. I have been using Kratom the last 3 weeks, taking three days off each week, and I feel like an INFINITELY cleaner, happier person. I have managed to stop taking vyvanse & xanax ENTIRELY after prolonged use of both (a feat that, before now, I NEVER thought possible to do on my own), and have stopped smoking marijuana. I sleep great now, I have energy during the day, I am eating much better, and I am overall significantly happier and FEEL as though I am much closer to being substance-free. I also have not had any desire to drink since consuming Kratom (5 grams a day, 2 in the morning and 3 at night) and haven't consumed alcohol except on Thanksgiving these past 3 weeks either. Krazy...it's as though Kratom makes you subconsciously want to treat your body better... I also have terrible muscle aches pertaining to my rather intense physical anxiety, ALL of which is alleviated by kratom, thus alleviating my desire to take Xanax. Again, amazing.\nI have had NO problem abstaining from using Kratom on my days off as well!! (unlike vyvanse or xanax, which my body typically feels dependent on day by day). Instead, while using Kratom, my sober days feel EVEN better. Honestly. I feel as though I am able to enjoy being substance free for the first time in a long time.\nPlease, please, please keep this substance legal, more regulated if need be (smoke shops use kratom of lesser quality or even with synthetic RC painkillers in it sometimes...super scary, unnecessary stuff. ONLY HIGH QUALITY kratom should be sold to anyone, thus this substance needs more regulation.) I feel like my life is finally about to start a new chapter that doesn't include xanax, vyvanse, or pot, and I am thrilled to find genuine happiness, motivation, and internal peace again. I am very, very happy that I have found Kratom. My list of vices includes weed, xanax, vyvanse, cigs, alcohol, coffee, and kratom; I can honestly tell you that I feel the least guilty about consuming kratom because my body and brain signal to me that it is an overall benign, good drug. And utilizing solely kratom, for the first time in years, I feel as though I can say goodbye to ALL my other vices...This substance has the potential to change people's lives who feel as though they have no option right now. I am serious.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21235","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom this may concern,\n\nKratom has allowed me to avoid taking dangerous anti-anxiety medications like xanax or pain pills like Oxycontin which both kill thousands of American's annually.

I speak for a great number of people when I say that I DO NOT rely on the government to serve as a decision maker in my life in that capacity.

I've yet to hear a single person serving in an official capacity be able to articulate why that is! Perhaps it's time to accept that we simply have no need for a governmental body that criminalizes drugs of any kind.

I understand that there is a problem happening in this country with addiction and that it can be scary to people who don't understand and who's job it is to control the traffic of illegal substances. However, as a recovering addict and long time user of both kratom and opioids in general,  I can say with absolute surety that kratom cannot be compared to or classified alongside opioids.  \n\nI found out about kratom roughly 5-6 years ago via the internet, I had heard about it before but had about ways thought of it as one of the cheap, knock off chemical compounds that are sold as substitute for illicit substances. At that time I was still young and wild so I wasn't going to settle for my less than the real thing. How wrong I was. After suffering the nightmare of addiction for many years and experiencing the consequences of jumping into into a poorly understood warzone,  I finally had smartened up a bit and sought recovery and alternative methods to do so. There I found kratom and to my surprise I found a completely natural and helpful plant that would be the answer to so much suffering. Not only did kratom help me to kick my addiction to opioids,  it also helped with the pain that I had suffered from for so long. Having degenerative disk disease and scoliosis and the pain that accompanied them was a big reason why I started using opioids in the first place. Kratom was a miracle and took care of all the problems simultaneously. After having used kratom for so long I have been off and on with using it, it cannot be compared as an addictive or dangerous substance like heroin or other opioids. It is safe, natural and useful for far more than just helping addicts to recover from the pain of addiction. To make this plant illegal would undoubtedly cause many people to suffer and have to return to the street to get the medicine that they need. And it would leave the people who use kratom for purposes other than addiction to fall into that addiction because they wouldn't be able to get their medicine anymore and would have to turn to illegal substances because the doctors will not give people the legal medicine they need anymore, due to the hysteria that surround this \"opiate epidemic\". By making this plant illegal the DEA will cause more deaths, more overdoses,  more addiction and more suicides. I can promise that. I know it like I know my own name and would bet anything on it. This scheduling of kratom very well may be the worst idea I have ever heard in my time on this earth. Please reconsider this decision and make the right choice.  Please help to save lives and not destroy them because of a reactionary panic to a larger problem. When we are in a state of fear and panic, our brains do not function properly and we make poor decisions. Making Kratom illegal is a poor decision made out of haste and panic. Kratom saves lives. Kratom saved my life. Kratom will continue to save lives and help millions of people find a healthier alternative to opioid dependance.

I am a 27-year-old film composer & musician. I strongly oppose the DEA's proposal to make the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which are constituents of the kratom plant,  schedule 1 controlled substances. This would consequently place kratom, which is a safe and beneficial plant to consume, under the same scheduling as heroin. As a past user of opiates who is familiar with their effects and the opiate community, I firmly believe that scheduling kratom and its alkaloid constituents could potentially ruin millions of lives and worsen the opioid epidemic.\n\t\n\tI began using kratom approximately five months ago. I read positive experiences  online and decided to see if it could help with my chronic anxiety. Kratom greatly decreases my anxiety, which in turn increases my well-being, motivation, and productivity. I have also quit drinking alcohol by using kratom. I honestly didn't think I  would ever stop drinking. I am now a much healthier and happier person. I am also grateful to be happily married to an incredibly supportive wife who understands the positive impact kratom has on my life.\n\n\tKratom is not a drug. Kratom is not addictive in the medical sense. Kratom is a botanical supplement and dietary ingredient. I am prescribed an anti-depressant and a benzodiazepine. Kratom has helped me greatly reduce the frequency of my benzodiazepine use. I finally feel stable and able to function. When you compare kratom to prescription opioids and alcohol the difference is like night and day. The DEA knows the statistics of alcohol and opioid related deaths. The DEA knows the statistics of calls to poison control related to prescription opioids and alcohol. Kratom doesn't even begin to compare.

I fear this action by the DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic, and also lead to incarceration of harmless citizens who have found Kratom to be helpful in their lives.  Being an ex-opiate addict myself, Kratom has helped to keep me from using opiates for 3 years now.  It has also helped with my insomnia and anxiety immensely.  Kratom has literally saved my life.  I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without Kratom.  \n    Kratom is a natural botanical native to tropical Southeast Asia that is part of the coffee family. It is NOT a drug or opiate.  All walks of life: Teachers, policemen, pastors, veterans, senior citizens and others suffering from chronic pain, muscle spasms, anxiety, depression, insomnia, PTSD, and  opiate/alcohol/benzodiazepine dependency have been legally using this natural leaf (normally ingested as a tea) for years.

I don't know if you've ever tried Kratom but if you have I hope you have had only positive experiences with it. I, myself, have had many positive experiences with the plant and, in fact, have had some not so pleasant experiences. Mostly, I want to focus on the benefits of Kratom treatment but I do not want to undermine those concerns that there may be about this plant. I use the plant to treat my panic attacks and sometimes when work is just too crippling to do, Ill treat myself to a healthy dose (~7 grams or so) of some good ol fashion nature and cruise through the day. I know this may seem strange or scary to some people but it makes a lot of sense. As a plant in the coffee family, it contains its own psychoactive ingredients that can influence your heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure while also altering the mood. The difference under question is how and at what cost?\nPersonally, I have done a lot of research about the effects of Kratom and from what I can gather, virtually none of accompanying risks of conventional opiate use, or alcohol use, or benzodiazepine use are present with Kratom. The one (maybe) potentially concerning side effect is the fact that it is a blood thinner. Therefore, those with low blood pressure probably shouldnt be using this plant as they may faint. Besides that, there other minor concerns that also come with many different medications such as itching, upset stomach, drowsiness, but nothing life threatening that I have found. I have heard of the potential for addiction but I will address those concerns in the following paragraph because that needs special attention.\nThe way in which American society treats addiction is so terrible because we have demonized certain drug users and praised others. We dont view addictions to substances such as coffee, or even alcohol to some extent, because they are a normalized part of our culture. In this manner, it has become so commonplace to require a cup of Joe or to in order to survive the day and a couple drinks at night to relax and unwind from a hard day. Were we to see a marijuana user or Kratom user taking their substance throughout the day, the average person may think lesser of the user because these substances have not been normalized yet by our society. Having experienced and seen the experiences of those who have abruptly terminated coffee, marijuana, and kratom usage (not all at the same time, that would be unbearable), by far the worst effects were experienced from coffee withdrawal. Mind you, the psychological effects are quite similar and include the inability to focus, lethargy, irritability, depression, and many more. However, coffee withdrawal also comes with physical side effects such as headaches, muscle pain, nausea, and other flu-like symptoms.\nI for one do not care so much to think about the negative side effects, as these are typical of overuse of any substance. Instead, I choose to focus on the benefits and why some people may use a plant such as Kratom. Many people, including myself, like the idea of natural medicines because nature has fine-tuned the production of such wonderful compounds that can be used to treat various ailments. Kratom contains compounds that can be used to cure insomnia, depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, overactive appetite, relieve pain, improve the immune system, block withdrawal symptoms of addiction to opiates, as well as prevent diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. The schedule 1 classification of this plant would essentially discredit any of these properties and instead demonize the plant and its users. Furthermore, it will cause major issues associated with its distribution.\nRight now, farmers simply sell Kratom as their crop and vendors distribute it across the country and the world. Making this illegal would cause tension between buyers and distributers that could potentially become violent, as has happened with other illegal substances. I see no reason why this plant cannot be simply regulated in a manner that does not allow for this potential. Making it illegal is only going to cause an underground market, which is going to take many lives. Furthermore, this plant will probably also be laced with who knows what type of opiates, rather than being exactly what we want it to be, which is pure unadulterated Kratom. If you really do not see the potential destruction that will be associated with the Kratom ban, please take a second look at the history of prohibition, specifically marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. Since their prohibition, usage has risen significantly, as well as the risk potential due to the fact that they are unregulated. If you dont want to see the type of violence and destruction that you see from the drug trade associated with Kratom, please keep it legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12326","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Noah Alsamadisi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI'd like to take a moment to voice my concern on the proposed ban regarding Kratom. I suffer from chronic back pain due to a bulging disc and torn ligament in my lower back. After suffering for many years from the pain of my injury, I finally decided to see a doctor and try to take care of things. I was prescribed hydrocodone, which as you know has a high potential for addiction. Not only did my tolerance to this medication skyrocket within the first two months I was taking it, but it wasn't long before the medication simply did not work at all. Towards the end of my use of hydrocodone, I was using kratom so that I did not have to continually use the prescribed pills that I eventually would have become addicted to. I can't imagine where I would be right now without Kratom, as I've heard many horror stories and even lost friends to hydrocodone addiction.\n\nI have a family and two children and I feel blessed to see them every day, and I know first hand for a fact that kratom had a role to play in this. Please do not ban this substance, because if you do you will see a directly related rise in pharmaceutical and illicit opiate use and abuse. With the number of overdoses surging, and with tragic stories of parents overdosing in their cars with children present - this ban is the last thing we need. Kratom is not the enemy. Heroin and pharmaceutical opiates are. You made the correct decision by deciding to withdraw the ban. Please don't change your minds back, many lives hang in the balance.

In addition, I am a very good father to a beautiful little girl whom I love very much.  \nI have struggled with addiction and depression my whole life.  Simply put, this problem has nearly killed me on more than one occasion.  I began using kratom just under three years ago, as an alternative to drinking alcohol, abusing prescription pain killers, and using illicit narcotics such as heroin.  I do not use kratom to get intoxicated, quite the opposite.  I use it to suppress my depression and addictive urges.  I use it to combat a problem I don't fully understand, and don't expect anyone else to understand.       \nAll I want is the liberty to deal with my problems in the best way I see fit.  My methods of fighting my addiction and battling my depression are not hurting anyone.  To be honest, it is very frustrating that I have to give anyone an explanation for how I live my life.  I am not breaking any laws, nor am I hurting anyone.  I am trying to live my life the best I can, and kratom has proven to be most effective in helping me deal with my problems.    \nKratom has never been attributed to any fatal overdoses.  Kratom does not pose a serious, imminent threat to public safety.  If it does, what does alcohol pose?  The vast majority of people who use kratom are doing so for legitimate purposes.  They are good people, functioning members of society\nPlease do not be hypocritical.  Please allow law-abiding citizens the dignity they deserve to live their own lives as they see fit.  Please do not let pharmaceutical corporations or dogmatic bureaucrats tell you how to act regarding this matter.  A large number of American citizens have already voiced their opinion about kratom.

I do not actually have an experience using Kratom and do not personally know someone who has; however, I researched the requirements of classifying a drug as a Schedule I and according to the dea.gov website, a Schedule I drug does not have an accepted medical use.  However, based on the hundreds of personal statements of people benefiting from Kratom, it would seem that the definition of the Schedule I classification alone disqualifies Kratom from being a Schedule I drug. If Kratom must be classified, it does not seem necessary or fair to make it a Schedule I. Many prescription medications that are classified as pain killers, such as Vicodin, Fentanyl, and Tylenol with codeine, are classified as Schedule II or III, depending on the level of codeine. These drugs are recognized as having a medical benefit and are not illegal with a prescription (dea.gov). Common side effects of pain killers, such as nausea and constipation (webmd.com) are also found with Kratom (drugabuse.gov) and both Kratom and painkillers have been reported to have a risk of dependence. So if Kratom must be classified, I believe a Schedule II or III would suffice; but making it completely illegal is unnecessary. I believe the personal comments are testament enough to the benefits of the drug, even more so than standard pain killers.\" \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3701","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alexandria Tuttle","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep Kratom legal.

Several years ago, I suffered a back and neck injury that left me out of work for more than six months. I was prescribed pain medication to relieve the chronic pain and was recommended surgery. I have been reluctant to have surgery, and instead have been able to maintain a minimum dose of pain medication that allows me to work relatively pain free. Unfortunately, most all prescription pain medication leads to tolerances and physical dependency. I want to stop taking my pain medication but I need to work. Up until several months ago, I was becoming very depressed about my situation because the dosage of my pain medication needed to be adjusted again to be effective. What kind of a life has this become? I asked myself repeatedly. I am a widower and self-reliant; I work hard and maintain a healthy lifestyle despite the condition of my spine. Disc degeneration, herniation, and spinal stenosis are the main issues, and the chronic pain has interfered greatly with my ability to work and be happy. Quality of life is extremely important.\nIn early September of this year I prayed for a solution. I prayed for help of my situation. Later that day I was searching on line for something totally unrelated to this and came across Kratom, as if by chance. I was intrigued by what I was reading and I thought that my prayers were being heard. I acquired some Kratom that next day and I was amazed at how effective it was. It is a miracle indeed. Of course, I did more research to learn as much as possible, but it was certain, my prayers had been answered. \nFor the last three years, I have not been able to sleep a full night without waking up in the middle of the night by the pain in my back. And upon waking up in the morning, it had become typical to have to shift my thoughts from being depressed to finding hope. After taking Kratom for the first night, I not only was able to sleep a whole night through, but I was also relatively pain free the next morning and I was not depressed! \nThe other remarkable thing I have noticed is that I have been able to take 1/2 as much of the prescription pain medication and on some days not at all! I did not at all experience any withdrawal discomfort from the prescribed medication, which gives me hope that I can eventually stop taking the pills all together. Kratom really helps with a lot of things, more than the pain medication, and it is a natural plant. I know that it is helping millions of people besides myself, and I am hopeful that Kratom will remain legal so that I, and many others, can stay on course with life.\nSince my prayer to find help was answered, I am now praying that Kratom will remain legal and continue to be available. I will support research and studies to help disseminate the truth about this miraculous herb. I strongly believe that the world would be a much better place if this sacred herb is allowed its own relative freedom, and not captured by the pharmaceutical companies that seek to control it and destroy the lives of so many people that are benefiting from its properties. That would be a huge mistake in my humble opinion, and personally, my life would begin again to spiral downward. Im too young for that. I want to continue living life with optimism and faith; both of which have been restored by Kratom. Making it illegal would certainly change everything for so many, in a very negative way. I pray with all of my soul that Kratom remains available in the way that it is, for it is doing the most for me in a very positive way and I am sure I am not alone.\nThank you for reading my testimonial.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21396","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Emily and I'm a 22 year old Paralegal in Washington, DC and I strongly oppose kratom being scheduled or banned.\n \n     I have witnessed my husband, who is a federal government contractor, regularly consuming kratom tea and I am a big supporter of this herbal supplement.

Speaking from my personal experience and that of many people I know the benefits outweigh the negatives when it comes to this plant. I have seen first hand my brother in law go from using opioids for years due to originally being over prescribed opioid pain killers from a physician for a shoulder injury that he became physically dependent. Then the prescriptions ran out but the withdrawals did not stop so he began to take heroin just so he wouldn't be sick.  To taking no opioids at all and return to being a normal functional person in society after my wife and I introduced him to kratom. My mother also suffers from dependence on opioid prescription painkillers and has just recently discovered that she has liver disease due to the very thing that was suppose to help her. If she would have known of kratom 15 years ago this would have never happened.  I myself take this to go to bed and stay asleep at night as I suffer from sleep disorder. I am a veteran of this country and a productive member of society who gets up in the morning and goes to work, takes care of my family,  and my responsibilities as a man. There are numerous people I know who suffered from addiction and dependence on painkillers / heroin  that were able to get clean as a result of kratom. It sickens me that you (DEA) are so bought off from the big pharmaceutical companies that you guys are willing to ban a plant that has never killed anyone so that they can keep pumping out there painkillers, methadone, and suboxone. That you (DEA) are willing to let people die because big pharma is the one that you guys all answer too and they can't stand the thought of losing money at the expense of peoples lives and well being. I read an article that said the poison control centers received around 660 calls for kratom and zero deaths over a period of several years. I also read that the poison control centers recieved over 50,000 calls for incidents relating to opioids in a span of several months which translates to thousands of deaths and overdoses  and for some reason there is no rush to ban those drugs and save all those lives because I don't think your bosses (big pharma) would like that very much. In all, this plant in my opinion, should be as freely available as tee at the store or a bottle of tylenal. I have taken it for a year in varying doses and at the worst I had an upset stomach. I have had worse experience from drinking to much coffee and definately worse experiences from drinking too much alcohol which by the way kill more people every year than kratom has.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17395","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I drank kratom one day at work.

Imagine if you had been diagnosed with a chronic, painful disease, or that you had been injured and were in permanent pain. Your doctor prescribes you medication that has been approved for use by the FDA and DEA from Big Pharma. This medication has gone through the painful trials and procedures required by the FDA to approve its use. Then, later, it is determined that Big Pharma lied, the substances they sent in for approval, and was approved, was much more dangerous and addictive that previously stated. You find that now the DEA is in the hot seat, realizing that now, instead of people being addicted, abusing, and dying from Schedule 1 substances, they are getting addicted to, abusing, and dying from substances that the FDA had approved for use. Then, in a knee jerk reaction, the DEA attempts to lessen the availability for these pain meds by going after doctors and pharmacies that may or may not over prescribe them. That, in turn, you find out that your doctor is too afraid to prescribe them to you for fear of losing their license or worse. So you, law abiding citizen, are now in chronic pain due to no fault of your own and there is no help available to you. Your choices now consist of either getting the pain medication you require illegally off the street, turn to heroin or other schedule 1 substance (which is cheaper and easier to obtain), or find a legal solution that has not proven to have any negative health risks, has been proven to help with multiple problems (albeit anecdotally, although apparently scientifically proven substances are flawed since you find yourself in this situation even after the FDA did their due diligence to approve the said pain meds that got you into this situation to begin with) and has been prove (albeit anecdotally) to be much less addictive. You turn to that substance, in this case Kratom, and find that it also helps to manage your mood and give you energy as well, and does not make you high or cloudy headed like the legal pain medications. For you, it becomes a life saver. You now can live a productive healthy life and once again become a productive member of society.\n\nSuddenly, he DEA gets wind of this miracle herb and because there hasn't been scientific evidence of its uses, it must be banned or scheduled to keep this dangerous substance out of the American peoples hands. Despite there being no proof that Kratom has ever, in its thousand year history, killed a single person, and despite the extremely minimal calls to poison control, it must be dangerous because it is not regulated and is being sold in head shops. You think what a horrible mentality these people have. They are suppose to be protecting us, failed, and now when I find a way to protect myself, they want to ban it! Ironically, that mentality is what is creating an imminent threat to public health.\n\nThis is not my story at all, but it is for hundreds of thousands of people across this country. Im a 42 year old professional male working in the live production field. The hours can be long and stressful. I first started taking Kratom as an alternative to caffeine. Coffee messes with my stomach and energy drinks give me the jitters. After taking Kratom, I also noticed that not only did it give me energy, it lowered my anxiety and kept me focused on the task at hand, making me much more productive and successful in my field. When the ban was announced, I conducted more research and found all these other uses for Kratom.\n\nThere are 2 concerns that the DEA has that cannot be disputed. 1: that Kratom can be addictive and 2: that since it is not regulated, there is no quality control. The 1st concern has zero merit. Anything can be addictive. Addiction is based on a persons psyche, not necessarily on a substance. Some things are more additive, and can cause physical addiction, however anecdotally Kratom does not fit into this category. The overwhelming majority of people that take Kratom regularly state that they have less withdraw symptoms than when they stop caffeine. In the few extreme cases of Kratom addiction, these people were taking enhanced strains constantly and consistently and more than likely already had a disposition for addiction. There are people that are addicted to food or sugar that eat until they weigh 400 + pounds, then keep eating because they are addicts. This definitely is not the majority of folks. Should food intake be regulated because of these few abusers?\n\nIssue 2. I believe that the overwhelming amount of Kratom advocated would agree that some form of regulation would be welcomed. Similar type of regulation issued for other botanical substances. To guarantee quality, make sure that the kratom is pure and unadulterated with foreign chemicals, and to keep it way from minors.\n\nLlisten to the people. Don't ban or limit access to Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4529","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Overbeek","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, my name is Angela Stutso, I am 48 years old and have an associate degree in computer networking as well as Microsoft and A+ certifications.\n\nI am strongly opposed to the DEA's intention to place Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.\n\nAlthough I had researched using Kratom in the past for pain relief I have just recently started using it.\n\nI have very little cartilage left in my knees and have osteoarthritis of the knees, hips, and lower back.

The positive results that I have witnessed first hand are remarkable and the impact on our family is a blessing. My wife has lived with pain and fatigue for sixteen years. I have watched her suffering and felt helpless as I watched her struggle. Fibromyalgia directed her life. She never gave up but daily life was difficult. There have been many days through the years that she was restricted to minimal living. She was treated with opioids and I watched her decline. Her once vibrant self was replaced with a person that struggled through each day. For the two years she has been supplementing with Kratom, she has improved and is now able to be a part of the world again. Why is a plant that is not addicting and helps so much being considered as a threat? I have seen the miracle that Kratom has been for her. I am urging the FDA to listen to the people who are connecting to jobs, families and life in a positive and productive way because of the plant Kratom. It would be an act of cruelty to return people like my wife to their brokenness. Don't you believe that it is the right of the person to choose how to deal with conditions characterized by pain and fatigue? My daughter has been rescued from addiction and depression because of Kratom. What a relief to see the turnaround she has made with the support of Kratom. How would it be the right approach to send her back to the life that was her world while addicted to prescription and addictive  drugs? I have also used Kratom for bouts with lower back pain. Kratom works. I implore you to not place a ban on Kratom. Keep this plant legal. It is the hope for freedom from pain and addiction for many. The testimonials are real and they are numerous. For our family, it is my hope that the FDA listens to the people who are productive and living with renewed hope. Please, keep Kratom legal. \n\n\n\nJoseph Mack Jones","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5580","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mack Jones","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Keep Kratom legal","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16846","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joe Righetti","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My Name is Dustin and I have used Kratom for almost a year now, if it wasn't for kratom my life would've already came to an end from an opiate addiction that lasted for a few years.

She got her life back!\n\nMy daughter was prescribed dangerous, addictive and life altering prescription pain medications, anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications to treat her multiple, diagnosed conditions: Degenerative Disk Disease, Sciatica, Herniated Disks and Severe Depressive Disorder, Severe Anxiety Disorder and PTSD (due to childhood trauma). These medicines had such adverse side effects that she no longer could function. She lost her job and became so withdrawn from life. Became housebound and addicted to the narcotic pain medications and anti-anxiety medications.The medications eventually did not work at all. She took more and more out of desperation for relief. I was in constant fear that I would find her dead one day. She would stop taking the medications, only to try the self medication route with alcohol. This made things worse and obviously made her very ill. So, she went back to the Doctors to get back on the prescription medicines. This process was a vicious cycle that went on for years. Until she researched for a natural, safe solution. She was doubtful that one existed. She discovered this plant, a member of the coffee family, known as Kratom, in March of 2015, she ordered some. She had little faith that it would help her but it made the most amazing difference. She no longer needed the prescription medicines, did not suffer withdrawal symptoms, etc. It was an answer to or prayers.\n\nThis plant has touched the lives of so many and has literally saved lives. If made a Schedule 1 drug (which it is not a drug), and not available to those who need it, many will suffer and lose their lives. The opiate epidemic will claim too many victims to count. This safe plant must remain legal and available.

Apon research of these incidents it was found that these people that have died from kratom were also having other problems. I also feel that kratom should be shared with the public as far as knoledge wise. It should be given a fair trial. Lastly, it would be irresponsible to put a restriction on a drug that the public utilizes for a method of transitioning off of addiction to opioids. These people that are trying to transition could be jailed, if I correctly understand the level of restrictions being put on the drug. To put another strain on the prisons of the US and citizens of the US is unjust considering the lack of research of Kratom.\n\nThank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14138","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dylan Januszewski","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"All the opiates you have legalized have proven to be addictive, harmful and deadly. They are stepping stones to illegal substances that are cheaper but cause much more harm. With the addict now venturing into unlawful territory, unknown substance intake, and a much harsher societal stigma, it's hard to rise up out of this without a criminal record, overdose, or death. Nobody would choose this route willfully. Trust me, it's messy and it quickly spirals out of control. Kratom is the only thing out there you can purchase safely. There are reputable vendors, reviews, and forums for open communication on how to use this plant for healing. I am a college-educated woman in my early 30's and have been in rehab centers via excellent insurance coverage - and it's a joke. I was yanked from a 90 day program after 28 days. Unless I could pay a thousand bucks a day I had to go because what the insurance company says, goes. It is a battle out there every single day for most people. When you add the disease of addiction on top of that it's virtually impossible to succeed. There are very few things out there that will reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, like Kratom can, without substituting one drug for another, like kratom does not. The withdrawal symptoms for Kratom are mild and tolerable. The same can not be said for your current legal therapies like buprenorphine and methadone. Please reconsider this sudden irrational decision - real American lives actually depend on it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6769","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've tried 2g kratom on two occassions and found the effects to be very mild. Aside from kava root, this has been my only experience with any sort of natural herb that could be considered a psychoactive or a drug.  I have chronic lyme disease, with my main symptom being arthritis-like joint pain. Within two hours of injesting the kratom I felt my joint pain go away entirely. I also felt calmed, as if I had drank chamomile tea or taken a epsom salt bath. I have ADHD-like tendencies, and the calming effect of the kratom lessened those.  Many other users have reported very symptoms to these, along with alleviation of stress, anxiety, PTSD symptoms, etc.  \n\nI have in no way felt debilitated or intoxicated on kratom. I would have no difficulty driving, writing, doing household chores.  As with any other herbal supplement, negative effects may be able to occur with high enough dosage, but the negative symptoms would be predictable and preventable. \n\nI believe this is a mild herbal supplement, on approximately equal in effect to kava root and valerian root. Negative side effects are associated with psychoactive effects or a high are a result of very high dosages or concentrated extracts.  With proper FDA regulation or standardization of kratom, the dosing would be more reliable and safer for users.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13242","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Lowe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 26 years old. I work in the craft beer/service industry as well as in the spa and alternative wellness industry. \nI do not believe Kratom should become a schedule 1 drug, or be put in any other schedule as well. I believe it will do more harm then good. \nI believe if anything, it should be regulated like any other herbal supplement, or herb. If so, that would help with quality and consistency control in the kratom in the market, thus preventing adulteration of the natural product and keeping it pure.\nI have responsibly been using Kratom for over 3 years. I use it periodically throughout the week, much in the same way as you would use coffee, energy drinks, or yerba mate. It is in the same plant family as coffee and it is used like coffee for its stimulating/caffeine like affects. I use it for it's coffee/caffeine like stimulating properties, as well as to help me with my production at work. It helps me focus, and relieves my social anxiety being around so many people with both my jobs. It helps me take on more tasks in and outside of work, and helps me endure longer work hours and makes me more productive in all aspects of my life and an overall more productive member of society. It is also relieving for any muscle pain or strains from over exhaustion or exercise. I also use to help with exercise. It allows me to perform better, stronger, faster, and overall more focused during exercise. A surprising effect I've noticed, is that it has also helped me perform better in bed, and last longer. It has helped me reducing my alcoholic consumption to barely even a few times a week, which is rather difficult being that I am surrounded by alcohol at work and involved in the alcohol industry and craft beer culture. Thus lowering my consumption of alcohol after finding Kratom, has resulted in many positive effects like weight loss, more energy, more social, more productivity, save money, and less likely to get involved in risky behaviors that could put myself or others in danger, which we all know the risks and bad side affects of alcohol consumption.\n\nI would not say Kratom gives you a \"high\". It stimulates you like coffee, allievates aches and pains, gives you a sense of calm focused well being, and general feel good, mood boosting, motivation boosting, and anti anxiety effects.\nI have only had positive side affects from Kratom.\n\nI introduced my grandmother to Kratom, because she suffers from incurable Fibromyalgia, and has been suffering with a few broken bones trying to heal that past few years, which has been very debilitating to her life.  Sometimes she cannot even get out of bed for days, because she is in so much pain and has little to no energy. Doctors can't give her anything that actual helps her, let alone without terrible and risks and side affects of opioid painkillers. Kratom has been one of the only things that has helped her find any relief and has improved her quality of life. It relieves her pain, helps her sleep, and gives her energy to do normal everyday things. \n\nIf Kratom becomes a schedule 1 drug, it will do so much harm to so many people. That will cause so many peoples' quality of life to tremendously decrease including my own, and my families. I think it is a short sighted and ill though out proposition, that has not taken into account of SO much anecdotal evidence and scientific evidence regarding the safety of Kratom. The positives of Kratom can't even be compared to any negatives regarding it. The positive benefits of Kratom greatly outnumber the very few negatives, if any of Kratom. \nMaking it illegal will hurt, and destroy so many more countless lives then just keeping it legal. Making Kratom illegal will do way more harm then good. Period. We have seen this with Alcohol Prohibition, and it doesn't work. It only made the problem worse, and more people died because of it being illegal, then legal. And alcohol is way more of a dangerous substance then Kratom. So the thought of making it illegal is ridiculous and not a decision based on the reality, facts, or science. This is a fundamental freedom and right at risk being taken away from us. The right to consume a plant that helps us.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21626","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mathias Ailstock","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be banned.

Over those 5 years I have been taking suboxone to manage cravings and withdrawal symptoms from opiates.  I then realized that I became addicted to suboxone in the same way I was addicted to opiates.  A friend suggested that I try kratom.  The effects \"mimicked\" those of opiates, but were much more mild and more similar to that of suboxone but WITHOUT the withdrawals that happen on suboxone.   I don't get high from kratom, it's not a recreational drug.   \n\nThe initial goal for me was to taper suboxone use and shift over to kratom.  I didn't even need to taper.  Once I used kratom, my cravings for opiates and partial opioids vanished almost immediately.  As an experiment I abstained for 24 hours to see what would happen after 2 weeks using kratom in lieu of suboxone and I experience no withdrawal symptoms at all.  Based on this I can definitely say that shifting to kratom was able to help me no longer be dependent on any pharmaceutical drug in order to live day to day life.  I am also only using kratom sporadically to help me sleep.  \n\nIt's my opinion that this herbal supplement dramatically and positively impacted my life as an addict and I can say with utmost sincerity that I hope to see it do the same in the lives of all those who I know or don't know that are suffering from opiate addiction. \n\nPlease reconsider keeping this supplement off of the Schedule 1 status as it does have many many benefits in treating pain and depression/anxiety as well as being my personal path away from pharmaceutical drugs and opiates.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10587","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi after 5 years of being injured I finally got health insurance through the affordable care act. At that point I had been wearing a back brace for all 5 years just to get through work every day. I had 2 MRI's and found that I had a bulging disc in my L5-S1 and a torn meniscus in my right knee.\n\nDue to wearing the back brace to get through every day life I was unable to do my physical therapy. My physical therapist told me that due to my back brace my core muscles had atrophied to that of a 90 year old woman.  I would have spasms for weeks after just one physical therapy session. I refused opiates from my doctor as I had an issue with them years prior. \n\nAfter a few months of research I found kratom. Kratom allowed me to not only get through the pain of physical therapy but alleviated my spasms. It is now 18 months later and I am 100% recovered with my back and my knee and no longer take kratom. Not only did kratom alleviate my pain and spasms it also helped me with focusing and with my mood in general. The only downside I ever experienced from kratom was mild headache if dosing too much and constipation. \n\nPlease do some research on this plant it helped me get through the toughest experience of my life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10148","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Stull","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has benefited all of our lives greatly.

I am a professional software developer by trade, however I have also struggled with social anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder for most of my adult life. Before discovering Kratom, these issues would repeatedly crop up and hold me back and cause debilitating problems throughout my personal and professional life often causing extreme social anxiety, nervousness and sudden panic attacks that effected my ability to be at my best both professionally and as a family man.\n\nThe drugs I was given by my doctor only made things worse. When I discovered Kratom however, it helped me overcome my anxiety issues without any negative side-effects and helped me on the road to becoming the successful, driven and social person I know I can be without the crippling effects of my anxiety disorder.\n\nYou see, this is not a drug or something I use to escape life. Kratom has been nothing but an extremely positive influence in my life. It helps me overcome these issues without negative health impacts and the side-effects of the pharmaceutical drugs I was prescribed. This herb enables me to stay on track, make progress in my career and be the best father I can be without allowing my anxiety and OCD to destroy and erode my life goals.\n\nThis is the leaves from a tree, used for thousands of years in Southeast Asia and brewed into a beneficial tea or taken with juice like a morning cup of coffee. This is not a dangerous opiate or poisonous synthetic drug like Bath Salts.  It is a naturally occurring safe herbal supplement thats more akin to tea and coffee than hard drugs.\nStates such as North Carolina had initially moved to make Kratom illegal after it was unfairly lumped in with dangerous synthetic drugs and legal highs, but after conducting extensive research into the herb, SB830 made Kratom legal for people over the age of 18 in North Carolina.\n\nThe science we do have at this point shows that Kratom is a mild and safe herb that has been used in Southeast Asia for hundreds of thousands of years. This simply does not align with the DEAs claim that Kratom is a dangerous plant that is causing an imminent health crisis in this country.\n\nThe DEA has stated a reported 660 poison control reports over a 5-year period. There have been 6,843 child poisoning reports from laundry detergent pods in just the last 7 months. The deaths that the DEA has attributed to Kratom have all been a case of mixing other much more powerful hard drugs with Kratom. The science in all of these cases has shown that Kratom did not cause these deaths.\n\nBy making Kratom a schedule 1 substance, we would also be literally eliminating thousands of American jobs and putting even more hard working Americans out of work in a critical time where every job counts. By making Kratom illegal the government would be shutting down a multi-million-dollar thriving industry built around the Kratom plant as a commodity. \n\nThis will not only put thousands of hard working Americans out of work, but will lead to more incarceration, crime and illegal activity creating a dangerous situation that did not exist when Kratom was available for legal purchase by the hundreds of small businesses selling and creating innovative Kratom products.\n\nAmericans that use Kratom like we do coffee such as myself are not wanting to get high on drugs, escape from their lives and responsibilities or engage in criminal activity by abusing drugs. We are asking to continue having the choice as responsible Adults to use a safe and natural herb that we have found beneficial in our lives and help us live a higher quality of life.\n\nThis is an issue about the freedom of law abiding and productive adult American citizens to continue to use a natural, safe and effective herb that has literally saved hundreds of people and helped folks overcome debilitating health conditions that people have struggled with by using pharmaceuticals that where not effective in reliving their symptoms or caused too many side-effects that Kratom does not.\nThis action will affect the other millions of Americans that will be made into criminals, have their quality of life reduced and possibly leads to losing their jobs by the actions of the DEA banning this herb.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1125","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chad Corrin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Don't capitalize on my health","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10345","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After being an alcoholic for 22 years, Kratom has helped me get and stay away from alcohol.

Kratom has simply been pivotal in saving me from the opiate plague that is out of control in this nation. Kratom also helped address the reasons that I became addicted in the first place. Kratom allowed me to feel energy and the sense of well being that I had lacked before. Kratom has helped me stay sober, happy and productive. I would likely be in jail on drug charges or dead from an overdose if I had not been introduced to kratom. My family and friends have been amazed and thankful upon seeing the difference in my attitude towards life and robust health since I started consuming kratom. It would be a grave mistake to take away or limit the benefits kratom bestows upon people. It would take away the chance for others like me to return from the horrors of drug addiction. \nHere is the message I wish to impress upon you as being very important to the well being of millions and the uncounted others whose lives will yet be saved by kratom. \n1) Kratom consumers strongly object to scheduling kratom controlled substance . Kratom definitely does not fit into the definition of a schedule 1 substance and could very well be a weapon against the opiate plague and give people an option to not experience narcotics in the first place, therefore avoiding the danger of getting caught up in the opiate plage themselves. This plant needs to be researched extensively and I know we will find MANY vital benefits from this plant.\n2) Kratom is safe. Kratom consumers know this and the scientific community knows this too. It is as safe as coffee and much safer than many of the over the counter products freely being sold right now that regularly kill thousands. Do not make it so that we have to go to a doctor and be prescribed kratom. This would only make for further financial burdens that many kratom consumers simply don't have the income to go through. Many cannot jump through the many hoops that would be required to obtain a simple plant. This would not be fair to the public at all.\n3) I do support MINOR regulations on kratom. Proper labeling , quality standards , age restriction for 18 and older, and MINOR and I mean MINOR taxation is fair. It is simply all that is needed and doing more than this would only serve to to create additional hardships for the many whom are poor , impaired or disabled. \nThe whole concept of seeing kratom as a drug instead of beneficial herb and adding kratom to the failing war on drugs is obviously terribly unjust. Please show the American people that you care for their well being instead of people to be exploited. Please show us that the FDA and DEA are responsible agencies that deserve our support instead of our resistance and oversight. This is your chance to win the American people's trust again and be proud of your work. Don't squander this chance.

Monthly consultations, urine tests, etc. i was a helicopter pilot before injuring my back. It's important that you understand that this all natural leaf is being used by educated professionals and not being sold behind a dumpster. I took kratom for about 6 months while I successfully detoxed from such a high amount of opiates that it should have been illegal. I no longer use kratom because my life choices are to not take ANY MEDICINE unless neede. However, i made the decision to stop my opiate use and I didn't want to do it with other opites or mood altering SSRIs and manufactured drugs. That path is fine for others if they so choose but I should also have the option to use a natural route for my pain management. Whats next guys?  Turmeric?  Cinnamon? Black Pepper?  Banning Kratom is going to send many Americans back to an addiction of very harmful drugs that they have fought hard to cleanse themselves of. I can only imagine this is the driving reason for the ban. Its clearly cutting into the revenue stream of big pharmaceutical companies. If you are indeed concerned about long term effects of this leaf, why not take a couple years to do some trials?  Talk to the people who use it. Show some integrity in your reasoning. Otherwise, I think youd just be doing all of us a greater service if you would just come out with the truth, regardless of what the public response will be.

I'm a responsible 38 year old. I served in the military and sustained injuries and have mild ptsd. When I got home I was prescribed many medications. Oxycodone being one of them. As well as many other psych meds. All they did was make me feel like a zombie. I had no motivation. I just layed around or was confined to bed. I got tired of that life. I couldn't work or anything. About 3 years ago I discovered kratom. I tried it and it helped relieve my pain to a manageable level. And I was surprised how I my pain was relieved and I had a clear head. It helped with my ptsd as well. I had a clear mind and was motivated again. I was able to start my own construction company. I now have my own company with 30 employees. I'm really successful at it. I'm opposed to the ban or scheduling on kratom. This supplement should remain available to everyone. I'm in favor of something like an age restriction. This is a safe plant. It's not a dangerous drug. I'm asking that you please not schedule kratom and force me back to my life as it was. I'll be in pain the rest of my life.

I have several medical issues that cause me to have chronic pain.  I have several bulging and degenerating discs, bone spurs on my spine and scoliosis.  I also suffer from osteoarthritis that is continuing to get worse; some days I find it hard to tie my shoes, write or even type.  Typing is essential to me because I am in school to get my MS in Substance Abuse Counseling.  I also have a job in retail as well as a job cleaning corporate apartments for another company; being able to move is essential to me.  \n     My story begins back a little over 10 years ago, I began seeing a pain specialist who began treating my chronic pain with Percocet and Vicodin.  I believe he was over-prescribing me when I stopped seeing him.  I then began buying oxycontin on the streets.  Soon I was doing heroin to treat my incessant chronic pain.  I got help to get off the heroin with Subutex but the withdrawals were worse than the heroin withdrawals.  After consulting with my regular doctor, I went off the Subutex cold turkey with the help of beta blockers and Klonopin.  As I am sure you are aware, I could no longer take prescription pain medications due to my addiction.  I did some research on natural, herbal solutions to manage my chronic pain.  I found Kratom.  \n     Although Kratom does not completely eliminate my pain, it makes it tolerable so that I can do everyday things like work and cook dinner for my husband.  Kratom does not cause the euphoria that prescription pain medication or heroin did.  It only helps to manage my pain and the depression that coincides with that pain. I have never had a problem with taking too much Kratom.  I did, however, overdose on heroin once and Percocet several times.  When I am not in pain, I have more energy; I was even able to enroll into a Master's degree program to become a substance abuse counselor.  I am studying to be a drug counselor and Kratom is helping me to do that.  What kind of example would I set if Kratom should become a Schedule I drug? \n     There is a severe epidemic in this country of prescription pain pill and heroin addiction.  Making Kratom a Schedule I drug would leave some people no choice but to go back to prescription drugs and illicit drugs.  I wasted too many years of my life in a euphoric stupor to help ease my pain.  Please do not take away the only thing that helps me that lets me maintain a clear head and is not lethal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18118","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alicia Zvonar","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep these harmless herbs legal and available.

She was diagnosed with a trapped nerve from scar tissue after an operation for fallopian tube and ovary removal due to an ectopic pregnancy. She was prescribed  percocet for her nerve pain. Over time she needed more and more percs to get the pain relief she needed. It became a problem until the time she decided that enough was enough. She made the commitment to get off of the opiate. We found kratom through the advice of a friend. The results were wonderful. She was able to detox from the opiate with the help of kratom which helped with the withdrawal  symptoms. Today she is able to deal with her pain management with a couple of capsules of kratom when she has her flare ups.Now her lifestyle is 10x more productive than she's ever been. I listened last month on the radio as the AG and the DEA head talk about the epidemic of opiate addiction and praised narcan which does nothing to get people off of the drug. As a firefighter we use narcan everyday to reverse he affects of heroin, but it does nothing to get people off of the drug. Kratom does and is all natural. My wife does not have to increase her intake of kratom either. That alone tells me a lot. Methadone the drug of choice for heroin addiction is a joke. I see it on my job as an emt all the time and the people that use it do not get better or off of heroin. You should replace methadone with krater if you ask me.

I can understand some concern about minors having ready access, but that is true of a myriad of substances, caffeine perhaps most troubling of all due to its ubiquity and relatively high toxicity. Please keep the Kratom plant itself unregulated.

Like many others my age due to past jobs where I lifted heavy items I now have chronic pain and have battled it severely for the past 7 years. I have pinched nerves in my neck,  chronic myofascial pain from scoliosis and daily right shoulder pain.  6 MRI'S, Cortisone Injections, Chiropractors, B12 injections, meds, meds and more meds, depression, lots of missed work that has affected my family adversely.  All the time soldiering through doing the best I can.  Last September or so I saw an episode of Dr. Phil that mentioned Kratom. I researched and was desperate to try anything when all else had failed.  The Doctors had me on 15 pills a day with mostly crap side effects.  I ordered some Kratom not expecting it to work as nothing else had before and I had been to the point of suicide at one point from pain, many times actually.  It was a miracle, a year later I have tapered down from 15 pills to only 2.  I take Kratom in moderation daily. My anxiety was horrible and I could barely function. I now am able to find joy in things I did before and can function much better.  It litterally has no side effects. Constipation at first but this stuff truly saved my life and I use it moderately to maintain my improved life.  Please,  prescription drugs are a big business and lots of meds are bad. Do not take Kratom away.  People with Chronic Pain take it because they have to, to survive the day. If our pain was gone we wouldn't need any meds.

Kratom helps relieve the pain so he doesn't need to try any type of opioid -- which is an extra benefit since his addictive personality has had him previously hooked on alcohol and cocaine.
