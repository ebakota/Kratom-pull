All recorded deaths linked to Kratom are of the cocktail nature. Where an individual takes a cocktail of drugs that all combined leads to death.  As an American we are lead to believe that we live in a society of liberty and freedom. Yet this is not the case.  I have never used Kratom and know no one that does, yet I cannot condone a schedule 1 classification. If the sea chooses to classify this as a schedule 1 drug, this is what's going to happen. A pharmaceutical company pick this up, break the plants components down into a much more potent drug. Then sell it to the people that are addicted to opiates, fixing the problem they created. Please do not classify natural plants as schedule 1 drugs. It's in ethical and un American. Please keep banning synthetic drugs these pose a real threat to society.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13324","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Mai","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Laura Seltzer and I am 35 years old and live in Salem, Oregon. I am a Case Management Coordinator at the Department of Human Services. I have used kratom for Restless Legs Syndrome and Irritable Bowel Syndrome since 2008. Before finding kratom I tried every prescription drug that is on the market for both of my chronic conditions. Every single medicine I tried was ineffective, or the side effects were so bad I was unable to continue treatment. In fact, the anti-Parkinson's medication my doctor prescribed for my Restless Legs Syndrome actually made my symptoms worse (this is a common side effect called \"augmentation\").\n\nI am a law-abiding citizen (I had to pass a background check to be employed at my current job), and I respect the law greatly, and one of the main reasons I chose kratom (like the hundreds of other people I have talked to in the kratom community), is because it is LEGAL, and because it does not alter who I am as a person like some of the medications I used to take for my chronic health conditions. It does not impair me, or alter my thinking or behavior, or affect my judgment. \n\nThe DEA may think it's as simple as choosing not to use kratom anymore if the ban goes into effect. But I have two serious chronic illnesses that have been successfully managed with kratom for more than 8 years now. I can sleep at night and not crash my car when I'm driving because a Restless Legs Syndrome flare up happens all of a sudden, because my Restless Legs Syndrome is helped greatly by kratom. I can focus at work because my Restless Legs Syndrome symptoms are under control. I can not wake up every morning sick to my stomach and throw up every day before I go to work, because my Irritable Bowel Syndrome disappears completely when I take kratom. \n\nMost kratom users respect the law like I do, and are not criminals. We don't abuse illegal drugs, most of us don't even drink alcohol or use other prescription drugs. We are moral, ethical people by and large. But we also have chronic illnesses that require treatment, and kratom is the only thing we have found that works. It has given us our lives back. That is why you will find such passion among us. We are literally fighting for our lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0329","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laura Seltzer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If you could just admit that the only reason, you guys wanna make this illegal is to keep pushing pills on people and getting people addicted to drugs instead of using nature to help the problem.

I have scoliosis and have been suffering from chronic back pain for many years. In addition, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression.  After seeking treatment for all these conditions, I've got severely addicted to opiate painkillers as well as benzodiazepines, all of these legally prescribed to me by my doctors and taken at the correct dosage.  My life began to spiral out of control; I lost my job and ended up in a rehab.  After a 28 day program plus some follow up I returned back to normal life but of course still had back pain and mental issues.  That's when I discovered kratom by pure accident and decided to give it a try.  I am not very religious but still consider this plant to be a gift from God- the way it worked for me was nothing short of amazing.  My back pain subsided considerably and was manageable even on the days when I couldn't get to a chiropractor.  I no longer had panic attacks and in general was much happier with life.  I've got myself a decent job in customer service (something that I never thought I could do due to anxiety) and excelled in it.  Most importantly, I was no longer craving any prescription drugs, and in fact when my dentist urged me to take a Vicodin prescription after a root canal, I refused since I no longer was interested in it; I would've never said \"no\" in the past.   Now, I took kratom on a nearly-daily basis but never experienced any side effects other than an occasional constipation (that I was prone to all of my life anyways), and whenever I ran out, I never suffered from any withdrawal symptoms.   My tolerance never went up either, and I am still taking the same dose as 3 years ago when I first discovered it.  Quite often I don't take any kratom for days just because I'm already feeling fine (no back pain, etc), but if this wonderful herbal supplement actually gets banned, that would be devastating.  My back pain would then need to be managed by prescription painkillers again, a route that I REALLY don't want to ever take, but I don't want to be in constant pain either.  My anxiety and depression would most likely come back as well,  implying a possible job loss and severe financial debt (currently I have no health insurance and can't afford to go to a doctor).  In other words, my life would become much less manageable, and now, with a family to support, this could have way more severe consequences than the last time around.  I would also like to mention that I've introduced several other people also suffering from chronic ailments to kratom, and that changed their life for the better (two other people were able to beat their opiate addictions as well).  Banning this herb would result in grave consequences for them too, not to mention millions of other kratom users in the USA.  None of us are taking it for \"recreational purposes\" since kratom is not something that makes you \"high\" or causes any kind of inebriation; it is infinitely more similar to coffee or chamomile tea than to heroin or cocaine.  I urge you to reconsider the scheduling, and while I agree that there should be a minimum age limit for kratom purchase as well as quality control, I firmly believe that more harm than good would come out if it ever was banned.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14591","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anon anon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am is Katie Sims and I am a 32 year old full time student, wife and mother of 2.

I was also diagnosed with Fibromyalgia which brought my pain killer use from manageable to a problem. I was miserable without my pain killers but I was also miserable with them. I read about Kratom online and decided to buy a bottle of 75 capsules at a local smoke shop. I followed the suggestions and directions completely and I am still surprised by the results. Not onlhy was I able to get off the pills completely but I was was able to get up, move around and get things accomplished. Kratom has made my life so much easier and more enojoyable.

I developed an opiate addiction beginning with prescription pain medication around the age of 23 (1998). I first lost a job due to my addiction at the age of 26; I then went to jail for possession of drugs at the age of 27. At that time, I honestly couldn't understand why my life was going downhill. I was arrested for drug possession 3 times in a 6-month span in 2002/2003. My addiction left me unemployed between 2002 and 2007. I finally began trying to clean up my life in 2006 - I've held steady employment at most times since then, BUT I've relapsed in 2008 (which sent me to prison) and again in 2012 (again, sent me to prison). I discovered Kratom in 2014. Since then, I've stayed clean and been a stable presence in my 2 children's lives. I've held a job in the mining industry for close to 2 years. If I were to relapse, I would lose both my job and my kids. Kratom has taken away all cravings and helped me handle the stress that used to lead me to relapse. It's basically allowed me to turn my life around. I still work a recovery program, and look forward to eventually phasing kratom out of my life. Until then, I know it helps. I know it helps many others whose addictions are even worse than mine. It's natural, safe and a life saver.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10113","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zachary Heim","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As part of the pain community, I want to say thank you for hearing our remarks over the last few months.

I am writing you today because I feel that Kratom should not be illegal nor should it be classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance. I believe this because I have been drinking Kratom tea for over 2 years now and I believe first hand that it has medicinal and healing benefits for me. I suffer from diagnosed scoliosis and have been taking doctor prescribed pain medication for over 5 years since an injury caused disc herniation in my spine. When a friend of mine recommended that I try drinking Kratom tea instead of taking pain pills, which worked but gave me side effects, I was eager to try something that might be a better alternative. After drinking Kratom tea, I realize that it is a clear alternative to my current medications. I now drink Kratom tea when I wake up in the mornings, when the pain is the worst for me, and in the late afternoon when it returns. I am able to function in my daily activities better when I drink Kratom tea. The most important thing is that I don't feel any dependency on drinking Kratom tea so I feel there is no risk of overuse or addiction. Please do not make Kratom a Schedule 1 controlled substance.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoshua Alon Zylberberg","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15500","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Zylberberg","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello there, I have been taking Kratom for 6 months.

I began using kratom as a means of reducing anxiety/depression and improving concentration while starting my business.  It worked, and I've been using it ever since.  \n\nI didn't even know that it would help me kick my lingering prescription addiction until after I started using it.  At the time I began using kratom, I had been using tramadol (mild opiate with SSRI properties) for the previous 2 years.  Before that, I had been addicted to prescription opiates since I was 19 when I was in a car accident.  Overall, over the last 10 years or so, I have gone from prescription opiates for pain to prescription addiction to tramadol to kratom.  \n\nKratom is the healthiest, most effective option for treating pain, opiate addiction, anxiety (social and chronic), depression, and concentration that I have encountered.  \n\nI have used kratom (which I've purchased) to treat 5 friends who were addicted to opiates, ranging from vicodin to oxycontin and heroin.  3 out of 5 kicked their addictions completely.  The other 2 went back to opiates, because (I believe) they didn't have a computer to purchase large quantities online and there aren't any wholesalers locally.  The 3 that kicked their addictions have stayed clean for the last 2+ years.  However, 1 recently went back to opiate addiction, because local dealers refused to sell after the imposed DEA ban.  Since then, I've contacted her and got her back on her regimen, and, once again, she's going on 2 weeks clean.  A friend of mine who served 3 tours in Iraq also uses it for PTSD and pain caused by shrapnel. \n\nFor me, kratom has been more effective at relieving my friends (and my) opiate cravings and withdrawals than anything else (including methadone and suboxone).  My veteran friend also threw out his prescription medications from the VA, because kratom works better.  In a country that is plagued by opiate addiction, I can't understand why the DEA would want to ban (to me) the single most effective option for relieving opiate cravings/withdrawals.  I also believe that the Veterans Administration should start supplementing kratom to veterans that they have gotten hooked on prescriptions (it's truly a shame...my mother works at the VA, she's ashamed of it too).\n\nKratom is not a drug, it's a plant - a leaf - that has been used for thousands of years with no documented deaths attributed (solely) to overdose.  Please, consider that I've used kratom for years and have a biomedical education...and I know kratom is less dangerous than the many well excepted and commonly used drugs (such as aspirin, which can cause liver damage).\n\nThe DEA banning kratom is like \"friendly fire.\"  They should be using it to treat addiction.  Medical establishments should also be encouraged to use it to treat everything from pain to depression.\n\nThank you for allowing us to comment.  I hope that you hear reason, to keep it legal.\n\nRespectfully, \n\nRobert Anderson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1975","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Anderson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Medicinal plants and extracts are the safest drugs known to mankind.\nNo one has the right to make plants illegal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19448","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \n\nI have lived with diagnosed anxiety, depression and chronic pain for many years.

Kratom is truly a miracle herb that has saved me and so many others from the constant stress and pain and anxieties of every day life! For me personally, sleep disturbances and alcohol have been my worst enemies for several years before being directed to Kratom. I had tried several sleep aids and there was always some awful downside to the effects of those drugs that were recommend to me. Nothing compares to the natural plant of kratom! This plant has helped me fall asleep, stay asleep, sleep soundly, and enhanced the quality of my sleep by completely  improving my sleep patterns tremendously. And if not for Kratom I might still be investing in the depletion of my health by use and abuse of alcohol. I tried to stop drinking several different times in several different ways and nothing could keep me away except for kratom. Please do not take away this life changing, life saving miracle herb!.  No deaths have been associated with Kratom and yet Kratom has potentially saved thousands of lives and the quality of those lives has flipped a hundred fold. I have several friends and family members who can attest to these facts as they had been addicted to medications and other drugs and where no hope seemed possible Kratom has been a breath of fresh air. When you look at these facts and look at what alcohol is doing  to the world you cannot argue to ban Kratom without arguing that alcohol and other intoxicants which do cause harm and death should be banned. It would simply be hypocritical to consider this harmless helpful herb as a substance that should be banned instead of the poison that pharmaceutical companies create and or alcohol or even cigarettes which in fact HAVE lead to abuse and addiction!  It is our right to use Kratom to benefit our lives . So labeling Kratom in comparison with heroin is absurd. And banning this plant will cause tremendous amounts of harm and zero chance of good. Please hear me and save Kratom. Without it, some people might be forced into harmful drugs and alcohol and relapse to ease their pain and struggles. What kind of world would that create? A uncountable amount of accidents and deaths and depression. Isn't that exactly what is supposed to be prevented by this banning? Look at the facts.

I am a former CPhT. I am also a 28 year old mother, student, wife, employee, and recovering addict. I am writing this letter in regards to the DEAs intent to schedule the alkaloids in kratom, Mitragynine and 7-OH-Mitragynine. I will aim not repeat the arguments of others or persuade the DEA. I will not speculate about kratom without evidence. I will not insult those with differing opinions. And I will not write beyond the scope of what my knowledge and education enables me to write. What I will do is cite scientific data and share my own experience with the plant in question, kratom.\n\n\nTo ensure my message is articulated in its entirety, some background information is necessary.\n\nI began abusing drugs when I was 13 to cope with severe depression and anxiety, because I did not even know how to articulate what was wrong. I continued abusing things like cannabis and alcohol, and experimented with other drugs. I quickly found that I had an enormous affinity for opioids. I enjoyed drugs like pentazocine and propoxyphene just as much as I enjoyed morphine or any other C-II. I did not develop an addiction to opioids until I began taking them on a regular basis at age 22; even then it was a psychological addiction. Yet, despite the lack of symptoms of physical addiction, and under duress, I was placed on Suboxone. I tried numerous times to get clean. After discontinuing Suboxone, I experienced physical withdrawal for the first time, and the intense psychological cravings continued. When I was 25, I used intravenous heroin for the first time. I tried to get clean many times. I tried in-patient and out-patient therapy. I tried methadone and suboxone. I tried pure abstinence. Even jail did not abate the pull opioids had on me. I would do just about anything to get them and maintain my addiction.\n\n\nBy early May 2015, I had been raped, lost custody my child, ruined my career, and dropped out of school. I couldnt get or keep a job. I woke up every morning exhausted and in pain. I decided that life was no longer worth living. I thought I had screwed up so badly that the world was better off without me. I tried to intentionally overdose on heroin, but instead that just sparked a binge. Towards the end of that three week binge, I wanted to get clean. I had tried kratom months earlier as a recreational substitute and found it to be a waste of time, but I remembered stories I had heard about people using it to recover. I decided that it was worth a try. That was June 14, 2015. Presently, I am now employed. I am back in school pursuing a degree in neuropharmacology and have maintained straight As. I have a healthy, fulfilling relationship with my child. I have a will to live. I have relief from overwhelming pain. And I have been clean since the day I began taking kratom. This plant has been instrumental in my recovery and my ability to be a responsible productive member of society. My professional opinion is that placing this plant in any schedule would only serve to worsen the current opioid epidemic, and I humbly beseech the DEA to consider this and all other comments in the scheduling process.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18100","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michelle Meadows","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Ive done research and watched many interviews on  this substance.

Whether positive or negative, the FDAs findings must be corroborated with a larger body of research in order to justify legislative action, particularly on the federal level. \n\nThe DEA website provides that \"Schedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse\" (Drug Scheduling), but what true evidence do we currently have for abuse potential and/or medical use of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine beyond anecdotal? In its Intent to Schedule Kratom notice, the DEA notes it \"...is aware of 15 kratom-related deaths between 2014 and 2016\" (Intent to Schedule). However, given that the gross majority (14) of those deaths revealed systemic presence of other drugs/substances at time of death (Silverman, \"Kratom Gets Reprieve\"), kratom can hardly be considered as correlated, much less causal. Yes, there are risks inherent to allowing kratom to remain available for recreational use, but given that we have yet to understand what level of risk we actually face, to schedule the drug in such an extreme way seems an overreaction. The body of proof available currently simply isn't compelling one way or the other. There is more work to be done.\n\nIn order to truly understand the actual risks and rewards we face with this drug, we need to allow research to run its course, which is historically difficult if not impossible on schedule I drugs and substances. \n\nSources:\n\n\"Drug Schedules\".

I am currently taking Kratom. I have been taking Kratom for almost a year. I was taking 9 different medications 3x daily for a total of 27 pills, which included Oxycodone and Xanax that was given to me by the VA hospital which I go to. I have been diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder,Anxiety Disorder,Borderline Personality disorder, along with high blood pressure and severe chronic back pain. All of the medications I was taking were just making everything worse and also became addicted to the Oxy and Xanax. The side effects of the medication were terrible. Once I started taking Kratom I noticed and felt a world of difference. The depression, anxiety, back pain and social issues got so much better. I have had multiple suicide attempts of which one nearly took my life(a gunshot wound which shattered my jaw and some teeth of which I was hospitalized for about 3 weeks with a week in Intensive Care). Kratom has been a life saver for me. I still have little bouts of depression and anxiety but nothing like before when I was taking all the medication. I feel it would be a great injustice if you were to ban Kratom. It has helped alot of people. If banned, I believe, people like myself that are taking it, that suicide rate would go up, emergency room visits for mental health issues would rise and people would go back to taking medication of which they would become addicted to again. I sincerely hope you all take these comments from everyone seriously. Kratom has helped alot of people overcome disorders such as all of mine. If you ban Kratom why not ban tobacco, alcohol, pain killers etc. they are way worse, or is there to much money to be lost in that...Just sayin.

As a mother of three, I am willing to offer my personal testimony to kratom, and how it has improved my life.  Let me explain some of the actions and known effects of Kratom (Mitragyna Speciosa):\n \n Kratom is a tree native to Southeast Asia, whose leaves have been used as a natural therapeutic supplement for thousands of years.\n In small doses it provides an energy boost  its a botanical cousin of coffee, but in higher doses have an analgesic (pain relieving) effect.\n Thousands of testimonials have been written about kratom's efficacy in helping:\nchronic pain, diabetes, fatigue, depression, lack of energy, withdrawal symptoms of opiate and alcohol addiction\n Kratom is non-addictive, and has few side effects\n Users report that it is less addictive than coffee, with those in middle-age being the most frequent and enthusiastic proponents of kratom's benefits.\n \n \nDespite all these wonderful effects, this plant is in danger of being banned in the US by the DEA and FDA.  Ironically their reason for banning this wonderfully safe medicine is that it poses a health risk. Kratom is used recreationally by some people, and recent scares surrounding the synthetic drug 'bath-salts' have led to increased scrutiny on a number of legal substances and plants. This age-old plant is being lumped in with dangerous, unknown synthetic substances, and is under threat of criminalization. If this criminalization occurs, countless sufferers of illness and pain could lose access to a vital natural remedy that they have been using safely for years. Like any plant or medicine, when one regularly ingests excessive amounts of a substance there is a potential for harm. This is true of countless products available for sale in pharmacies and liquor stores today, but few would argue that this means they should be outlawed. If kratom is abused  taken daily in very high doses  it can be mildly addictive, and can also cause nervousness, sleeplessness, loss of libido, constipation and the darkening of skin complexion.  However, there have been no recorded deaths due to the use of kratom, which highlights its safety.\n \nA case can certainly be made for the restriction of sale of kratom to minors, and responsible vendors have called for self-policing and an industry code of conduct. Senator A.G. Crowe recently withdrew a proposal to outlaw the sale of kratom in Louisiana after hundreds of people signed a petition against the plan, however he plans to put forward legislation to instate a minimum age of 18 for anybody purchasing the leaf  a move that is presumably not opposed by the majority of those who responsibly use kratom.  We have seen time and time again that prohibition simply worsens the social impact of drug use, causing further health risks for users and providing criminal gangs with money that could instead be directed towards tax coffers. \n \nPublic health should be not seen through a lens so narrow that it that disregards practically all alternatives to Western medicine and pharmaceutical drugs. We call upon citizens, policymakers, and politicians to support the reform of archaic drug policy for the benefit of society, and to respect people's innate right to use all natural plants and herbs.\n \nThank you for your time and my prayer is that you help join the fight to regulate not prohibit the use of this natural herbal tea.\n \nShea Anderson\n(34 year old Mother of Three, Masters in Education and Finance)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1004","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shea Anderson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has saved my life and kept me opiate free for 16 months .

This is clearly the most socially responsible way to deal with this issue.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0372","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ana jamborcic","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Stop the madness","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18683","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"2 and a half years ago I had a knee surgery.

It for me is like coffee, give's me energy for the day and makes it easy to stay motivated while calming my nerves. That's something coffee can't do for me, I get shaky when I drink caffine. So for me kratom really helps my productivity. I would be very disappointed if the choice to use kratom was taken away. \nSince Ive started to take kratom I've had a dramatic change in my personal relationships. Im more social at family events, enough to where my family has said they notice the new me. They have said they haven't seen me this healthy and happy in a long time. I am more mild mannered in disputes with my significant other and at work. All around it really has improved my life.\n\nSince this is something that is very hard to abuse, the only motivation I can think of for it being banned would be money? \nIf that's the case I would hope instead of making it illegal and punishing people that use it. Why not tax it more? Its not dangerous. But I could see how a lot of drug companies would be against this because it can be used to replace harmful prescription's for some people and that costs drug companies and the government money, bet they are paying to try and make this not be an alternative to their drugs. But this is America, land of the free and I think quality of life should come before profits. But if thats not an option tax it till its profitable if you have to, just dont take away the peoples ability to choose. Thanks for your time.

The giant ones that pave highways) tumbled down a hill and landed on top of her. She survived, but the rest of her life was never ending, relentless, excruciating pain. Her doctors didn't care that she was suffering. So she turned to alcohol. It was the only thing that she could get her hands on to help relive even just a small amount of the pain. If only I had known of kratom at the time... I truly believe with all my heart that she would still be here today. It could have helped her in so many ways, and would not have jeopardized her liver in the manner that the alcohol did. I have witnessed the miracle of kratom with other people I know, I think it is a huge mistake to take it away from the hundreds of thousands of people that rely upon it. If it is banned, those people will continue to suffer, and without a doubt turn to other extreme methods to find relief. Methods that will likely be harmful, or illegal, or worse.

In addition to helping ease my chronic sciatica pain, it's the only \"medicine\" that's ever really helped my bipolar and borderline personality disorders. Most people take kratom as an opiate substitute, but it should be noted that its use in psychological disorders is at least as valid, if not more, as we often have no working alternative drug therapies (not even evil opiates) that actually do any noticeable good - and many have horrible, even fatal side-effects. \n\nI've suffered from Steven Johnsons Syndrome resulting from a mood stabilizer, which was truly awful despite being a milder case, and I suggest you not google it while eating. Kratom is, for me, far more effective than prescription medication, and unlike other herbal remedies like marijuana, doesn't get me high, and so I'm able to keep my wits about me and work productively while taking it - and has no noticeable side effects beyond mild constipation, which I'll take over SJS any day!\n\nBorderline Personality is non-curable, and very difficult to treat, often with limited success, and most suffers are on long-term disability/welfare due to inability to function in any consistent manner over any reasonable length of time. Kratom has kept me steadily employed for several years now, with jobs lasting longer than ever before in my life. \n\nI have stopped taking kratom more than once to try and save money or see if I would be alright without it, and although I had no withdrawal symptoms I would start slipping back into my old state of being, having more and more \"bad days\", within weeks to a couple of months of quitting. No other drugs I've attempted (and there have been many) have worked for this disorder to the degree kratom does. It improves my quality of life tremendously and I'm not sure what I would do without it now, honestly.\n\nMy oldest daughter suffers from Asperger's, an Autism Spectrum Disorder. She used to have crippling social anxiety, among other debilitating symptoms, and couldn't even purchase items at a store unaccompanied. After my own experiences with kratom I suggested she try it to see if it helped her as well, since some of kratom's well known effects are to make people fee more open to new experiences, outgoing, more \"connected\" to others, and generally less anxious and depressed. It seemed fitting.\n\nIt's done nothing short of turn her life around. She's now a successfully employed, social and confident college student with a significant other, living a 99% normal life instead of a scared young adult trapped in her own mind. Treating Autism is something I don't believe kratom has even been considered for, with much of its focus on opiate addiction and pain management, and there are no good (and few FDA approved) drug therapies for treating Autism - definitely none that even pretend to work to this degree. This could be a huge boon to so many sufferers on the spectrum, enabling them to live more functional, fruitful, fulfilled and generally happy, normal lives. I would specifically like to see studies done on this before it's hastily banned when it has so much potential! Autism is huge nowadays!\n\nAs if the above alone wasn't enough to justify more research (and not banning) of kratom, it also treats both me and my daughter's frequent migraine headaches, and works better than Ibuprofin - which is continually being warned against due to side effects of heart attack and stroke - or any other pain reliever we've tried.\n\nKratom is the single thing that keeps myself and my daughter - among many others - employed, functional citizens, paying taxes and living fulfilling lives, instead of being societal burdens, stuck on disability, seeking help that doesn't exist in the pathetic state of our current mental health system.\n\nIf you go through with banning this natural remedy - which I'm opposed to in principle as well and support marijuana legalization also despite getting no useful effect from it myself - you'll be causing millions of people (look at the numbers involved in the outcry against banning) pain, suffering, and possible loss of livelihood and/or quality of life, vs this supposed \"immanent threat\" which includes what? A few hundred calls to poison centers (how many do they get for OTC medications), and a small handful of deaths that have all involved other drugs and can't be definitively linked to kratom (again, give us numbers relative to OTC or prescription drugs widely available also)? \n\nThat hardly sounds like a reasonable tradeoff, even if the cited issues did exist - and there's a huge amount of contention on the cited data to begin with. Leave kratom alone or be prepared to deal with the massive backlash of millions of users losing the only thing that helps them and having to resort to far less desirable alternatives - if any are available at all. The extra burden on our healthcare system alone would be substantial! \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11087","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern kratom has helped me tremendously with my mental and physical state which has been deteriorating for quite a while.

I had the second one replaced 6 months later. I was born with a condition called acetabular protusio, which is the medical term for a malformation of the hip sockets. I was diagnosed in my 20s. I made it to 57 before I couldn't function without the surgery. Unfortunately, instead of improving my life, the surgeries fixed the original problem but left in its place many many more, and I am in pain every waking hour. I have travelled far and wide for a solution but no doctor has been able to help. My life has been all but destroyed as I can no longer do most of the things I loved to do--even walking around the house hurts. I hate taking drugs and avoid painkillers. I had to take opioids immediately post-surgery as almost everyone does, but after two weeks or so I switched to ibuprofen, which I have been taking a small dose of ever since. Needless to say, it doesn't do much for me. I recently heard about Kratom and have just this week taken some to ease my pain and help with the depression that comes with pain and immobility. I am thrilled to find something safe and readily available with very few side effects, which are manageable. This herb has given me hope that I will have some of my life back. I am too young to have the lifestyle of a 90 year old woman. Today I went for a long walk with my husband. I had some pain, but not nearly as much as I would have had without a low dose of Kratom. Thanks to the community, I have been able to study dosage and such carefully, and I have begun very cautiously, with good results. Please don't take away this first and only hope I have of a reasonably active life. In the summer my daughter got married and I was in severe pain all day long at her wedding, although I put a smile on my face as usual. If I had known about Kratom, I might have enjoyed the day more. It is my strong belief that for future family events, I will have Kratom to bring me relief so I can enjoy the grandchildren I hope for, and my son's wedding one day too.

I would like to say that kratom has done for me what many pharmaceutical drugs could not for my clinically diagnosed chronic depression, acute anxiety, PTSD, and alcoholism. I have struggled with alcoholism for years. It negatively impacted many aspects of my life, I.e; job loss, relationships, financial insecurity, personal health, among many other things. I find that this is a virtually harmless way to treat my issues. There lies very few cons, and the pros outweigh them tremendously. It allowed me to put down the drinking. Cravings virtually are non existent. The diagnosis of anxiety and depression have diminshed to a point far superior than any antidepressants or mood stabilizers have done. I've been able to null the continuous dire health issues I was facing because of these issues. It has improved my life to a point I'd never imagined was possible after struggling endlessly with these seemingly unresolvable matters of mental and physical health. Alas, I could make a very vast list with examples but that would exceed my character limit. In conclusion, I fear the consequences that might pursue this ban, for the many people that rely on this plant that is no different then someone, I.e; me, that relies on continuous doses of antidepressants that possess some terrible side effects. Without the use of this, I cannot say how I'd manage my mental health issues or my alcoholism. I am incredibly adamant on my overwhelming dissent of opposition of this possible scheduling. I appreciate your time, and I hope this comment will aid in the efforts of I, and, many, many others in the pursuit of views that speak in opposition of the proposed ban.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21274","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dylan Beresford","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Nickee Anderson.

Kratom is a beneficial plant not comparable to heroin or meth. \n\nI have been using kratom for over two years. I have both scoliosis and degenerate disk disease which leaves me in chronic pain.

The horrendous pain led me to depression. I couldn't wrap my mind around being so young and in so much pain. I feared for my children in the way of them having an active involved mother. I don't and didn't want to parent them from my bed being that that's where my pain left me most days. I live for them and the thought of letting them down crushed my soul. I started to research natural alternatives and that is when I found kratom. That very day changed my life forever! My pain was gone and my depression was lifted!

I recently fell extremely sick. I had my appendix removed, pneumonia, and I still have a pulmonary nodule in my lung. Now I have a long family history of drug abuse and overdoses. I have also lost many of my friend to their opiate use. I have avoided opiates until after my surgery. I was in so much pain. I ended up getting addicted to my prescribed percocet. This was one of the scariest times in my 23 years. I could not stop on my own. I have no insurance so I could not afford a suboxone treatment. Suboxone is very hard to quit too. I have a couple of friends who have been on suboxone for years. I ended up using kratom which worked wonderfully. I am happy to report that I am drug free because of kratom. Kratom saved my life. I am all for regulation of dangerous drugs (herion, crack, meth, etc.), but kratom is not one of these. There are no cases where kratom alone caused a death. Real unadulterated kratom should be available to everyone even poor and uninsured people. There is a massive drug problem in the county, and making kratom illegal will worsen the symptoms. By taking away this safe alternative to hard drugs and addictive pharmaceuticals, the people who use kratom for pain management will be force the live in agony or return to these hard drugs. Just look at the spike in overdoses in Arkansas right after they banned kratom. It will also put more non-violent people in jail, and it will ruin many people's lives. No one wants to be an addict, but no one wants to live in pain either. and we will never be able to rid the world of drugs and at the very least kratom is a form of harm reduction.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0923","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Audrey Green","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jazmin, and I am here to defend my kratom for so many different reasons. Kratom has changed my life in the most positive way possible. Just like so many others out there, I have suffered from chronic back pain for many years. I did my part in going to physical therapy and exercising but still had alot of pain and discomfort. Of course whenever I went to the doctors they would only throw addictive pills at me, and this was not a risk I was willing to take. I have a future and would like to keep that future without becoming addicted or dependent on a pill. Finally I found a natural plant called kratom, I research everything I put in my body so of course I did that with kratom. I was willing to try it and it was the best thing that has happened to me as far as taking care of my health. While having back problems I also suffered from severe anxiety and depression. Kratom really made a positive change in my life and I was able to feel normal again WITHOUT having to suffer from side effects and being \"high\" out of my mind. I did not want that for myself just like so many others. My dad, who was in the military and has been deployed over 4 times, and was once a frontline soldier, has also found opportunity within kratom. He is now retired after 22 years and suffers from PTSD, and chronic knee and back pain. Once again, the doctors wanted to throw addictive painkillers at him but he refused to take them knowing the consequences it could have. I explained to him what kratom was and even though he was skeptical at first, he tried it. It has helped him tremendously and I am so thankful that I don't have to see my father, who served this country, in so much physical and mental pain anymore. I am so happy that he can experience a better and healthier life because he deserves it. We all deserve to have the choice to buy kratom and to have a better option for our health and well being. No one deserves to live with pain, fear, depression and then addiction just because they wanted to live a normal life, but didnt have any other options to choose from. My dad and many other solider's have fought and lost their lives for us to have freedom, a better life, and to make our own choice's. Why would you take our choice to have a happier, safer, and healthier lifestyle? Don't take our freedom of choice. Don't take the positivity out of people's lives. Don't take kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19976","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jazmin Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Let Kratom be legal!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11457","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon Johnson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern: \n\nI am a devout Catholic (I attend Mass regularly), I am also a lawyer (University of Memphis, School of Law 2010), and I am an entrepreneur (I successfully run three small businesses).

It is extremely unlikely that this is a plant that can cause a fatal overdose. In the most severe cases, it can, however, cause nausea. The amount taken must be regulated; as taking large amounts can have similar effects to drinking too much alcohol. Similar to Alcohol, if an individual took an exceedingly large amount, it would be dangerous to get behind the wheel of an automobile. \n\nThe main difference in Kratom and Alcohol is that Alcohol can be fatal in large amounts, and Kratom is very, very likely not fatal, even in rare instances when exceedingly large amounts are ingested. \n\nI believe that Kratom, as a plant, should be researched extensively for its benefits and possible dangers (if any) before it is taken away from the American people. I also believe that Kratom is not a problem, but an opportunity, for the DEA as a natural remedy and combatant to the current heroin epidemic that is destroying so many lives.

That no pharmaceutical company has been sufficiently motivated by profit to apply for FDA permission to sell this plant as a drug should not be the measure of whether this plant has any known beneficial uses. Thousands of years of its use informs any sentient human being - the DEA notwithstanding - to the contrary. Scientific studies show kratom to be safer and better treatment for symptoms of withdrawal from opiods than methadone. If you schedule this PLANT and send it to the underground, you will be placing lives at risk, much like you do with your entire prohibition regime. Its time for the DEA to enter the 21st Century. Imposing a ban on kratom based entirely on anecdotal evidence and without scientific study would be an abomination. Fifteen of the sixteen deaths attributed to kratom involved people with multidrug toxicity and it is irresponsible for you to attribute these deaths to kratom. As a plant in the coffee family, it is about as addictive as coffee which you choose not to regulate. Therefore, screaming \"its addictive\" is not a convincing argument that it needs to be scheduled. Most people reading this have been addicted to coffee for decades with no known adverse consequences. Anything is subject to abuse. Sugar poses a greater threat to the public health than kratom, yet I can buy four pound bags of it for $1.50 a few blocks from my home. High fructose corn syrup also poses a much greater and PRESENT threat to the public health than kratom. Moreover, kratom is not highly likely to be abused as people looking to \"get high\" have many more options that provide a more reliable and pleasant \"high\" than can be obtained from using kratom. Frankly, the scheduling of kratom appears to me to be nothing more than the protection of the big pharmaceutical companies that peddle methadone. Looking back on why Thailand originally outlawed kratom, recall it was because tax receipts on their government run opium monopoly were falling due to kratom use. Ask yourself: is it better that people be using kratom instead of opiods? There is only one answer to this question. Just look at the deaths in this country from opiod abuse.

That being said, to put kratom on the schedule 1 list shows ignorance to the substance and would be the biggest case of misjudgment since the scheduling of marijuana. The bill states: \n\nTo find that placing a substance temporarily into schedule I of the CSA is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety, the Administrator is required to consider three of the eight factors set forth in section 201(c) of the CSA, 21 U.S.C. 811(c): the substance's history and current pattern of abuse; the scope, duration and significance of abuse; and what, if any, risk there is to the public health. 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(3). Consideration of these factors includes actual abuse, diversion from legitimate channels, and clandestine importation, manufacture, or distribution. 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(3).\n\nJudging something by its pattern of abuse is a nebulous and seemingly asinine way of determining if it should be restricted from the whole country's population. If the meaning of abuse is \"to use badly\" or \"to use improperly\", how can one objectively say a substance is being abused. Kratom is a less addicting, cheap, and less harmful alternative to prescription painkillers. It is used for just that reason, it helps people in pain. In addition, kratom has also been a godsend from people suffering from anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders, myself included. Where can the line be drawn between use and abuse? Can a substance only be abused when there are dangerous, life threatening side effects like those of alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine? If so, why aren't those banned?\n\nAnnual tobacco related deaths in America: 480,000[1]\nAnnual alcohol related deaths in America: 88,000[1]\nDeaths from kratom worldwide between 2014-2016: 15[2]\n\nOf the 15 reported deaths, it was found that other drugs were used in conjunction[2]. To say that kratom is more dangerous than already legal substances is a blatant lie and the American people should not stand for it. Banning kratom could make thousands of recovering opiate addicts resort back to prescription painkillers. To me, it is clear that the only motive for banning kratom is money related. Quickly putting a substance that has saved thousands of lives into a drug schedule that classifies it as having \"no medicinal value\" and \"highly abusable\" shows that the DEA does not even want to look into its potential benefits. At the time of writing this, over 142,000 people have signed the petition to stop the kratom banned[3]. The American people have spoken. We do not want kratom banned.\n\nreferences:\n1. http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/Causes_of_Death\n2. https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/02/kratom-devotees-fight-for-supplement/\n3. https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/please-do-not-make-kratom-schedule-i-substance","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0200","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"P Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, to whomever it may concern.

I am a 46 year old house wife with a Master's degree in Science. Struggling with lupus, fibromyalgia, IBS, and kidney issues for 19 years. I have been to the top Dr's in the country and spent money on medications that have never helped. All the pharmaceutical medications on the market do nothing to help and if anything they make it worse. After finding Kratom I was able to quit taking 8 RX Doctor prescribed medications and finally go back to work part time after years of being bed ridden and totally helpless. With Kratom, other organic herbs, organic diet, and Dr's supervision on the changes I have made I am able to be a productive individual. Please take into consideration what Kratom has done for others with autoimmune diseases. Kratom is a natural herb that aids in my daily life and helps me live. \nI have gone to several different doctors in an attempt to treat my pain and they keep sending me home with addictive and dangerous pills. Kratom is a safe alternative that has helped alleviate some of my pain. It doens't treat or cure any of my ailments but it does help with the symptoms. I have been using kratom for pain relief for over two years and have not had a single negative side affect. I am not addicted and have no withdrawals when I stop taking the kratom. There has never been a single death in the hundreds of years of kratom use, as opposed to the thousands of deaths every year from prescription drugs. I am not a drug addict and have never done street drugs of any kind. Kratom is safe, effective, has no side effects or withdrawals. It is a plant that can be used as an herbal supplement and that is a God given right for us to have access to. I choose plants over pills and request that it not be scheduled in ANY schedule as it poses absolutely no risk to anyone. I would like to see it added to the list of supplements covered under the FDA Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. Please listen to science and anecdotal evidence, kratom is not a danger and should not be controlled. Thank you for your consideration!

Reconstructive surgery and years of therapy allowed me to use it again, but not without serious chronic pain, debilitating acute pain associated with moderate use of my hand, and insomnia caused by pain. \n\nI've tried just about every prescription or over-the-counter drug for pain relief, including opiates and medical marijuana, as well as dozens of dietary supplements. The best pain relief with no side effects I've had comes from kratom. Taking kratom as a regular dietary supplement has made life livable and allowed me to follow my desired career path.\n\nI've taken kratom for three years now. Before my injury, I worked in remodeling houses (my family's business) for about a decade. My injury made such work impossible, but every other job I worked (in science research and writing) also caused acute pain from repetitive hand use. Since I began taking kratom regularly, I have regained work remodeling and can continue my writing work without frequent breaks. This kratom use also helps me to fall asleep and stay asleep instead of writhing awake from pain. Furthermore, my lifelong practice of piano became impossible after my injury but with kratom again enriches my life.\n\nKratom is extremely valuable to my well-being and has had essentially no negative impacts. If by accident (which is hardly possible) I take too much kratom, at worst, I feel nauseous and sleepy.\n\nKratom is not a drug and should not be regulated as such. It should be in the same category as coffee, wild lettuce, or kava. Kratom is about as addictive as coffee. Kratom is not possible to abuse since it is not a recreational drug and one cannot get \"high\" from it.\n\nKratom is a botanical dietary supplement indispensable for millions of Americans to reduce pain, sleep soundly, or to feel calm, concentrated, or uplifted in mood.\n\nTo schedule kratom would be absolutely devastating to my life and millions of others. That kratom has any of the characteristics meriting a schedule 1 substance has no basis in science or fact.\n\nThese recent articles are just a few of the many that show that kratom is safe to take, and poses no medical risk:\nhttp://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2588524\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bz83v89y59h5kky/112916%20AKA%20ER%20trauma%20med%20professionals%20survey%20news%20release.docx?dl=0\n\nComment by: Cyrus Harp, 29 years old, general contractor for home renovation and non-fiction writer.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19547","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban Kratom as I believe it to be a possible exit drug from opioids.

I started using kratom about 3 years ago. It has changed my life for the better. I used to be an alcoholic. I realized I was drinking to relieve anxiety. A friend told me about kratom so I thought it was worth trying. After trying it I was able to quit drinking instantly. I've been sober for 3 years now! So whenever I feel that anxiety coming on I just take a little kratom. It has very few side effects if any and is about as addicting as coffee. You can't say that about any man made pharmaceuticals. Any way if kratom were  to become illegal my quality of life would go down the gutter. I would probably start drinking again or have to get prescribed some dangerous pharmaceutical.  I hope that this helps save kratom. God created kratom for a reason. It's such a wonderful herbal supplement!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21542","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I started taking Kratom in April of 2016.

I've been depressed for the passed 8 years because I haven't been able to work or sometimes get out of bed from the pain and when I found that Kratom was helping so many people I decided to try it as well.

With my doctors help I quit taking both medications I was on and only take minimal amount of kratom daily. My liver is in better shape and I'm not on any prescribed medications since August.

My name is Kelly Meredith, I am 47 years old, married, and Ive worked in the technical department of an environmental company for over twenty-five years.  I was diagnosed several years ago with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder, and I currently take prescribed medication which keeps the worst of my symptoms under control.  I also run about twenty miles per week and do yoga at least once per week, and these both help as well.\n\nI started drinking Kratom tea a little over two years ago. It was suggested to me by a friend of my husbands, and I noticed that it lessened some of my anxiety symptoms that arent controlled by other methods. The effect is subtle--the closest thing I can liken it to is coffee.  I feel uplifted, but unlike coffee, I dont get jittery.  Instead I feel both alert and calm at the same time. Occasionally I have some mild back pain from sitting at a desk all day, and Kratom seems to help with that as well.  Earlier this year I completed my Masters in Information and Library Science, and I feel that Kratom helped with test anxiety and the general anxiety of being in school.  My husband drinks Kratom tea often with me, and my 74 year old mother recently started drinking it to help with her anxiety and with some of her rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.  \n\nPutting Kratom on a schedule will have a negative impact on me and my family.  It is now part of our lives in much the same way coffee or tea is, and I believe it to be just as benign-in no way do I agree that it is as dangerous as LSD or Heroin.  I think it should be regulated like other drinks such as coffee or tea, or as a supplement.  \n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nSincerely, \n\nKelly Meredith","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16222","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kelly Meredith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir,\n\nAfter 26 years of officiating ice hockey, I was forced to retire due to severe foot pain in both feet.

Americans are becoming increasingly addicted to opioids as the dosage has to be increased over long-term use. Unfortunately, opioids are also one of the easiest prescriptions to get from your doctor. Personally, I've been prescribed various opioids for the common cold, muscle tension, and post-surgery recovery. Prescription takers are more likely to develop a heroin addiction because opioids are highly addictive and have terrible withdrawal symptoms. However, even without addiction, opioids have many harmful side effects, even for short term users. \n\tKratom on the other hand, has been safely used not only in place of opioids but also to recover heroin addictions. It eases chronic pain and withdrawal symptoms. People should be provided with a safe alternative to dangerous prescription drugs. More importantly, people need to have the option to try both methods to see what works for them the best.

I am a 38 year old, hard-working father of three, 1 teenager, an 8 year old and a 4 year old.  Perhaps you can imagine and appreciate the relief and security I felt when I found a safe, natural alternative to opiate painkillers.  I read on the news that there are now more Americans using opiates than tobacco.  The pharmaceutical companies are obviously doing very well.  I understand age restrictions but to label this as more dangerous than alcohol or tobacco is completely ridiculous.  Kratom does not kill people, in fact it saves lives.  It provides a safe alternative to much much more dangerous opiates, and it is crazy to make such a substance illegal.  The right, moral and ethical thing to do is leave it alone!  Please do not cave in to greed and money.  Kratom is safer, much less likely to be abused, it works, and it helps hard working, responsible people like me stay away from the dangers of opiate addiction, or even infinitely more important, it keeps it out of my household and therefore out of the hands of my children.  Please do the right thing.  Why on earth would you make something that saves lives illegal and turn people into criminals?  Who are you protecting?

It said that it was an opiate like drug that produced the same effects and danger as other opiates like heroin and prescription pain medication. Naturally I immediately ordered some. Having taken opiates in the past, the thought of a leagal (for now) drug that can be ordered over the Internet that produced the same effects as other opiates sounded too good to be true. Sure enough, it was too good to be true. It was not even the least bit opiate like in its effects, and there certainly was no \"high\" involved, no matter how much I took. At best it made me feel similar to drinking chamomile tea. But what it did do, which was a surprise to me, was aleveate my restless leg syndrome and the chronic cramp in my foot that RLS caused. \n\nI started researching kratom more and reading about the experiences of others who were regular kratom users and found their experiences to be similar to mine. It produces a mild analgesic effect, but nothing on par with regular opiates. I also found that the primary reason most people use it is to manage severe pain that previously had to be treated with dangerous and addictive prescription opiates. Some even use it to get and stay off heroin! \n\nIt also turned out the dangers reported about kratom were either outright lies or gross exaggerations. More people die a year from drinking too much water than have ever died from taking kratom. Clearly the public health crisis and danger to society kratom has been made out to be is false. I won't go into the reasons for why I believe the DEA has chosen to mislead the public about kratom, but it definitely is not for the best interests of the general public. \n\nKratom is a safe and helpful alternative to deadly and habit forming prescription drugs, and should NOT be scheduled by the DEA. The idea that the DEA can turn law abiding citizens into felons overnight by scheduling a natural and harmless plant is sickening and an abuse of the power they have been granted by congress. Though I do need to thank the DEA for making me aware of this life changing plant that I now rely on for a good night sleep and a pain free work day, and I sincerely hope you thoughtfully consider this and the many other accounts from kratom users when you make your final decision on kratom scheduling.

I am writing to oppose the\nscheduling of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, constituents of the Kratom plant, under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). I consume it for health and well-being.\nI have worked on healing my physical body from a horrible horse accident (1994) and a failed ankle arthroplasty (2001) as an attempt to get my life back from this accident in which my ankle was crushed. Due to the nature of this botched surgery, I was diagnosed with PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and therefore had a mental/emotional issue that also had to be contended with which included severe depression. \n12 medications later, I was fraught with the developing side-effects. \nI have a BA in Equine Science and have some graduate work in Counselor Education. As a previous counselor and coordinator of programming in the field of Chemical Dependency, I quickly realized that the medications and the dependency on them were going to shorten my life and so started working diligently on healing using alternative and natural means by which to do so.\n Also, as an Equine massage and physiotherapist who has researched and incorporated Integrative Medicine and Holistic Health Care into my life and my work for the past 26 years I have a fairly extensive knowledge of how this healing process works naturally!\nI was introduced to Kratom in April of this year (2016) after being told by my doctor that due to new CDC regulatory guidelines there would be a decrease in pain medication.\nSo I began research to figure out what else I could do to help myself with the continued process of healing since I would no longer be permitted to manage it with the medicines.\nAfter doing fairly extensive research on the safety and efficacy of this plant I figured it couldnt hurt to try it. Much to my surprise and relief, the addition of this herbal tea helped immensely. I have been able to consume the tea and get relief from the physical pain of the ankle. I have also found support from this amazing plant in that I am finding relief from the anxiety and the depression from the PTSD that I have refused to take prescription medications for over the last several years. \nAs a result, I feel as though I have a new life. I have been able to work more regularly, take on new clientele, and have been able to spend more time with my family&my grand-kids&something that I have struggled with for so long. I actually HAVE a life now. I do NOT get high from this plant (and do NOT use marijuana for that very reason) and have experienced ZERO side effects. \nI have noticed that this proposed ban comes on the heels of the new CDC regulatory guidelines. These guidelines and the resulting panic with the medical doctors in their actions to decrease or stop the pain management programming have created havoc and in my opinion have increased the numbers in the opiate epidemic.  So many people are being discharged from their pain-management programs that despite the side-effects, were giving most people at least some semblance of quality of life (especially the veterans!) Many of these people have discovered Kratom and have improved their lives beyond what the medical profession was giving them\n I have also noticed that there is a huge (and genuine) concern for the opiate epidemic and this decrease in pain-management in the medical field has not helped. Now there is an herbal supplement that can essentially be a huge part in healing this epidemic and help people to get their lives back and the DEA wants to take it away?  Now I am very concerned about how this decision would affect the opiate epidemic! If hundreds of thousands of people are using this herb responsibly for various reasons instead of opiates (including heroin), how do you think this is going to affect the epidemic? \nAnother thing that stuck out to me was the economic impact that this would have. I have read several articles and surveys on the economic impact that this ban would create. \nhttps://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.botanical-education.org%2Feconomic-impact-kratom%2F&h=uAQGZSqla&s=1 \nWith all of these implications, this proposed ban is the most ridiculous and deplorable thing I think I have ever heard of! Personally, I would agree with some responsible and appropriate regulation in order to keep this whole natural plant unadulterated and possibly an age limitation but since the unadulterated whole plant is clearly safe and beneficial, I would appreciate able to continue to make my own choice about consuming it!\nCLEARLY keeping this plant legal and available would be in the very BEST interest of ALL! \nSincerely,\nMarcilyn Brient","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20945","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marcilyn Brient","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have taken kratom for fiur months and it has helped me with my lowee back pain and it gives me more energy.

This ban is not only unnecessary, but it's potentially perilous to chronic pain sufferers and recovering addicts. \n\nA good friend of mine suffers from chronic pain due to an injury she experienced in her work place. For years, she struggled to get doctors to take her pain seriously, as medical professional after medical professional failed to find a diagnosis. After following the advice of the doctors she visited, she was flagged as a \"drug seeker\" and essentially blacklisted from receiving treatment. Her debilitating pain prevents her from working, and even everyday tasks like going to the grocery store can be thwarted by bouts of pain that compel her back into her house for hours or even days at a time. She exhausted avenues such as chiropractic treatment and homeopathy. A couple of years ago, in her efforts to take ownership of her health in the face of a system that would no longer help her, she discovered kratom. This has been the cornerstone of a series of lifestyle changes that have permitted her to go back on the job market, resume directing a choir in conjunction with her church, and look ahead toward a happy marriage with her fianc. \n\nThe DEA proposes listing kratom as a Schedule 1 drug citing imminent danger to the public from its continued use, a claim that is not borne out in the numbers. Kratom, by itself, has been linked to no fatalities (it's only in connection with other drug use that kratom has been tagged as a dangerous substance), nor does it cause a high that endangers the user nor those around them. Meanwhile, it is effective in alleviating chronic pain and an affordable, homeopathic means for heroin addicts to detox and break their cycles of addiction. \n\nIn a healthcare system where, despite efforts at reform, too many patients still slip through the cracks and we rely too heavily on pharmaceuticals whose costs continue to skyrocket, solutions such as kratom need to be available without government intervention. Moreover, in a political climate where increasing attention is being paid by both political parties to the crisis of heroin addiction across the United States, it would be nothing short of disingenuous to ban the use of a plant demonstrated to help addicts quit on their own.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12714","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jessica Lynam","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 40 year old woman working in the software industry as a project manager, my company works closely with Fortune 100 companies providing their infrastructure. I have am an accredited PM and have a Bachelors degrees in Psychology. I also have chronic pain due to a riding injury which shattered my hip when I was 18, a shattered coccyx and symptomatic degenerated discs in my lower back. I cannot stand for more than about 15 minutes without pain, which becomes intense to the point of being unable to move after about 45 minutes. I also have clinical depression, anxiety and C-PTSD. I have years lost to impaired function due to either the pharmaceuticals needed to combat the worst of my symptoms, or the mental exhaustion in managing these health issues without prescription medication as my job requires me to be focused and sharp, which takes a great deal of mental fortitude, often lost when I'm on medication. Additionally I am unfortunate enough to suffer from most of the side effects of medication, so careful choices must be made as sometimes they can be worse than actually gritting my teeth and suffering. \n\nThat was until I found out about Kratom earlier this year. On the first day I started a small 1 teaspoon dose, I was astounded at the effect. Not only am I now almost pain free, but I have my emotional stability and clarity back as well. My husband was moved to tears on the first day only an hour after I took my first dose, he said he felt like the woman he had fallen in love with had come back home. I have been more impact-full and focused at my job, I am able to do simple things most people take for granted like clean my home or go for a walk without being crippled in pain for days afterwards. The only side effects I have are a little dry mouth and extremely mild nausea within a half hour of first taking a dose. After several months I'm not taking a higher dose that I originally started with (the 1 teaspoon) nor do I feel any need to take more. I have been able to come of all prescribed medication for both my chronic pain and my mental health with the approval of my doctors... I've even lost weight because I'm now able to be so mobile! \n\nI almost feel like a teenager again. I cannot imagine life without this simple herbal remedy, and it's not just the impact it's had on my own health, but the impact on my husband, family and friends who have also had a huge weight lifted from them even though their not taking it. No longer does my husband have to be my care giver and be wary of my mental health at detriment to his own needs, no one needs to be mindful of how they speak to me, we can all actually go out together as a group instead of my anxiety keeping me at home alone or only able to be out for a short time. \n\nI've studied this herbal supplement in depth, and while I understand the concern to keep harmful items out of the public's general access, this is not something to restrict. Rather it's something that should be allowed to be available, and with raising awareness, safe use becomes the burden of the user. I understand the DEA has had concerns over 12 deaths thus far linked to Kratom, but in every single case Kratom was just one substance in a cocktail taken by the person who died. Kratom is no more the cause of the death in those cases than alcohol is the cause of the death of someone who mixes too many pills with their drinking. Raising awareness of safe use is the only thing that needs to happen, as the unsafe use cannot happen with Kratom alone. Therefore the responsibility should be on the user who chooses to use unsafely, just as the drinker is held responsible for drinking while taking pills, not the alcohol. \n\nPlease do not punish the many tens of hundreds, if not hundreds of thousands of people who are using this beneficial herbal supplement to manage pain & mental health safely and without any more addiction than Coffee (which I'm sure many in your offices would say they're addicted to!). There always will be the reckless and unsafe few who will take the greatest risks in chasing a high. And Kratom is NOT a high in any sense of the word, if anything it's a stabilizer, a normalizer - I know from my experience that it is pretty amazing to not feel caged by my anxiety or crippled by my pain, and one could liken that amazing normalcy as a \"high\" if to you it feels like a miracle just to not be in pain physically and emotionally, but it cannot be compared to any other  mind altering drug like heroin or even marijuana. It sharpens and clarifies, not dulls and disassociates. \n\nThank you for this opportunity, I look forward to you making the rational and compassionate decision, and leaving Kratom as a dietary supplement to allow awareness to grow that it is NOT a \"high\" to chase, and for its safe use to be widely understood.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2752","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been incredibly helpful in managing my chronic pain which previously was being treated with oxycodone 100mg per day.

I wanted to know why sleeping for twenty hours a day was preferable to leaving my bed and doing anything with my life -- I got nothing but judgment and echoed sentiments of \"We can't help you, try another doctor\". I couldn't even get a doctor to touch my back to feel the knots that kept me from sleeping. For three years, that was how I lived. I literally did not leave my bed. I was constantly in pain. The first thing I did every morning when I woke up was cry -- every single morning, I wished that I had just died in my sleep so I wouldn't have to deal with yet another day of excruciating agony, of hating myself and my life, of lashing out at my friends and family. I didn't have any hope left, I had completely given up. \nThen, my friend introduced me to Kratom . It gave me my life back. Within moments of trying it, my back didn't hurt. I cried again that day, but not because of pain or depression. I cried because I could finally do what I wanted with my time and with my life. I could get out of bed and do the dishes. I could take my dogs for walks again. I could be nice to people again without concentrating only on pain and anger. Because of this plant, and the support and love of my friends and family, I'm going to finish college in two weeks. It's taken me seven years, but I'm finally going to graduate -- and I owe that to the pain relief and quality of life that Kratom has given me. Kratom has helped so many people get their lives back -- from pain, from anxiety, from opiate addiction, and from depression, among numerous other things. Kratom has let the veterans that fought for this country's continued freedom live their lives without being in a haze of prescription opiates all day. The people that use kratom aren't junkies looking to get high -- they're human beings who simply want to live their lives free of pain and depression. \nPlease do not schedule Kratom -- it will do so much more harm than good. Kratom is non-lethal, non-toxic, and not at all a threat to anyone's health or wellbeing. Banning it will do nothing but drive more people back to street heroin or illegal prescription pills. Banning Kratom will ruin the lives of hundreds of thousands of people that don't want to be dependent on drugs that take away the essence of who they are as people -- they want to work and be part of society, to be themselves, and Kratom lets them do that. Kratom has given hope to so many people who thought they would never escape the cycles of pain, depression, and addiction, and done so in a way that poses the absolute minimum of risk. Please don't take that away from us.\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this comment, and I truly hope you will make the right decision -- to keep this wonderful herb available, in its natural form, to the millions of citizens whom it helps on a daily basis.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15519","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Aidan Lawrence","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nMy name is Joseph Mack and I believe kratom should not be put under the schedule I drug category.

I purchase it from a local kratom/kava bar in Gulfport, Florida. I consume it 1-3 times per week with no more than 12 oz during a 24-hour period.\n\nKratom helps me in the following ways:\n\n1. It relieves severe headache/sinus pain to a remarkable degree. My pain is caused by recurring and sometimes severe sinus infections. \n\n2. It is a mild mood enhancer.\n\n3. It reduces general anxiety, which I experience at various intervals.\n\nI've never experienced an undesirable side effect from kratom. There was never a loss of equilibrium. My only caveat is that drinking it on an empty stomach may cause some mild nausea, although vomiting never occurred.\n\nWhen kratom became unavailable to me due to the temporary ban, I did not experience withdrawal, either physically or psychologically. I did miss it, however, because I was at times experiencing the sinus/head pain as well as anxiety. But I never felt an overwhelming desire for kratom.\n\nOf course, various medications are available for alleviating pain and anxiety. But I would much rather use a natural herb for relief as opposed to potentially harmful or toxic medications created by the pharmaceutical companies.\n\nI fully support the legalization of kratom, except the minimum age for its use should be 18.  \n\nFinally, I applaud the DEA for reversing its decision to ban kratom at this time, and sincerely hope that the lifting of the ban becomes permanent.\n\nBest regards,\nDavid Yelenchic","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4132","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Yelenchic","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Crystal I started Kratom 2 months ago I was introduced by a good friend.

I have been having severe anxiety and panic attacks and depression for about 4 years . I used to be house bound . When my kids would go to school I would stay in my bedroom. Until they would get home. My anxiety and panic attacks would get so bad where I couldn't even breath and I would have very bad chest pains from them. I went to numerous doctors and hospitals to see if maybe I was having a heart attack it sure felt like it . Well all the doctors told me it wasent a heart attack. I was in perfect heath only thing that was wrong with me is that I have severe anxiety and panic  and depression. I constantly would have suicidal thoughts and even came close to taking my own life two years ago. Well almost two years ago I prayed to God and asked him to send me something all natural that would help me. Cause if I didn't find something soon I am scared I will lose my mind with all this mentally pain. Well I was in a smoke shop almost two years ago and a lady told me about kratom it supposed to help with anxiety and panic attacks.  She knows people that takes it and it has changed there life around. Well I ended up doing research on kratom for months before buying some and I heard all great things from it. So I figured I would give it a try. I knew I had to try something if I didn't I know things would get worse for me. So I ended up ordering some from a great reliable vendor on here and wow my first time taking it is was feeling amazing all my anxiety and panic attacks were gone it took away all my thoughts of suicide away I was actually going out to to stores and events with my kids and husband and I was more talkative and I didn't close my self in my room anymore. It took all my mental pain away I was smiling again and I had a spark coming from me again which I have not seen for years.

Both myself and Anthony are vehemently opposed to any scheduling of the Kratom plant and/or its' alkaloids. Anthony has used Kratom since 2012 and it has helped him achieve a better quality of life. Anthony, like many of us who fought in Afghanistan and/or Iraq suffer from PTSD and/or anxiety and/or depression and/or alcoholism. While Kratom does not treat or cure any of these diseases, it makes life much more comfortable for the people living with these diseases. Anthony no longer drinks, which is something he did very heavily. He is job, family and Reserve career are no longer in jeopardy, as they were when he was drinking daily. Kratom gives him energy and provides an uplifting sense of well being. Rather than drink alcohol to help with social anxiety, Anthony takes Kratom. It helps him maintain a \"clear head\". These positive steps have contributed to Anthony saving his own life and by extension, saving his family, job and continued service. Scheduling Kratom will negatively impact Anthony and after conquering all those \"demons\" is that really the way we want to honor this man and the many men and women like him who have served honorably? I've read many of these comments and have seen so many personal narratives as well as hard scientific facts and commentary by medical experts, all indicating Kratom is a positive force and does not present a danger, but rather a helping hand to many.

I am a 56 year old woman. I am a private in home caregiver that prefers to work with Alzheimer's patients. \nI wanted to clearly state I simply disagree and oppose the DEA putting Kratom on a scheduled 1 controlled substance list, This simply is not true. This botanical plant has \nbeen great in my life. I have been taking it for a little over 3 years now. I came about using it when my daughter had her baby at the hospital they either used a dirt surgical instrument on her or someone didn't change their gloves running between patients. She contracted a flesh eating virus. She was in immense pain. She was also a former iv heroin addict and didn't want to get involved with pain pills again. As soon as she was able to quit taking the pain pills we bought some Kratom to try. She quit taking the pain medicine and started using the Kratom. She had very little withdrawal from the medication using this. She was free from the drugs. Still to this day she is in pain and continues to take it. I myself could barely move crippled up with arthritis found myself taking care of a brand new baby and my daughter. I was also working part time as a housekeeper for several families. I started taking the Kratom myself. I also am a former addict and want nothing to do with any narcotics. I have been clean for over 6 yrs now. I do feel I can move more at ease with the Kratom than without it. I believe I would be pretty much unable to move at this point and without the Kratom myself and my daughter would have to apply for our Social Security at an early age. Today we both work are very productive and I work full time and she works and supports her baby on her own part time. I think it would be ridiculous for you to take something so wonderful and schedule it to where people can't have some help. There couldn't even be research on it if you were to schedule it as you were.

My highest education is a bachelor's degree in science (biology) from Rutgers University. I suffer from major depression, panic disorder, anxiety disorder, and agoraphobia. I've been taking Kratom for a few years, and it to say it has saved my quality of life is an understatement. I'm currently on four prescription medications. However, they fail me in so many ways. For instance, I am on Xanax for the anxiety and panic attacks. While the Xanax works to subdue a panic attack, it also knocks me out and I must sleep. This is not a practical solution when trying to live a functional normal life. I deal with panic and depression on a daily basis. How can I live a normal life asleep? Or even so tired I cannot concentrate? I can't. I cannot raise my child, pay the bills, do the shopping, care for all my animals (I rescue them and also have a service dog), etc. because my medication has sedated me. It's just not practical. If I take a lower dose, then it doesn't help with the panic. This is just ONE problem with ONE of my prescribed medications. \nI was not functioning AT ALL and was bedridden for 18 months. I finally somehow managed to peel myself from my bed and get to my computer. I cannot describe to you the mental anguish I was experiencing. I was completely grief-stricken for one thing. I had lost my dad in a tragic motorcycle accident and was suffering from PTSD on top of my already existing emotional and mental illnesses. As stated above, I rescue animals and had suffered the loss of FOUR dogs within a year and a half. These were my children. I had a hyper toddler at the time, and there was no time or space to grieve the way I needed to. I would stay cocooned in the bed, enwrapped in my blanket with only one arm out to play with my child. I could not cook her dinner. I could not go outside to play with her. I suffered a nervous breakdown when my home was headed to foreclosure. I lost a lot of weight and was down from 135 to 113 lb and looked sickly. So I somehow by the grace of God made my way to my computer. I had given up on my meds. I Googled \"herbal remedies for anxiety and depression\" and discovered Kratom. I was willing to try anything and this was so simple, a plant relative to the coffee plant but with people claiming it was relieving their pain, physical or mental. So I wanted to try it. \n I placed an order and received my capsules within a few days. I took them with some iced tea and quickly ran back to my bed, my sanctuary, my best friend. And I waited. About a half hour later I noticed my racing heart was calming down, the panic dissipating. My mood was lifted. I didn't feel so gloomy. The feeling of doom went away. I could feel love again, something I had lost, and could show my child how much I loved her. I did have feelings inside but they were dormant and protected by the panic. It's the only way I can describe myself at the time; I was numb. I was in such pain that it's all I could feel...pain or complete numbness. Empathy, passion, love, and any other positive feeling like that eluded me. The grief, the breakdown, the fear of losing my home...it all overwhelmed me to such an extent that I couldn't feel at all and I certainly could not function like a normal human being. Now suddenly everything shifted. I could feel again but in a positive way. I showered, I took my child outside to play at the park. Yes! I left the house!  With taking Kratom in the morning, I was able to care for everyone again, including myself! I started cooking again for my family. I could function! \nI do not know where I'd be right now if it wasn't for this wonderful plant God has provided to us. As a biologist, I c\\an tell you that every organism on this planet serves a purpose. Hell, there's even little fish to clean sharks' teeth. This plant has not only saved my life but also my quality of life. I do not know what would have become of me by now, but I fear I may not be sitting here telling you my story. And now there's threat of my MIRACLE being banned? A plant that is helping so many people? It's not only unfair but it's absurd. Please do not let this happen! I'm still to this day taking my prescription meds, but as you read above, they were not working to get me to a functional level. I see a therapist now and a psychiatrist who prescribes the meds. I was able to get out of the house and see my family doctor thanks to Kratom, and he prescribed me Abilify, another miracle. BUT, I still struggle with panic and only like to take the Xanax at night before bed. It's just not practical to use during the day when I have a life to be live. I know my family is grateful to Kratom because they got back their wife, mother, daughter, and sister. My animals would have a story to share also I'm sure. Please, leave this plant alone. I cannot survive without it, and if I do, it will be awful. I will be back in my bed once again, locked away both inside my body and inside my home.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8401","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Patrice ZIMMER","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jacquelyn,and I am a 21 year old college student. About a year and a half ago I started experiencing severe pelvic pain, that escalated from light cramping into a daily and debilitating pain. I went to three doctors before one finally told me I likely had endometriosis - a disease prevalent in 1/10 women. It causes severe pelvic pain, that no meds would touch. I had to wait 6 months for surgery. I couldn't go to class, had to quit my job, and didn't even feel like a human being. While researching how women with this disease deal with their pain- a pain that even narcotics don't help - I saw one woman mention kratom on a Facebook group for endo sufferers. I immediately started doing research and, lucky for me, there are about three tea bars within 15 minutes of my house that served kratom tea. I went that same night, and it was the first night in months I had been pain free. I felt like a person again. I could watch a movie with my boyfriend without worrying about my pain. It was incredible. Until I had my surgery, I drank kratom tea for a few days every week. I also used it after surgery instead of the narcotics prescribed to me because they made me so tired all the time. \n\nKratom is an incredible plant that people of all ages benefit from.

I am a single mother of three and also take care of my disabled parents. I have been diagnosed with Adenomyosis and Endometriosis which is a Uterine disease. It causes me daily pain and severe fatigue. Along with hormonal treatments prescribed by my doctor I use Kratom for pain management and energy. Specifically, I use Maeng Da for the day time hours and Bali at night. I do not want to use prescription pain medication, as I have addiction in my immediate family. I have always wanted to use natural remedies, Kratom when used properly has helped me continue to work and care for my family with no side effects. I am only 35 and doctors will not perform a hysterectomy due to my age, they prefer me to be over 40. Therefore, the only cure for my disease cannot be performed for another 4.5 years, sadly.\nMaking Kratom a Schedule 1 narcotic I believe would increase the amount of opiate addiction in this country. I was introduced to it by a friend of mine who was an addict and told me that it controls pain. Although I personally have not become an addict, I do fear it because of addiction being genetic and I have immediate family members whom have struggled with an opiate addiction from chronic pain. Since my responsibility is my children, I wish to control my pain in an unprescribed, natural, and non addictive way. I have read many articles, opinions, blogs, and have spoken to many holistic doctors who have said when used properly, Kratom is very effective in pain management and giving safe energy. More safe and less addictive than caffeine! Because of my disease, I have had to stop drinking coffee, espresso, and energy drinks. Prior to my diagnosis I drank all of the above often. I have been using Kratom for 1 year now and have been feeling much better! I do continue with hormone treatment, strict diet, anti inflammatorys (OTC), and Kratom. I know that without Kratom I would have to take pain medication and I do not want to until absolutely necessary! I am still young and do not want to have to rely on pain medication to get through daily life. \nThank you for your time and consideration and I hope this clarifies the importance to the access of Kratom. Please understand that it's uses are more positive than negative and have such great uses, especially the fight against opiate addiction!

I have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, depression, chronic migraine. I have struggled with these conditions most of my life and have been seen by numerous doctors and specialists through the years including my own father, who is a physician (internal medicine). I have been on too many medications to count, with little or minimal benefit and most often unbearable side effects which made it impossible to continue treatment. One unfortunate symptom of fibromyalgia is being overly sensitive to medications whether RX or natural so my options through the years has been limited. Enduring horrible side-effects and withdrawal symptoms from prescription medicines has just added to the struggle and frustration to try to live a somewhat normal life. \n\nAfter many years of seeking help from physicians and trying medication after medication at great expense both physically and monetarily I found that I was still living in constant pain, exhaustion and depressed. I decided a few years ago to try a more natural approach. I did research, sought advice and was also seen by naturopaths and slowly started adding natural supplements and foods to my daily routine. I also slowly, and with the help of my physicians weaned off of the prescription medications that were not helping me. I can't say that it was easy to do, and it took a long time and a lot of trial and error, but I found that I slowly started to feel better! \n\nOne of the main components in my natural regimen is kratom. I initially heard of kratom through a fibromyalgia support group. I researched the vast information available on kratom; including published medical trials (and subsequent patents of the active compounds found in kratom) and after I became very interested in trying it. I also had my father who is a MD read the published medical literature on kratom and he decided it would be safe to me to try. I slowly added kratom to my daily regimen and started to see improvements in my overall pain levels and fatigue. My father was also impressed with the results and lack of side effects. I would liken kratom's effects to it's plant relative, coffee, with the added benefit of pain relief. I have used kratom daily for over 2 years now and have found that it has been a life changing natural medicine for my symptoms. Kratom also had little to no side effects for me, which is quite rare given my high sensitivity to most prescriptions. The more information and studies that I have read have also posted very similar success stories with almost zero side effects. There is also a large online support community including the American Kratom Association and Botanical Education Alliance that have amazing information and resources on kratom. \n\nConsidering where I was just a few years ago I cannot imagine living without kratom or being forced to go back on medications that did more harm than good. For kratom to be banned and placed in the same schedule as heroin and other illegal drugs is unimaginable and there is substantial documented research to support this. There are kratom studies that prove it is superior in the treatment of pain versus high strength RX opiate medications without #1 being an opiate #2 having the same harmful addictive properties and  #3 it does not affect the central nervous system or slow breathing which is one of the main reasons people can die from overdosing on prescription opiates. Far too many people die every single day from prescription drug overdoses and I fear banning kratom will only increase that number. The number of deaths from legal medications far outweighs those of natural remedies including kratom. The overdoses where kratom was involved always included another prescription or illegal substance. There have been zero overdoses from kratom alone and the number of calls to poison centers/ER visits from kratom is less than those for children accidentally consuming laundry detergent packs. The reasons behind the proposed ban are not in line with the truth and published research. \n\nKratom has become part of my daily routine (just like coffee for a majority of the population) and it helps me to live and function without the pain, exhaustion and horrible side effects that traditional prescription medications had provided. I would be bedridden and unable to work or provide for myself without kratom and cannot imagine that this could be taken away within weeks by having it placed on the same schedule as heroin and drugs that have zero benefit and kill thousands of people every year. \n\nI along with my father are strongly opposing the proposed scheduling of kratom . We both are making our comments here along with writing to and calling our state/federal representatives. Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4468","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep kratom Legal!!!

I am writing this to make it clear that I oppose the scheduling of Mitragyna Speciosa. As someone who helps many patients with dispensing their pain, anxiety, and ADHD medication, I cannot tell you how many HATE the medicine and wish so badly for an alternative. They tell me of all of the horrible side effects. I cannot and do not say anything to them about this wonderful alternative plant that has helped so many people, but it is clear that this is something that needs to stay around.\n\nI started using Kratom 3 years ago because I was in a near-fatal car accident which left me with many, many issues including severe pain and anxiety from PTSD. I could not handle the amount of side effects and \"hooked\" feeling from the Percocet they gave to me. I decided to look for alternatives and found Kratom. I realized it is not a \"drug\" and is not \"addictive\" like the painkillers they were giving me were. I had to wean off of the Percocet and even still had lasting issues from it. I started using Kratom while weaning off and it helped so tremendously. It was night and day. The pain disappeared, the withdrawal symptoms from the Percocet were reduced drastically, and I was able to continue to use it to stay pain free. Here is a link to a government done study that concludes that kratom is a wonderful plant for cessation of opioids such as Oxycodone:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670991/\nSome key quotes from the article:\n\n\"One striking finding of this report is the extent to which kratom attenuates potentially severe opioid withdrawal, yet cessation of kratom administration itself appears to be associated with modest abstinence symptoms.\"\n\n\"Although mitragynines agonize mu-opioid receptors, respiratory depression, coma, pulmonary edema and death have not, to our knowledge, been associated with human kratom ingestion.\"\n\nOnce I healed and did physical therapy, I no longer needed the kratom for pain, had used it daily, and had no withdrawal issues whatsoever from stopping cold turkey. I had therapy and found out my increasing anxiety was due to PTSD from the accident, I decided to try Kratom again as I read it was good for anxiety as well. It is unbelievable how much it helped. It has completely and utterly cured it. All this from a PLANT, not a drug isolated from the well-known addictive plant Poppy Somniferum, which I know is imported in MASSIVE quantities for pharmaceutical companies to keep making these horrible addictive drugs. \n\nTo conclude, it just seems so clear to me that this alternative should be available for US Citizens. We are in the \"Land of The Free\" and a PLANT which helps so many people and has been found to have so many medicinal properties is going to be banned? It may be anecdotal, but I have never had a single issue or side effect from this plant and yet it has helped more than any pharmaceutical even could come close to with virtually no side effects. I genuinely hope you will not ban this plant that could and does help so many people and that you can see how wrong it would be to do so.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12646","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should be regulated, not banned.

Despite the reports of some shock media, Kratom is not a \"new exotic drug.\"\n\nKratom is a natural botanical that has quietly been part of the American economy for at least 2 decades. Hundreds of thousands of mature adults suffering from chronic pain have used Kratom for years, as well as individuals trying to abstain from hard drugs like opiates, or alcohol, which is obviously legal, yet much more dangerous.\n\nCommercial Kratom has been on shelves for years but never caught on as a 'legal high' because it's recreational potential is limited. If Kratom was anything like heroin, it would have seen instant popularity and gotten national attention and prohibition a decade ago.\n\nKratom can produce a 'sense of well-being' but falls far short of the 'euphoria' category because it largely doesn't interact with the Mu-Opiate receptor which produces euphoria, major pain relief and dependency. That is why you almost always see mature adults in support videos/media and not teenagers looking to get high.\n\nThe opium epidemic kills 78 people in America a day. This is an epidemic that was ignored by the federal government for way too long, until it grew out of control. Kratom has the potential to help opiate addicts recover and become functional members of society, much more painlessly than methadone or suboxone. \n\nDenying people this opportunity to get back on track can be a literal death sentence for many. To be able to wean off deadly, addictive opiates simply by drinking kratom tea is a miracle and would save numerous lives. The Federal government would be heroes by facilitating this treatment, especially since kratom has very limited recreational potential. \n\nAdditionally, placing kratom into schedule I will not permit important research to be performed without mountains of red tape that will discourage most researchers from performing these necessary studies into the beneficial aspects of kratom.  \n\nThe war on drugs is an utter failure, and it is now time to start offering solutions rather than blind imprisonment and prohibition. \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20414","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please, please, please keep kratom available as a natural choice for my (and many others) health and well-being, please!\n\nI will keep this a brief as possible. I was addicted to pain killers from 2007-2014. For a long time I thought it would take me dying or going into the hospital to get me to stop taking them.  In 2009 I went into the hospital for pneumonia, they put me in a coma for 13 days.  When I woke up, i had pain killers brought to me every 2 hours. It took me a month to get released from the hospital, they sent me home with 120 pk and a prescription for 2 more refills, those were gone in less than a week (all 360 pk, not just the 120).  Fast forward 2 and a half years later to late 2011.  I had eaten so many pills that I had a hole in my large intestines. I had hours to live before they opened me up, cut out the piece of my intestines that had a hole in it, and sewed the two ends together.  When I woke up this time I couldn't eat anything but guess what, I could put Dilaudid in my I.V.  Three weeks later I was released from the hospital, again with 120 pk and 2 more refills.\n\nSo lets review, I was in a coma for almost 2 weeks, I have a 10 inch scar on my stomach, I'm missing 8 inches of my large intestines, in the past 2 and a half years I've spent almost 2 months in 2 different hospitals, and I'm still addicted to pain killers.\n\nThe moment I discovered Kratom, the grasp pain killers had on me was released, my life improved in ways that I can't put into words.  I suddenly could think clear, I didn't crave pain killers, I had money again, and most of all I had hope. Hope that I was going to win.  All the things that happened to me while I has on pk's was not enough to wake me up, kratom did wake me up. \n\nI know for a fact that I'm not the only person with a story like this. You want to solve the pain killer/ heroin problem in the United States, you already have the answer, KRATOM!  Don't let this important plant go to waste. I'm living proof that it really does work. \n\nFeel free to look into my medical records if need be, to see I'm not making this story up.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7849","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Hinkin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a Kratom user for 2 years now, I have eliminated my need for pain medication from my Dr.  I also have no use for SSRI's they are constantly giving people for whatever ails them.  Kratom treats my depression, AND I get no help paying for my medicine.  It is a safe herb and I've never abused it.  I had some on hand for detoxing off of opiates, but I detoxed the old fashioned way, abstinence. In my case, Kratom also keeps my addictive brain from craving opiates for my pain.  I've got nothing but clarity and relief from this tree.  There are plenty of dangerous drugs to access if getting high or suicide were my goal.  Kratom offers neither of these.  It's a tool to stay functional.  Period.  \nKratom helped ME change my life for the better.  Yes, I didn't need to use a detox facility, but I DO still utilize cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy and NA meetings to reinforce the good work I am doing.  Kratom helps and does not disrupt or damage family relationships, nor does it make me wish to die (SSRI's do this, I'm also physically allergic to two of them).  Kratom is not destructive to life in any way.  \nI hope you'll consider keeping my depression medication legal.  If not, I'll be in bed.  There is no substitute for having a functioning brain (in my case).  \nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4601","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laurie Otto","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using Kratom for about 2 months now for discomfort from having a fistula and a peri-rectal abscess. I have only been taking 1 to 2 teaspoons of it, sometimes everynight; but I started taking it only every other 2-3 nights. To me his herb is like other supplements only that it allows me to slow down and & it helps me to relax when I'm in discomfort. I don't feel any toxic affects from it. Toxicity is usually one of the main indicators of whether anything is addictive. I don't feel it makes me high. I just feel it helps me be more inside of my body and it assists with allowing my body to balance out stress & pain, making me feel comfortable. I am a care giver & for the last 9 months I've been working everyday for my client. I am clearly burnt out from not having any days off in such a long time, not to mention not having a vacation or much time for recreation. Kratom has helped me to bottom out this stress that this situation is causing me. The main thing that impresses me about taking Kratom is that it does this without causing any side effects. I feel more alert when I'm taking it, & this wouldn't be the case with prescription drugs that are given for pain or anti-depression drugs. Again I reiterate that there doesn't seem to be any toxic effects from using it, even on a daily basis. Prescription drugs, such as the opiods, that are addictive are very toxic; especially if taken over a long period of time. I work at least 40 hours a week for my client. She is an elderly woman who is 82 years old. She has limited mobility, and she has diabetes. She is mainly bed ridden, and can't get up on her own out of bed. She is type I bi-polar and has arthritis, and most of the time she is in extreme pain. I have been giving her Kratom in capsules for a little over a month now. She would usually have somewhat violent outbursts & hysterical behavior when the pain got too extreme for her, and she felt overwhelmed with anxiety. None of the many psychiatric drugs she is taking, such as depakot, klonopin, or buspiron, exhibit the same results of taking the edge off her pain & depression and give her a better quality of sleep than the Kratom does. When a person such as my client, who arguably has a short time to live in this life, is given a better quality of life by using this one herb it is pretty miraculous, and it just may give her a longer life by helping her to sustain her strength & keep a more positive mental outlook in dealing with the effects of neurological pain, the depression surrounding diabetes, and the type of mental illness she has. I have seen a handful of videos on YouTube from Kratom users who have told their stories about what they've been dealing with and how the Kratom has given them a higher quality of life than was possible with the opiod drugs. One video particularly caught my attention that told the story of a mother whose son had been addicted to opiods, and she didn't find this acceptable at all, so she had him try the Kratom. He proclaimed that he had profound results, because not only was he able to let go of his addiction to the opiod prescription drugs, but it released him from depression from the pain his body was in and allowed him to have a much more positive frame of mind in dealing with his mental & physical problems. After having taken the Kratom myself I see how this could be. I was initially given the information about Kratom from a close friend who I have known about seven years. She has Lyme Disease. She said that she had been taking Kratom for 3 years. She told her story of how it has helped her to deal with the effects of the Lyme Disease, and how the Lyme disease has wore down her immune system, & the immense level of pain she has had to endure. She said that using the Kratom all during this time has enabled her to get rid of taking many drugs that had toxic side effects, which caused discomfort and pain; and how it has been the main thing that has allowed her to have a more normal life by being able to get out of bed and take care of her children and be there for her husband. I can't imagine Kratom causing anyone to die. Indeed all of the deaths that have been linked to Kratom were when the user took Kratom with hard drugs. Is it a good idea to mix drugs? I can't see how it is, because so many of the deaths of famous people have been caused this way. I am very confident that Kratom won't risk the health of users. I would classify it as an herbal supplement. I feel that caffeine is so much stronger than Kratom. Giving up long term caffeine use has caused me bad headaches. I can't imagine how Kratom would do this. I am of the opinion that you would be causing so much more harm by banning it and denying people a way to deal with long term pain than saving anyone from harmful effects. I don't feel that it has any.

I am 27 years old, I live in Los Angeles and I work as a lead engineer on mobile application development for a major corporation, where I have worked for the last five years.  I discovered kratom when I was reading about the public health crisis of opiate addiction and overdose (I personally know two people in my age group who are dead from heroin overdoses).  I heard people discussing kratom as something people can use to wean themselves off of opiates and handle the otherwise very painful withdrawal.  At the time I myself was dealing with a decade-long addiction to marijuana that I had been trying for the last year, unsuccessfully, to overcome, and figured it may be possible that kratom could help with that too.  At first the fact that kratom is an opioid scared me away from it.  It was a full year after I first heard of it that I decided since I felt nearly hopeless about overcoming my own addiction, I might as well give it a try.  Two months after I began using kratom I completely stopped using marijuana and it has now been six months since I have touched any form of it, the longest I have gone since I was 15 without smoking marijuana.  My life has massively improved from beating my addiction and I cannot imagine beating it without kratom.  Additionally, I have always suffered from mild depression and anxiety and I have found kratom to be a very effective treatment, after trying pharmaceutical antidepressants and not liking them.  I know from experience that kratom is more like coffee than a psychoactive drug.  It may cause slight changes in mood but you cannot get \"high\" off of kratom, like you can off of marijuana or other drugs.  Taking more does not intensify the effects, it just leads to nausea.  It is also completely safe.  It is not possible to overdose and face a life-threatening situation with kratom.  I have taken too much and just got sick for 30-4 minutes.  I urge you to consider the actual repercussions of criminalizing kratom.  Since so many people use it to get off of dangerous psychoactive drugs, they may end up relapsing.  Kratom awareness may be key to ending the crisis of opiate addiction, which will only get worse if kratom is banned.  I understand and sympathize with the desire to keep dangerous drugs off the streets.  But kratom is not one of them.  Kratom is not, and has never been, a \"legal high\", even if dishonest scammers try to sell it as one.  Thank you for giving me a chance to voice my concern and I hope you take the testimonies you receive on behalf of kratom to heart.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13869","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Coleman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is James Trice.

The first tour I did as many did and was embarrassed and ashamed or too proud and stubborn to admit having PTSD. Seven months after being back... I was separated and eventually divorced. I suffered from severe anxiety, insomnia as well as the other physical complications that come along with it. I saw a therapist and took advantage of all of the yellow ribbon tools available from my unit. It took about two years to fully recover, just in time for my second tour. After returning home from my second tour I was determined not to repeat the process of struggling with PTSD. My second tour was far more intense and twice as long, 6 months the first tour being 60 days. Desperate for a legal and natural solution I began to research. Eventually I came across an article on Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine. Unknowing of what Kratom was or that there was any controversy over the herb I decided it sounded like a potential supplement. I managed my anxiety and insomnia with a warm cup of Kratom tea, 3mg of powder mixed with lemon and honey did the trick and the mild effects lasted for hours. There were no negative side effects that I could tell from this dosage and one cup usually did the trick. In fact the only effects that I can say it had was it made me feel happy, in a good mood and have positive attitude. I dosed as needed and felt no desire or need to have it every day. Within 90 days of starting the tea I had had no panic or anxiety attacks, or avoided them if I felt one coming on with a glass of tea. The same for insomnia. I kept a 25mg bag of the powder in the cabinet for about 6-8 months and eventually only used it for insomnia which I have always wrestled with prior military. To this day this it is the only treatment that I've needed to overcome my PTSD and I've been home for 16 months. For me personally I did not find Kratom to be addictive at all. I haven't purchased or thought about Kratom for months until tonight (insomnia) and remembered how well it worked. I had no idea that there was a pending ban and was surprised to find out about it tonight when I decided to place an order. In my opinion Kratom should be treated like other coffee or tea products. I have no problem with anything I ingest into my body being FDA approved, however I don't have to go to my doctor for a prescription when I want caffeine. Nor do I think I should for this product. I do think there should be studies to ensure there are no long term negative side effects or risk of overdose. Just recently I read a news article about teens doing the \"caffeine challenge\" and dying from caffeine overdose. I didn't hear about any caffeine ban, because that would be ridiculous. If anything this should be treated as a supplement with a notice that it has not been approved by the FDA or a warning that you would see on a product with caffeine, although the effects are mild in comparison and vastly differ from caffeine. If this ban was enacted and had I not come across the information, my military career could have been jeopardized if it were on the banned substance list and I were popped with a random urinalyses, that I am not okay with. I haven't seen it on the military's list so far but I will definitely be watching for it. I ask that the plan to ban be revoked and ask vendors to place a warning or notice of the effects on the packaging.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4437","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Williams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"please do your do diligence and give this a honest look...","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11482","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Holmstrom","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Shea Anderson and I am a mother of three, with an undergrad degree in Finance and Masters in Education.

THANK YOU FOR SERVING OUR COUNTRY!!! Secondly, to give thanks to whomever has the opportunity to read and include this comment in our debate.  \n\nIn regards to subjecting Mitragyna speciosa and/or some of its chemical properties to the Controlled Substances Act:\n\nWe the People have the responsibility to question EVERY aspect of law passed and/or enforced and are obligated to be mindful of ALL regulatory proposals pertaining to action - whether it be based on prior extension of an amendment - or legislature;  likewise, whether it be deemed appropriate upon the commonality of suspicion. \n\nThese suggestions of prohibition should include EVERYONE'S opinion, discussion, and choice to abstain. Furthermore, in an undoubted respect, we are to expect responsible and concise conduct by those elected and/or assigned in our justice and intelligence agencies, as well as to critique the rationality and motive of lawmakers in our states and federal government.  \n\nWith that being evident..\n\nWe all have our beliefs of how things are the way they are. Religiously. Spiritually. Philosophically. Though, we all can agree on the simple, deductive reasoning, that our species has lived and thrived by nourishment of plants. Some may suggest the significance of adapting to agriculture as detrimental for the very origin of settlement.\n\nAs a matter of fact, mankind has used plants for medicinal and \"recreational\" purposes for longer than history itself can account. And, in some contrast, the vast of religions suppose there is indeed purpose for their presence.  \n  \nNo matter where someone may be in our country or on our planet, something as natural as a plant should never be subject to restriction.. prohibition.. propaganda. It simply contradicts its place on earth, and is, perhaps, even dangerous to its existence. One may as well place it on an endangered species list.\n\nAs a citizen of the United States, I oppose any such action to make credible, the assumption in illegality of something natural. It's our individual, earth-born right to behave in any manner regarding NATURAL substances. Needlessness to say, if one would like to eat a poisonous mushroom - it's their NATURAL RIGHT! We can only education, pity and mourn those who are unable to distinguish nectar from poison. Likewise, Some system of government can't simply demand chili peppers be illegal -- because they burn our mouths. That includes ALL AGRICULTURE (e.g., the legalization of marijuana is inevitable).  \n\nIn conclusion, please review current practices and anticipate the inevitable changes in our society. Inorganic/Synthetic drugs are what truly plague our youth and principles. Natural \"solutions\" could become quite the answer to the problems of drugs such as methamphtamines, LCD, etc.  \n\nNote: It would be more beneficial to the Drug Enforcement Agency to focus more on the pharmaceutical industry. It is being overlooked. \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1515","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Forest Arsenault","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I bought Kratom for my wife a few months ago, she is 72 years old and a lifelong sufferer of depression as is her sisters. upon her first dose of 2 grams, within 1 hour she actually said\nI feel good today it is going to be one of my good days.

My suggestion would be to not restrict the organic, un-enhanced product, and enforce an over 18 requirement, like for tobacco.  I would support restriction the enhanced product.\n\nAnecdotally, because of the reasonably low concentration of Mitragynine and the related active components in the organic leaf, it is difficult to imagine ingesting enough to cause anyone serious harm.  I know there are exceptions to everything, but ingesting, lets say 100 grams of the stuff would not be worth the effect in my opinion (!).\n\nOne other important note I think:  Since Kratom as a plant (I believe it is a tree) is difficult to grow, particularly in the North American continent, I think the supply is limited pretty much to what is imported, at least currently.  Also, being a 'perennial' tree vs. an 'annual' (e.g. Marijuana) limits the degree to which folks would be able to increase the Mitragynine content via plant breeding or chemical methods (e.g. application of Colchicine to Marijuana to induce polyploidy).\n\nThank you for your attention\n\n:-)\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0029","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a resource too precious to put a price on for those struggling with opiate addiction.

I work at a Medical Examiners Office as a Forensic Pathology Technician. It is a job that makes many people say, \"Eeeeww!\" but I see and learn something new every day. I find this to be very rewarding and I love my job. I am proud to be an employed and productive member of my community, and I have Kratom to thank for helping me maintain the stamina required of me daily. I can't imagine having to change the kind of work I do because of the physical, emotional and mental distractions that  chronic pain brings.\nI have suffered from chronic pain (failed neck surgery, DDD and nerve damage) for 15 years. In the last 5, as I have come closer to 60 years of age, I have gradually been able to do less and enjoy less and have become a really unhappy person because of pain. I also wondered how in the world I would be able to continue to work until retirement age... sometimes when adding all this together I couldn't help but wonder, \"what's the use?\".\nI have made many lifestyle changes in an effort to bring back some of the old me. Lost some weight, added some herbal supplements, and learned about kratom. What I learned in my research is that it deserves the opportunity that I have been affording my other supplements. And so, I added kratom to my daily supplements! It has had such a positive impact on my life, my pain levels and my overall sense of well-being.\nI can't say that I don't ever have pain anymore, but what I can say, is that things are not as dark as they once were. I am more hopeful. I am more well balanced. I am not as focused on my pain. I am able to do more than just sit with my grand children; I am now a fun grandmother! I can finally work in my garden again. I get to experience the joy that has been missing for far too long! My quality of life has improved and I am happy and thankful!\nSo I have to ask...why would you want to take that from anyone?\nAmy Hendricks","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2941","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amy Hendricks","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello.

This fatigue I experience is debilitating, and does not respond to caffeine. Although I have taken legally prescribed amphetamine for this, the amphetamine has unpleasant side effects such as heart palpitations and anxiety which are extremely unpleasant. As such, restrictive scheduling of kratom will significantly decrease my quality of life. \n\nI understand the DEA's concern over kratom because, like other psychoactive substances (e.g. caffeine, alcohol), it does have the potential for abuse. One way to address this would be to require sellers to include safety information about kratom with all purchases, as is required for alcohol and tobacco products. \n\nRequiring sellers to provide certifications of purity is another good step toward improving safety of supplements in general, including kratom. This would've prevent that one death related to tramadol-laced kratom.\n\nAnother option may be to limit the more potent kratom extracts that are available for purchase, or limit the amount that can be sold to one individual over a period of time. However, if caffeine (which is also toxic at high concentrations) can be sold without a prescription in tablet form, I don't see the necessity for this measure since such high amounts of kratom would be needed to induce toxicity. \n\nPersonally, I think a good compromise would be to assign kratom to schedule IV, but only AFTER the active compounds are available with a prescription. \n\nI challenge the DEA to be both scientific in their approach to scheduling, and considerate as to whether any scheduling of kratom might harm more citizens than it helps. \n\nSincerely,\nA fifth year immunology PhD student and mother of one","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3699","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 64-year-old, retired, mental health professional with rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia. These conditions are treated by physicians and I am, otherwise, healthy. I've raised children and grandchildren while being actively involved in their lives. I was an athlete and a jazz dancer until my late forties. In the past ten years, my normal activity level and ability to remain physically involved with friends and family has been curtailed by pain associated with my medical conditions. In spite of following all suggestions and treatment plans provided by medical professionals, the pain associated with these conditions has continued to impact my life in negative ways. The discovery of Kratom, as an herbal nutritional supplement, has changed my life with its softening of my pain and capability of return to a functioning life.  \n\n    I've always believed that I had a high tolerance to pain and have only received prescription pain meds for tooth pain and post surgical procedures. Over the years, I occasionally took muscle relaxers when I suffered a sports injury that didn't resolve after a few days. I've always sought alternate ways of dealing with pain aside from pills. The relentless, chronic pain associated with my current health has come as a shock...especially since the severity of it varies, over time, and it is unpredictable in occurrence and capability of responding to my efforts to manage it and not have it take me down.\n\n    Taking me down, in pain, means that I was never sure if plans I made could be followed, if I would be able to spend time with my family on a holiday, able to get to medical appointments, take a shower, shop for groceries, clean cat litter box, pick up mail, etc. Sometimes I dreaded not knowing what the next day would  bring: a better day than the current day or back to worse pain than I was relatively free of on that day. Going to bed was a curse. Waking up could be a curse. Sleep wasn't  a guaranteed escape because pain could prevent sleep....or wake me during the night, unable to return to sleep. Sometimes I felt overcome to the point of sobbing from pain and frustration. My mental health has suffered. I'd become an isolated, cranky, person...shoving everyone in my life away with my anger...something that snuck up on me as I've struggled in getting on top of what had turned out to be a situation that was not going away. At times, relentless episodes of pain have taken me down the path of depression to contemplation of suicide. \n\n    There exists a catch-22 in dealing with chronic pain: the exercises and activity level which is supposed to help, in providing degrees of relief, are often not possible because of pain which limits capability to engage in activity without pain.\n\n    In my personal path of researching methods of dealing with pain outside of medical care, I learned to use a specific type of pillow to support my head, benefit of OTC products, and came across the mention of Kratom. I spent dozens of hours researching this herbal plant. I read three books, numerous articles, and followed blogs. I determined that an occasional reference to it as a recreational substance seemed to have sprung from its rumored application to pain issues. There will always be a small percentage of the population who seek something from which to get \"high\"; they hear \"pain\" treatment and they think euphoric opioid effects. \n\nMy personal preference has been to avoid the use of pharmaceutical opioids as long as possible. I am aware of the pitfalls of potential addiction. My experience with them...post surgery and teeth extraction...has been unpleasant. They leave me lethargic, fuzzy-headed, and with a sense of depression. I can't imagine that a dependency on them would make my life a whole lot better than one of living with chronic pain. \n\nWhen researching vendors of Kratom, I found that it was fairly easy to identify legitimate suppliers who were helpful, informational, and did not offer medical advice or claims that their product treated specific conditions or disease. In addition to my background in psychology, I have medical experience and have studied chemistry. I understand what is known about how Kratom works and I've been excited to see what will unfold, in knowledge, from current scientific research on this plant.\n\nI was shocked, recently, to learn about the ban on this herb and the halt of research outside of pharmaceutical companies seeking patents for synthetics. I've also come to learn about the application of Kratom in the area of opiate and opioid addiction. It is not a replacement for these substances and it does not provide recreational value.\n\nI do not understand why agencies of our government seek to create a potential drug epidemic by leaving a chunk of the population without legal  access to this plant, nor how a claim of managing an opioid drug epidemic can be made. It's that simple.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17720","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Molly Howard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom this may concern,\n\nMy name is James Carso.

I am also very active and exercise daily. While I happen to be in very good health for my age, unfortunately, I do suffer from anxiety sometimes leading to panic attacks. I take prescription medication for ADHD and I truly believe the anxiety I am experiencing comes from the prescribed medication. \n\nInitially I started taking Kratom about 6 months ago to help alleviate anxiety. I have other herbs that also work pretty well such as passion flower, California poppy, hops, lavender, chamomile and the list goes on. That said, I especially find Kratom to be most effective. \n\nIncidently since I started taking Kratom not only has my anxiety been reduced significantly I actually don't even really need to take the medication for ADHD as often. It's as if I don't need it anymore. I'm relaxed and focused in the mornings and a cup of coffee or tea is all I need to stay focused and relaxed in a very stressful job. \n\nKratom isn't a mind altering substance. It's not that much different than what you would feel if you drank Kava or Valerian. It seems very strange that a tea like Kratom would be banned. It makes no sense. What I can tell you is that I've had to take a prescribed stimulant for ADHD for years and even though it's legal it's hard on the body. For whatever reason I don't feel the need to take that drug anymore and for that I'm very grateful.

I have been doing this for over four years now. As such, I am very familiar with kratom, the people who use it, and the reasons as to why they use it. I am writing this because I am in a more unique position than most individuals when it comes to seeing what the day to day use of kratom looks like due to the fact that I interact with a large number of kratom users on a daily basis. Although I work in a retail environment I graduated college with a degree in Psychology. A significant amount of my education centered around addiction, treatment, and the numerous issues surrounding substance use and abuse. I am not claiming to be an expert, but I was well educated in this subject from a university known for their Psychology program.\n\nWhen I first began working in my current field I had never heard of kratom. But I quickly realized that it was a popular item. So i decided to research it. Eventually I decided to try it myself since it seemed to pose minimal (if any) risk and had the potential to be beneficial. I was surprised by the fact that it did indeed help with physical pain that I had been experiencing. I was also surprised by the fact that something this effective was completely natural and did not get me high. Like many Americans I have been prescribed narcotic pain medications before. Fortunately for me however, I never became addicted to them. Though I can understand why others do.\n\nI legally sell kratom every day that I go to work. And I sell it to a wide array of people. Moms, dads, grandparents, military veterans, firefighters, police officers, doctors, and more. These people use kratom for a variety of reasons. These reasons include pain management, PTSD, anxiety, depression, and withdrawal from prescription pain medication. Interestingly enough, some people are using kratom in order to get off of things like Suboxone and Methadone. I find it ironic that these medications designed to get addicts off of opiates seem to be addictive to some users. Regardless, kratom has definitely helped many of the ones that I have dealt with at work.\n\nOver the years I have quite literally seen people turn their lives around. I have gotten to watch and listen to people who have effectively and safely used kratom to help get themselves sober. Many of these people are not your cliche drug users that you imagine when you think of addicts. I have been shocked to see how many \"normal\" people - who I never would have imagined to be opiate addicts - come through our door. Most of these people are working professionals who are educated and have families. I find many of these people to be really great human beings. And over the years I have become very sympathetic to the situation that they are in. Like Bethany, the wife and mother of two children who works for the United Way and sings in her church's choir. She developed an addiction to pain pills after they were prescribed by her doctor. I was shocked to learn that she had been an addict. And I am happy to see her living a normal, happy, and healthy life. She is a great friend, and she does a lot of good for the world.\n\nBut as I stated earlier, I sell to many other demographics than just addicts. Word has gotten around in the veteran and military community that kratom has the ability to help with PTSD. And in many cases with the chronic pain they are dealing with because of what they have done for their country on our behalf. I come from a military family and grew up as an \"Army brat\" to a father who is a high ranking medical professional. I have a big heart and the deepest respect for those who have served our nation. And I feel privileged to be able to in some way help them in return. Much like I have seen addicts turn their lives around, I have seen countless warriors get their lives back. People who could barely leave their house who have now reintegrated to civilian life. People with missing limbs who can now go about their life with less pain without being loaded full of narcotics. Kratom has obviously helped them regain some semblance and normalcy in their lives. I think that taking kratom away from these people would be incredibly cruel and detrimental to many of them and their families. Please, do not do this to these people. They, and their families, have given and suffered so much. And now you are thinking about making a plant - that does not get you high - a scheduled substance. In my humble opinion, this is going to be a serious blow to these Americans who are already suffering enough and have an astonishingly high rate of suicide.

Kratom has been a life saver and assisted   with my quality of life and not using pain killers which the side effects are terrible. As a veteran, I can say so many veterans I have spoken to are very disappointed with our system controlled by big pharma. They believe as I the system is there to enslave us and the system to ban beneficial health products from nature has continued  for so many years. Are freedom to choose what goes into our body is our choice on a individual level. Kratom is a godsend and we the people believe that there is an effort by corporations  to limit anything that they cannot capitalize on. We are the sickest  western population of all western countries and America takes more pharmaceuticals than any other country in the world. Over 100,000 people die taking prescription  drugs as prescribed yet there have been no deaths linked to kratom. I implore the people sitting at those desk in Washington to represent the people of this country. If there is going to be a funded study of kratom, it needs to be independent from any corporations influence. This is a plant linked to the coffee species. For those government officials that believe kratom is addictive,  I and many people I know strongly disagree. I have no withdraws when stopping, however, my pain from gulf war related illnesses begin to ramp up to a point where I cannot support my family. I know of many people personally  including my sister whom all committed  suicide taking prescription  pain pills antidepressants . I know of many people  whom got off their prescription  drugs due to kratom. I have found almost every natural substance I have found beneficial  to my health banned in this country as have many veterans I know. It's time that government  represents the people and does not interfere with our right to natural remedies. How many natural remedies has the FDA approved? That speaks for itself.

In 2015, I was diagnosed with a multitude of chronic spinal issues including a double fracture (Bilateral Pars Defect) and pinched nerves. Since the flare up happened, I have been living in pain every day trying to care for my boys. These conditions limit my movement and increase pre-existing depression that I've had from the age of 12. I also live with anxiety. I started using kratom when I found out about it six months ago. It has done wonders for my life. Kratom has allowed me to stop taking prescription opioids for my pain, which we all know are extremely addicting. I am now able to manage my pain NATURALLY, which is extremely important to me. It certainly does not take away my pain, but it helps me to manage it daily without all of the harmful side effects of opioids. It has also significantly helped my depression and anxiety, without the sedating effects of some prescribed medicines. I am extremely grateful for kratom because it has allowed me to live an easier life and be more mobile. This is priceless because I can do more with my children. Please do not ban this botanical. It will do much more harm than good. Many people's lives have turned around because of it including my own. We are pleading with you.

I went to a reputable liberal arts university and was at the top of my class, but by the time I graduated I had very severe anxiety. \n\nI was caught in a bad cycle after graduating from university. I was only working low-level jobs, because my anxiety made it difficult (nearly impossible, even) to pursue something more challenging even though I knew I was otherwise capable of doing far more. Because these jobs didn't offer insurance and I didn't have enough money to pay for it myself, I was stuck without a viable solution.\n\nI sometimes turned to alcohol, though the effects the day after always negated any positive anxiety reduction and loss of inhibitions.\n\nA friend recommended kratom, but when I looked into it I was initially skeptical. I was reluctant to try anything that was associated with opiates, as I knew how destructive that class of drugs tends to be. \n\nEventually I decided to give it a shot because the anxiety was so persistent and I wanted anything that might alleviate it. I was surprised not to full a 'buzz' or anything of the sort when I first gave it a try.\n\nWhat I noticed instead was that it helped me to not fall into my anxious thought cycles. I felt healthy and motivated, able to socialize and accomplish tasks and work toward being my best self.\n\nI now take kratom 3-4 days per week, and it still helps me immensely. I run my own very profitable blog and also do freelance writing and business consulting on the side. This is a huge change from where I was even a few years ago, and I can attribute much of my success to kratom helping me overcome mental hurdles.\n\nIt is not by any means an intoxicating drug. It has helped me to focus, contribute to society, cultivate better friendships and romantic relationships, and be my best self. I genuinely fear what might happen if I no longer have access to this plant. Please consider the very real consequences this would have on people like me before you take the plant away.

Many patients are also discovering the value of kratom in decreasing or eliminating their dependence on prescription pain medications.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry has a vested interest in debunking methods of pain management which do not further its own agenda. I certainly hope the influence of corporate pharmaceutical lobbyists is not a factor in the DEA's decision making process. No doubt big pharma is chomping at the bit to make kratom \"their own\", furthering their already astronomical profits, at the expense of the health and wellbeing of the American people.                                                   \n\nThe fact that the number of poison center calls regarding kratom has rapidly increased in no way translates to a need to schedule this plant. It merely suggests more people are discovering it's value and wishing to gain further information. \n\nThe DEA loses credibility when it fails to responsibly assess it's decisions in a manner consistent with good science. Evidence of harm from this plant is so vastly outweighed by innumerable reports of its efficacy. If for no other reason than reducing prescription drug abuse, the DEA might please consider leaving well enough alone! The use of plants to improve the human condition began thousands of years ago, and will continue. \n\nHas the DEA still not acknowledged the failure of the \"War on Drugs\"? Kratom has not demonstrated sufficient harm in a significant number of people to warrant efforts to eradicate it's use. These efforts will result only in harm by denying legal access to many thousands of legitimate safe, responsible users who deserve the freedom to choose. \n\nAre there no potential risks to kratom remaining available without criminalization? Of course not!  But until the unlikely day that it's use is shown to harm more people than it helps, it is unjustified and irresponsible to make it a controlled substance in an era when there are so many bigger fish to fry.\n\nAs a physician, a patient, and an American, I implore the DEA to more carefully evaluate the evidence (or lack thereof) and allow kratom to be used without criminalization.\n\nI sincerely appreciate the DEA's recent decision to allow discussion of this matter. \n\nWith Thanks and Respect,\n\nEly Zaslow MD","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6110","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ely Zaslow","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Regulators:\n\nI am writing to you today about an organic herb that is the ground leaf of a tree in the same family as coffee. The media has recently begun portraying this safe herbal tea as some kind of \"new\" heroin or cocaine, or even a hallucinogen, which couldn't be further from the truth. And we all know about the 'hasty' ban that was narrowly avoided. Kratom should be viewed as an important tool in the solution to the opiate/opioid epidemic, not just another green plant for government agencies to vilify for profit.  Kratom has a 2000-year history of safe, responsible use as a detox from opium and alternative to dangerous drugs such as opium and heroin which is easily verified. The Botanical Education Alliance website (botanical-education.org) and Transnational Institute (TNI.org) have extensive medical and scientific papers available showing both its efficacy and almost foolproof safety profile.  Ithas greatly enhanced the chances of opiate addicts to achieve permanent recovery for the same period of time, inexpensively and unofficially. During the last 15 years it has become a staple of many successful Narcotics Anonymous participants, boosting long term sobriety rates by preventing PAWS relapses.\n\nThere is no respiratory depression associated with Kratom, an established scientific fact, making it impossible to overdose, since one simply upchucks a larger than necessary amount. There hasneverbeen a death associated with use of Kratom leaf alone --compare that with any prescription opiate/opioid, much less street drugs.\n\nI worked for a time as a legislative aid, so I understand that lawmakers and regulators have many demands on their time and sometimes only have time to scan the lobbyist statements before voting on some issues.Don't let that be the case with Kratom.\n\nYou wanted a silver bullet for the opiate crisis? --here it is use it!\n\nMany thousands, or more, mature American citizens have found kratom to be a safer alternative to opioids or western medicines' \"solutions\" and an entirely new lease on life without any of the harms or side effects associated with either street drugs or the tightrope of prescription substitutes.\n\nThe only connection that Kratom (mitragyna speciosa) has with opiates is its ability to safely block withdrawal symptoms of street drugs like heroin or dangerous Rx opiates/opioids and provide a safe alternative for pain management and/or mood support. It does not produce a \"high\" that users will chase, and is ineffective as a a recreational drug. It is actually quite subtle. Other than an absence of pain, no one would notice its effects any more than an espresso coffee. The rest is media hype and misinformation by mislead anti-drug groups and pharmaceutical companies who have noticed a drop in their revenues from the highly-addictive opiate/opioid Rx medications that are wreaking havoc on our society.\n\nThousands of older adults have been spared the horrid effects of prescription drug abuse by using this relatively harmless dietary supplement as a simple tea. If a ban on Kratom becomes law, responsible adult Americans will no longer be free to avoid the snare of chronic opiate dependence.Leave Americans a choice, don't become the drug pushers!\n\nAllow the many adult, responsible users of this herbal tea to educate you, and you will likely come to the same conclusion as the legislators in most States, that an age restriction of 18+ or 21+ is more than enough \"protection\" for consumers of this rather harmless herbal tea.\n\nThank you for allowing common sense to rule this issue rather than media hysteria and misinformation. I realize the war on drugs is always a high political priority, but don't shoot yourselves in the foot. Americans will benefit from your good sense. Good health to you.\n\nJohn Hilger\nPenacook, NH 03303\nhighwaterz2@gmail.com","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3313","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Hilger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't make this unavailable to the public.

If you don't know who that is, it my doctor.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20092","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jenifer Markoe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please allow us to keep kratom on the market..

I ended up having a seizure from the tramadol nd landed in the hospital for a few days and tested positive for PCP..I was mortified nd immensely confused because I hadn't touched a drink or a drug in almost 2 years at that point..after doing research the doctors confirmed that I had a false positive from the tramadol nd I had to stop the drug immediately ..but by this time I was addicted..I didn't know what to do nd I was horrified I had to go through this all over again ..finally a friend recommended kratom..I decided to try it nd it helped me get off the tramadol with ease nd with no side effects..it even helped me get off of all psych meds nd prescriptions I was on nd I haven't put a pill in my body for months now..kratom has helped me more than the doctors ever had since my accident ..please do not take this off the market for it can be detrimental to people like me after all the good it has done..I hope my story can reach at least one person because I have gone through alot nd disclosed my addiction but it fell upon deaf ears..please help stop the drug pushing nd not the herb that has helped so many like me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3584","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amanda Rook","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has saved my life.

I had days were I couldn't walk very well and missed work due to the pain. Went to several doctors and no help said they could try surgery but no guarantee it would help they started shoving ibuprofen in very high doses my way so now I worry about ulcers so I went to the internet and read about kratom and the help people were getting from it. I ordered 1oz  to try it and now a year later I don't miss work. So I beg you not to take this away from the thousands of people that need to have some release from pain PLEASE DONT MAKE US BE ONe OF THE HEROIN STATISTICS when you take everything away what else is there.

In all 3 cases, she was riding in the back seat of the car, and suffered multiple injuries that have been compounded by scoliosis.\n\nFor years, here only option for pain management was the use of pharmaceuticals, OTC and prescribed, that caused uncomfortable and dangerous side-affects. A couple of years ago, she discovered Kratom, and found that is significantly reduced her pain, and without side effects. Since then, she has been using small doses of Kratom instead with great success. In fact, over the last year, she has been reducing her Kratom dosing as she continues physical therapy and other treatments to heal her body.\n\nThe DEA claims that Kratom is an \"imminent hazard to the public safety.\" This is hyperbole, pure and simple. As this Newsweek article points out, single use laundry pods are vastly more dangerous to public safety than Kratom: http://www.newsweek.com/dea-list-kratom-schedule-i-effectively-outlawing-herbal-supplement-495144\n\nNeither my partner nor I are recreational drug users. My partner uses Kratom only in small doses- primarily because she doesn't want to build up a resistance to it's effects, and secondarily because larger doses give her an upset stomach.... yes, that's right, Kratom has its own mechanism to deal with over use.\n\nI am contacting you as a concerned citizen, because I have seen the major benefits in quality of life that my partner credits directly to Kratom. She is distraught that she may not be able to obtain Kratom in the future, and if she can, she is worried that since it will be illegal, she will have major concerns about quality and purity. Making Kratom illegal will have the unintended side effect of actually making it dangerous. Please do not disenfranchise the thousands of people that use Kratom for pain relief.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4360","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ramana Lagemann","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Respectful greetings, my name is Matthew Wood. I am 36 years old and have been employed as a Trust Settlement Officer Assistant for the past 4 years. I am writing this, to humbly opose the Dea's intent to include Mitragynine and 7- hydroxymitragynine on the schedule 1 controlled substances list.\n\nI started using Kratom about 2 and half years ago. I discovered and decided to sample Kratom after searching on the internet for legal stimulants similar to caffeine. I was looking for an additional plant stimulant that I could use to provide an energy boost that I desperately needed. This is because I have to battle treatment resistant Bipolar 2 Disorder and chronic fatigue disorder on a daily basis. These illness have robbed me of my, physical energy, desire, motivation, and ability to enjoy my life. \n\nIn my experience, moderate use of Kratom and Caffeine have been the  safest, healthiest, and most effective ways to manage my illness, because they temporary restore my energy,  motivation, desire, and ability to enjoy living life. I do not like to use either every day because I like to keep a low tolerance and maintain their effectiveness. I do this by using them each for 2 days a week, but on different days from each other. They both help me live a more normal active life for at least 4 out the 7 weekdays.\n\nI've been on several antidepressants and mood stabilizers. None of them were effective enough, and some of them even wrecked havoc on periods of my life. Kratom is a has been a godsend for me, and my life wouldn't be as beneficial without it. If Kratom is scheduled and no longer legal, I would lose a very powerful tool that I stratigicaly use to help me live a normal life 2 days each week\n\nBefore closing, I wanted to address your potentional concern about Kratom addiction and apply it to my own life. I have developed a physical dependency to kratom in the past. I also have developed a physical dependence to caffeine just like milions of Americans,  but It took a much longer time for Kratom tolerance and dependency to build. When I wanted to quit Kratom I was able to avoid withdrawal symptoms by doing a simple taper. I now chose to avoid dependency all together by using Kratom as  recommended, which is every 3 days. \n\nIn closing, I humbly ask that the DEA please keep this plant which I greatly respect, legally available to myself and many other Americans who responsibly use it to manage their illness and chronic physical pain.  I lost my wonderdful cousin Nicholas Gangemi when he was 35, to prescription pain killer abuse, a few years before I discovered Kratom. I wonder to this day if he still might be alive had I discovered it sooner. Please consider reviewing this article emphasising the need and importance of Kratom for pain killer use and research.\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kratom-drug-ban-may-cripple-promising-painkiller-research/\n\n\nI genuinely thank You for taking the time read and consider my personal testimony on Kratom.\n\nScincerely, \n\nMatthew Wood","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22537","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Wood","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using Kratom regularly (2-3 times per day) for 5 years now.  I have gone periods without taking it, and suffered no side affects or withdraw symptoms.  I use it to help with anxiety and stress reduction.  I find that it does not impair me in anyway whatsoever.  I can function with full cognitive capabilities, and there is no affect on coordination or nervous system impairment.  I have spoken with dozens of people who use it for withdraw from prescription pain medications successfully.  This is incredible and so much better than having to go through expensive rehab programs or having to take prescription drugs to avoid withdraw symptoms.  Kratom does not cause any health problems or negative side affects.  Further, keep in mind that in those cases where some individuals have called for medical help, after ingesting krater, that you are not taking into account how many of those individuals were taking other drugs at the same time as taking Kratom, so you are confounding your assumptions on what Kratom does or does not do.  Let's face it, a person can overdose on caffeine and have a bad outcome.  Even too much vitamin C can cause negative symptoms.  At the end of the day, there is NO reason Kratom should be outlawed or restricted.

There are countless other plants found in nature that highly toxic and will kill a human in minutes; yet, these sources of harmful substances are ignored.

I am respectfully requesting that these natural substances remain legal. My background: In July, 2005 I was sitting at a stop light waiting for the traffic light to turn green. A man in a Ford F-350 slammed into the back of my 2000 Toyota Camry. This totaled my car. After I was released from Littleton Hospial in Colorado, I met with my doctor. My doctor assessed me, and prescribed medicine to help my body heal. Over time, my body ached very badly. I did not get better. I didn't understand why. I was an Army Reserve Soldier in excellent shape. My name came down on orders to be deployed to a unit that needed a nurse. I knew my job, had learned it well. I was not allowed to be deployed due to my neck, back, body hurting constantly. I was a fast tracker in the Army Reserves. I earned the rank of E6 (Staff Sergeant) within four years. I had to go to a doctor to be assessed. Long story short, I was given 2 (2's) in my PUHLES Scoring. This killed my career, and left the Army in April 2006. Now it is November 2017. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Degenerative disc disease, and there are problems with my spine. I have met with various medical doctors, 1 Orthopaedist, Acupuncture from the traditional School of Chinese Medicine, Psyologist for decompression therapy. and now the VA Clinic. My doctor said there are no other medicines to try. I used to take oxycodone/Apap 5/325-very low dosage for pain. The CDC has made it to where doctors don't prescribe pain meds like they used to. So now, I only have these natural substances to take-this works to allow the pain level to decrease so that I may go to work and be productive. I have worked 25 long years for the government, I am trying to make it 5 more years to lock into retirement. I have to work to pay my monthly bills. Please, allow these natural substances to remain legal. This is all I have for pain that works. Thank you for your time. \nRespectfully, \nJacqueline Anderson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4263","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jacqueline Anderson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I want to say kratom is a all natural plant.

I was prescribed Pain Medication for an injury that lead to pain management. I soon realized I was addicted to this medication and was in big trouble. I tried to taper off a few times but being the sole provider working two jobs to support a family of five prevented me from ever having the time to get clean. I stayed in this struggle for three years then decided to try the maintenance drug Suboxone which is a horrible drug. I lost nearly 50 lbs became very depressed, lost & easily aggravated I hated myself. I nearly lost everything while under my doctors \"care\". My doctor said I needed to be on Suboxone for the rest of my life to prevent relapse but if i wanted to stop taking it the withdrawal was nothing compared to opiate withdrawal. I was on this horrible drug for five years and experienced many bad side effects including depression, anxiety, Low Testosterone, and major muscle loss. On April 1st, 2016, I looked at my self in the mirror and decided I was not ever going to take this medicine again. The withdrawal from Suboxone is brutal i made it 35 days on my own then ended up in the urgent care about to give up still feeling awful. I was in horrible shape, near death, a shadow of the person i desperately wanted to be. I was in terrible pain, near suicidal from the withdrawal depression, unable to work, eat, sleep, lay down, stand up or sit still and with no end to the suffering in sight. Instead of giving up I went on the internet and the Kratom community reached out and gave me a gameplan. So I went and bought a some to give it a try before i gave up and went back to Suboxone. I was very skeptical and the taste was awful but 20 minutes later I started to feel OK, by the 30 minutes mark Ifelt like a million bucks. The pain was gone as was the depression, anxiety which was replaced with hopefulnessand joy for the first time in years. The icky withdrawal feeling was totally gone!  Kratom saved my life and saved my family. I have been off Suboxone, all opiates as well as all the other nasty chemicals my doctor prescribed for me to help with the side effects. It has been 244 days and I feel great, it is great to be off those damaging drugs. All the side effects have disappeared, my life is better then I ever thought it could be and in large part its due to Kratom and the Kratom community. Please do not turn you back on the Doctor made addicts that are victims in the Opiate crisis. Unfortunately i have many friends and family members who did not get the last chance I did.

Kratom helps kill the pain and anxiety at least a little bit to make my life a little bit easier. I do not consider it a highly addictive substance, it's a very good safe alternative to opiods that are prescribed by doctors. I do not believe it will ever be the cause of death for anyone unless they were to mix it with other hard drugs. I was very happy and relieved when I found Kratom but the same day I got a sample in the mail, I read online that the DEA intended to ban it.

I am 34 years old and I work as a waiter in upscale restaurants. I have been using kratom for about 2 years now. I have been diagnosed and live with severe depression and general anxiety disorder for my entire adult life. Until I found kratom, I was prescribed almost every antidepressant and anti-anxiety med out there, old and new. when some pills would work, they would conflict with the other. And trying to stop taking one to go on another was unbearable . Never knowing if I would break into panic or jump off a building.  It seemed I was in a vicious circle of all kinds of medication, and hopelessness. \nWhen i found kratom slowly I was able to get off the meds with minimal withdrawl, and even maintain a positive outlook about my future. I use kratom twice a day at a low to moderate dose, and it has changed my world. In the last year and a half I have met the love of my life, and was even able to move into a place on my own, and am able to maintain a steady job without severe anxiety attacks keeping me unemployed.\nIf kratom had not became a part of my life I have no idea where I would be, if anywhere at all.  I am finally able to live my life, get out and enjoy company of people and the outside world. My outlook on life has completely changed since kratom became a part of it. And I simply don't know what would happen if it were no longer available. \nThank you for reading these comments, it means the world to many people including myself.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12642","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Velardi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The product has helped me in a positive way and has no negative impact.

The only reason I could see for banning this plant is because it works so well for so many issues with minimal side effects that it would give people an alternative to rx drugs and the drug companies would lose money but this should never be a reason to take away something can can help others. I want to thank you for your time and hope that you have a happy holidays.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20059","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin Fonseca","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would just like to say that I think that Kratom has been a huge blessing to me. I have struggled for years with back pain due to herniated disks. Because the only options that were available to me for years were surgery or pain pills, I just suffered silently. However, since I've discovered Kratom I felt like a new man. It made me feel great without pain for the first time in years. Almost overnight I became way more active. I lost over 80 lbs. because I was suddenly not restricted to the couch every night after work. I was able to get on the floor and play with my kids. I was finally catching up on household chores. It really has been a life changing discovery. I pray that you don't make Kratom a schedule 1 substance. It has been nothing but beneficial to me in my life. If you are really concerned for the public, outlaw opiates. They do nothing but wreck lives. I feel like these proceedings are only underway because the pharmaceutical companies want to protect their own drug cartel. I hope you do the right thing and let people continue to enrich their lives with this miraculous plant.

I challenge anyone to prove kratoms safety profile as unsuitable, let alone unsuitable compared to pure toxins that we condone such as alochol and nicotine. Even as a supplement, there is no way anyone informed on the topic, let alone an informed, university certified doctor such as myself, could even propose banning kratom, without first banning alcohol and countless other products from caucuses to poppy seeds to inhalants. Overall, it will not be my opinion that contributes to this decision but the choice between acknowledging logic, or continuing this pointless destructive and primitive drug war.

Last year, I had to retire from my profession due to issues with chronic pain which cannot be treated with surgery.\n\nI learned about kratom from a family member who also has arthritis, and researched it before trying it.   I then bought some myself and tried it.  I found it worked well to minimize my pain, and worked better than some of the prescriptions medications such as Tramadol and Hydrocodone, without the negative side effects.   It also gave me more energy, on par with coffee or vitamin B-12, and improved my mood.   \n\nI take it orally, in capsule form, intermittently, usually two or three 100 mg capsules (200-300 mg).    I found that when taking this herbal product in small quantities, I am able to better tolerate my pain and have a much better quality of life, and reduce the other opiate based medications such as Tramadol and Hydrocodone.  Also, the other medications I have been taking to treat my pain have caused problems with tinnitus that has worsened over time, but I do not have any issues with tinnitus if I use kratom instead.\n\nI have not found this plant to be habit forming in any way, but take it only as needed, and have started and stopped it several times without any issues.  I am pleased to find a natural product that does not have the habit forming aspects of hydrocodone or oxycodone, which I have been prescribed in the past.   \n\nI understand some people use this herbal product to reduce their intake of other opiate-based drugs, which I think is a great benefit to our society, as I have read a lot about the issues in some areas with opiate dependency, and how this has ruined many people's lives.  \n\nIn contrast, I see no such risk with kratom. Therefore, I hope that those who oversee this will consider a special status for this plant, or implement a moratorium on the proposed ban, so that chronic pain sufferers like myself are able to reduce their use of opiate-based medication by using this mild herbal product instead.  It has certainly worked well for me, and I have taken it now for a five or six months.   \n\nI see this product falling under the category of dietary supplement, and it could easily be regulated by existing laws under DSHEA. \n\nFinally, it would be a lose-lose scenario to ban and outlaw kratom, as it would have a negative impact on those who suffer from chronic pain (and have few options already), those who have opiate drug dependency and need an alternative, and would create a new class of outlaws in our society of those who have used this product and find it to a very effective herbal alternative.  \n\nI regret that I must provide my testimony anonymously, but feel this is necessary to protect my own privacy, yet I felt this issue was important enough that I wanted to provide my testimony, and I hope it will be well received even if anonymously given.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5297","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"DEA-442W\n\nDear Sir or madam,\nI'm going to tell you my very personal story.

Once muy supply ran out, it was easier to buy them off the street then to find a doctor. That's what I did. No one in my family had an indication because it got to a put of taking them to avoid withdrawal. Prior to that muy sister went into rehab for pill popping. I on other side was not allowed to go to rehab. The only reason everyone found out is because my dealer ran out. Withdrawal set in. A week of living hell and wishing I would die. I had very little but some help during this process. Muy sister was the one suggested taking Kratom tip help with the withdrawal symptoms and cravings. I've since been clean for 7 months because of me and the assist of Kratom. When I heard that Kratom was being pulled I got anxious. In bought as much as I could in fear of it never returning to the shelves. I've also spoke with several other people who are scared that they will relapse because of this ban. Please consider your decision very careful. I feel like by pulling it off will cause an increase to relapse. It doesn't give you the high that opiates do, it does affect the same receptors and by doing so helps keep your mind off of wanting more. The level of anxiety that I felt along with many others was so intense that all you could think about was, what was next.

It is a popular and widely used herbal supplement. People have used it for thousands (if not tens of thousands) of years for physical pain, fever reduction, diarrhea, coughs, hypertension, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and fatigue among other things. Many veterans use kratom to help with PTSD. Countless people have used it to help break their alcohol or opiate addiction. Kratom has saved many lives in this way.\nIn lower doses it's stimulating like caffeine and in higher doses it's sedating. Most people take it in their morning tea. Though some take it in capsule form because it is so bitter. You do not become inebriated from kratom and it is not an opiate. It does not cause significant or any respiratory depression. It is about as habit forming as coffee. The primary alkaloid in kratom, mitragynine, is also present in the coffee plant. Kratom's effects are mild at most. Millions of Americans (estimated 3-5 million by the AKA) are using kratom today and have been for decades. There are thousands of (possibly more than 10,000 estimated by the BEA) American kratom small businesses.\nYou tried to emergency schedule (ban) kratom in September. You cited as their reason 15 deaths over a two year timespan. You later admitted that those deaths involved other substances, which were undoubtedly the cause. Compare this to the literal millions of poisonings and deaths caused by things like prescription drugs, alcohol, tobacco, Tylenol, Aspirin, caffeine, laundry detergent pods, etc. every year. This is actually a record of amazing safety not danger. If kratom was actually dangerous as the DEA is currently portraying then there would be millions of dead people. You were actually going to put kratom into Schedule I with heroin and meth which is beyond absurd and frankly insane.\nAs an example of how kratom is treated in other places, in Canada, kratom is completely legal and classified as a NHP or Natural Health Product under Schedule 1 item 1 (plant or plant material) of the NHP Regulations. In 2015 the Florida Department of Law Enforcement studied kratom and determined that \"Kratom does not constitute a significant risk to the safety and welfare of Florida residents.\" The Florida Department of Health added that, \"there are no pervasive health issues that can be attributed to the ingestion of kratom products in Florida.\"","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7969","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi ho!

Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

Initially, I had heard of Kratom as the legal \"high\" it has been mistakenly marketed as, and I was severely disappointed. I noticed that my pain was reduced, my mood improved, and I had a little more energy, but there was no euphoria.\n\nI say this because I am one of the Americans that fell into the deep hole of opiate dependence and addiction. In 2002 I rolled a car, blowing out discs in my neck. In 2006 a chiropractor tore a disc again, rendering me in excruciating pain and limited the use of my left arm to 80%. At 26 years old and a father of 3, I looked to doctors for help. I was prescribed opiate medication, muscle relaxers and xanax, THE LETHAL COMBINATION KILLING ANERICANS. I gained significance tolerance to opiates, to the point where I could take 10 times my daily allowance at one time and feel no effects. So, I, like many Americans, turned to illicit drugs and abused my prescriptions. I lost the wife, kids, jobs, house, cars, dignity and self respect. In 2011 I enter rehab. After 4 years of sobriety, I had re injured my back and was faced with the decision to either go back on the opiates that destroyed my life, or live in excruciating pain. I went back on opiates, both prescription and illicit, and my life started to fall apart again. That's when I started looking into alternatives. I found Kratom as an alternitave, and I was told about its \"intoxicating\" effects, supposedly similar to the opiates I loved. \n\nI was severely disappointed. There was no high. I felt the effects as discribed before, so I thought more would work better like my pills and dope. I was, again, severely disappointed. I became a little nauseous and vomited up the \"extra\". I couldn't take enough to get \"high\", but I found relief from my pain, my depression, and I had some energy that I was lacking. It may have been a side effect of feeling less pain. The pain was not gone, which is good because I know I can't over do things and hurt myself. I know my limits because I can feel without dibilitating pain. \n\nI have not taken an opiate, muscle relaxer or anti-anxiety medication since finding Kratom. I no longer chase \"highs\", because I like who I am and like how I feel without being dependent on opiates. My life has improved since I have started taking Kratom as a supplement. My fianc has also found relief from debilitating back pain from degenerative discs and has improved mood offsetting her clinical depression. My neighbor with Chrones disease has found relief from her pain from Kratom. \n\nI would like to see Kratom regulated like alcohol, tobacco and supplements like Kava and St. John's Wart. It makes sense to have age restrictions and quality control measures to prevent adulteration and keep \"head shop\" garbage off of the streets. Just like \"vaporizers\" for nicotine, there are ways to make the market safer for consumers without destroying the quality of life of millions of parents, grandparents, and veterans with PTSD. I believe that the government is designed to represent the will of the people, and the people wish to hold the right to take natural supplements. \n\nIn summary, after seeing my life, my fianc, my neighbors lives all improved by taking a natural organic supplement, I STRONGLY believe that taking Kratom completely off the market will be a significant risk to the opiate epidemic and the veteran suicide epidemic. The risks have been outlined with factual research, showing that Kratom is safer than aspirin, and harms significantly less people, per capita, than doctor prescribed opiate pain killers. It has more benefits by far than alcohol or tobacco, with significantly less harmful effects. All of these claims will be backed up by the research that will be provided by scientists and researchers. I trust the DEA and FDA will make the right choice and base its decision on what the people want. It's our bodies, it's our government.

I was given opiates for leg pain years ago. I had surgery and it eliminated varicose veins and the pain subsided. However, I was given 8 Vicodin a day and found it hard to go through the withdrawals. That's when I found Kratom.\n\nToday, I still take Kratom. It has helped me eliminate not only any physical pain from muscle aches, but  also allowed me to stop taking anti-depressants and increase my ability to process information. I write articles for a living and have written over 26,000 in the last 4 years ranking at the top of my company.\n\nSome additional benefits that I have experienced from taking Kratom include the elimination of hay fever. I have had allergies all of my life. I have taken antihistamines, and was also getting steroid shots from my doctor. But after taking Kratom, I no longer have hay fever. It has also allowed me to eliminate presecibed sleeping pills (ambien) allowing me to sleep soundly soon after a lay down. This effect happens as a byproduct of taking a few teaspoons of Kratom a day.\n\nTo conclude, this has changed my life. I am now able to function at a higher level both physically and mentally, plus my depression has been gone for years.  The lack of hay fever has allowed me to go outdoors into the woods, mow my lawn, and walk through fields without sneezing. It is literally a miracle supplement and has changed my life of the better.

With all the reports of opiate overdose and death, I have feared that opiates would become illegal and/or unavailable.  Thus, I was quite interested back in September to hear on NPR a discussion about kratom and the Fed's consideration to place these leaves in the same classification as heroin.  Never having heard of kratom, I researched it extensively, reading a multitude of testimonials claiming the pain reducing properties of the leaves for a large variety of painful conditions.\n\nI ordered a bottle of capsules and received a bottle labeled \"Vietnam\".  I took two or three caps a day in lieu of the opiate and found it to be effective.   When it was nearly gone I placed another order and received a bottle of \"Maeng Da\"..  Two days after starting to take it, my \"stomach of steel\" began to hurt with increasing severity over the next several days.  With my gut in an uproar, I wondered if it was connected to the kratom.  My further research revealed that there is such a thing as \"kratom stomach flu\".  Although I took it for only two or three days, the debilitating \"flu\" symptoms have persisted for over a week, much to my dismay and disappointment.   I suspect that some strains are kinder to the gut than others, but I have a reluctance to risk further trials.\n\nIn addition to its pain reducing properties, kratom is reportedly useful in drug addiction recovery.  For that reason alone, it should remain legal.\n\nThis place will not allow me to sign my name.

It went into detail on why I appreciate the opportunity and freedom to comment, and that I would appreciate the preservation of my freedom to consume this particular plant. It discussed why I believe this potential ban is a serious mistake, about the harm it would do to individuals and families, including mine that have regained a chance at life again. It even cited the published research discussing why I believe what I do: that kratom is bereft of respiratory depression, its withdrawals are akin to Restless Leg Syndrome and similar to coffee without the headaches, and that no one has ever died from kratom use alone. I even surmised on what entities are spearheading the ban, and why.\n\nI decided against it. Partly because it was too longwinded, but mostly because I realized that would be a bit demeaning to my readers. I mean, I cant imagine this wouldnt be common knowledge to any government agency that is trying to take this tea from its citizens. I mean, the research is there, albeit limited. And thats another reason the ban would be a mistake. A plant with numerous potential medicinal values being placed in schedule 1 temporarily would extremely restrict its research, including current research at universities across America, if not outright cease research altogether. \n\nSo, instead I will tell my story, for whats it is worth; the concise version. \nI had open heart surgery when I was 3. My son had the same surgery at 20 months old. Over the course of my childhood I had various tests, procedures and more surgeries. I had to have a pacemaker implanted at age 29. In grad school I was eventually diagnosed with cardiac neurosis, a condition where one perseverates and worries about cardiac related fears, including death. Indeed I feared that I was going to suddenly die, every day. I was prescribed SSRIs, benzodiazepines, and various other drugs. Each had their own side effects, but unfortunately most of them did not adequately address my issue, and if it did, the side effects were crippling (brain zaps, inability to focus, lethargy etc). Both my condition and the various side effects of the prescribed medications almost ended my collegiate career and even my marriage. I had a newborn son and simply refused to let it all fall apart. \n\nI researched online and found a plant named kratom. I researched its alleged safety and efficacy. I decided the potential risks were minimal (vomiting) and the rewards may actually be worth it. \n\nThat was one of the best and most important decisions of my life. After adding a mug of kratom tea to my daily regimen, I was able to focus on finishing graduate school. I got married, had my son Andrew (whos open heart surgery went perfectly at 20 months old) and grew my family with an amazing daughter named Olivia. I moved to Brevard County Florida, began working in our regional medical center as a Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist, 5 years later became a professor at Keiser University all while telling others how kratom had turned my life around. \n\nMy primary care physician supports my choice to consume kratom tea. She is glad that I do not require harder addictive substances such as benzodiazepines. I have even decided to attach my most recent labs for further scrutiny. This is after 10 years of almost daily ingestion.\n\nIf kratom is taken from me, I am terrified I will begin to experience full-fledged cardiac neurosis. I am very uncomfortable even entertaining what that will mean to my family, friends, and career. And more than anything, I can only hope that my son will not be stricken with cardiac neurosis, but if he does, I pray that the blessing of a plant named kratom will be there to support him in life, as it was for his father. \n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nGreg Cannon MS, RD, LD/N\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3001","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Greg Cannon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Edward Dubois I am a technical support analyst for a large IT outsourcing company. I have been using kratom on and off daily all year (2016) it has helped my life tremendously for the better. I have struggled with addiction my whole life and kratom is the ONLY supplement that leaves my brain to function normally without the use of opiates. I am now functional and productive. Kratom has also helped with my depression/anxiety as well. This plant has amazing properties and has kept me healthy during very rough periods of time. Without turning back to opiates to function normally it has released me from addiction. Suboxone was a crutch that never let me go whereas kratom lets me live without the need to medicate myself with mind numbing opiate derivatives. I urge anyone reading this to keep kratom legal to help whoever needs a push to recovery without the use of extrememly addicting substances. We need to further study this plant and making it a scheduled/controlled substance we halt these studies. Please consider the health of America and let this wonderful supplement be free of a failing drug war and policy. The answer to addiction from opiates CANNOT be more opiates, it only agitates/prolongs recovery. From Vicodin to Oxycontin to Heroin to methadone/suboxone this is the path that Americans have when addiction to opiates occur. Keeping kratom legal will provide much needed pain relief among other relief and help to those looking for healthy productive minds without the use of drugs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15125","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Edward Dubois","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"No.  No government control.

Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n\n\nOne of the uses of kratom is as a treatment opiate addiction. \nOpiate addiction is a widespread problem.

I used to take many different anti anxiety medications as well as narcotics. With the help of my psychiatrist i weened myself off of both Xanax and Valium using Mitragyna Speciosa; Because of my Mitragyna Speciosa use i no longer need to take a pill which is very harmful with extended use. I generally feel anxiety free throughout my day and do NOT get any withdrawals like i did with any of the prescribed medications if i missed a dose.  I still see my psychiatrist for anxiety but simply to discuss how well the different types and strains of Mitragyna Speciosa work for me and dosages. Putting a ban on Mitragyna Speciosa would not only destroy the last four years of working very hard to get off pharmaceuticals but it would also make my life and thousands of others very complicated. I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety and i work in retail. If Mitragyna Speciosa is to be banned my life will change drastically to the point where i could go back to Valium or Xanax but would be risking overdoses, withdrawals as well as all the other negative side effects of pharmaceuticals. I also had Rotator Cuff surgery three years ago and nothing could touch the pain except for high doses of Oxycontin or morphine. I absolutely hated the feeling it gave me on a day to day basis. I felt abnormal and felt very unsocial. Once i discussed with my surgeon that i take Mitragyna Speciosa for my anxiety, we then discussed different strains of Mitragyna Speciosa that could help with my post surgery pain. I am 100% off all pharmaceutical drugs and i have never felt better in my life. Please think about how little my story is and then think about the thousands upon thousands of people with worse stories than mine that benefit from Mitragyna Speciosa . Please do not make myself and others around the united states alter our way of life for no reason at all. Mitragyna Speciosa is NOT a hard drug like heroin, cocaine, Oxycontin, Valium or PCP, it is a simple plant with amazing medicinal properties and is SAFE. The only documented deaths or issues with Mitragyna Speciosa deal with other TRUE drugs that were mixed with Mitragyna Speciosa, such as alcohol or narcotics that caused the issues. It would be outrageous to even consider the idea that they are near the same. Mitragyna Speciosa. Please rethink the situation and use logic and moral sense to help the many users of Mitragyna Speciosa. Thank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3130","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nicholas Fazio","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Good Day, \n\nMy name is Jack M. I am a Kratom user. I use Kratom for relief from multiple sclerosis. I chose to treat myself ( with my Dr's consent) with as much natural remedy as possible as I do not like using conventional pharmaceuticals for a whole list of reasons. 1 primary reason is pain pills. I have a legitimate rx for Oxycontin and frankly it scares me. This is because of how dangerous and addicting it can be...even if used as directed over many years. \nI had to do something to deal with the pain from my MS and after many days researching I chose to try Kratom. Plain leaf (non extract) Kratom. I have used Kratom since 2010. \nI take 3 doses of 5 grams daily. I have never been sick from Kratom.. I have never had any bad experiences. I do not drink. I do not smoke. I do not consume caffeine. \nI am a 38 year old college graduate that works 50 hours a week as a human resources manager.  I MUST be able to perform at a high level daily. Kratom helps to ensure this happens.  Kratom if used as it is intended is a perfectly safe plant. Even if taken in excess there has been no deaths from Kratom. Not 1. There has been deaths associated with MIXING Kratom with OTHER drugs...but not alone. \nIf Kratom were to be banned I would be forced to take REAL opiate pain medication. As an american citizen I chose to NOT take these pain pills...again from the dangers associated with them.\n\nI am asking for the powers that be to please look at my case and many other Americans cases as well as real science behind Kratom to make an informed decision and to allow us to live freely and safely. \n\nI am willing to discuss this via phone or any other way needed. \nI am quite sure that if one were to speak with me under the  usage of Kratom I would prove not only capable but also productive.  There is simply no reason to outlaw this plant. \n\nIt is safe. It is effective. It is NOT illicit.  Please reconsider. \n\n\nRespectfully, \n\n\nJackson Mustaine\nMonroe, Louisiana ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1485","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jackson Mustaine","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Lloyd.\n\nI am in favor of keeping Kratom legal.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13394","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, my name is Michael Mathews and I am in favor of keeping Kratom legal.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16909","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI would just like to plea my case to not ban the use of kratom. I am 30 years old now, but when I was 18 and before I even graduated from high school I started a job at a furniture warehouse. I would lift 100-200 lb pieces of furniture day in and day out. Within a few years I was already diagnosed with degenerative discs and it only got worse from there. I had to stay there for a decade because my daughter was born when I was 20 and it seemed impossible to find another job as a single parent. Any how, after seeing doctors, rheumatologists, and orthopedic surgeons the put me on opiates. As we all know these are very easy to become dependent on and that's what happened to me over the years. I didn't like feeling like i didn't have control of my life so I was looking for something to help. I found kratom in May 2016 and it was like a GOD SEND. It helps with everything. My pain and also my anxiety and depression are basically held in check with kratom. I've come to use kratom more than opiates because it only feels like more of a coffee craving than a narcotic and it's so much easier to live like that instead of being addicted to opiates. After i heard that kratom was being banned my heart dropped. Thousands of us use this just to help get through the days and I ask that you do not just outright ban it. Regulations would be just fine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4882","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Julian Rivera","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not  be a schedule 1 drug.

In addition to bachelor's degrees in nursing and biology, I hold active professional certifications. For many years, I have been a gardener and have extensively researched and used herbs for their therapeutic properties.  Several years ago, I suffered an injury which resulted in chronic pain and dysfunction. Unfortunately, providers that I sought out for help turned out to be none at all. Some had off-based profit motives that disgusted me, and others gave vague conflicting diagnoses and told me I was on my own with this. So - I researched what might help, and kratom was one of my \"finds\".  I was impressed with kratom's long history of effective use in relieving pain and in increasing the capacity to do hard work. I ordered some online and was not disappointed. Kratom has helped me meet high physical and mental demands, despite my injury. In the past 2 years, I have rarely been even slightly ill and have not called off a single shift at my job. \n     Daily in my work, I see the ravaging effects of alcohol, tobacco, and opioids on population health.  Never have I seen a problem due to kratom.  To the contrary, there is robust evidence that kratom is beneficial in many ways. One huge apparent benefit is its effectiveness in weaning from killer opioids. I believe that, in its unrefined natural state, kratom poses no hazards and should not be placed on any type of enforcement \"scheduling\".  Like thousands of other medicinal herbs, it should be available for citizens to use responsibly.  \n     If you have not already done so, please read the attached 2011 Report of the Global Commission on Drug Policy: http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/wp-content/themes/gcdp_v1/pdf/Global_Commission_Report_English.pdf \n ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7097","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement\n kratom.

If this plant is really as dangerous as some @ the DEA would like us to believe, then surely they would have no trouble explaining that in a transparent legislative session. \n\nThe intention of emergency scheduling is not to suddenly criminalize a plant thousands of years after people began using it. The purpose of emergency scheduling is to get drugs like bath salts off the streets, and they are completely synthetic. Come to think of it, the only reason people were buying bath salts is because they could not legally purchase or use their drugs of choice (likely MDMA, amphetamine, or cocaine) -- all of which are safer and better studied than their subsequent \"bath salt\" analogues.\n\nThe only thing scheduling kratom will accomplish is that these gas stations and smoke shops will begin selling new, unscheduled, completely synthetic, untested analogs of mitragynine. It will be a bath salt situation, but this time with ultra-potent mu-opioid agonists. It seems to me that people are currently filling a hole inside of them with sand. Why force them to switch to dynamite?\n\nMy honest advice to the DEA as a friend is to do yourself a favor and quit while you are ahead. The alternative, as with all prohibition efforts before, is the continued accumulation of blood on the hands of those responsible for these policies.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0295","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have suffered from back pain and depression with anxiety for many years now.

I've never been a user of any recreational drugs, even to this day, as Kratom (Mitragyna Speciosa) is Not a drug. It is a pure, all natural, regulated dietary ingredient.\n\nKratom was a way for me to overcome a low point in my life. I didn't have a lot of motivation, and I felt like it was something that I could use to give me the edge that I needed to pull myself out of a depression and take charge in my own life. \n\nThat's exactly what I did. \n\nI learned how to use it responsibly, before ever even consuming it. I have logged almost every time that I have taken any, and I always rotate strains, to prevent any probability of gaining a tolerance. I personally have absolutely no addiction to Kratom. I have proven this time and time again. Kratom IS NOT Addictive. \n\nThere are almost No negative effects of kratom, unless you combine kratom with DRUGS, that are proven to be harmful, or use it irresponsibly. \n\nContrary to misinformed, popular belief, Kratom isn't intended for the use to get \"high;\" Kratom is used to enhance and sharpen one's mind, as well as increase the user's productivity and mood in a very subtle way. \n\nI'm asking the DEA to not ban kratom Or Any of it's naturally occurring alkaloids, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine.

It never dulled me down or made me incoherent or unable to operate a vehicle, even at higher doses. It doesn't make you feel high or any different, all it ever did was give me ambition and drive to work hard for longer periods of time with little to no pain. It helped my abstinence from pain meds that made me incoherent and unable to accomplish daily tasks. It saved my life and my family, by allowing me to break a pain pill addiction that was controlling my life and taking me down a destructive path.\nOn pain meds I couldn't feel emotions or empathy for life in general. But when I started Kratom and stopped the pain meds, I started to regain my ability to feel real emotions. It was as if a dark vail had been lifted from me and I could actually remember what it was like to cry again with an open heart with tears of joy. Thats when I relized what my life had been missing. And what opiods (pain pills) had been taking from me. \nKratom is not a drug, it is not an opiate nor an opioid.\nKratom is composed of natural active alkaloids 7-Hydroxymytraginine and Mytraginine.\nAnd should be available to everyone in its natural form who could benefit from its possible life changing qualities. If the government takes Kratom away from the people we are not really living in a free country. And millions of daily lives will suffer tramendiously and our society as a whole will suffer.

Comment on FR Doc #2016-24659. I am sixty-six years old and a retired teacher. At forty-six, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and prescribed Prozac, Hydrocodone, Xanax and Ambien.  My treatment plan progressed and Lyrica, Ultram, Tramadol, anti-inflammatories, steroids, hypnotherapy, massage, acupuncture, chiropractic treatment and laser therapy added and inter-changed. Through the years, my profile expanded and my life diminished by inclusion of degenerative arthritis, spinal stenosis, cancer, knee replacement, disc repair, laminectomy and carpal tunnel. Twenty years post diagnosis, I filed for early retirement.  Few knew my \"secret\" as disclosure was often received with misunderstanding and misadvice. I made my way, took my drugs, kept my secret and readied myself for the monster that reduced and erased my hope. I have served as a Girl Scout leader,  been nominated \"Teacher of the Year\", volunteered at the local zoo, worked with wildlife rescue, served as Elder in my church, directed Vacation Bible School, taught Sunday School, directed and written school musicals, volunteered with local theatre and committed myself to living with a condition that reduced me through chronic pain and fatigue. \n\nIn 2014 I weaned myself from the opioids and pharmaceuticals; I decided to try the natural plant, Kratom, the flu-like malaise, pain and chronic fatigue were eased.  Why does the DEA and FDA advocate criminalization of a plant that is helping me? I am harming no one and living without the side effects of pharmaceuticals should be my choice. It is a gross disservice to thousands of responsible adults to dismiss our testimonials of recovery and pain reduction with Kratom.  President Obama has expressed his desire to win the war on drugs. Why was our presence ignored on Pennsylvania Avenue?  I feel victimized by the big business of pharmaceutical addiction. Allow me my choice to choose Kratom. The plant has not been responsible for a single death. Alcohol is legal and lethal as it destroys the American family.  Kratom is my best choice into the day which is a journey in determination. I am one voice among thousands advocating that Kratom need not be scheduled. \n\nWe face daily obstacles which require presentation of the best we can give. It is my nature to do my best with my gifts. There will be a day when each of us must deal with acceptance of limited mobility, cognitive difficulties and life threatening challenges. I am standing at the threshold of my greatest challenge; a family member has been diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia. It is my nature to help navigate the heartbreak that my daughter experiences as caregiver and primary breadwinner for her young family. I might as well be dead if I am unable to help her emotionally and physically. The natural leaf Kratom has helped me and will support me in this unexpected and demanding role. Why place me in the position where I am unable to help my child? I know from supplementing with Kratom that I can be present for her. My diagnosis is not life threatening but it is life challenging. \n\nWhat can I do to gain understanding that my condition is helped with Kratom? You are invited to follow me throughout my days in order to ease your concerns about Kratom being addictive or a threat to society. This natural alternative to pharmaceuticals will support me and thousands who want nothing more than living productively with conditions characterized by pain and fatigue. How does the FDA reach the conclusion it is in my best interest to take from me and thousands that may help support mental, physical and emotional well being.  It is the nature of a healthy mind and spirit to choose a productive lifestyle. With my time on earth, I aspire to be my best self; not just for myself but the family and friends I cherish. I am Kratom.\n\nMary W Jones","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9285","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mary Jones","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to make comments on your proposed measure to ban Kratom and tell you how it has helped my husband and I. Our lives would be quite different without it.\n\n7 years ago I had to retire early and go on disability for migraines. I was 59 years old and am now 64. I had a very long and successful career as an art director for magazines. I have an MFA in Design and have won many design awards. I was also at the top of my career. I was diagnosed with daily migraine. The headaches were continuous and I was put on daily opiates for pain40 mugs daily and given Xanax for anxiety. We lived in Virginia at that time and have since moved to Houston, TX. While I gained a new team of great doctors for my condition in Houston, they wanted me off opiates (turns out the opiates were making the migraines worse) and Xanax. I was offered nothing but Aleve for pain.\n\nIn desperation I searched for some herb that would help with the constant pain and found Kratom. I can't express fully how it improved my life. I also suffer from depression and anxiety. Kratom helps all three problems. \n\nKratom works well to ease the pain in my head. It is also a mood elevator and reduces anxiety. My husband has serious back problems. Serious enough that it requires him to to require daily medication and spinal shots. Even though he has opiates, he prefers to take Kratom as there are no side effects. He has told me he would not be able to continue working without it. (my husband is 63).\n\nThere is nothing in this herb that causes hallucinations or a \"high\" like opiates. There is no way to overdose on this herb. I have tried large doses and it does not seem to do anything more than what a regular dose does. It seems like your body absorbs only so much of what is the active ingredient.\n\nI am stunned to hear people make remarks about this herb being dangerous.

Why are you listening to these hysterics who know nothing about this \"drug\". \n\nI don't want to believe this, but it makes the DEA sound like it is league with the pharma companies who want to synthesize the active ingredients and make it into pill form so they can sell it as a controlled drug.

I work 10 hour shifts, and I work 50 hours A week. I use organic Kratom from A reputable online vendor to keep me  focused when I work long hours. I have been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression. Kratom helps me live A more functional and fulfilling life by helping me manage my attention deficit disorder,  anxiety, and depression. I have been prescribed drugs such as adderall and Ritalin for my attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Xanax for my anxiety, and Prozac for my Depression. In my experience the drugs I have been prescribed have been much more dangerous with much higher addiction potential then Kratom. Adderall is A combination brand drug made from dextroamphetamine and amphetamine. It has A high addiction potential and can be lethal. Even if you don't take too much adderall and overdose it can be dangerous because of it's cardiac effects. Xanax is also very addictive and can kill you. Even if Xanax doesn't kill you it can still cause memory problems, drowsiness, coordination problems, dependency, and even addiction. I am currently off medication. I presently just use kratom, and I feel so much healthier. I've been around the block and I know what's dangerous and what isn't. Prescription amphetamines like adderall, and benzodiazepines like xanax are drugs with high addiction potential that can kill. Kratom is an organic herb that grows on A tree. Kratom has about the same addiction potential as coffee and you can't overdose on it. Kratom has been A miracle medicine for me. I'm A goal oriented person, and Kratom helps me stay motivated in my career. Kratom also helps me work out harder in the gym and recover faster from my workouts. Kratom helps me in my relationships with people by reducing my anxiety. Kratom helps me fall asleep faster, and sleep longer. I eat A clean diet, run marathons, and work overtime at my job. I can credit Kratom for helping me achieve many goals in my career and in the gym. In our American society where tobacco and alcohol are legal we shouldn't make Kratom illegal. My reasoning is that it is estimated that about 450000 to 500000 Americans die from tobacco related diseases such as lung cancer, esophageal cancer, bladder cancer, or heart disease every year. It is estimated that 75000 to 88000 deaths can be traced back to alcohol use. Alcoholic liver disease, fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol poisoning, and drunk driving deaths can be 100% attributed to alcohol abuse, and liver cancer, hypertension, and stroke deaths can be partially linked to alcohol abuse. In our society tobacco is available in stores to anyone of age and is clearly poison. I would know I quit smoking A couple of years ago. Alcohol is also available in stores to anyone 21 years old and is toxic when misused. If our society accepts tobacco and alcohol it is my opinion that it is obvious that Kratom deserves to be respected as an herbal supplement and remain legal and available. Kratom is an herb not A drug, and it has low addiction potential. You also can't overdose on Kratom. That is something you can't say about the very popular drug caffeine. Kratom has been available in the United States for mere decades, but Kratom is an ancient herb that has been used for millennia. I encourage you to research the entire history of Kratom, not just the small window of it's use in America. Kratom is native to southeast Asia and is related to coffee. Kratom benefits me more then the harder prescription drugs I used to use with less side effects, addiction potential, and dangers. If Kratom wasn't available to me anymore it would become really challenging for me to manage my attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, and to keep working 50 hours A week. My work is demanding and I have to lift things that weigh over 80 pounds over and over for ten hours straight, and If I couldn't use Kratom my work would be A lot difficult for me. I would be negatively impacted if I no longer had access to the herb Kratom. I'm not A doctor and nothing in this comment should be perceived as medical claims. Kratom should stay legal and available because we are in the middle of an opiate epidemic in America and Kratom helps opiate addicts quit pain medication and heroin. It also helps people with real pain management issues, and people that work demanding hours at work like me. I really believe kratom saves lives and making it unavailable to the general public would have A negative impact on American society. Just look at States that have laws that prohibit Kratom use. They have higher opiate and opiate related deaths. I don't believe that making herbs in their natural form unavailable to the general public is the way that adults that work full time, pay their taxes and vote should be treated by their government.

My father had just passed after a long battle with Alzheimers in which I was one of the primary caretakers.  I was emotionally devastated and drained and very depressed. I was talking to a friend of mine about how he got out of a deep depression and he mentioned exercise and a little known plant from Southeast Asia  Kratom.\nI did some research online and ordered some samplers and was astonished how quickly it had improved my life- despite feelings of sadness for the loss of my father,  I finally had the energy and mood to face the day and world again.    After some experimentation, I found my ideal dose and started taking 1 teaspoon twice a day.  I dove back into work and life with a vengeance.  There is no doubt in my mind that Kratom played a major role in \nFor years I also suffered from migraines  about 5-10 or so a month.   I was prescribed a mild opiate prescription drug to battle the migraines and had been taking them as needed for years.    About 2 months into taking Kratom I realized that I simply hadnt had a migraine.    That was one of the side effects that I was not anticipating.    IN the 2 years since Ive been taking Kratom Ive had only a handful of Migraines so it has substantially improved my quality of life in that respect as well.\nI understand that the pharmaceutical industry will be crating many new analgesic and non-analgesic drugs from the active alkaloids in Kratom and Im all for that!   It will prevent countless people from experiencing the addiction and the terribly side effects that go along with the current opiate based pharmaceutical trends.

This appears to be a case of corruption where government officials who are supposed to protect the people sell out for personal profit and protect the pharmaceutical corporations' profits.  What is happening here appears to align with the evil and greed that is destroying the freedom, health,  and prosperity of this nation. For another one of the many cases of similar greed,  please see the following page:    blog.norml.org/2016/09/24/pharma-company-admits-opposing-marijuana-legalization-to-protect-its-corporate-profits/     I am almost 60 years old, I work an outdoor job in Montana and I suffer chronic pain in my joints and lower spine. I didnt feel it wise to go to the doctor for prescription pain killers to use while working on and around heavy equipment, but I also knew the pain levels were going to cause me to become disabled and no longer able to work. I discovered Kratom three years ago and in it found a solution that controls the pain while keeping me an alert and safe worker. I feel well, my strength has been restored and I am again able to keep up in the work place with people much younger than I am. When I first heard recently about the DEA plans to schedule Kratom in the same category as heroin, I did not believe something this crazy and ridiculous could be true. What the DEA is doing here is an aggressive insult and assault on the intelligence of US citizens.  The people's choice of Donald Trump in this recent election should have sent a clear message to the government concerning how we feel about government corruption. Apparently the DEA has not caught on yet to the evidence of how the silent majority feels. Kratom does not get me high& if anything it increases alertness. Alertness and safety are not possible for me if I am forced by the medical experts at the DEA to go on disabling prescription opiates for pain control.  I won't do it,  I am strong and I will choose to live with the pain before I will give in to the greed and corruption as I view it here.  I refuse to take prescription opiates or any drugs.  I trust natural herbs,  and no government official has the God given right to deny an herb to any human on this earth,  and to think that they do is an assault upon truth.  I also will refuse to take the kratom based drug (that is the entire motive for this proposed and corrupt ban of the herb),  which will be coming forth from Glaxo Smith Klein which is a distorted fluoride extract of the kratom herb which I doubt will be safe,  and which (after man's tampering), will have dangerous side effects. Take Valerian for example: Valerian is a safe and calming herb:   nothing could be more safe.  After being chemically tampered with, however, this safe herb is transformed into a drug called Valium.  Valium is a dangerous and addicting drug that has destroyed thousands if not millions of lives and has killed people. If \"safety of the people\" is the real issue here,  then why isn't Valium illegal?   Hello, Govt: do not tell me out of one side of your mouth that I live in a free country, while out of the other side of your mouth you are stating that as an adult, I am not intelligent enough, not able and not allowed to decide what is safe or unsafe to put into my own body. I know myself, and I know what works for my situation. The DEA is going to make the government look pretty stupid and corrupt for busting people with chronic pain for their great crimes of wanting to remain productive, working and tax paying citizens.

While a majority of the bad wrap that kratom receives is from being sold in Mylar plastic bags and jars at gas stations and head shops, a lot of good does come from this product. Yes it certainly should be taken off the shelves so people are not inclined to buy it in a common atmosphere to when you are buying soda and snacks or tobacco (head shop, gas station, smoke shops, etc) and it most definitly should be regulated at 18 years only online to buy.\n\nBut from everyone I know that uses kratom I would say 9 out of 10 individuals use it for a chronic illness that they can not get relief without a pharmaceutical painkiller which has undesired, deadly side effects like withdrawal and dependency. Very rarely do you come across someone that is able to \"get high\" or use it for recreational purposes. Sure, as with any LEGAL pharmeceutical, the initial doses might offer an effect that one might find euphoric or enjoyable, but as with any RX (prozac, citalopram, oxycodone, vicodin, trazodone) they do the same, and once it works into your system you no longer get it.\n\nKratom has a very low addiction potential, and the withdrawal from those of the heaviest users that choose to stop can only be described as A VERY SLIGHT form of withdrawal in regard to physical symptoms, compared to popular pharmaceutical withdrawals.\n\nDo not ban kratom or you will be screwing up a lot of peoples lives, and not just a group of drug addicts that you seem to think encompasses the kratom user base.\n\nCHEERS","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9743","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Timothy Radcliffe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am not even understanding the reasoning for scheduling Kratom as a class I drug. We are comparing Kratom to heroin? That doesn't make any sense. There is no scientific evidence to back this up. It is a very dangerous rode if we start taking away free choice without any real logical evidence behind it. Even bringing this ban up seems to be tied to the prescription drug industry which have been and will lose out on revenue from pain and anxiety meds if Kratom stays legal. What's more important big pharma's income or the ability for individuals to make their own decisions regarding their body? If this ban goes through, the DEA is choosing profits over people's well being. Pain pills are killing people nationwide and there is a solution to this problem in Kratom and the DEA wants to ban it? In what world is that a sound decision? Even bringing this potential ban to fruition has exposed to DEA's lack of medical and scientific knowledge.

He stole many of my favorite electronics when I was a child. My brother is a good person, opiates turned him into something else. He tried several times to get clean but it only ever lasted a few weeks. Eventually he used Kratom as an aid to help with withdrawal, and after two months of finally being heroin free, he was able to quite taking Kratom. He has lived clean ever since. I believe Kratom aided him in a journey that brought his life back. He had no withdrawals getting off Kratom as he did with other substances he would try to take to aid during former withdrawals.\n\nI also begun taking Kratom at a time when I dropped out of school and lost motivation after being diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder that causes chronic depersonalization and derealization and horrible headaches. Kratom helped me gain back motivation. I also started exercising and eating better. I was able to quit taking clonazapam. The withdrawals were tough and long but I made it through with Kratom being one of the things that helped me. I went back to school and am currently still attending the University of Utah. I have maintained a 4.0 despite the brain fog from my disorder. I feel hope again for the future. I have stopped taking Kratom since the potential ban has been in place. I have reduced my Kratom usage from daily to weekly. I experienced nothing besides a runny nose with the reduction. It felt about equivalent to taking a break from coffee. I have had a harder time keeping up on my studies due to renewed headachs that Kratom was helping with.\n\nI am also very concerned about the reasoning behind this ban. The number of calls to poison control being 660 over five years is not alarming to me. poison control centers received 6,843 reports of young children ingesting single-load laundry pods in just the first seven months of 2016. I'm sure you have already heard that the deaths linked to Kratom almost all involved other substances mixed with the Kratom making a direct cause of death being Kratom hard to conclude. I understand that The World Health Organization estimates that 4.6 million people die each year from causes directly attributable to air pollution. Opiods killed more than 28,000 people in 2014. I feel there are much bigger things to worry about and spend tax dollars on. Locking up people for Kratom, in my view, will not reduce as much harm as it will cause to people such as my brother and I. I would like to see the DEA focus more on reducing that very real Opiod death toll.  \n\nIt short, Kratom has helped both my brother and I in different ways and has brought no negative consequences with it. It feels very benign to both take and quit taking. It certainly does not feel intoxicating. I am strongly opposed to the ban on Kratom and hope you will find it in your heart to let people who are benefiting from Kratom remain doing so. \n\nSincerely, \n\nChase Stephens","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18819","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chase Stephens","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Sir, I have 3 bulging disk, 2 herniated disk, two vertibrae  with compression  fractures, bone spurs  on the vertibraes, and arthritis in my lower back.

It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose. \n\nI have been dealing with depression and anxiety for years now. Three years ago, things became a lot worse after I lost my grandmother. I had a lot of guilt inside me after she past. I would go days being in the worst mood for no particular reason. My anxiety would get so bad that I could not willingly be around anyone. I would not talk to any of my friends or family. I would avoid the people in my every day life day in and day out. I had no will to live. There are many personal issues that lead to this I believe, but I never addressed it. I always put it off to the side and convinced myself that I did not have problems going on in my head. It was no way to live. When you have anxiety and depression, your way of life seems unbearable. I began to abuse prescription pain killers to deal with my issues but after months and months of living through hell dealing with my new addiction. \n\nI began to do my own research on natural substances that will have the same medicinal properties. I even tried to speak to close family members or friends about how I was feeling and nothing worked. I learned that just letting things out and having therapy sessions did not fix anything. So I knew I had something more serious then I thought. \n\nI then came to Kratom and tried it for the first time and it was everything I needed. I now live happily every day. My days are not grueling and unbearable anymore. I am able to spend time with family and friends. Kratom has changed my life completely. I have more clean energy to my days. I have spent over 4 years dealing with my depression and anxiety. I now have a will to live every day to the fullest. Best of all, I am completely off prescription medications and have no need or urge to take any more. Kratom and it's many beneficial properties has gotten my life back together and prevented me from going down many wrong paths in life.

Her condition deteriorated over the years, and she has been in relentless, chronic, excruciating pain for years. Can the government representatives who determine her future know what it's like to be in relentless, chronic, excruciating pain that no prescription painkiller can help for very long, that no surgery can heal completely or even help without incredible risk, including making it worse? The only thing that provides her relief is kratom. And kratom doesn't just help - it eliminates the pain! Kratom enables her to function - drive, work, attend her youngest daughter's chorus concerts, visit friends and actually enjoy their company instead of masking pain, take care of the vast array of family members she loves and who depend on her. When she first told me they were planning to take this away from her, I froze in horror at the thought of what this would do to her life. My mother has suffered so much throughout her life, but she had found this ONE way to effectively fight her pain and allow her to live. And it was going to be stolen from her, why? For what purpose?! Because some people insisted it was dangerous and that an overdose could kill you? Hmmm...\n\nWater - safe in many quantities, even necessary, but too much of it, and you die (it's called drowning).\nTylenol - perfectly legal, useful substance sold over the counter with no restrictions, but too much of it? Not good.\nBleach - perfectly legal, useful product sold everywhere with no restrictions, but drink it, and you die.\nCigarettes - perfectly legal, popular product for everyone in the U.S. over 18 years of age with the potential to slowly kill you from various forms of cancer.\nAlcohol - perfectly legal, popular product for everyone in the U.S. over 21 years of age with the potential to kill you and even cause you to harm others.\nSex - dangerous activity responsible for spreading horrible diseases to millions of people every year. There has been no proposal to restrict people's freedom to have anytime, anywhere, with whomever they want under any circumstances.\n\nKratom - an herb that for many people is the only thing standing between them and excruciating, constant, incurable, untreatable pain.\n\nYou ban one potentially dangerous substance or activity, if your motive is truly the safety of people, you have to ban ALL potentially dangerous substances and activities.\n\nCitizens of the United States are not serfs or subjects of the government which has the right to control every single, solitary detail of their lives in exchange for taking care of all their needs. People who are citizens, not subjects, have a personal responsibility to take care of themselves and make their own decisions. People should have the right to weight the benefits of using kratom against the risks and decide for themselves if it's worth the risk; the government should not have the right to make this decision for them.\n\nEspecially important: there is no need for the government to protect people from any overwhelming danger from kratom! There has been no epidemic of people overdosing and dying from this herb. It does not make one high. It does not impair judgment. It does not affect one's mental state at all and has no debilitating physical side effects. It's a cost-free pain reliever. Potentially dangerous in too high quantities? See above list - the existence of a small risk of addiction or danger from too much is obviously not the standard used to ban a substance or activity. A bigger priority would be outlawing sex outside of approved, government-run institutions where applicants are screened for STDs and interviewed for competency prior to being permitted to do the deed. Think of the unfortunate consequences people would be relieved from under such measures! Why has no one proposed such a measure to protect people from bad decision-making?\n\nThe proposal to ban kratom came from people who don't use the herb, have no need to use the herb, and don't know anyone who use the herb. Anyone who supports such a bill should first spend significant time with chronic pain sufferers who rely on this herb's effects so they know what lives they'll be ruining. And for what gain? Banning kratom would gain nothing. It would cause no benefits to society at all because you're banning a substance that hasn't caused society to suffer! Chronic pain sufferers who found relief will be forced to lose that relief, and nobody will gain anything in return.\n\nFor the sake of my mother and all innocent, chronic pain sufferers in the United States, I strongly urge you to leave them free to find relief from kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2260","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jill Geisler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please DO NOT ban KRATOM it has saved my life an the lives of so many others it will only make things worse people will be forced to take awful pain killers an turn back to other harmful drugs an other substances please reconsider THANKYOU\n                                                                                            KEVIN P.

I am a 46 year old male, registered professional geologist, environmental department manager and safety director at an engineering firm, and husband and father.  I have dealt with chronic pain, depression and anxiety throughout my entire life.  I have been to many doctors and placed on many different pain meds, anti-inflammatories, anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications over the years.  All of the medications I have been prescribed had side effects which left me either feeling sick, lethargic, spaced-out and/or addicted.  I was constantly searching for new medications that could adequately and safely take care of my issues and deliberately ignored natural remedies thinking they could never work better than a laboratory-made pharmaceutical.  However, earlier this year I reached my tipping point and after reading many testimonials from numerous people online, I decided to try Kratom.  After all, desperate times call for desperate measures.  I am so glad that I did.  Kratom has completely given me my life back! Who would ever have thought that one plant could relieve conditions that multiple pharmaceuticals collectively could not...and with no side effects!!!  The best part is that there is no \"high\" feeling and I feel \"normal\" again.  Please don't believe the negative hype that is perpetuated by people who know very little about the plant and likely have never tried it.  It would be a grave mistake for the DEA to make Kratom a Schedule I.  This plant must be studied so that its full potential can be realized.  Ultimately, why would you ban a plant that has shown the potential to treat a number of mental and physical illnesses naturally with little to no side effects?  You would be doing this country and the millions that suffer from chronic pain, depression and anxiety (to name a few) a great disservice by not studying the medicinal qualities of this wonderful plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6325","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jim Kunzelman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Why on earth is this even being considered?

I also suffer from GI issues and abdominal pain from multiple hernias and an inoperable hiatal hernia. And I have been taking the herbal supplement known as Kratom for over nine years to help me manage the pain, depression and anxiety that come from having to deal with these issues on a daily basis. \n\nTo be clear, I have tried many doctors. I have undergone painful surgery, and have been prescribed powerful opiate pain killers like Vicodin, hydrocodone, and oxycodone to help me manage my pain. My medicine chest is overflowing with muscle relaxants, and prescription strength naproxyn, diclofenac and other NSAID pain killers. \n\nAs you are most likely aware, all of these drugs come with an assortment of side effects that are well documented by the medical community. The byproduct of all these medications, make it difficult for me to be an effective provider for my family when I am taking them. The prescription strength nsaids have left me with GI issues that must be treated with PPI drugs like omeprazole (prilosec), and ranitidine on a daily basis. Furthermore, the omeprazole (prilosec) causes me to have chest pain and tachicardia as another side effect. And my cardiologist recommended this year that I discontinue usage of all PPIs in this class. \n\nThis leaves me with very few viable options to treat my pain.  I can take the narcotics and suffer the slow, \"muddy\" thought processes, addiction, constipation, and difficulty breathing that they bring. Or I can take the nsaids and PPIs and suffer through the chest pain, tachycardia, ulcers, gastric reflux and irritation to my hiatal hernia.\n\nOR, I can take an all natural, and SAFE herbal supplement like Kratom that comes with NONE of these symptoms. I can choose to take low doses of this herbal supplement that has been used to treat pain for thousands of years and that has been proven to be safe and effective by the community of people who have used it as part of their traditional medicine.\n\nI have lived in NC all my working, adult life. And I have worked for the same company here in NC for over thirteen years. I am well respected by my customers, colleagues and my management in this company. And I have been responsibly using Kratom for almost nine of those years now - WITHOUT any of the complications or issues with addiction that have been reported in the news recently. Certainly nothing like the horror stories and narrative currently being pushed on the public by the DEA and FDA.\n\nKratom is a plant that comes from the same family as the coffee plant and is no more addictive than your morning cup of coffee. But the DEA and FDA almost decided, without any community discussion, to arbitrarily schedule this useful herbal supplement as a schedule I drug. Due to public backlash, the scheduling of this herb was delayed to allow for a period of public commentary. But if this ban is ratified on December 1st, kratom will be placed in the same class as HEROIN. At that point, the DEA and law enforcement agencies of the US will view me no differently then a Heroin-using street junky.\n\nI have been legally taking this amazing herbal supplement for almost a decade, and I do not drink alcohol, or smoke, or use illegal drugs. I do not even like to take prescription painkillers. Every morning, I get up, pain or no pain, and I go to work to provide for my three little girls. Because that is what a good Father - NOT a Junky - does for his family. And now the US government is going to classify me in the same category as a Heroin addict? That is ludicrous!\n\nWhat is needed at this time is an EXTENDED period of responsible discussion with the medical community to properly address the debatable claims of negative side effects and rumors of danger to the public. The medical and scientific community need to be given time (and the funding) to properly research this amazing herbal supplement. What we do NOT need is a knee-jerk reaction to ban this herb due to the few unsubstantiated claims of death and addiction that have been associated to it.\n\nIF, it is determined that some form of regulation is required during this period of discussion and research, then let's please work together to find something less draconian then requiring a prescription or outright banning.  For example, we could simply restrict the sale of the herb to minors - much the same as we do for OTC medicines, tobacco and alcohol. \n\nPlease keep the sale of this herbal supplement legal to adults and responsible individuals such as myself who depend on it for their daily activities.\n\nThank you for your time in this matter. It is a topic of great concern to me, and I look forward to hearing back from you!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8772","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Tatman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Maybe making things illegal isn't working...You're trying to make Kratom illegal for health concerns yet tobacco and alcohol are available everywhere.

I'm a financial advisor and in my mid-20's.  I've never used kratom or any illegal substance, nor do I intend to do so.  While I do not feel the need to use something like this, there does appear to be a lot of anecdotal evidence that there are benefits from the use of kratom for certain subsets of our population.  Scheduling a substance like kratom, without doing solid research (peer reviewed, double blind, controlled, etc.) seems to be the equivalent of crying wolf.  It seems irresponsible to schedule a substance that shows promise of being helpful and appears to have few, if any, trade offs ( news.olemiss.edu/new-hope-for-addicts/#.UkSzEeg9-cc ).  If Kratom really is dangerous and worthy of a schedule 1 classification, it would be really helpful if there was a solid, scientifically rigorous analysis that can help clearly identify the dangers and downsides, rather than making a possibly helpful substance illegal out of fear and thereby criminalizing well-intentioned people trying to better themselves.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12245","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Samuel Stufflebam","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I used Kratom to help with chronic pain.

This notice of intent to schedule the \"drug\" (which are actually just chemical constituents of nature's botanical, not some dangerous \"drug\") is entirely immature and unfounded. The fact that this alleged \"ban\" comes along at the same time that Big Pharma is patenting synthetic chemicals that resemble these active constituents, in order to treat pain and anxiety and depression just blatantly shows how the DEA is lobbying for Big Pharma's control over the Kratom industry.\n\nAs I'm sure you know by now, the Botanical Education Alliance and American Kratom Association are pulling for stricter indications and stronger focus on purity/safety. However, while this is nice and reassuring, people who take Kratom know what amount works for them, and the only ER visits have been from polydrug use, not \"Kratom intoxication\" - the latter would make one vomit the Kratom and render it rather useless, floating in the toilet. But it won't land you in the emergency room. There has been a humongous outpouring of caffeine related ER visits compared to anything regarding Kratom; not to mention, Kratom is no more habituating than coffee and shares it's extremely minor day-after tired feeling. This makes sense, and it tells us that, while Kratom is a member of the coffee family (fact check me), Kratom is probably safer than coffee. At least, if you're using substance-related ER visits as your measuring factor of harm.\n\nThe community behind this plant is not seeking recreation; they are trying to live functional lives in the face of pain, fighting through it in a docile manner (especially compared to these ridiculously, incomparably addictive opioids and opiates prescribed by Big Pharma.\n\nOf Kratom is put on schedule I and people lose access to it, you will proceed to see the worst opioid epidemic this country has ever seen. I've already read plenty of stories of people turning back into the zombified versions of theirselves on western medicine pain management therapy, and it has already ruined enough lives to take things this far. Let Kratom be, and trust that the Botanical Education Alliance will protect the Kratom using community from any hazardous sources/vendors of the powdered herb.\n\n\nBy the way, there are bigger flies to kill. Ever heard of fentanyl analogues, or U-47700? They are readily available and pure on black markets. I don't want to see people turning to dangerous opioid drugs or things like \"Lean/Sizzurp\" in place of something that was previously helping facilitate existence, rather than letting it wear away in front of you. We're already in the middle of a heroin epidemic. It will increase so rapidly after the potential scheduling of Kratom that it will be like a zombie apocalypse.\n\nKratom is a WELLNESS SUPPLEMENT that attenuates opioid withdrawal (without carrying the dangerous constipatory or respiratory depression side effects), eases depression for people who have no luck with western medicine, and obliterates unfounded anxiety from anxiety disorders. It is non-addictive (at least not more than coffee; Google \"Kratom and Forbes\" for a well-written subjective account of a writer trying to convey how docile Kratom actually is and respectively how demonized it is by this country and the DEA in particular.\n\nSave Kratom.

This plant is safer than any prescription or OTC medicine and because of Kratom, I am able to go to work each morning in order to provide for my family. \n\nStudies have shown that Kratom has no known narcotic or addictive history and as someone who uses this plant on a regular basis can certainly vouch for its many amazing properties and the lack of any harmful effects.\n\nPlease reconsider your intent to ban this amazing plant so that it can continue to help not only myself but the thousands of other individuals who rely on one of Gods creation to live a productive life without unnecessary pharmaceutical drugs that are far more dangerous and addictive than Kratom.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1887","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tamara Bass","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"- Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\n- Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n- Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n- Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n- Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14336","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Doug Cecere","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.

I was dx with Reflex sympathetic dystrophy in 1984 and was placed on a variety of medications, including up to 8 Vicodin a day. In June of 2000 I was also dx with Fibromyalgia. At that time the doctor's put me on oxycontine (120 Mg's a day) . I have been given fentanyl patches, morphine, methadone and oxycontine over the last 14 yrs and by accident I discovered alternative medicine. While in the hospital for a Fibromyalgia related issue the nurse suggested magnesium and potassium for my restless leg syndrome, it worked! I then started researching other natural vitamins and minerals that could help with my pain.in December of 2013 I began reading about Kratom and after much research began taking Kratom along with the other vitamins, minerals and natural supplements I'd discovered.. My last pain pill was taken on Jan 19th 2014. After 30 years I was totally opiate free! \nDuring the above mentioned time, I had not been able to work except here and there... Would end up having to quit because my employer would get tired of me missing time due to a \"Fibro flare\". I have been working full-time since Jan 2014 & have only missed a few days. Kratom does not completely take care of all my pain and suffering, but along with the other all-natural supplements that I take, I have my life back. I became, at the age of 56, a productive member of society! \nIf Kratom is banned my life will again become a cycle of doctors, pain medications and being unable to work. Instead of living, I will again, just be existing.... Waiting for my time to come to an end on this earth. Dear DEA I am not being melodramatic when I say this, after existing for 30 yrs I now have a good life. Not pain free, on a scale of 1-10, I stay around a 2-4.... Prior to Kratom my pain levels stayed between a 8-15.\nIf you have any family members who live with chronic acute pain please take a good look at them.... Wouldn't you want to find a natural way to help them? There are no cures for my medical issues, just ways to help keep me comfortable... I would rather go with natural supplements and have a life than live on pain meds that are destroying my organs.\nThank you for listening,\nTina Saylor","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5098","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tina Saylor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I recently discovered Kratom and no longer have to take any pain pills.

It also has a relaxing effect which helps manage my anxiety. Kratom is an amazing plant that I wish I had found out about it a long time ago. Since I began using Kratom I have had none of the negative side effects as I had using the pain pills. I'll take it two to three times per day depending on my pain and its effects last 6-8 hrs.

I have multiple painful conditions including pinched spinal cord from C3-C7 which causes headaches, neck and upper back pain, and pain and numbness down both arms, I have Ehlers Danlos syndrome, arthritis, adrenal fatigue, anemia of chronic disease, and autoimmune conditions. \n\nMost people in my condition have to take multiple pharmaceutical medications and narcotic pain relievers which cause additional issues due to side effects, both short and long term. When I took these medications I was largely unable to function. The narcotics made me tired and dizzy, tore up my stomach, caused issues with constipation which aggravated the diverticulosis which then caused bad abdominal pain and nausea and risked causing a diverticular rupture. In 2012 I was hospitalized for 6 weeks with 3 intestinal ruptures and nearly died. That's when I knew that the pharmaceuticals I was being prescribed were actually causing more harm than they were giving relief. \n\nAfter that I was introduced to kratom as a supplement. It's not a drug. It's not dangerous. It's just a supplement that helps me. When I take kratom not only do I not feel the need for narcotics, I actually feel NORMAL. I am not tired or dizzy. Neither do I feel high, or jittery, or incapacitated/altered in any way. Kratom supports normal daily function for me. Taking kratom as a supplement with my other herbs and vitamins gives me hope that I can be productive again, rather than house and bed bound. I feel better and am able to do physical therapy for my neck now because I can actually get out of bed to do it. If kratom is taken away... I fear that my life will again be reduced to pills and side effects and the inability to get out of bed or function semi-normally. If you ban kratom and make it illegal you are taking away my hope of ever getting OFF of disability and becoming a productive member of society.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5319","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kathrynn Donovan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"PLEASE VOTE TO KEEP KTRATOM LEGAL.\n\nI have been in constant, debilitating pain (24/7/365) since 1993 due to several back and neck injuries, including fractured vertebrae.  the pain is severe enough to drastically limit my activities.\n\nDuring that time I have used every method to control the pain to a tolerable level without success.

She also can't do normal things like take us to school, cook, drive or pick up my little brother who always wants to be held by her. Years ago she stopped taking her pain medication because kratom was a more natural alternative to the pills that she was prescribed. She was introduced to it by my grandfather who practices herbal remedies. Since then she's been able to use kratom to help alleviate her pain; along with diet and exercise. It doesn't take the pain away 100% but it helps alleviate it enough so that she can take my sister to Girl Scout events, cook and clean for us and do simple things like grocery shopping or going to the mall to buy me new shoes. Kratom does not get her high. It's far from it actually. She's youthful, happy, alert, physically active and makes me and my friends laugh when we're just hanging out.

You did the right thing by withdrawing that original notice of intent.\n\nPresently, then, the proper course of action involves two steps.  First is for DEA to take no action with regard to scheduling kratom.  Second, your agency should advise FDA that its review of the extant scientific research is no longer directly tied to any pending action by DEA.\n\nBy withdrawing the involvement of your agency in this matter, you will have avoided doing actual harm to both the public and the scientific community.

I am 34 and work as a handyman, mechanic, and farm hand. I oppose the DEA putting kratom on the list of Schedule I controlled substances.  I feel the ban is unwarranted because Schedule I drugs like heroin, and cocaine are narcotics with serious side effects while kratom has a very mild effect and no negative effects that I have found in three years of taking it.\n\nMy experience pre-kratom: \n\nI suffered severe chronic pain due to muscle injuries that wouldn't heal, as well as back and head injuries due to a couple of serious vehicle accidents.  My doctor said I also had advanced arthritis and that my joints looked like those of a 70-year-old man.  I had been dealing with these problems since I was 18.  I went to many doctors and spent tens of thousands of dollars but they could not figure out what was wrong.  I was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's, an autoimmune disorder, as the cause of the healing problems.  But now these problems are so bad they cannot be fixed.\n\nOver this thirteen year period, doctors prescribed these drugs for me:\n\nFor pain: Opiates (Oxycodone, Methadone, Morphine).  These drugs took away my energy and made me sleepy, worthless, and lethargic.  I was too impaired to drive or work. I had to keep increasing the dose to get relief from the pain.  They were extremely addictive.  Detoxing off them was horrible.\n\nFor depression: I tried three or four common anti-depressants.  I felt like I had no emotions.  I was numb, had no energy, and felt dead inside.\n\nFor anxiety: (Diazepam and others).  They worked, but I always had an impaired feeling.  I couldn't function.\n\nFor insomnia: (Trazedone, Seraquil, Ambien). I woke up feeling horrible, angry, tense, worked up.\n\nFor side effects: I took a variety of medications to combat the side effects of the other drugs I was taking.\n\nTransitioning from medications to kratom: \n\nThree years ago I detoxed off oxycodone. It took two weeks of heavy-duty detoxing.  I had to get off all pain meds to decrease my tolerance for opiates so that kratom would work.  Please note that kratom is not an opiate but it affects the same opiod receptors in the brain that they do.  Coffee and chocolate also affect these receptors and obviously are not opiates.\n\nThe kratom I take: \n\nI take straight kratom - the pure, dried, powdered leaf of the kratom tree, not mixed with any other substance, always the same type of leaf and always from a reputable supplier.  I take the minimum I need to based on the amount of pain I have that day. \n\nMy experience with kratom and that of relatives and friends:\n\nI do not experience euphoria or any negative side effects.  Kratom does not take away the pain completely, but enough that I can function.  It also provides relief from anxiety, depression, low energy, and insomnia.  Mentally it changes me back to a pre-illness state.  I no longer need to take any prescription medications.\n\nEach individual may have a different experience - especially depending on what type of leaf they consume.  Some people say it doesn't do anything.\n\nThe following list of kratom's effects is from DEA's \"Drugs of Abuse\" (page 84).\n\nI have not experienced these symptoms:\nItching, constipation, increased urination, anorexia.\n\nI have not experienced these symptoms or heard of anyone else experiencing them:\nPsychotic symptoms, including hallucinations, delusion, and confusion.\n\nI have not experienced these symptoms, but I might if the kratom was too potent or I took too much:\nNausea and sweating.\n\nI have experienced the opposite of these symptoms:\nLoss of appetite.  Weight loss.  Insomnia. \n\nI have experienced these symptoms or a variation of them:\nDry mouth - Yes.\nImproved physical energy - Yes, definitely.\nStimulant effects and increased alertness - Improves my mood rather than being a stimulant.\nIncreased talkativeness - Maybe a little, due to better mood.\nSedative effects - It is calming and reduces anxiety.\nPsychological addiction - No worse than coffee.\n\nIn conclusion, kratom gave me my life back after eight years of taking prescription pain killers.  I had lost everything - my family, my house, and all my possessions.  My cousin suggested getting off prescription medications and trying kratom.  Three years later I am a new father who is able to help support his family.  I am in the process of rebuilding my life.  I do not want to go back to my old life.  That is what will happen if this ban goes into effect.\n\nFor more information please refer to the American Kratom Association website which contains links to the latest scientific studies on kratom - www.AmericanKratom.org/science.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16264","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would only say that as an opiate user, Kratom has been the relief I need to overcome the major cravings of prescription pills.

U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21901","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep Kratom (Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine) safe and legal.

I work in sales and am great at what I do and am very much a family man.\n\n7.5 yrs ago I cleaned up from a devastating oxy contin addiction, I couldn't hold a job nor could I be available or present with my family. I came very close to overdose a few times and hit rock bottom. I entered into my 3rd treatment facility and actually worked a program of recovery that time around which allowed me to achieve true and lasting sobriety. Fast forward 4 years and I was diagnosed with a chronic condition that would've required me to go back to prescription pain killers. I told the doc no way I'm going back, I am terrified of the effect the prescription pain killers would have on my life now. I did a great deal of research and found kratom. I believe Kratom quite literally saved my life because I know going back to the prescription pain pills is a death sentence. I have been taking kratom for 3.5 years and the effects are a mild mood lift a little less than a 5 hour energy and it has some pain killing aspects. Kratom replaced my morning star bucks. I don't believe kratom is even close to schedule 1 worthy because in my experience there have been no side effects and it has helped me not hurt me. Schedule 1 would also stop or make any future research very difficult. I believe it should be regulated like any other herbal supplement or food item (like chamomile, lavender, Kava, green tea ect) to make sure it is not adulterated however in 3 and 1/2 years I've never come across anything but fresh natural crushed leaf kratom from dozens of suppliers, which just goes to show the free market and internet reviews at work. \n\nWhen I was using prescription pain killers I used to fall into a deep sleep everywhere and I was always worried about not waking up. I used to steal and do things I'm ashamed of to get my oxy but I've never even thought about that with kratom nor had any side effects like that from kratom. Kratom is not any more addictive than caffeine in my experience. \n\nTo compare kratom with heroin is like comparing green tea to crack cocaine. I realize for the USA this is a brand new herb and government entities don't know much about it but in other countries in the world they have used kratom for hundreds of years with no serious side effects. That can't be ignored. Please do thorough research. I'm a little concerned the FDA is going to slap research together real quick due to the short time frame they have and it won't be as good as thorough un-biased research.\n\nPlease don't ban kratom, it has given me my life back from a condition that would've ruined my life. I'm able to do things and live my life to it's fullest by being a present dad, go mountain biking, hiking, make a very good living and participate in charity work.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1558","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"See attached file(s)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4350","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 54 year old Female that has been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, bulging disks in my lower back and neck.

We were featured in the LA Times, NPR, and the front cover photo of USA Today and a number of publications after the Denver Environmental Health Division had closed down our shop strictly because of the DEA announcement a week prior that the DEA had announced kratom as an imminent threat to public health with no more information provided.  We were still shut down with no valid explanation given other than that and it was on 9/6 when the original proposed DEA ban was slated for 9/30.  \n\nAfterwards, I received so many heartbreaking e-mails from people whom were suffering immensely as they had been using kratom as a mild coffee like substitute to keep them from doing more harmful drugs such as heroin, oxycontin, xanax, cocaine and alcohol (although we followed all of the the FDA and regulatory guidelines that were required of us and never promoted it for such use).  \n\nThese people had lost the desire to use those other substances until kratom was taken away from them when kratom hasn't been found to have officially caused any severe health crisis that has been specified, has any substantial statistics comparable to the dangers presented by even some of the most benign seeming household foods and products and kratom has been used for thousands of years without a history of health concerns being reported as opposed to the positive information that was volunteered to us despite our FDA required \"Not for Human Consumption\" policy.  \n\nWe even had customers messaging us whom had just discovered kratom after attempting to kick opiate drugs and alleviate withdrawal and had their supply cut off halfway through the withdrawal process.  A couple had messaged us with thoughts of suicide after discovering the relief kratom has been reported to provide as an opioid withdrawal suppressor (once again we never promoted any of this as it had not been FDA approved or evaluated) only to run out and be faced with a week or 2 of hell trying to function in their lives while enduring the living hell that is opiate withdrawal without a buffer to make it tolerable.\n\nWe still avoid making any medical claims as a result of respecting the rules imposed by the FDA, DEA and US customs about making any claims that had not been approved by the FDA but ended up getting the DEH ruling overturned.  I've just seen kratom lead to so many drastic positive changes in others and myself with very little downside that is no worse than coffee which is unregulated.\n\nI personally am in favor of kratom regulation and support a set of standards that kratom vendors (including us should adopt) such as the ones we have already put into place such as using a cGMP rated manufacturing facility with FDA grade storage containers and adopting the lab testing and making the results available public for each batch in our shop and new website to come.  \n\nAs for my own experience, I have given up alcohol almost completely with the occasional beer at dinner maybe once every 3 months if that.  It has properties as a dietary ingredient that could provide relief to so many people whom are suffering horribly or slaves to pharmaceuticals as they reach the point after taking these dangerous legal drugs with way higher reported death totals that aren't even in the ballpark of the legal FDA approved alternatives even with a couple of 0's added in at the end.  Point being, kratom has changed my life, got me clean from all other substances that are considered drugs (including alcohol outside of that rare single drink).  \n\nI just don't understand what imminent danger that kratom poses that would call for an emergency ban and why it has been impossible to get a decent and sensible answer from any government agency as to why kratom is being singled out like this based seemingly on irresponsible reporting from local news agencies whom have referred to kratom as an \"opioid\" and \"designer drug\" when neither description could be further from the truth along with the tone of each of the news agencies (cbs for example) whom have seemingly made up their mind.\n\nI was following the test trials by the Florida Law enforcement division whom were studying kratom earlier this year in order to discover proof that would allow the lawmakers to ban it statewide but the results ended up refuting the very claims that the kratom opposition in Florida had made against the botanical and had hoped to find in these studies only to be humbled by science and quickly have that story kept low key and swept under the rug.  Then as research comes out showing favorable reports that refute the reported dangers behind the botanical it is then a few months later attempted to be made Schedule I along with heroin and therefore halting the ability to do future research on the botanical.  Sounds sketch to me but what do I know after having been unjustifiably judged by the FDA, banks, cc agencies and landlords.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21208","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeremy Haley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not believe Kratom should be a schedule 1.

I first came across Kratom speaking with a friend who suffers from chronic pain and has adverse effects to prescribed medication. Having suffered myself from chronic back problems (spending years getting treatment through a chiropractor), he told me how he took a trip to Indonesia and found Kratom, and how it helped in a way that nothing previously had. Upon my first encounter with this wonderful and safe plant, my life changed dramatically. \n\nI had spent a number of years coping with some person problems--some related to work, some not--by drinking alcohol. I drank regularly, probably 5 or 6 times a week for about 5 straight years, and it was profoundly affecting my daily life at home and at work. I felt my life was spiraling out of control, but didn't know how to quit. I felt trapped, alone, and powerless to stop. That it, until I discovered this leafy plant that had been safely in use for thousands of years. It was a miracle. It does no impare my function and allows me to thrive as a person!\n\nQuite simply: Kratom changed and ultimately, I believe, save my livelihood and possibly my life. It turned things around for me in a way I can't fully express. I don't know what I will do without it. the burden of this precarious situation is already too much to bare.

This plant has helped me in so many levels. I suffer from chronic pain and anxiety and had to take narcotics for years to deal with my ailments. I took these medications for a long period of time and eventually became physically and psychologically dependent on the medications. They made my life a living hell; the medication lost its effectivness and I started taking more than I should to get the relief of pain that I previously experienced. I wanted to stop taking the medications but since I had been taking them for years I was advised by doctors that I would become violently I'll and could even possibly die. This shocked me and at that point I decided I would find a way to get off but I had to find an non narcotic alternative. After searching for two years and trying many different medications and plants I came across kratom. It relieved my pains AND anxiety and I could take it as needed without experiencing the physical and psychological discomforts of opiate or synthetic opiate based medications. I since weaned myself completely off of all narcotic medications and now am at a pain level I am comfortable with and don't have to rely on medications. This plant made my life livable again and hasnt had any adverse health effects on me.

Kratom is a plant!  Just like marijuana, it is something that is naturally grown on our planet and has amazing medical uses.  The fact that these are being made illegal is beyond ludicrous; they are plants!\n\nI was diagnosed with some minor depression and anxiety problems in the past and was prescribed something similar to Zoloft.  Being on Zoloft was absolutely horrible!  It made you feel uneasy and sick.  You could say it almost made you feel \"zombie-like\".  That is when I found out about Kratom from online stories about it and video testimonials.  The community behind it was very descriptive of its effects and dosage.  The common misconception with it too is that it is addictive...that is not the case!  Whoever says this is clearly abusing it and doesn't understand it's usage.  With anything in life, it takes moderation to fully accept something.  When it comes to Kratom, that is no different!  Any of these stories that are being garnished by the media about people overdosing on Kratom getting hurt in some way by Kratom, are honestly being over dramatized! If anything, these people were most likely abusing it or they were on other medication when it occurred.  Not once have I EVER experienced these type of occurrences when taking Kratom!\n\nWith me, Kratom is not a daily activity.  In fact, Kratom can become highly tolerant if taken too often, which I believe is it's only downside, but also it's upside.  I find taking Kratom best when I get any sort of fits of anxiety, especially when it comes to social anxiety of some kind.  A relatively small dose of Kratom can give you that uplifting experience you wouldn't get from other anti-depressants that are cooked up in a lab.  This makes it great to always have on hand, because banning it would only make up for more problems from the public.  In my personal experience, the only problem I've EVER had with Kratom is possibly an upset stomach and this was only because I was a beginner and trying to figure out my proper dosage.

The agency cites 14 deaths reported in the scientific literature, plus 16 others that have been confirmed by autopsy/medical examiner reports, meaning that mitragynine and/or 7-hydroxymitragynine were identified in biological samples. It is not safe to assume, as the DEA does, that every person who ever died after consuming kratom died because he consumed kratom. But even if you overlook that logical fallacy, a grand total of 30 deaths associated with kratom in the whole world over the course of centuries is hardly numerous, and it pales beside the number of deaths associated with myriad legal drugs. Alcohol, for instance, is implicated in about 88,000 deaths a year in the U.S. alone, while 28,000 deaths were attributed to heroin and opioid painkillers in 2014.\n\nMitragynine and its constituent compounds pose no threat in comparison to many over-the-counter medications - let alone warrant a schedule 1 classification. The herb and its compounds have been implicated in stopping withdrawal symptoms in various classes of depressants allowing the user to wean off safely.[1] Kratom is a safe alternative for pain, and even in a recreational setting, given the much lower potential for abuse and devastating addiction.

After reading some journal articles about the supplement and its pharmacologic effects, I believe it would be a mistake to make Kratom a schedule-1 substance for the following reasons.\n\n1. According the article entitled \"Pharmacology of Kratom: An Emerging Botanical Agent With Stimulant, Analgesic and Opioid-Like Effects\", in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, December 2012, Vol. 112, 792-799, Kratom stimulates both mu and delta opioid receptors (a mechanism similar to our narcotic pain medicines like Oxycodone), exhibits an anti-inflammatory effect similar to NSAIDS like Celebrex, and also stimulates alpha-2 receptors (Clonidine and Precedex are medications with this mechanism of action used for pain management). Another, source suggested that it may be an NMDA antagonist as well, which would be useful in pain management, and may explain is stimulant effects.\n\n2. The people I have spoken to that utilize this substance are not people who abuse it for recreational use. These are people who have chronic pain issues, and are taking the substance to improve their quality of life. They lead fully functional daily lives, and to my knowledge, pose no threat to society due to the utilization of this supplement. \n\n3. My area of expertise is anesthesia. Some pharmacological agents have what is called a synergistic effect, meaning that the utilization of drugs that hit different receptors has a higher efficacy than just taking a higher dose of one single substance. NSAIDS (Cox 1&2 inhibitors), alpha-2 agonists, NMDA receptor antagonists, and opioid-receptor agonists are all utilized for pain management. The combination of these effects, and the resultant synergism may explain why people can take just a small dose of this supplement and receive the pain relief that they could not formerly achieve when taking one or two of the medications in these drug classes, while experiencing minimal side effects. Removing the option to take Kratom from these people will unnecessarily impact their quality of life, and possibly their ability to provide for their families. \n\n4. From what I know, this country is currently experiencing an epidemic in opioid addiction due to the over-prescription of Oxycodone and other opiates for pain management, which leads to dependence. I have read many news stories in the past couple years about people overdosing on fentanyl-laced heroin. So many stories in fact, that Narcan pens have recently become more available to the general public and first responders (unlike the Epi pen, which is a travesty in its own right). These heroin addicts are often born from opioid addicts that formerly obtained opiate pain medications for legitimate medical issues from legitimate medical sources. Removing Kratom as a safer, more effective option for pain management could possibly turn some of these functioning, productive members of society back to opioids for their pain control needs, adding to the rampant opioid epidemic that is already plaguing the country. \n\nI contend that removing Kratom without just cause would infringe on the civil liberties of many Americans by severely impacting quality of life, and possibly exacerbate the opioid epidemic. If the DEA has adequate investigative research that proves Kratom is wreaking havoc on our society in a manner that outweighs the benefits, I would be glad to receive that information and take it into consideration. Considering that Kratom is not a widely known substance, public education could go a long way in reducing some of the negative outcomes that occur from abuse of the drug. However, in light of all the aforementioned points, I recommend that the move to designate Kratom as a schedule-1 substance be halted, or at least postponed until adequate data exists, proving that this supplement is a detriment to our society deserving of such a designation.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4625","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Richards","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Back in 2011, I fell off a roof and injured my back while working.

I want to tell you about my experience with this herb.  Kratom has been an invaluable tool on my journey of recovery from opiate addiction.  All of my previous attempts to quit opiates (as well as Suboxone) had failed because I wasn't able to make it through the extreme withdrawal and the anxiety was overbearing.  That's when I found kratom.  When I quit taking the opiates, kratom alleviated many of the withdrawal symptoms, while not altering my state of mind.  This allowed me to set up a plan for my recovery and put that plan into action.  I was able to stop taking the kratom not long after.  Thanks to kratom, a great support system, and becoming involved in recovery programs, I can be a contributing member of society.  Kratom is not a cure-all for addiction, but it allowed me to get my life in order and focus on my recovery.  I don't believe I would have been able to make it to this point without the help of kratom.  I now use kratom occasionally (along with counseling) to combat my anxiety.  I don't want to use benzodiazepines for my anxiety, due to their long list of potential side effects and potential for dependence.\n\nNot only has kratom greatly improved my quality of life, I know many others who have benefited from kratom as well.  I have witnessed firsthand how much it helps those battling depression, addiction, anxiety, chronic pain, and other ailments.  Banning kratom will have a negative impact on our lives.  My heart breaks thinking of the impact this ban would have. \n\nI would also like to add that any deaths where the individual had kratom in their system, the person also had dangerous substances in their system (such as Heroin). There have been no reported deaths that can be directly linked to kratom.  This is huge, when you look at the number of deaths caused from legal substances such as alcohol or cigarettes.  Kratom is natural and originates from the same family of plants as coffee.  \n\nI ask that you please consider the repercussions this ban would have.  I predict that we will see an increase in drug addiction and drug overdoses if kratom is banned.  I know how devastating and hopeless life can seem for those battling depression, addiction, and chronic pain.  Kratom gives these individuals hope. Taking away hope is a very dangerous thing. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read and consider my message.  It is greatly appreciated. \n\nSincerely, \n\nKelsey ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4032","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is a natural product that can help control pain with no damaging side affects.

Why not make maple syrup illegal? The alcoloids in Kratom helps many people. It keeps them from opiate addiction both legal or street opiates, it can help with stress and it is natural. It's not like opiates or Marijuana \"which are both medically legal and fully legal in some states\" which get you \"high\" and affect your motor skills and make you prone to choices that wouldn't be your own. Kratom does not affect fine motor skills nor does it change your perception.

I watched my daughter go through heroin withdrawal cold turkey the first time and give birth to a,10 week premature son. The second time I bought kratom for her. She had much less trouble withdrawing and with the help of kratom she has,stayed clean for almost 2 years. I believe this to be a very useful and therapeutic plant and wish to see studies on it. Please don't ban kratom.\n\n\n\n\nMary Lynne Sprinkle\nThe former didn't permit me to click in the box below.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1065","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lynne Sprinkle","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI am writing this because I believe kratom needs to be researched further to increase the very little knowledge we have.

I had shoulder surgery in Feb. of 2016 and had a few set backs.  The answer from my Dr. was to just keep giving me pain meds.  I have heard horror stories of people becoming addicted to these, and decided to find another way to deal with the pain.  That is when Kratom came into the picture.  Not only did it relieve my pain, but it did not make me feel like a zombie like the vicodin, and percocet did.  I also noticed that it helped with the tremor that I have in my right hand.  It was diagnosed 2 years ago at the age of 31.  They call it an essential tremor and there is nothing really wrong with me.  I was prescribed xanax for it (.25mg 4 times a day).  The xanax worked great, but I do not like having to take something so much, and really for the rest of my life.  With Kratom, I only need to take it in the evening when my tremor really acts up.  Can I live without Kratom?  Of course I can, but it has enhanced my quality of life and I am grateful for that.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12279","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Elizabeth Louis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think kratom should not be regulated by the DEA.

Taking kratom before and after work helps manage pain and soreness for me for most of the duration of a 10 hour work day. I also feel alert and more focused. I originally heard about kratom as a dietary supplement from a friend.  From the first time I tried it I was surprised how much energy  I had as well as the relief from pain of old injuries. I haven't experienced any negative side effects even after a few months of daily use. I have also stopped usage for months at a time without any withdrawal symptoms or craving for it. In conclusion I don't believe that the DEA  should  regulate kratom because it is non-addictive with less negative side effects than over the counter pain remedies such as asprin,  and provides a  more effective energy boost than coffee, tea, and energy drinks.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19792","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thomas Nimick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is the only thing that greatly helps to mitigate the severity of my rhinitis (allergies), and allows me sufficient pain relief from scoliosis to exercise on my erg (rowing machine) for a half hour everyday.

I have maintained good overall health, and have not suffered any ill effects from using it - I have had blood tests to prove this.

I suffer from chronic back pain and have tried numerous methods to manage it.  The medications that have prescribed by my doctor make me feel sick, are addictive and come with side effects.  When I tried Kratom, I could not believe I was just finding out about it.  I quit all of my other medications.  It helps me forget about the pain that I am feeling, without impairing my function or being addictive.  I sleep better, am happier and work more productively. I also like the fact that it is a natural plant.  Often times nature has the best medicine, and I believe this is the case with Kratom.\n\nI am a responsible, full-time working, law-abiding citizen.  Kratom has made me happier and more functional.  The loved ones in my life support my use of it, because they see that it is helpful.  I consume a teaspoon in the morning, without the need to increase my dose.\n\nI compare it to a cup of coffee in the morning (but geared towards someone with pain, not fatigue).

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

This is a dangerous abuse of power--for a multitude of reasons--and should be terminated immediately.\n\nThe assertions that this thousands of years old natural plant remedy is an \"imminent public safety hazard\" that has \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse\" are erroneous on every level. First of all, there is absolutely no scientific evidence to suggest that kratom--which has been used medicinally all over the world for generations-- is dangerous. The DEA has cited reports of 15 total deaths linked to--though not necessarily attributable to--kratom in the last two years (2014-2016)-- and in all of those cases, there were other drugs and/or alcohol involved (all of which routinely cause thousands of deaths annually, and are far more likely to have been the cause of death). Fifteen deaths in two years is an astonishingly small number, considering the number of deaths from opiate drugs was over 47,000 in 2014 alone, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, and has been steadily increasing every single year. Thus, kratom can't reasonably be classified as a public safety hazard. Secondly, the assertion that it has no medical use is just as foolish, given that thousands in the U.S. alone have either ended their addictions to narcotics and alcohol or safely and effectively treated their chronic pain--often when narcotics failed them, caused an adverse reaction, or were not made available. Finally, the assertion that kratom has a high potential for abuse has been proven both scientifically and anecdotally inaccurate, and is far safer than the addictive prescription drugs prescribed to people every day for pain, substance abuse, and the multitude of other conditions that kratom helps to treat (not to mention its safety record when compared to the obvious dangers of the millions of illegal drugs in use for pain or addiction). Please see this research in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (just one example of the multitude of research that proves kratom's safety, efficacy, and lack of addictive potential in the brain's reward centers): pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b00748?source=cen\n\nFor those in chronic pain or battling addiction, kratom provides safe, effective, and affordable relief, and has been used safely around the world for thousands of years. For purposes of clarification and perspective, I'd like to share with you that I am a 35 year old Harvard graduate with a successful career and family life, and no history of substance abuse or criminal activity. However, I nearly lost everything after a devastating illness that left me with chronic, severe pain, and on over ten medications-- all of which came with their own dangers and side effects, and weren't terribly effective to begin with. It wasn't until I discovered kratom (approximately two years ago through friends also suffering from chronic pain) that I was able to start enjoying a reasonably good quality of life again, safely, and without dangerous side effects of medications. As a result of using kratom, I have been able to get off of all but two of my medications naturally, have been able to resume a normal social life, become productive again, and have even become healthy enough to have another child, which was previously considered impossible and dangerous because of my condition (my second son was born safely and perfectly five weeks ago). Kratom quite literally saved me--and as a result, my family-- and the idea that our government would criminalize my right--and our collective right as a free people--to a decent quality of life is unthinkable and unforgivable. If kratom becomes a Schedule I substance, my use of kratom as an herbal supplement will have the same legal and criminal consequences as if I was using heroin or cocaine! By supporting this ban, you condemn the millions who use kratom to safely ease their suffering to, at minimum, a life of unnecessary pain and suffering, and at worst, that painful life spent behind bars. \n\nAt the very least, kratom should be fully and properly researched before ANY decision about its standing is made. Ultimately, if the government wants to regulate it reasonably (for example, limiting its purchase/use to those over 18 years of age, or setting minimum standards of quality and purity), fine; I don't believe any reasonable person would have a problem with that. But please, don't force millions of good, law-abiding citizens back into chronic pain and/or medication and drug dependency under the guise of public service. \n\nThank you for you time and consideration. \n\nWith appreciation for all you do,\nBrianna Ladapo","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10683","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brianna Ladapo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Mark Therkildsen, I'm a 29 year old college graduate from Colorado State University.

I only used de-stemmed leaves as a tea twice a day but I had to give it up because I could not afford it on my monthly disability. This plant is one of the best things I've run into, it helped me not just with depression but also anxiety, as well as my harsh insomnia, which are two of my biggest problems.At this point I can only go to sleep when I want using three different pharmaceuticals. I have no problem with a ban on the extracts as they are often hard to gauge, I've overdosed on extract but all that happened was that I basically sat in a chair, puked a few times, and I didn't want to talk to anyone as though I was in a trance. Nothing at all like the deadly effects of opioids. The natural leaf I would take everyday and probably throw out most of my pharmaceuticals in the process. I stay on pharms because my insurance pays for them, I simply cannot pay $200 a month out of pocket when my disability only gives me $500. You guys need to understand that big pharma is not interested in our best interests, while a plant that helps more is demonized. If I have one dream it's that the DEA or the Gov in general takes no interests in simple plants that can help people in need. All my votes will be for candidates that are not interested in prohibition. The original drug they had me on, Abilify, made me gain 50 pounds in less than 5 months, rendered me totally emotionally numb and unable to be creative. Creativity is the most important thing to me as I went to school just to learn how to write creative fiction better. I do not experience the weight gain and loss of creativity when I use herbal alternatives. I am begging you, stop this nonsensical approach to things. I do think you have a bias, that you are often unscientific or willfully discourage scientific research into naturally occurring compounds that can be of immense benefit without turning the Pharma industry a profit. How long I live most likely depends on your decision to either back away from these natural plants or to arbitrarily consider all of us criminals. I am not afraid to die if I am forced to live in a society that gives no fucks about how natural substances can help me, yet insists on prescribing me artificial chemicals that are guaranteed to shorten my lifespan and make what life I have completely unproductive. I hope someone who actually cares reads this. There must be a shift in policy, for I am hardly the only one who feels this way about the situation. Thank you for reading and for your time, may I and others like me have our voices be heard. End the nonsense. You will have far more respect from society at large if you just back off, as telling a sick person that something that makes them better also makes them a criminal. This is psychopathy. These herbs are not for everyone, nor should you assume that they are, but for some they are not just life-saving but quality-of-life saving. Do I want to live as an angry depressed lunatic, or do I want to live as someone who can actually function at least to a limited degree. Lives are at stake. Please take my statement seriously.

Like so many others in recent years I started out being prescribed opioid pain medication for severe back pain from an injury sustained in a car accident many years ago. At the time doctors were being incentivized to prescribe these drugs by the drug companies which as you know had led to a dangerous epidemic in this country that is destroying countless lives. When I complained about getting sick of the negative effects I was told that my dosage needed to be raised due to my tolerance becoming higher. I had tried to stop on a few occasions but noticed that when I did I would feel so horrible I couldn't function. When I finally told my doctor this I was told that he could no longer prescribe me the medication leaving me scarred an in complete shambles and thus leading me down a path of self destruction ( I say self destruction but I really believe that greedy drug companies and doctors are the ones to blame) I started buying drugs on the street and slowly graduated to stronger more addicting and dangerous forms of opiates until I decided to seek out help which was a local methadone clinic and was 10X more addicting and tougher to get off then the original drugs I was prescribed and then while doing research about 5 or 6 years ago I found out about Kratom and decided to give it a try. After a month or so of reading every scientific research paper and hundreds of user experiences I ordered some from a vendor that had excellent reviews and was also very knowledgeable. The first thing I noticed was that within 30-40 min. of taking it 80% of my withdrawal symptoms were gone yet I did not feel like I was high on opiates the way methadone or suboxone make you feel and I also didn't have a methadone clinic constantly raising my dosage or have to worry about overdose or the staggeringly high half life of these incredibly potent drugs used to combat addiction. Within 2 weeks of starting the kratom (not the extracts just the plain ground leaf) I decided to start tapering my dosage, within 2 weeks I was completely off of the kratom with no side effects and one of the best things about this plant (Not synthesized drug) is that it's 100% natural. I have since recommended this to several friends who were also suffering from the disease of opiate addiction and am happy to say that of the 5 people I told about Kratom 4 of them had the same success as I did, I also recommended to a couple of friends who suffered from other medical issues that caused severe pain but were sick of taking opioid medication and they both had great success and told me how much their lives had improved. The people who are stirring up the pot about this wonderful natural remedy are most likely affiliated with big pharma and are worried that they will lose billions of dollars if people start using this safer all natural plant in place of these potent synthetic, over prescribed drugs to combat everything from pain to addiction to anxiety and a whole list of other ailments that kratom can help combat. Let us remember that this plant is not an opiate it is in the same family / species as the coffee plant and other drugs like pain killers, alcohol & tobacco kill hundreds of thousands of people a year. I feel our great nation is becoming more and more over regulated and our personal freedoms are shrinking more and more.

She uses a powder that she mixes into a yogurt smoothie. Admittedly, I have no personal experience with the plant, but, at her urging, I have read a wide source of documents and articles to educate myself. I am aware of the benefits of Kratom for persons who suffer from PTSD, including scores of veterans, and its potential for helping opioid addicts, avoid the deadly consequences of their addictions and recover. If the DEA proceeds with putting Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances, without allowing for much-needed research into its benefits (and risks), it may have tragic consequences for people, such as my daughter-in-law, whose quality of life I have watched dramatically improve since she began using the supplement. I would like to add my voice to the many who wish to see much more consideration of the potential healing properties of this natural plant that has been in use throughout the world for thousands of years, before summarily making it illegal without allowing for much-needed research and investigation.

I like a lot of desperate Americans moved from prescription pain killers to Heroin due to the price and potency difference. I felt like I always needed MORE. My tolerance got crazy. Finally, after pretty much losing everything of value through pawning or selling or trading it away and being in the most hopeless state you could ever imagine I decided I was DONE. I have been to rehab 2 times before this but succumbed to the craving of the Opiates. This time I have NO craving and I'm not bound to Kratom like I was with pills and heroin.

We also reported on the pharmacologically active constituents of kratom, most notably mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, paynantheine, and speciogynine, along with more than 20 other substances.1,3 These compounds have complex and potentially useful pharmacologic activities. In addition, we found many anecdotal reports and testimonials posted online suggesting that kratom may have beneficial effects, particularly in the management of both opioid withdrawal and pain.1 \nAt the time our review was published, kratom was not banned by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), although it was on their Drugs and Chemicals of Concern watch list.1,7 We summarized the potential therapeutic benefits of kratom, but we also emphasized that no well-controlled scientific studies on the safety and efficacy of kratom had been published.1 We noted an increase in the number of reported adverse effects attributed to kratom and highlighted the lack of regulation and quality-control measures in the production and sale of kratom products. Our conclusions from these analyses were that even though kratom or its active constituents could have potential for development as therapeutic agents, it would not be appropriate for physicians to recommend kratom for their patients. \nIn the 4 years since the review1 was published, several major developments have been made regarding the pharmacology and legal status of kratom.8 Given the widespread use of kratom and the extensive media attention it is receiving,8-11 it is important for physicians and other health care professionals to be knowledgeable about the subject. The purpose of this review is to update readers about key developments in this rapidly evolving area.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17753","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Margie baas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Addiction. It's a word that has been affecting America for quite some time but in the last decade it has become one of the leading causes of death other than cancer. Cancer and addiction however do have their similarities. Both addiction and cancer are diseases and someone who suffers from either one of these killer's have to fight for their life every single day. I myself suffer from addiction. My great grandfather died of alcoholism along with my grandfather as well. This gene was passed to my father which in turn was unfortunately passed down to me as well. Though I don't drink alcohol, over time I have come to the realization that my addiction to pain medicine will forever be a constant struggle in my everyday life. My addiction all started when I broke my hand in a high school soccer game. I was prescribed Vicodin for the pain following the surgery to repair the broken bones in my hand. I was immediately hooked. I didn't stand a chance. I was 17 years old. When I had surpassed my number of refills to my prescription I couldn't figure out why I was so sick for a few consecutive days. Now I know they were something called withdrawals. As I continued to grow through my younger years I was living my life with a masked addiction that I had no idea about. Everything was fine until one day... I was at a high school party drinking alcohol to fit in like everyone else at the party when an accident occurred. I fell off of a balcony 3 floors high and landed on my back. I landed on the windshield of a car and broke my back. It required surgery and metal bars in my back to replace half of my spine. I was prescribed high levels of Vicodin for the pain. I was on this prescription for 3 whole years. When I decided to quit the Vicodin it was because I became depressed. I was able to make it through the miserable withdrawal symptoms but as I lived without my pain medicine I was in so much pain that I couldn't do simple tasks like stand stationary for more than an hour without my back throbbing in pain. I got back on the pain medicine prescription. Another year went by when I knew I just wasn't myself anymore. I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to be on Vicodin because I just became depressed but I didn't want to be off of it because I couldn't handle the pain. Finally I decided to do some research and I found out about KRATOM. I ordered some. Thank God for Kratom because I can take it everyday without being in pain but more importantly because I can be myself on it without slipping into depression. It also masked the withdrawals of the Vicodin when I decided to quit it and switch to Kratom. Kratom has saved my life. This is the only thing on the market that works to get rid of my pain without going through the constant prescription refills I was with Vicodin. I know I am not alone. Please. Don't take away Kratom. It should not be banned it should be the new alternative to prescription medicine. I tell people about Kratom all the time. I have a friend that I recommended to try Kratom for his Heroin addiction. He took it for the Withdrawals and he told me it literally saved his life to help him get through the painstaking and miserable withdrawals of heroin. Please. I am begging you to really listen and let everyone's testimonials about how Kratom has helped them and let it resonate with you. I know this is new but we as a country need new. It's how we evolve as a species. Thank you for listening. I trust you will make the right call.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10654","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"N/A","postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Colvin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I plead with you not to issue a ban on Kratom. I am a 30 year old full time social worker and mother of two. I have migraines, fibromyalgia, endometriosis, hypothyroidism, & generalized anxiety disorder. I began using narcotic pain pills daily for pain relief about 6 years ago. I became addicted to them. Not in a strung out junkie way with their life falling apart, but where I took 20-30 mg of hydrocodone per day just to function normally. When I lost my health insurance after being fired from my job, I went into withdrawals and the pain became excruciating. A friend of mine had just heard about Kratom from a relative and gave me some to try. I was pretty skeptical about it doing anything to help. However, I quickly realized it was better than the narcotics I had become hooked on. It helped ease my withdrawals from the oliates, provided a decent amount of pain relief, and had an extremely calming effect on my anxiety. 5 months later and I still take it in capsule form every day. I have not felt the need to return to opiate use, which seems like a miracle to me. I do not feel spaced out like I sometimes would from the opiates and I do not struggle with the constipation and irritably the opiates caused either. This has given me my life back. I am too young to be in so much pain. Please do not ban this herbal remedy. I fear I would return to opiates if you do.

My brother used to be a hardcore addict but started taking kratom as maintenance and was able to pull his life together when nothing else worked (rehab, suboxone, methadone). He is now off kratom and said there was very little withdrawal. He also said that kratom didn't give him the extreme cravings that he would get from opiates. Kratom isn't an opiate, I don't know what it is besides a miracle. He was never able to handle opiate and would always go overboard on them but on kratom he was a functioning member of society. I fear if (God forbid) he relapses on opiates there will be no way out for him if kratom is illegal. \nThe other family member has a chronic pain disorder called RSD. she is always in pain and her quality of life is horrible. She takes traditional opiates but was able to cut back and not use as much once she started kratom. Kratom also helped her with the depression that comes with debilitating pain. She is no longer suicidal. Banning kratom will kill her. She had tried multiple times before we found kratom. I am begging you for my family's sake to not make it illegal. Please have a heart and let us keep this relatively benign plant. If you must ban something ban the extracts. From my understanding the extracts are unreliable and are sometimes cut with other things.  The very few kratom deaths were attributedoing to the extracts and not the plain leaf.

I hate pain pills or anything that makes me not function 100%.  Kratom is like something just flipped a light switch in my brain and the pain is gone!  I cried the first time I tried it because I couldn't believe that I could live a life without chronic pain.  Now because of Big PHARMA, you are going to take away the only thing that works for me and 1000s of others? God put Kratom on this earth for a reason!  \"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.\" Genesis 1:29.  Stop interfering with God's intended use of his plants! \n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21347","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a successful attorney and devout Christian in my 30's. I've been using kratom off and on for the last five years. I started using it as a relaxation aid, but found that it also helped me to quit drinking and reduce my ADHD medication use. I usually use a teaspoon (about 2.5-3 grams) of crushed powder, which hasn't changed in the time I've been using it. I might use it a couple times a week, at most. Depending on the strain, it either gives me mild pain relieving (Bali) or mild stimulant (Thai) effects. It is far, far safer than alcohol or methylphenidate, both of which I used legally. The most negative effect I've had is dry mouth and slight nausea, and that was with a significantly higher dose than I usually use. It's simply a mild herb that excels at easing cravings, rather than giving you a high (I've never felt anything resembling a \"high\" feeling). While my life will move on without issue if it's banned, I fear for the people who use it to ween themselves off opiates.

Myself and numerous acquaintences have used this wonderful plant to alleviate the withdrawal symptoms of prescription opoids. It allowed me to continue to work and be fully functional rather than lying in bed sick unable to lead a normal life. It not only allowed me to break free of the addiction, but it also lacked the highly addictive qualities of drugs like methadone and suboxone which are used for similar purposes. I was able to discontinue the use of kratom with little to no withdrawal symptoms. I continue to use kratom occasionaly for reasons other than treating withdrawals. It is very effective at alleviating the chronic aches and pains I have from various injuries and I dont have to worry about becoming a slave to the plant as I have to opiod pain medications in the past.\n      Kratom also provides a pleasant mood lift that makes it an effective natural treatment for anxiety and depression. It is a very subtle mood lift and by no means would I consider it a \"high.\" It provides a natural alternative to pharmaceuticals typically used to treat these issues without the long list of side effects.\n      I have been using kratom occasionally for several years now and have noticed no negative health consequences. It has been remarkably beneficial to me and others and it would be sad to see it taken away because some people falsely believe it to be dangerous or that it is a way to get intoxicated. My experience with kratom has been nothing but positive and I see no reason for it to be banned.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3652","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kelsey Rowland","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is such an amazing plant.

I have also been diagnosed with ADHD, chronic fatigue, chronic pain, on and off depression, anxiety, and finally with fibromyalgia (leading me to believe that all of my conditions may be symptoms of fibromyalgia). My doctors' solution (in addition to recommending a healthy lifestyle, which I try to do) has always been to prescribe medication.  \n\nI've tried several prescription anti-depressants, which made me feel like a zombie or as if I was watching someone else live my life.  I've been prescribed fast-acting anxiety medication, which weren't very helpful as I couldn't be proactive in avoiding panic attacks, but could only be reactive once I felt one coming on.  I've been prescribed daily ADHD medication, which heightened my anxiety, caused me to lose my appetite and my ability to get a good night's sleep, and elevated my heart rate (which scared me, as they can cause potentially life-threatening cardiac issues).  \n\nMy doctors have tried to prescribe me strong, opioid pain medications, but I did not want to take them as I know that I need a fully-functioning and fast-acting brain to perform well in my career.  I found it interesting that because I was not seeking these types of medications, and in fact, I was refusing to take them, my doctors pushed them even harder.  It's as if they were pushing these narcotic pain medications on me BECAUSE I did not want to take them, but I have heard from others that simply asking for stronger pain medication has caused their doctors to believe that they are 'drug seekers' and thus should not have any medication prescribed at all (seems a little backwards to me, but that's a different story). \n\nAnyway, I first heard about kratom a few months ago due to the media coverage over the potential ban. At first, I assumed (from the misleading articles and propaganda) that this was just another dangerous drug that 'druggies' seek to get high.  I decided to dig a little deeper (and boy am I glad I did!).  I read through numerous websites that explained the potential benefits of kratom, including many forums and blog posts.  I realized that there are a LOT of people who truly believe that kratom has enhanced, or even \"saved\" their lives, in many different ways.  I quickly also realized that many of the people who swear by kratom have symptoms or problems that are almost identical to the ones that I was struggling with.\n\nAlthough the promises of this miracle leaf seemed too good to be true, I decided to try some for myself.  At this point, I was sick and tired of feeling like I'm spending my life fighting one symptom after the other on a daily basis.  I had forgotten what it felt like to be \"normal\".  This is something that many people who live without chronic pain (and other chronic conditions) take for granted.  I know that before all of my issues started (in my early 20s), I definitely took my pain-free and worry-free life for granted.  \n\nFast forward to today (only about 2.5 months later) and I can honestly tell you that kratom truly has changed my life (already!).   I still vividly remember the feeling I had the first time I took kratom -  I was fully mentally aware, but I was calm, pain-free, and most importantly of all, \"normal\"!  With some guidance from people online who have been using kratom for many years, I have found a type and dosage that worked for me (and has continued to work since).  As a bonus side effect, I have completely lost my desire to have any alcohol.  I used to sometimes have two or three glasses of wine with dinner, or would feel the need to have a few drinks when out with friends (sometimes, overdoing it). Somehow, no one thought this was odd - it seems very common (and socially acceptable) that people use alcohol this way, yet it is passed off as normal behavior.  I have not touched a drink in 2.5 months!\n\nI cannot believe that something that can help people in so many ways (and so quickly!) is being mislabeled as dangerous and essentially useless by some in the media (and of course, by regulators). It is important to remember that pain-sufferers, who would otherwise be hooked on dangerous and addictive opioids (with numerous side-effects), would be left in the dark if this ban went through, and would likely be forced to use the same medication they were happy to be rid of when they started taking kratom. \n\nI hope that after reading all of these comments from people who have had their lives changed for the better, the conclusion reached will not be a short-sighted one that seeks to ban this amazing, natural medicine. More research is definitely required in order to truly understand just how helpful kratom can be! Thank you for reading my comment.

My husband and I have personally used the herb Kratom for less then one year. He is was a contractor over seas for five years and returned home in 2015. Like many others returning and reintegrating into day to day life was hard. We are not substance abusers or drink alcohol. But my husband was prescribed Xanax. After a year of taking this, it only made it worse. Until we came across Kratom. A herb that was made into a tea he drinks every morning was such a help in tampering off the Xanax which could have been a nightmare. I am young but was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, taking a cup of Kratom tea everyday is a needed relief. Please take into consideration that this plant has healed many people like my husband. It is frustrating when prescriptions and alcohol are being abused by so many, but is not regulated enough.

I have worked in the service industry for over 25 years. I am required to work and stand on my feet for long hours at a time even up to 16 hours in one day. I routinely work 55-65 hours a week. I have had three hernia operations including a double hernia when I was eight years old. Needless to say I have a great deal of muscular pain. The doctors that I have seen have offered physical therapy (stretching exercises) which do help but are difficult to do at work and only for a short amount of time. A few minutes at most. They will prescribe me muscle relaxers which also helps a little bit but makes me extremely groggy when I am at work. I heard about Kratom and tried it. I was very surprised at how it eased the pain and help elevate my mood and energy level. Kratom has allowed me to remain productive at my job. If Kratom were to become unavailable it would have a serious degrading impact on my quality of life and health and also on my ability to provide a sufficient income for my household.

Reg. 59929 (Aug. 31, 2016)\n\nDear Acting Administrator Rosenberg, \n\nThe action declared in DEAs August 31, 2016 Notice of Intent with regard to constituents in kratom leaf is an unprecedented use of the emergency scheduling authority to temporarily place an herb into schedule I of the CSA.  I support DEAs appropriate application of this emergency authority, which is regularly exercised by the agency, such that there are currently 20 substances listed in schedule I subject to temporary emergency scheduling (21 CFR 1308(h)). But these currently listed substances tend to be synthetic compounds, many of which are commonly known as designer drugs and are produced and marketed with no other purpose than as hallucinogens, illegal stimulants, and similar unlawful uses. However none of the substances currently listed (or to the best of my knowledge, ever listed) in schedule I through the temporary listing mechanism is a simple herb, and DEAs temporary placement of mitragynine and 7- hydroxymitragynine in schedule I will have the effect of placing kratom leaf itself on schedule I. This unprecedented application of the emergency authority for temporary placement of a substance on schedule I to an herbal ingredient with broad use is unacceptable. My view is that in situations involving an herb or other natural product DEA should reach out to herbal trade and professional associations prior to taking unilateral action that temporarily makes that herb unlawful. Indeed, in the present case there is an American Kratom Association that might have provided useful input to DEAs decision making process, as well as many learned and responsible individuals in the herbal field. Meeting or conferring with associations and groups is useful, appropriate and justified where such groups and associations are known to exist. \n\nOn this basis, I respectfully requests DEA not to promulgate a final order temporarily scheduling mitragynine and 7- hydroxymitragynine into schedule I and to withdraw its August 31, 2016 Notice of Intent. Instead, I ask that DEA:\n\n1)Consider the many comments that are being filed to this Docket by various organizations and individuals. \n\n2)Initiate the regular Docket No. DEA-442 September 30, 2016 - 5 - scheduling process for these substances, if, in fact, warranted by scientific and medical evaluation of all of the factors that are required under the CSA to be considered in the regular scheduling process.\n\n\nSincerely,\nYasoda Mensah, M.S.\nDirector, Three Leaf Farmden and\nTrifolia Natural Products and Botanicals\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9786","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Trifolia Natural Products and Botanicals","postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Yasoda Mensah","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello DEA,\n\nI heard about this dietary supplement through the JRE Podcast Episode with Chris Bell.  Mr. Bell talks extensively on his personal experiences with Kratom, reasons for use, benefits gained, and more importantly the freedom it has awarded him from opiate addiction.  I listened to this podcast while on my drive to work, and once I heard that it was available in my state (FL) I made plans to purchase some while on break to try it out.  I, an office manager, and a friend of mine, a licensed health care provider, took about 7-8 grams of Kratom each.  Now, before I even listened to this podcast, I went biking the weekend before and strained a muscle in my back.  I noticed about 20 minutes after consumption, some of the noticeable affects.  My mood was elevated, I was being more talkative (I'm an introvert) than normal, and also a measurable decrease in the pain that was coming from my strained back muscle.  I was concerned with the possibility of it impairing my ability to competently do my job, which I can honestly say my work efficiency was constant and unchanged even after affects were apparent.  My friend as well, had a very positive experience, and work production was unaffected.  This being my first time use of Kratom, I was very pleased with the experience and believe that this is a powerfully important substance, and if placed in Schedule 1, would be a total injustice to science of alternative medicine, as well as a slap-in-the-face to all the people who are currently benefitting from this substance in lieu of using either opiates/narcotics.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12786","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Burgess","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a disabled veteran after 30 years of pain pill use through the VA I was able to take myself off of them and I only use kratom kratom has allowed me to live free of the VA dependency I considered safe alternative to dangerous narcotic please don't ban kratom Olivier no longer help them with their pain the ban is unnecessary and wrong I can think of no logical reason to want to ban and as a schedule 1 drug and less it's just to keep the Jail's full please leave Kratom alone","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21114","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tim Conley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a law abiding citizen of the United States, I urge the DEA to leave Kratom alone.

I was prescribed oxycodone which relieved my pain but I was unable to function. I couldn't work because I'd fall asleep or \"nod off\" on the job. I finally discovered kratom at 20 years old.

Kratom allows me to have total pain relief and still live a normal life. Taking away kratom will destroy me. I don't get \"high\" from it and it just makes my pain go away. The only deaths from kratom have been from adulterated kratom. I would recomend the dea to require kratom vendors to get every batch tested by a 3rd party lab before selling. However my biggest fear is all the overdoses, deaths and relapses that will skyrocket from a ban. The dea will kill more people in the first month of prohibition than kratom ever has (you can't die from a kratom overdose). However I do support a ban on the pure active synthetic chemical.

I am writing today to express my opinions, in regards to Kratom, and its potential scheduling in the United States by the DEA. I first started utilizing Kratom 3 years ago to help manage anxiety issues I have been plagued with since the time I was a teen. I was prescribed medication by my primary care physician, I did my research, and the possible side effects of an SSRI quickly led me to seek an alternative route.\n\nIt took some time, but I was ultimately able to find a supplement regimen which worked to curb my anxiety throughout the day. Unfortunately, I was still plagued by the inability to sleep at night due to racing thoughts and was unable calm down when it was time to get some rest. I had found out about Kratom online and decided to give it a try in the evenings to help me calm down. It took a few days experimenting with different dosages, but I was finally able to find a nightly regimine which worked wonders for me. For the past 3 years I have taken a small dose of Kratom a few hours before bed each night. I do not get \"high\" and it does not have any negative affects, mentally or physiologically, on me personally. It simply helps to calm my body and mind at the end of the day, allowing me to get a good nights rest instead of tossing and turning for hours on end after crawling into bed. It has truly worked wonders for me in this regard and I do not believe it should be scheduled in the United States. I know it has helped myself and others tremendously who suffer from anxiety issues.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18183","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There is no reason to schedule kratom as a schedule 1 drug.

It is not providing any justification for its actions in this case nor is it providing any evidence that Kratom is dangerous or has harmed anyone. 55000 people died from viox before it was pulled from the market. No one has died from Kratom. No one has been shown to be addicted to Kratom. People do try to capitalize on Kratom use rehab ( narcanon owned ran by scientoligists). People are Being taken advantage of while profiteers promote lies surrounding Kratom. It certainly appears that there are people on the take. The deaths ascribed to Kratom are people who were using multiple pharmaceutical drugs. Kratom is typically used to help get off and deal with affects of pain killer addiction. The reported negative side affects are not founded, or supported in any scientific way.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11558","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Oestmann","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It may Concern,\n\n     In regards to the natural herb, known as Kratom, it is my humble opinion that this should not be considered as an illegal substance, much less a Schedule 1. I could state that it is no one's business what we so choose to put into their bodies, as we are all capable of doing research and making knowledgeable choices, but this is not even the most important aspect. Currently, prescriptions such as Hydrocodone and the like, are being given to people of all ages to combat pain which has a harsh effect on a person's liver (among other things). That is not even including the addiction potential of such opiates that tend to have a propensity to cause overdoses. I myself had a friend pass away in their sleep due to Hydrocodone. There are worse prescriptions. Oxycontin are given to children. Might as well tie their arm and shoot Heroin into them. Kratom is different in the way that when I observe people consuming this plant, it tends to make an improvement in their life. They might drink less alcohol, which is an observation I made. They might be more physically active, or complain less about doing physical things that would normally cause them pain or discomfort. It can change people's lives. I do not chronically consume this herb myself which in of itself indicates how it can be less addictive. Even fast food, sugar, TV, and the like have far more addictive potential than some plant that helps with pain and motivates one to be productive. Serious. To whomever reads this, who are you to tell me what I can and cannot consume? I have the right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness, which includes what I, or anyone else, should chooses to consume. I would hate to be the person to tell you to not eat McDonald's. Do I have a right to do that? Or do you prefer options, as most people do?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4713","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon Truster","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have taken kratom and have had nothing but a positive experience from it.

I don't like using drugs as they have side affects lsuch as: dizziness, loss of memory, and fatigue.  I know several people who also use kratom that have never had anything but positive results.

Surely you recongnize the 660 kratom emergency room calls in 2 years in comparison to 30 thousand deaths from overdosing on heroine and opiates does not come close to the same public health risk. The kratom was always used with some other drug in those cases and it is virtually impossible to overdose on Kratom as the only side affect is nausea which is a good thing!  This way people have no interest in overdosing.  If  all things that people abused were banned, we would have no over the counter drugs as caugh syrup is one of the most commonly abused.  If the issue is about control and profit, please consider making this a prescribable supplement, it might just help those who are licenced to sell as well as those who would like to purchase it.

I'm 28 years old and I'm a stay at home mother. I have 8 year old twins and an 11 month old who i care for everyday on my own. a little over 9 months ago i started taking Kratom on and off as a herbal supplement in a tea form to help with my chronic pain, chronic fatigue and depression. I was also battling severe opiate addiction and with the help of Kratom and the support of the people of the kratom community plus my doctors help, i was able to get off the pain killers i was abusing that made my whole life out of control. Before finding Kratom, i was not only addicted to pain killers, but i was always depressed, low self esteem, isolated to my bedroom which made me unable to care for my kids and led to a divorce with my ex husband. I wasn't able to enjoy life itself and i wanted to die. Now i'm in such a better place in life since taking kratom as an herbal tea. My children got their mother back, i got my life back, my 11  month old never has to witness her mother the old way i was, and that's due to the help of this leaf. Please don't ban such an amazing herb, I've witnessed not only myself but a few of my own friends and family get back their quality of life due to taking kratom as a herbal supplement. As for side affects and danger? I've never had any withdrawal symptoms when i haven't had the kratom even after a few days or weeks i was fine only had a small headache like when i stop drinking coffee. I do not believe kratom is a threat to society or a danger. I believe kratom could be a great supplement for those who deal with chronic pain who want a natural way to maintain pain fatigue ect. I ask that you listen to our voices, i fear for too many people if this plant gets banned. I hope and pray that we can continue to take kratom as a supplement.

Please consider the medicinal use of this supplement, while I think it would be naive of me to say we could 100% end opiate addictions, I absolutely think we could make HUGE impact by treating the root physical pain with this non-opiate, and it would make treating the mental part of the addiction exponentially easier.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6651","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Working middle class family.

I have had chronic pain in my leg for 25+ years. I have done everything the medical professionals has prescribed along with what was considered alternative medicine -  analgesics, pain medications, muscle relaxers, cupping, electro therapy, physical therapy, chiropractic, acupuncture & massage. The doctors had me on Desparmine (anti depressant), Flexril, Soma, and Motrin along with Hydrocodone.  The only drug that really seemed to help was hydrocodone. I only take it when I am in extreme pain - driving long distances, standing or walking more than a couple hours at a time. However, I do not take it until I am in a high level of pain because of the addiction problems related to hydrocodone. Because of this, I am in moderate pain a great deal of the time. My son told me about Kratom, after hearing about it on a podcast, and it has been a godsend. I am able to take it on a regular basis so I am not in constant pain. It has definitely improved my quality of life without any side effects that I can discern.   \n\nI recently drove to Palo Alto from San Diego to visit family.  On a trip of that distance I would normally take 3 hydrocodone due to the pain in my leg.  I took one dose of Kratom (5 capsules) and was able to reduce my intake of hydrocodone to 1.5 tablets.  A 50% decrease in the hydrocodone I normally take. In the future, I will take more Kratom and see if I am able to drive that distance without any hydrocodone at all. I am not comfortable driving while on hydrocodone but in the past that was the only way I would be able to make the trip. I feel that I now have a safe alternative that has been used for thousands of years. While taking Kratom I do not have the side effects I get while taking hydrocodone, like jitters or nausea, and I have to worry about addiction. Kratom has proven to be a safe alternative in my life.  I truly appreciate my quality of life due to Kratom. I am able to hike, sit in theaters, drive long distances, stand in line at festivals, farmers markets - things people take for granted.  \n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.\n\nSincerely, \n\nMichelle West","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22484","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michelle West","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This what has been stated...\n\nOn August 31, 2016, the DEA published in the Federal Register a notice of intent to temporarily place mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which are the main psychoactive constituents of the plant Mitragyna speciosa, also referred to as kratom, into schedule I pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of the Controlled Substances Act.

I  see the effects of the opioid epidemic every day that I practice. Let me tell you something you already know. There is a major prescription drug problem in this country. This problem is largely a product of prescribers overprescribing dangerous medications in large doses month after month. A community practice recently started drug testing their patients for whom they prescribed 100s of tablet a month. These patients refilled their prescriptions every month without fail. This practice ended up discharging over 100 patients from their practice because their test came up negative for the drugs they were prescribed. This means that one small practice can produce over ten thousand tablets a month. Most of these are being redirected to the black market no doubt. I can tell you that many people in the grips of drug addiction do not want to be a slave to their addiction. To think that you are going to ban a substance that could have a chance of curbing and controlling someone's addiction without any research to its benifishial effects is very concerning. If you are still in the business of looking out for the American public do not ban kratom. This plant could be helpful to thousands of Americans who are being victimized and controlled by the entities who profit from such addiction.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11273","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Franklin Brown","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, \nMy experience with Kratom was very benign.

I began using Kratom about 6 years ago. Over the years it has been an invaluable resource. My first experience came when I was quite depressed. I had no health insurance, was afraid to talk about my problems, and felt like I had no where to go for help. Kratom helped pull me out of a deep pit and was incredibly helpful in getting me back to being a productive member of society. \n\nKratom is not a drug, it is not an opioid, and it is not synthetic. It is a naturally occurring plant in the same family as coffee that is much more similar to coffee or tea than to other drugs or opioids. Like chocolate, exercise, and a number of other common substances, Kratom acts on the opioid receptors. Because of this, it has been largely misunderstood to be an opiate with addictive properties and the potential for overdose and abuse. It unfortunately has also been sold in some head shops alongside synthetic marijuana and bath salts, which has lead some to believe that it is somehow related to these substances and will have effects that are very different than what it actually does. To me and the thousands of other people who use Kratom or have used it in the past, hearing about the intent to schedule Kratom was like hearing that coffee would be banned. I am incredibly thankful that the large number of people who safely benefit from Kratom use, as well as a number of journalists, public figures, 51 Congressman, and 9 Senators (crossing party lines) were able to express their shock over the ban and delay the emergency scheduling. \n\nKratom is a plant that has a long history of safe use in the United States. Thousands of people across the country have used it daily to manage pain, help with anxiety and depression, and to put an end to addictions to heroin and pharmaceutical opioids. If Kratom is banned, many of these people will be unable to afford an alternative substance to effectively manage their pain or will be forced to turn to highly addictive opioids. The United States is unfortunately facing an opioid and heroin epidemic, and for many people, including a close friend and several others in my hometown, Kratom saved them when they had nothing else.\n\nI completely understand the concern of the DEA when a new substance seemingly appears out of nowhere, but the concern over the safety of the public in the case of Kratom is completely unwarranted. In my experience and those of the other Kratom users that I know and have heard from, Kratom is no more addictive than coffee and has little potential for serious abuse. People routinely get headaches and irritability from caffeine withdrawal and there will always be cases of students overdosing on caffeine pills, but we understand that overuse by some individuals is not a good reason to make it illegal for responsible adults to consume caffeine. The case is the same for a huge number of substances that we accept: Tobacco kills 500,000 annually, and alcohol contributes to thousands of drunk driving deaths, overdoses, causes birth defects, and is a factor in rape, domestic violence, and assault every day. Our nation banned alcohol due to it's adverse effects, but soon found that the prohibition created it's own string of serious problems, was largely ineffective, and curtailed the rights of responsible adults. Like anything, it is possible for Kratom to be misused, but the risks are nowhere near as severe as those involved in the use of completely legal substances. Kratom has a high LD 50, and because the body will induce vomiting to prevent over-ingestion it is incredibly unlikely that one would die as a result of Kratom overdose without the assistance of pharmaceuticals or illegal drugs. When the initial intent to schedule was announced, concern was expressed over 660 calls to poison control centers related to Kratom over a 5 year period and 15 deaths As Forbes points out, \"To put kratom risks in perspective, poison control centers received 6,843 reports of young children ingesting single-load laundry pods in just the first seven months of 2016.\" And refer to the reported deaths in a separate article, \"&14 of which also involved other, more dangerous drugs.\"\n\nKratom poses no serious threat to public safety, and a ban will do far more damage than allowing it to remain legal. Scheduling would prevent further research, would turn me and thousands of good people into criminals, would interfere with the right of adults to responsibly use safe substances, and would add fuel to the opioid epidemic by causing people to turn to dangerous and addictive drugs, boosting the black market, and removing an option for those wishing to break free from addictions to dangerous drugs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15625","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Billig","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Chase, I am 25 years old and currently in graduate school working towards my Ph.D. I have been using Kratom for approximately three years fairly regularly as a coffee/caffeine alternative.

I believe, as an adult,  that decision should be left up to me.  Especially considering this plant has medical benefits.   If a mind altering substance like alcohol is legal and regulated then so should kratom be.  Cigarettes kill countless people every year and are legal.   Kratom isn't mind altering and based off my experience has only been a major factor in aidimg me in living a productive and less stressful life. Before using kratom I was suffering from addiction, which ran in my family.  I couldn't hold down a job and was suffering from major emotionally and psychological stress. I responsibly use kratom in low doses because it kills my cravings to use harder, damaging drugs.  Since discovering kratom i have truly gotten my life back, helping me become a productive member of society.  Medical studies need to be conducted before banning a plant that has helped millions of people regain control of their lives.   If this government truly cares about the opioid epidemic and putting a stop to it then scheduling kratom is a move inthe wrong direction.  Draw your conclusion after analysing the medical research.   Its truly laughable to call kratom a treat to public safety.   Use your money and resources to go after the drugs that are running lives, not saving them.

I have never had my breathing slowed or depressed, which I know is the way that opiates kill people. From looking into the ban, I've noticed that every case of those people who died from Kratom had been using other drugs at the same time. I also know that many more calls come in from laundry pods or prescription painkillers than Kratom. \n\nPlease don't ban Kratom, or make it hard or impossible for responsible adult users like myself to access the plant. It has literally been a godsend, and kept me away from pursuing pharmaceutical drugs. Thanks for your time and considerations.

Kratom is an herbal supplement and should be treated as such. As far I can remember, I have had anxiety since I was a child and it was tough pursuing many goals because of it. Four years ago I hurt my back and it caused me to have a bulged disc in my lower back that causes pain every day. I went to many doctors and physically therapy but nothing was really relieving my pain from the bugling disc. I do not like taking pain medications because all of the terrible side effects they give with little to no relief for my back. I was in search of a natural supplement I could take to relieve some of the pain I was going through everyday. I researched different supplements and I found mitragyna speciosa (kratom) and it seemed like it might be what I needed. I researched this plant for several weeks, making sure that this would be safe to use and would actually help relieve my pain. I finally made my first purchase and the first time I used mitragyna speciosa it changed my life. I noticed after I took it that my pain lessend and it was more tolerable, it didn't take all of my pain away but it make it bareable. I also realized that for the first time in my life, I didn't feel like an anxious and paranoid mess. Goals in my life started to feel easier to achieve without all of the constant pain and anxiety I was going through before I started my kratom use. I became a more confident person in my personal and work life. I soon enough got the courage to start dating and start a new career. I now have a beautiful person in my life and I have a job that I love. I know kratom didn't make all of these changes happen on its own and that these things I accomplished were already possible, but it made it a little less of a challenge without my pain and anxiety. I know that kratom helps ease others pain and anxiety like it has mine. There are veterans that can now live a healthier life, away from the struggles of PTSD. Kratom eases the symptoms of PTSD because it helps relieve a lot of the anxiety associated with it. Please take what I have written into consideration, many lives rely on this wonderful plant for relief from pain and suffering, which makes life a little more bareable.

I also help take care of my ailing 91-year old grandmother who is suffering from dementia and is unable to move on her own without assistance.\n\nI've spent most of my life struggling with anxiety, PTSD from childhood abuse, and chronic depression. I've lost and hurt people I love dearly due to my problems. All doctors have ever done is put me on medications that have made me even more erratic and in the long run caused more harm than good. Half the time, these doctors won't even listen to me about my problems because our healthcare system is broken. I've tried everything under the moon.\n\nI came across this plant one day by sheer accident and decided to give it a try since I've had more success with herbal supplements than any pharmaceutical drug on the planet - and they are drugs, some of them are the worst you can imagine.\n\nSince I started supplementing Kratom I've been able to work. I've been able to help my family. I've felt like I had hope in my life for the first time in 20 years. I'm finally a productive member of society.

Scheduling a supplement that can help so many people, is not only immoral, it is plain evil.\n\nThis supplement has helped so many people from all walks of life be a more productive member of society.\n\nI pray that the people in charge will do the right thing just this one time. Restore some faith in the FDA, the DEA, and our government. Because right now, there is none left. \n\nThank you for your time and your consideration.

He is an amazing little boy & I am so very blessed to have watched him grow to be this perfect tiny human.\n\nThat's the reason I wanted to reach out to you and try to explain what Kratom means to me. Please Allow me to have a few moments of your time , I will try to be brief,  as I know you are very busy.\n\nThere was a time not to long ago that  I was depressed, practically disabled and just empty inside. I was broken, damaged and had given up on life.\nI couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. It started after I was prescribed pain medicine after a major surgery. Over the course of a year I had been on 4 different strengths and 3 different types of narcotics . I was a walking half functioning zombie. A dark cloud lingered over me day and night. I rarely ate, I hardly slept and had to literally make myself shower and get dressed. I didn't enjoy playing with my son anymore, I couldn't even help him with his homework. I wasn't able to clean our home or grocery shop on a regular basis. \n I was short tempered with my family & friends & before long, they saw the negative changes and desperately tried to convince me to get help. \n\nBefore this I was outgoing, friendly and bubbly my whole life. Doctors & medicine couldn't bring me back to that place. I couldn't help myself and didn't care enough to push any harder to get well.  my family insisted I see another therapist because they were scared seeing me like that. \nI was Diagnosed with depression, anxiety, mood disorders & ADD.\n My physical health was deteriorating fast. Already Having Lupus & chronic migraines, I suffered every day of my life in debilitating pain.\nI suffered with Chronic kidney infections, bladder infections & even sepsis. I lost one kidney at 21 and spent most of my life On antibiotics & pain meds. I never had energy so was prescribed can Ritalin. The side effects of all these drugs caused horrible reactions. I spent years In and out of hospitals & had to have multiple surgeries,  eventually having my gall bladder removed last year & abdominal tumors & abdominal cysts removed. After 6 more long months of and so many different medications failing, I gave up on ever being happy , pain free & active again. \n\nIm ashamed to say that I eventually broke & I ended up over dosing in an attempt to stop the suffering. I had hit rock bottom and had no where left to go. I saw that my son was hardly with me because I wouldn't properly care for him so my mom and dad had Tyler 80% of the time and the other 20% time with me was  supervised. That was The turning point in my so called life was when a random stranger in group therapy told me how she used suffer & be destructive just like I was until her doctor suggested an all natural plant to her. She was saved , given her life back and began to pay it forward by giving talks in support groups , online forums and even at pain clinics. I was skeptical but yet I was so desperate & willing to try anything that I agreed. \nI researched this plant, Kratom and found so many success stories that I knew I had to give this a chance, for my son, my family and for myself. I found all the information , support and knowledge I needed and made the first step towards recovery. \nI can't tell you how grateful I am that I got another chance at life and my son finally has the mother & life he deserves. I Am happy & feel alive again. I take no pain meds, no depression meds and I have energy. I have an appetite again. I sleep normally and don't suffer emotionally or physically anymore and I owe it all to Kratom. This saved my life and it is helping so many people who without it would not have the quality of life they do now. Everyone including myself , and Family's & children all over the world would suffer irreversibly if Kratom didn't exist.\n\n\nI BEG YOU TO HEAR MY TESTIMONY & KNOW I POUR MY HEART OUT TO YOU & OPEN UP AND REVEAL MY SENSITIVE PAST.\n PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THIS A SCHEDULED \"DRUG\". \nKRATOM IS AN ALL NATURAL ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER DANGEROUS OPTIONS WITH HORRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS. \nKratom is helping  everyone who is suffering end it once and for all and be the Healthy, happy & successful  People we were created to be. We are saving the lives of families, children & parents everyday.

Not only opiate addicts, but also alcohol addicts. It has been reported that not only can this help to relieve addiction, but can also control pain. All of this is speculative and NEEDS to be researched. \n\nWe also know that biology creates specificity with receptor-ligand connections better then anything in the lab. This is why researchers will use natural toxins and receptors to activate/silence/block pathways in the brain and body to answer questions about how things work, rather than using synthetic drugs. Nothing is more specific than what evolution has designed.\n\nThis is why it would be irresponsible to remove this substance from the ability to be researched and possibly prescribed/used by those who may need it. Many more questions need to be asked and research needs to be done to answer them. We cannot let pharmaceutical companies continue to monopolize the drug market.

I researched what others were using for pain and discovered kratom.\n   It was exactly what they said it was.  I use a teaspoon 3 times a day.  I either drink it in tea or mix it in food.  I am able to do a lot more than I was. My pain is not all gone, but it's much better than it was.    \n  Even though I am blessed with a body that does not get psychologically addicted to narcotics, I prefer kratom to the traditional pain meds.  Because of MRSA procedures done to control pain are not a option for me.  I have terrible side effects from most drugs, and the new generation of meds they are now using for pain have really horrible side effects as well as withdrawal symptoms.  There is no way I would subject my body  to that.  Also, I suffer from PTSD and depression.  Kratom helps with those things too.\n  I would respectfully request that you seriously look into what effects a ban on kratom would do.  Ask yourself these questions:\n\nWould a ban on the ingredients on kratom be worth the time and effort to make it so?\n\nHow much damage has this plant actually done?  How much has it helped?\n\nWhat would it cost to make this plant illegal when it comes to enforcing the laws?\n\nWhere are the resources going to come from to jail all the people who refuse to give up kratom?\n\n I am asking you not to make kratom illegal.  Just leave it alone.  I am almost 60 years old, and I would hate be considered a criminal at this late date.  Please, use good common sense. Please allow kratom to stay legal in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0583","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Judie Plumley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"You don't not have the authority to regulate what I can eat or drink or what medicinal herbs I can take.\nKratom is a natural existing plant therefore you have no right to limit my usage of it .\n\nSincerely CL Atkins","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16762","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am the husband of a woman whose life has been changed because of kratom.

Kratom enhanced my life in ways that only a healthy, harmless, valuable natural medicine could. I will explain the various reasons why I believe kratom should not be made a schedule 1 drug and why I believe it should be available to anyone who would benefit from its positive life changing effects.\n\n     Prior to me discovering kratom i had many negative experiences with mental health issues, unhelpful medications, and addiction. SInce I was 7 years old I have struggled with OCD, ADD, depression, anxiety, and addiction. For 17 years I was prescribed medications that mostly  either didn't help at all or actually made my mental state worse than it already was. Some of these medications gave me a temporary feeling of euphoria that within 8 hours turned into very negative damaging thoughts and feelings. This lead to me becoming addicted to these medications. I eventually resorted to using destructive man-made drugs like methamphetamine and heroin in order to kill the pain that I felt within myself due to my mental dysfunctions. The result of this was me becoming heavily addicted to mainly methamphetamine. \n\n     In the depths of my methamphetamine addiction I came across a description of kratom and the benefits of using it as a tool to overcome various issues ranging from pain relief to the healing of mental issues. At first I was skeptical about it, but after using it for the first time I was sure that it had positive potential. I had become very impressed with it after a few uses. It was then that I decided to use it as a way to overcome my methamphetamine addiction and my mental health issues. I quit using methamphetamine altogether that very day. I used kratom to successfully subdue my unbearable cravings to use methamphetamine. Without kratom I would certainly still be using methamphetamine. After using kratom to overcome my meth addiction I began using kratom to deal with my excruciating anxiety and deep depression. Kratom relieves my anxiety and depression exceptionally, while exhibiting no negative side effects. By eliminating my anxiety kratom in turn subdues my OCD. Because of this I now have a safe healthy natural medicine that alleviates my mental pain. I now can work on changing my thought patterns in order to completely eliminate my mental disorders.\n\n     Ontop of all this, kratom has helped me to quit smoking. Kratom gives me clean efficient energy and focus that is superior to most stimulants and certainly feels much safer and healthier. Even though kratom provides me with valuable energy it also helps me achieve deeper more significant sleep. Since I have began using kratom I have managed to avoid almost all of the viruses that my coworkers, friends, and family whom I was in close contact with were sick from, wich leads me to believe that kratom is a powerful immune system supporter. Kratom has completely helped me change my life for the better and should absolutely remain 100% legal.\nThank you for allowing the public to comment on this.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2184","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've been using kratom for 5 years or so.

I have been using Kratom for approximately 2 years I do not believe that Kratom should be a schedule 1 controlled substance. The tea in its natural state is safe. It has helped me with pain, anxiety, energy and depression. It helps me be able to get up and go to work, whether it is when I work in the field or at the office. I work in construction and am in pain a lot of the time, Kratom helps me tolerate the pain, while helping me focus with a healthy amount of energy. I also have asthma and have had issues with taking opiate based prescription medicine causing shallow breathing and respiratory depression. Kratom has never caused any complications with my asthma or breathing. Prior to discovering Kratom, I dealt with extreme anxiety and depression, so bad I was taking up to 4 mg of alprazolam a day alongside 2 mg of clonazepam and had tried several antidepressants such as Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Paxil, and Trazodone, all of which caused me horrible side effects that made my depression and anxiety much worse. Kratom has allowed me not to be dependent upon benzodiazepines as much. I am no longer using alprazolam and only occasionally use 1 mg clonazepam, usually when Kratom is not available or in high anxiety situations, such as large crowds. I notice that because my anxiety is much lower, my depression has subsided significantly. I do not feel that Kratom should be scheduled, it is natural, safe and helpful for many who want alternatives to dangerous and addictive medicine and drugs. The most regulation Kratom should have is as an herbal supplement, nothing more.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8918","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Payne","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a great alternative to the poison pills that doctors like to over prescribed, kratom has helped my wife and myself  lead a  somewhat normal pain free life.

This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\n-How you came to use kratom&.. (did you learn about it in a chronic pain support group, etc?)\n\n-What ailments you suffer, what treatments haven't worked (prescriptions, surgery, etc.), how long you've been dealing with your condition, how long you've been using kratom and how many/what medications you've been able to quit.\n\n-What kratom means to you (has it given you your life back, have you gone back to work, can you play with your, exercise or travel, etc., something anecdotal about why kratom is important and should be available).\n\n-Conclusion: Kratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. Im asking you to please contact the DEA. Please send a letter or request an oversight hearing asking to delay this emergency action. I fear this action by the DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic, maybe even my own (if you think this may lead to a replace and illicit drug use).

I'm graduating from the Petroleum Engineering master's program at University of Oklahoma this December.  I have been a Graduate Teaching Assistant and I have a 4.0 GPA.  I have over 5 years work experience with prominent exploration and production corporations.  I don't say this to boast but to highlight the fact that there are many kratom users who are respectable, hard-working citizens.\n\nWhen I heard kratom was on emergency scheduling status for Schedule 1 I was shocked.  I am aware of no deaths caused by kratom alone, so to characterize kratom as an imminent threat to public health is misguided in my opinion.  And to suggest that kratom has no medicinal potential is equally perplexing.  I'm sure my friends at the American Kratom Association has sent you plenty of studies examining the medicinal potential of kratom.  Anecdotally I know it has been used to aid detox of dangerous opiates, including heroin.  Many people use kratom for pain relief that don't want to use physically addicting opiates.  Kratom is used by many people for anxiety or depression with success.\n\nI myself started using kratom 7 years ago for minor social anxiety.  It worked well and was a great substitute for alcohol which is much more health damaging and kills many people a year.  Since then, I have continued to use kratom to relieve minor anxiety and I consider it a blessing.  I'm healthy, doing great at school and work, and looking forward to a positive future.  \n\nPlease consider the comments of people like myself, the research studies on kratom's medicinal potential, and the statistics (or lack of statistics) on actual kratom deaths (no other drugs).  I truly believe this is in the best interest of public health.\n\nThank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16681","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bryan Scarborough","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is good for chronic pain..I have fibro and there is no meds prescribed that help the pain...Kratom eases the pain in my back and legs and I don't have to spend the day in bed with a heating blanket...","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5532","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"JoAnn Fletcher","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am an RN, and have witnessed how destructive and dangerous opioid addiction can be.

I'm a 31 year old mother of a 6 year old boy. I'm also a recovering addict with a history of depression and anxiety. I was an active addict of opiate pain medications for over 10 years, which like most people, I became dependent on after I had been given a legitimate prescription by my doctor for migraine head aches. I was also a certified pharmacy technician. I saw 1st hand the damage done by opioid pain killers, then experienced it myself. As my addiction progressed, I had to leave my career. Obviously, I could not go to work in withdrawal and restrain myself from taking what was right in front of me to ease my pain. My addiction took everything from me. My career was gone. My marriage collapsed. My car got repossessed. Sadly, my story is not an unusual one. \n   Fast forward to 2 years ago when I discovered kratom. Like many, I was desperately searching for anything that could help me through the mental and physical pain of withdrawal. I was skeptical, but from the moment I tried it, I knew it was a game changer for me. I have been taking advantage of kratom's benefits since that day. I can honestly say that it has saved my life. It's very likely that I would be dead right now, and my son without a mother. Instead, I'm thriving. I have a good job. I just bought my first home. I'm involved with my family. My son has his mother.. All of this because of one unrefined, natural leaf, not another drug. If kratom is removed from the hands of people like me, they could be forced back into the life that they so desperately crawled out of. Undeniably, deaths will go up exponentially, and children orphaned. Complete removal of this priceless resource would be incredibly harmful and beyond irresponsible. Please be very careful when considering this prospective ban. You hold thousands of lives in your hands.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18444","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amber Hageman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm writing today to share with you how much this beautiful plant has helped me in my life. \n\nIn 1998 I severely herniated a disc in my back at work. I have a very low income and could not afford proper medical treatment for it and it became a chronic injury. Several times a year I would become fully immobile. Even worse, I lived with a constant low to medium level of pain and discomfort. My quality of life was greatly compromised and my emotional health suffered because of it.\n\nPharmaceutical pain medication terrifies me as I've seen it take over and destroy many lives with profound addiction. Yet I needed relief. After some research I came across Kratom, and many testimonials from people who had used it for pain relief. I sought it out and what I experienced was nothing short of a miracle. \n\nThe kratom immediately eased my pain and discomfort. With it came a lifting of the dark mood I had come accustomed to. I felt connected again with a joy for life that I hadn't felt since a child. What it offers is not a high or an intoxication, but more a balancing. My performance and mental clarity is not dismissed in any way.\n\nAt its worse when I took too much once, I only felt a transitory dizziness, sleepiness and nausea. It passed quickly and presented no true physical hazard. I've never experienced an unpleasant physical or mental side effect after years of use. The claims of addiction are very overstated and at its worse parallel those of a regular coffee habit.\n\nIts very affordable and remarkably easy to use. Its a very gentle and generous plant and it's my strong feeling that all humans on this planet have a birth right to benefit from it if they choose. It has helped so so many achieve the quality of life they desire. Because of its medicinal properties I'm a better worker, friend, partner and member of society. This plant is only positive and suggesting it be prohibited is in itself an absurd crime against humanity!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9195","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Poplawski","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I an a 47 year old  single mother of three who was an active,  productive  member of society.

This is a severe epidemic in this country and it's being perpetrated by our own doctors and pharmaceutical companies. My father deals with having constant nerve pain and must take heavy medications to get through each day, that numb his nerves. Luckily he's not on any opiate! I have not personally used Kratom, but I have read and heard a lot of other's experiences and comments on it. This is a plant that has shown no issue  with most common users. I have seen some rare comments from users that have problems with the plant, either from feeling sick or having some sort of trouble with it, but they are outliers from the vast majority of positive experiences with Kratom. God forbid my joint pain or back pain ever get bad enough that I'm looking to relief from any opiate. I know my problems are getting worse and I'd feel better if Kratom was out there and available as a natural alternative for pain relief. You also need to do more research on Kratom and we can then find out for certain what side effects we'll be dealing with in this substance. It's important that you give adults the freedom and information to act on their own accord and in their own best interests. Banning Kratom and marking it Schedule 1 will only cause it to go underground and people will be hurt by unregulated sellers mixing in other things.

Your wisdom in delaying the ban on kratom has given me so much hope and admiration for the DEA, now I have nothing but respect for your ability to listen, learn, and act appropriately, Thank you so much for hearing the voice of the people!\nMy name is Matt, and I'm 25 years old. I work at Barnes and Noble where I love to connect people with new books and ideas which can change there life.\nBefore finding kratom I was a functioning alcoholic and I barely made it to work because of the daily hangovers which plagued my waking life. Each and every day was a struggle to resist the urge to drink,  every method of quitting failed me. From AA to naltrexone, to anabuse all these provided only a stronger urge to drink and fill the genetic predisposition to drown in a bottle of alcohol. I was on the verge of giving up and letting myself drink until I  died. \nBut then something miraculously happened to me. While talking with a new friend about any supplements which had helped him maintain his sobriety he mentioned a plant named kratom. I didn't have much confidence in his testimonies, because it sounded to good to be true. After nearly 6 years of trying everything under the sun I wouldn't believe that a simple plant could alter a persons addictions so drastically. But I decided to trust this persons unrelenting enthusiasm about Kratom and buy some at a local sore in downtown Denver, because hey, I had run out of options and knew my mind and liver were running quickly out of time.\n3 capsules of kratom later the urge was gone. I felt normal, I felt functional, I felt the curse of my families Irish alcoholic history had been washed away and redemption was at hand. Freedom never felt so good, I jumped around the house thanking god for giving me a second chance at life. \nSix months of sobriety all thanks to this miraculous plant. I have become a fully functional member of society and a drastically better, son, boyfriend, employee, and citizen. I wake up everyday now refreshed, rested, with no hangover and that is such a blessing. I can drink in moderation again with kratom and celebrate birthdays or weddings as a responsible consumer of alcohol again without getting drunk. With the monkey of addiction off my back I can pursue my dreams and contribute to society as every responsible person has the right to. \n            I hope this story is only one of countless others which you have read, reflected on, and used to make a final decision. The benefits are too great and the consequences to drastic to ban this plant for American citizens who deserve justice and the pursuit of happiness.

Kratom has the strength of coffee in terms of effects.\n\nAdding a drug that hundreds of thousands of people around the US use to a list of illegal drugs will not only hurt the users, but also hurt the success of our country. Kratom users are regular people. They are people who actively contribute to our economy. Banning Kratom is akin to banning a less-ubiquitous coffee. No one is out there stealing for a fix. There is no kratom violence. There is no kratom health crisis, nor could their be due to the relatively mild strength of effects. \n\nBy criminalizing kratom, you will be taking a subset of people who are otherwise productive citizens and turn them into criminals.

For the past few years, I have chosen not to take these prescriptions, as they left me feeling even worse. Last year, I discovered Kratom. I take a couple teaspoons mixed in with my herbal teas. I buy it from a trusted herbal shop, and I did research before using. Like with anything else, such as caffeine or alcohol, it is not something that should be abused. It has helped me tremendously - and helped me cut back my drinking. I used to turn to wine, but with kratom it left me feeling calm and lighter. It did not have any harmful side effects and helped me more than ANY pill. Kratom is in the same family as coffee. It helps many people with addictions to opiates.

At least not in the sense that Kratom is dangerous. I used to, and I know it may seem ridiculous to some, abuse things like Tylenol and Advil. I was taking over 25 Tylenol a day back when I was in school. This may not seem like a lot but the recommended limit is 6 in 24 hours. I was taking  over 25 just for the 14 to 18 hours i was awake every day. Doing sports like football and wrestling, I was 300 lbs as a Freshman being that heavy and having to move that much destroyed my knees. Also my Freshman year I hurt my back. I got stacked, imagine a 6 foot 265 lb person with only their head and shoulder blades touching the mat. That move, caused a disk in my back to slip out of place. Pretty painful, and I got it fixed and got done using my prescription for Hydrocodon. With my left knee in particular in so much pain, I had a tendon out of place and it would swell up when doing physical activities, and my back still in pain I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to become a \"drug addict\" so i just used whatever I could find at home to help with the pain. Plus if you ask a person for Tylenol and they give you a few they don't really think about it, but when you go and ask then next person for a few, and the next. It starts to make you realize you might have a problem. I didn't want to damage my liver so I started looking for other things to fix my problem, I found booze. Amazing my liver will be... ohh yeah booze is bad for that too. So then I decided well i can get help or try and get a prescription. I decided to get help, I am still in pain and I'm trying to live with it but it gets hard. I just heard about this \"Kratom\" thing and was thinking about trying it to help with the pain, but I hear its going to be banned. Yet when I try and do research on it to see what kind of harmful effects it may or may not have I see nothing really shocking or particularly abhorrent. It seems to be less lethal than cigarettes or alcohol and yet those are both legal. So, I'm asking in this comment for you to, at least to show more evidence if you have it or do more tests if there is not more substantial evidence.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9411","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bryce Brandt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Cassie; I am college student studying biology and immunology.\n\nI think it is wrong to schedule the two main alkaloids present in Kratom (which would outlaw the plant itself).

For myself, I fear a scheduling may take from me the life improvements I've enjoyed since discovering kratom.\n\nPlease keep kratom legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16801","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeremy Thogmartin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been a long term user of kratom for anxiety and chronic pain.

I am in agreement with this decision. Our country is facing an opioid addiction crisis. Having previously worked for the Wisconsin State Legislature, and currently working for a family practice clinic in Madison, WI I have dealt with this issue from a variety of angles. While I understand that Kratom is not technically an opiate, it affects the same receptors and causes the same effects on the body. \n\nSkimming through other comments and doing research online it is clear that many people do not understand the true nature of this substance, or the fact that it is exceptionally similar to heroin, morphine, or any other opioid. They feel like they are making a better, healthier decision, which could really be leading them down a path to addiction. Working as an RN I am very aware that there are people who require daily pain medication to live. However, these medications are risky and require the oversight of a provider. It is not safe to self-treat with medications sold over the internet or on the street without any sort of regulation or guarantee of purity. We tell patients consistently to refrain from buying prescription medications from disreputable sources, and I believe that allowing Kratom to be sold with no regulation would go against best practice and best policy. \n\nDoing research into this drug, there are many stories about the substance being used to wean people off of opioids. If this is valid and this substance would be able to help people wean off opioids and become independent of all substances (not just replace heroin with Kratom) than the medication should be made available through safe channels at reasonable costs. Recently the FDA has agreed to approve a trial of MDMA (ecstasy) to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. If Kratom is effective in treating addiction than it will be able to hold up to a similar clinical trial. \n\nI have family members who suffer with opioid addiction. I have seen first-hand what it can do to a person and the effect it can have on their lives. I also know how misinformation on the ability to get addicted to prescription pain killers has increased the abuse of these drugs. While I realize that placing this drug on the Schedule 1 list will not do much to decrease addiction it is a preventative measure to help keep the drug away from our citizens and not exacerbate the problem we are already facing. I am open to research if there is a demand and people are willing to pay for and/or participate in clinical trials of the substance. However, I believe that it is also in the best interest of our nation that this move be made to protect citizens from believing the substance is a \"safe, natural, alternative\" to heroin or other opioids. Obviously, having heroin or ecstasy listed as Schedule 1 has not stopped them from getting into the hands of people across the country. However, it does mean that the majority of people know that the drug is dangerous. \n\nThe hope is that education programs and new regulations on narcotics and prescribing practices will help curb the opioid epidemic. Doctors, nurses, legislators and activists across the country are hard at work finding creative solutions to help those addicted and to prevent others from becoming addicted. The last thing we need as we clamp down on one drug is to introduce another and allow it to remain legal and unregulated. For these reasons I agree with placing Kratom on the Schedule 1 list until such a time that it is determined to have a safe, medicinal purpose. \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11006","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello!

Being inside my head is miserable, so at a young age, I began using drugs. My first experience with opium was a revelation. For the first time in nineteen years I felt truly happy. I entered into a relationship with a junky, and later became one myself. I got clean through relocation, but every second of every day was spent thinking about opium, wishing I could get my hands on some. Eighteen months later, I found a connection for hydrocodone. For the past two and a half years I have spent every spare dollar, even those I could not spend, on chasing the dragon. At my worst, I was taking eight pills a day just to maintain the habit. As a functioning addict, I had a full time job I could not take time off of to go through the painful, miserable experience that is opiate withdrawal. On top of the physical discomfort, the emotional withdrawal would cause me so much anxiety and mania that I would often come close to suicide. At that point, I would break my vow of sobriety and go buy more pills. I tried the twelve step program, it didn't work and just depressed me more by letting other people's problems into my own issue ridden life. I then moved across the country for the summer to get away and detox. I was sober for three months, but I looked for pills every single day. When I finally drove home, instead of going straight to my apartment after a two day drive, I went an extra hour and a half out of my way to get pills. My dealer, who had never shied away from making his desires for me known, began to grow more confident in his advances and finally tried to elicit sexual favors in exchange for pills. I was in a terrible position and knew I needed an out. Serendipitously, one of the libertarian Facebook pages I followed posted an article about the DEA planning to classify kratom as Schedule 1. I had never heard of this plant or its benefits prior to the posting. I spent the next several hours reading reviews from former addicts about the wonders of kratom. I hurried to my local head shop and purchased my first few grams. My life is so much better because of it. I did not experience a single symptom of withdrawal even a week after taking my last pills. Not only that, but my desire to get more pills had completely dissolved. My dealer contacted me thrice that week, and I didn't bother to text him back. I am now six weeks sober and have no wish to take another opiate, not because I'm afraid of where I'll end up if I do, but because I don't need the high. It's as if my brain has been rewired and my addiction eliminated. I now use kratom simply as an antidepressant and anti-anxiety treatment since it gives me the slight happiness boost I longed for that prescribed medication never has. I am happier than I ever have been because of this plant. I implore you to please take this into account, to listen not to the pharmaceutical companies who want to continue shoving opiates down the nation's throats for profit, but to the US citizens like me who have gotten their lives back. I want everyone in the world to have the option to use kratom for whatever reason. There's no high, no cognitive impairment, nothing to make this drug something you need to regulate. It's about the same level of dangerous as a B12 vitamin. Please make the right decision by the American people and leave kratom alone.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15297","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Prudence Kasner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using Kratom for over a year now.

I first discovered Kratom in early 2004 while looking for an alternative to narcotic pain medication for treating chronic lower back pain and arthritis. At that time it was relatively unknown in the US and identified as being from the coffee family. I began using Kratom at that time and found that it actually was helpful for pain relief with none of the side effects of opiod pain meds. It is not a substance that has ever resulted in my being intoxicated. In smaller amounts it is mildly stimulating at best similar to coffee. In higher doses it may be somewhat relaxing, however I can emphatically state it is not at all comparative to prescription drugs I have used in the past such as opiods, tranquilizers, sedatives, etc..- I have seen this misinformation in the media and unless it is somehow being tainted with other substances or drugs plain kratom is nothing like those drugs. It has been almost 13 years of my using kratom, and the past 7 include regular and almost daily doses. I am very active and also extremely health conscious. I have regular medical check ups and lab work done every six months for thyroid/cholesterol as well as liver/kidney function and all tests have been in normal range. I have had two shoulder surgeries in the past 5 years and used kratom rather than opiod medication throughout the recovery. I must really emphasize that kratom does not impair you and something like Benadryl has a much more sedating effect than kratom in my experience. Although the significant benefits of Kratom are considered mostly anecdotal I have seen it proven to be nothing short of miraculous in saving several people I know personally from long term and severe addictions when no other treatments had been successful. It saved their lives. Please do not schedule this drug as planned. It has benefitted myself greatly but even more importantly it has actually saved, and will save the lives of so many others, especially with the current opiod crisis in this country.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4708","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom tea has changed my life, to live a fuller,happier,healthier life style.\nKratom Tea has helped me in many ways that if it was made illegal and my rights to have access to it taken away from me,my life would see many negative changes and would have many Drastic repercussions. \n\n\n\nPlease help me and the many others like myself keep kratom legal. \n\n\nThank you, \nErica Escutai","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4964","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Erica Escutia","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Making a natural plant that helps so many people get off of pills that are an EPIDEMIC is CRIMINAL stop the war on the citizens of the USA who choose NOT to be dependent on pharmaceutical DRUGS that cause innumerable PROBLEMS for this great yet struggling country...

I now have a 3 month old son and recently got engaged to his father. I am a productive member of society and I couldn't imagine my life without Kratom. I recently had surgery from the pressure of my pregnancy and was able to refuse pain medication because I had Kratom.

Compared to morphine, it has none of the narcotic effects, but all the benefits I was looking for to control my chronic pain. Please, do some research before you make any legislation that could potentially have a negative effect across the nation. I fear that people who have discovered Kratom will go back to narcotics, or even end their life out of despair when they are unable to control their pain, or afford to control their pain.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23225","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Garden of the Ancients","postedDate":"2017-06-12T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Young","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nThank you for listening to the public before classifying the substance. Kratom is a 100% natural product that helps thousands of people in many walks of life. Kratom has helped me and friends of mine overcome our addictions to other substances, and I don't know where I would be if it was not available legally. It is truly an amazing substance with remarkable effects. It should not be classified as an illegal substance, because that would prevent a lot of progress with researching it for use in patients who need help. It is an incredible plant that has many uses, such as a healthy way to maintain focus, which helps with ADD; and it is also vey helpful as a painkiller and sleep aid to help with those in chronic pain. It would be a waste of a wonderful gift to illegalize this plant. A lot of good will come from it. I am a chemistry major at a respected world class university, and it has helped me get to where I am. It can help many more if it is available legally and better advertised. \n\nThank you for listening. Please don't make a big mistake and end up on the wrong side of history on this decision. If alcohol is legal, there is no way this should be illegal.

I'd simply like to take some time to express my opinions and two positive experiences I've had with Kratom. First, two years ago I found out I was allergic to acetaminophen and aspirin apparently. It's not severe but I do get hives when taking Tylenol, Advil, Aspirin, Ibuprofen, among other painkillers. Either way, occasionally I get pretty bad migraines and my Doctor actually recommended trying Kratom to prevent serious migraines from interfering with my work and family time. I gave it a shot and it has helped tremendously. I have never had the urge to abuse it or use it for recreationally; I only use when I get a bad headache and it immediately eliminates the pain without making me feel impaired or fuzzy. Also, I realized that taking Kratom 1 - 3 times a week has helped me with my IBS, apparently it's an excellent source of fiber...who would've known! \n\nAnother more important experience I also witnessed firsthand was Kratom's ability to assist people in overcoming addiction to prescription painkillers like Oxy and Vicodin. Two of my good friends fell on hards times and both of them fell victim to the abuse of prescription painkillers. One of these friends was addicted to Oxy for over 8 years and the other was an addict of Hydrocodone and Vicodin for approximately 4 years. After I did some research on Kratom and after speaking with my Doctor I learned that Kratom can help people overcome opiate addiction. I told my friends about this over a year ago and I can proudly say that as of this year they are both completely drug free. The reason I write this is because one of these friends actually sent me a text two days ago and all he wrote was \"Thank you, Kratom has saved me.\" After hearing that I knew I had to share my experience on this form. One of the two friends takes Katom about 3 times a week to battle urges, and the other is completely off any type of assistance, not even needing Kratom. These two friends had trouble communicating in public without opiates in their system, they both looked sick and lost the color in their skin, but as of this last year with the assistance of Kratom they're now very active, one of the two went back to college and the other is very successful in his line of work; to sum it up...they have their lives back! So I'm just sharing my story, and I know Kratom has helped several others with addiction, anxiety, ADHD, etc. It would be a shame to see this plant banned, I can guarantee we'd see the opiate use increase and I can't imagine someone going to jail or getting arrested for something like Kratom. That's my story and I thank you for your time and for hearing me out. Happy Thanksgiving and Merry Christmas.

The benefits for me have been amazing, my pain is controlled, I've gotten off of prescription opiates which had literally torn my life apart for years and just made the emotional pain worse. This plant has helped many in the same ways as it has for me through anxiety, depression, emotional well-being, drive, I've actually gotten a better paying job working with animals. I have never had a bad reaction to this plant through numerous vendors, never! It has only helped in every instance. I understand drugs are a problem, but only in the instance of \"imminent public danger\" I.e. Flaka, spice, fentanyl pressed fake pills that are actually killing people. I do not believe anyone should mandate controlling a plant that has a better track record than peanut butter for killing people, it's not psychoactive, you don't get high, it doesn't inhibit motor functions for me.. Just a useful tool for living through some of life's downsides when it comes to the human body and pain..

I run a clinic for heroine and opiates addiction. Yes I use suboxone. I have a good handle on the dosing of this medication and how it gets people's lives back. So just tonight I am having a conersation with a patient as he tells me of his plans and use of kratom. There is no scientific evidence to form an opinion. He reports to a face book forum of over he say 150 thousand users. But like any addiction or abar ant behavior. R u working. Do u want ur children to have and or use it.  Unlike the tramadol which a lot of doctor says ooh it's not a narcotic. It's safe. And seizures are good for depression. So if it hits the mu receptor then activates the effects of an opiate.  Period. End of story. So now I have a patient getting this on line mixing. What I do think is the potency of suboxone will block the kratom receptor. So I still have control. But what other drug drug interactions are we doing.  Okay u use kratom. Addiction. Still addictive behaviors. Persons on suboxone don't have addictive behaviors. I read about kratom and feeling of high. This person was telling me he did not feel the need for suboxone and did not take it. Stupid. It's still on the receptor and it is not a feel good drugs. Let's use marinol. I can dose it. I can expect the same dose with each delivery system. I can have expected results. I would rather offer marinol in a pill than go thru this hap hazard make up chemistry set as we go. So again let's allow a drug that we know minimal about. I guess there r some pharmaceutical that the package insert states the moa is not known. Maybe the plant potency just will not be pharmaceutical grade. I just find to sale it in a drink otc is subject to a child's play and use. Adult brain and adult consequences.  Limit s somehow but not that we have to regulate it per person but at the distribution site. Maybe the post office will say illegal to ship like ghb and then it's a federal case. So shipping companies say no. Then the Dea job easier. U guys already have a tuff job. From over prescribing docs to heroin. Maybe the 150 thousand just ain't worth our time. Just stay outta my practice.\nI don't know how or if this rant help. Be safe to u however.

I'm a 31 year old cab driver from Asheville, NC. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree from Beloit College. I have been consuming kratom--in the form of tea--for a little over a year and a half now, though I have known about it a lot longer. I used to be addicted to opiates for many years. It destroyed some of my relationships, and hindered my progress in life greatly. Since utilizing kratom, I have no more cravings, I have energy and zest for life, and I have not gone back to using opiates. I also have battled depression and anxiety throughout my life and this plant has helped with that as well. I'm going to keep this personal and not include scientific claims or research, but there is plenty of it out there, and most all of it is positive. The fact that this plant--this TEA--was even being considered as a schedule 1 illegal substance is absurd. Any negative or harmful influences on my life from it are scarce. \n\nI make a bottle of tea each day to drink throughout (like many people do with coffee). It gets me no more \"wired\" than caffeine does, and makes me feel no more \"high\" than the way I feel after having some dark chocolate or a good session of yoga. The biggest effect it has on me is with my mood. I'm generally content most of the time, and I'm able to be productive and better navigate life's ups and downs. This has all the effects found in numerous herbal supplements wrapped up into one nice little plant. I really do not want it taken away from me, and I think doing so will do more harm to society than it does good.\n\nThe opiate epidemic has been terrible for a long time now, and anything that can help ease its disastrous effects on families and society should be embraced, not shunned. People are not showing up dead in emergency rooms because of this plant. They are regaining their lives, being more productive members of society, and a bettering themselves--often with a smile on their faces. I fully support kratom, I will continue taking it as long as I have access to it, and I will fight for it to remain legal and accepted in society for the benefit of anyone who needs it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14172","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Fennig","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been able to come off cymbalta and oxycodone thanks to kratom.

This letter expresses disapproval of the DEA's scheduling of kratom as a schedule I controlled substance, which calls for mandatory prison sentences for anyone carrying even a small amount of the tea. \n\nKratom helps millions of people in the U.S. (not just junkies, but respectable and hard working citizens) deal with pain. Many millions of people who suffer from severe chronic pain have become addicted to prescription opiates, which is an incredibly serious addiction that many of them will never recover from. This issue would only be exacerbated by the scheduling of kratom. \n\nIn my opinion, that is plenty good reason not to ban kratom, but of course, there is even more to it. Kratom is an incredible tool for overcoming addiction to both powerful opiates (prescription and otherwise) and alcohol. It's known, not only to be just as effective as methadone and suboxone, but also to be much easier to step down and get clean from. Not only that, but the relapse rate for those who recover using kratom is lower than for those who use methadone or suboxone. On top of that, methadone and suboxone are chemicals that are synthesized in labs and factories. It seems absolutely ridiculous to favor them over a type of tea that has been shown to work even more effectively.\n\nI know a lot of this first hand. I became addicted to prescription opiates that were prescribed to me after a simple but painful procedure. They claimed that the amounts they were giving me were \"standard for this type of procedure\" yet it was plenty to get me hooked and in withdrawals (which are much worse than the post procedure pain) when I decided to stop. Keep in mind, I was taking the proper amount, however they did up my dosage as my tolerance developed. After doing research and learning about kratom, I gave it a shot, and it was an absolute lifesaver. I was able to switch to kratom entirely, and ween  off of it within a month, with absolutely no withdrawals, which meant I could still go to school, continue work, and keep on enjoying life. I now use it on occasion for pain, and I never feel the urge to start using again regularly, which addicts know, if you relapse on opiates even a little, you'll be back in the deep end before you know it. One of the greatest things about it is that, because of the dosage plateau, there really isn't much deep end. It is possible to become dependent, but most of the factors that contribute to serious addiction do not apply to kratom. The best example is the idea of \"chasing the high\", which is the reason addicts use more and more every time to feel as good as they did the last time. With kratom, even if you reach the dose ceiling, if you continue to use at that level, you will only develop more tolerance, and once the high is entirely non existent, there is no more incentive to continue to use. It really is a miracle opiate in that way. The DEA does not know how great it can be for those who truly benefit from it. I would still have that huge problem in my life if it hadn't been for kratom. If more prescription opiate (or even heroin) users made the switch, it would save hundreds of thousands of lives over the next 10 years.\n\nThe DEA claims they are trying to protect the public. I do not believe that for a second. The whole situation screams lobbying from big pharma, especially since patents were filed, shortly after the announcement of the ban, for several compounds that were synthesized from 2 of the effective alkaloids found in kratom, Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine. Kratom addiction itself takes much longer to develop than addiction from any other opiate that either exists on the streets, or is pushed by pharmaceutical companies. Not only that, but, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, 47,055 people died of opiate overdose in 2014, which works out to be about 5 deaths an hour! Of these, 18,893 of them were prescription opiates, which means 2 of those 5 per hour were caused by substances that are accepted by the DEA. Kratom, on the other hand, has never caused an overdose in all of medical history. It doesn't require much thought to realize that a ban of it would only make matters worse in this country. Please, do your own research, and make the decision that makes most sense to you.\n\nThank you,\nRyan McKay","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21271","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan McKay","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There isn't enough space in the comment slot to cover why Kratom should be kept legal. For opiate addictions like vicodin, oxycotin, and heroin, there are those that find it way to hard to quit and end up having to be prescribed methadone and suboxone. Both of which are more dangerous and harder to withdrawal from then the opioids that they were addicted to. Kratom is an herbal remedy which provides relief from the pain of opioid withdrawal without the danger of becoming addicted to a new harder substance. There is little withdrawal, even from heavy use, of kratom. It provides no real feeling of a high. It is in every way an useful herbal supplement from which there is little potential for abuse. Please keep kratom legal or if it scheduled keep the schedule lowest that useful research may still be done on it.

What I have learned is that it helps with many addictions, the biggest one being opiates. The government want to ban natural herbs that's are a natural medicine including pot. Kratom has slowed my alcohol consumption down with the few times I have injested it. It has also slowed down my nicotine addiction. Banning and/or keeping these these natural substances illegal is doing nothin but helping the government profit. When \"we\" as working Americans should be able to profit and let it circulate in our country. The pharmactical industry is diestroying our country by trusting our doctors and what the prescribe. There have been no deaths on either kratom nor marijuana. So what's is the controversy?

My sister has fibromyalgia and she had been posting articles about the ban on Facebook. I wanted to know more about Kratom so she had told me about it. She uses Kratom daily to help with her pain from the fibromyalgia and hip pain as she is waiting on getting a full hip replacement at 37 years old. She will not take pain pills because she hates the way they make her feel but takes Kratom to get her through the day. She also has severe anxiety anytime she has to leave her house and Kratom makes it possible for her to function in public. \n   Her husband was an alcoholic and because of his alcoholism, they were on the verge of divorce. He had gone to rehab and when he got out, he started using Kratom to help with his alcohol withdrawals and mood swings. Kratom saved their marriage. \n   When we found out about this, I had already been researching ways to detox from opiates because my fiancee had become addicted to Percocets. He was shot in his arm while working as a tow truck driver 8 years ago. I was 8 months pregnant with our son at the time. He was set up, shot, and robbed by an 18 year old felon. It caused many issues afterward. He didn't regain complete use of his arm for a year after the shooting. He developed PTSD and severe, crippling anxiety because of it. It also messed up his back. He was taking 15 - 20 10mg Percocets daily for his back pain. He tried quitting the pain pills cold turkey and couldn't handle the withdrawals. Kratom saved him and our relationship. He now can work again and is off of Social Security Disability. It not only helps his pain, but his anxiety is under control. He has been off of pain pills for two months now. \n   I also have back pain and take Kratom when I can no longer function through the pain. Kratom does not make you high. I have yet to experience any type of euphoria that people claim it provides. It only gives me a sense of calm and relaxation. Please do not take this natural pain and anxiety away from our family.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8194","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Brandon Achten and I'm 37 years old from Louisiana.

After years of her suffering constant pain from arthritis, constant fatigue and depression, she had seen Drs and was treated like she was probably a \"pill seeker\" which was not the case as she was never prescribed pain killers or anything else to help, Instead she was told to take advil. This brought her to tears as the advil did not help at all. She gave up even trying to get help from Drs. She gave up LIVING. Although not suicidal, she resorted to sleeping as much as possible and barely able to do her at home phone job as even that was exhausting. She gained a bunch of weight. We thought about disability for her and I contemplated leaving her so it would be easier to obtain and maybe she would get someone who was trained and could help take care of her. Our marriage had become a caretaker/patient type of relationship. She relied on me for basic needs, do the housework, cooking, shopping. I was at my wits end too and we had no physical relationship anymore as she did not have the energy or will anymore. The weight gain made her feel ugly. We heard of Kratom on a TV show as a natural way to help with chronic pain. She  researched it and we decided she should try it. the 1st time, she felt pain melt away, some color came back to her paled face. This gave her lots of encouragement and using just a little a day, Soon she was up moving around more, had some energy, made us a dinners, cleaned the house. She actually wanted to get out and do stuff again. She has lost some weight which made her feel even more encouraged to keep moving. She has found hope and a life again and our marriage is once again promising and fulfilling. She is keeping her at home phone job, but talks about getting a work outside the home job to move around more. She will not be filing for disability. She will not become the governments responsibility and need a caretaker. Kratom has helped her so much, gave her a life back and I think it could help so many more people who may not even know about it. WHY it is even being considered as a drug is beyond me. I even tried a bit and it doesn't have any drug effects that I can tell. My wife seems normal and is back to her old self. I have never seen a drug induced side effect in her (such as NEVER , any hallucinations, paranoia, withdrawals etc) She still has some bad days and Kratom doesn't make everyday tolerable for her, but where nothing else helped, it sure has given her a manageable life back. Please keep it legal and a rightful choice. Thank You.

I am a 24 year old white male with a college degree and a full time job. In the early years of college my girlfriend and I started using her leftover oxycodone after her surgery. It took about a year but after that we were full addicts. As I went through college my addiction got worse and I almost failed to graduate. After college I spent a year in the same city with my addiction in its worst stages. A friend introduced me to kratom, and it alone is the reason I am clean today. Kratom alleviated most of my withdrawal pains and made the experience much more bearable. To make a long story short, I am now nearly 2 years clean from opiates. I still have kratom around to help me out when I get cravings, and it works well to subside those. I have also been prescribed benzodiazepines for my social anxiety (for 3 years), and since taking kratom I have been able to reduce my dose of benzos by almost half. \n\nI want to emphasize that while I take kratom to alleviate craving symptoms and in place of benzodiazepines, kratom has never given me a \"high\".  There is a mood boost I would associate with caffeine. Kratom works to help my pain, my anxiety, and my cravings, but does not affect me physically or mentally the way opiates used to, or benzodiazepines can. I believe that having acces to kratom has the potential to save and improve thousands of lives. So many people die from overdoses in this country, and I feel that if they only knew about kratom, their situations can be greatly improved. \n\nI sincerely hope that all of this information is taken into account when you make your decision.\n\nThank you,\nWill Hooper","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15563","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Will Hooper","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nMy name is Nicholas Denomme.

I began using Kratom about 3 years ago as a pain aid. I had herniated a few discs in my lower spin and had severe pain. I was prescribed narcotics, oxycodone for the most part from my doctor. They worked for the pain but put me in a stupor and compromised my alertness. In addition I became dependent on them. After doing research I found people were using Kratom to avoid opiate pain killers and used it to temper the withdrawals of discontinuing them as well. I ordered a small quantity of different varietals and found one that seemed to work for my system and symptoms. I do not respond to Advil, Aspirin or Tylenol at all but Kratom will alleviate my pain easily. I suspect this herb is on the chopping block because it cuts out the need for be pharma who must be lobbying to have it labeled illegal in order to keep up their profits. I have used this for 3 years daily now and have had no side effects. I feel great as a result and if you go to my website you can see that I am a highly functional professional. I do not consider this a drug, I have experienced, pot and some other mild drugs in my past growing up in the 70s, I know what drinking is like and honestly this is nothing like a drug or drinking, I am fully alert on kratom never feel the need to take more and do not withdrawal from it. I have heard a couple news stories of people seeking medical attention from it but I suspect the ingested a version from a head shop somewhere that was not pure. If you do anything you should classify it as you would an herbal remedy like st johns wort and let it sell in cvs and whole foods, at least this way it will be pure. Get it passed through the FDA and approved, it beats this epidemic of opiate abuse we have in this country. \n\n\tAs a second thought. I am aware there are paraphernalia shops out there selling Kratom in pre-packaged capsules. I have purchased some of these and suspect they are not what they claim to be. I have almost always purchased my Kratom from one source online in bulk and made my own capsules. I think the various street shops selling Kratom packets dont know what they are selling. I suspect these store bought items are mixed with other things such as synthetic marijuana and such. I do not do drugs and have disliked any I tried, this herb is NOT harmful at all. I have heard of people overdosing and having issues needing medical attention. I cant imagine this being caused by Kratom, I am sure there is something else going on causing this reaction. \n\n\tI would suggest looking at it as an herbal supplement like Ginko, Ginseng and some of the other bottled herbs sold in Whole Foods etc, this is how Kratom should be treated. It is far far far weaker than any NyQuil product in terms of sedation, far less intoxicating than alcohol, and even less dangerous than aspirin. It is an herb with digestive benefits as well. I have no doubt that it has some properties that make the user feel a little happier, but why on earth would you consider that a problem. I have consumed and average of 40 grams a month daily for the last few years, if there were any side effects I would know it by now. Please dont take this away from me, my only other option is a combination of anti-anxiety medication, depression medication and pain killers. I have taken those too before Kratom and they ruined my life and relationships, they are highly addictive and impossible to stop  taking. Xanax is the worst, Wellbutrin and Effexor withdrawals made me want to die, opiate pain killers are mind numbing and zap my energy. Kratom is the perfect solution for all of these things, it is far less potent, not dependent and kind on the system. \n\n\tPlease do not take this one thing away from me that helps me get through my day. \n\n\nAll my best,\n\nCHRISTOPHER K KOLK\nwww.christopherkolk.com\nckolk@mac.com\n917-673-4091","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16779","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"christopher kolk","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Evan Dean Whipple.

I am a 49 year old Mom of two teenagers. I don't drink, smoke and have never done drugs of any sort. I have Fibromyalgia and have been struggling with it for over 15 years.  I have seen many doctors that have given me a lot of different prescriptions i.e.: Trazadon, Elavil, Neurontin, Lyrica, Cymbalta, Prozac, Hydrocodone, Dilauded, Morphin. At one point I was on 9 different prescriptions at the same time. Prior to getting sick I never even took an aspirin and now here I was on 9 STRONG prescriptions that did absolutely nothing for my pain but wrecked HAVOC on my body.  A couple of years ago I came across a discussion about Kratom in one of my Fibromyalgia support groups. I was interested in finding out more about it because I have tried over the years to find a natural remedy for my pain. Something that would allow me to function, go to work, be active again. I researched it for over a year. I wanted to make sure that what I was taking is not going to change me. I did not want to be HIGH or not in control of my senses. In July 2015 I ordered some Kratom for the first time. I really was not expecting it to work because I have tried other things that were supposed to work and didn't. I took 1/2 teaspoon of Kratom with some Orange juice and within 15 minutes I have felt relief. I felt almost normal again. There was no HIGH feeling or anything. I just felt BETTER. My flares subsided for the first time in years. I have since stopped taking all my prescription medications and only take Kratom as a supplement for my Fibromyalgia. It makes me feel human again. It doesn't cure me or make the pain go away completely but I can function again and go about my day. I go to work and take care of my family. I strongly oppose making Kratom a schedule 1 drug. Please do your research. Take a very close look at this amazing plant.  Take the time to see how this is helping millions of people like me.  If Kratom becomes illegal I don't even know how to explain how devastating this would be to me.  I know that I will not be able to continue to work which would be an extreme hardship on our family. We are not rich people.  We need both incomes. I don't want to become disabled again. I want to work. Please research Kratom.

There is a move right now by the DEA to emergency schedule Kratom (an herbal supplement, that contains no synthetics)  as a schedule 1 controlled substance. Schedule 1 is the most restrictive category claiming no medicinal value. That is simply not true.  \nKratom has been used safely throughout the world for hundreds of years as a natural pain reliever, and mild mood elevator (for me, it is like coffee without the jitters).  This product allows those with chronic pain to choose the unadulterated leaves of a plant (instead of a narcotic) to eliminate pain.  \nI am a 50 year old woman, a productive citizen, currently going back to school to get my Master's Degree in clinical mental health counseling.  I have 3 years of recovery from addiction to pain medication, after an auto accident damaged my spine, and caused permanent nerve damage.  I can't take narcotics.  Over the counter pain meds don't work for me.   Kratom helped give me my life back and is helping tens of thousands of people in the U.S. to avoid narcotics during an opioid epidemic. \nPlease consider the thousands of us who would prefer to take an herbal supplement over taking vicodin, morphine, dilaudid, oxycodone, heroin! I don't want to become a felon for purchasing an herbal product.  This product does not make me high.  I am not a drug and alcohol user.

I am a 36 year old mother of 2 ( one of whom is autistic and the other who is also special needs).I have struggled myself with chronic pain and multiple medical issues since childhood and things have progressed over the years.I have Hurleys stage III hidradenitis suppurativa with scarring over %40 of my body..Painful lesions and scar tissue and problems at time with mobility.I also suffer from agoraphobia and anxiety because of this..I had disfiguring scarring that people tend to gawk at and it has made me become a hermit.I also suffer from degenerative disc disease,spinal stenosis,and was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia 3 years ago..I have been to more Doctors and taken more prescriptions than I can count.I have tried many different alternative treatments.and went to specialists.Most of the medications caused horrible side effects making it hard to function,work, or have the ability to be a the mother I want to be.I found Kratom while researching natural means to manage my symptoms.I researched for months on the internet until actually deciding to try.When I finally decided to try within a week I started to feel relief.I felt less pain a little energy and anxiety relief.I was finally feeling normal and without the fogginess and drugged feeling that pharmaceutical gave me.I simply drink a tea a few times a day instead of countless prescriptions.I was able to return to work for the first time in 3 years!!.It doesn't make you \"high\".It doesn't make you hallucinate,or make bad choices,,so how is it being called a drug?  Kratom is not dangerous and is much safer than most all prescriptions I myself have taken.I believe that I should be able to choose a natural plant over man made chemicals.Kratom is NOT dangerous..It is NOT a synthetic drug.Making this plant illegal would be nothing but harmful..thousands of lives will be effected,and not only will the lives of the people who utilize this plant to manage symptoms of various medical issues, you would be effecting the lives of their children,of their spouses,their employers, their friends and other loved ones.Please do not make this plant a schedule1.It would be irresponsible and harmful to take away something who has benefited so many people.

This would put kratom -- a plant consumed safely in the U.S for decades and world-wide for millennia, and one that helps millions of people -- on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. This makes no sense to me as I have been taking kratom for almost two year and have been healthy in all aspects of my life. I am an owner of a successful small business and am motivated on a daily basis. Kratom has assisted me in this motivation and keeps me in a great mood. Before kratom I had high anxiety and it was so bad to the point in which I had to get counseling. Once I started taking kratom my anxiety went down and has stayed down immensely. I have been taking the same dosage for the 2 years that I have been taking kratom and have never felt the need to take more. Kratom comes from the same family as the caffeine tree and from my personal experience has similar effects to this. My main question is if caffeine can be legal and socially accepted then why are we rushing to put such a high illegal status to another plant from the same family without further researching it. Making it illegal will prevent any further research from being able to be conducted. These alkaloids have been shown to work in a similar method as opiods without the HIGHLY dangerous effects of respiratory depression or physical addiction (which leads to heavily dangerous withdraws when coming off of). Looking at the situation from a 3rd person view makes the scheduling of this plant appear completely absurd and unproductive. The scheduling of this plant is unfair to the people and will lead to even more distrust in our already distrusted government.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14946","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Brandi. I am 33 years old and have chronic pain and autoimmune disorders. I found out about kratom in in May of 2014. I was heading down a road to death by prescription pain pills. When I had ran out and knew that the withdrawal would start, I knew what to expect. While searching for relief, I found kratom. I drink kratom tea to help relieve symptoms. It does not alter my mind in any way. It is nothing like the opiates that I used to take. Those were highly addictive and caused severe withdrawal. I was able to get off the narcotic pain meds, which eventually would have caused liver failure, Kratom literally saved my life. Not just  mine. It also saved my 53 year old mother's life.Kratom has given me my life back. My kids have their mother again. I will not, no matter what, go back to the pharmaceuticals again. Kratom relieves my symptoms in the same way that coffee (caffeine) drinkers feel more awake. Kratom is a tea that benefits me in many ways. For many, the loss of kratom would send them back to the drugs that will kill them. Many of those addicts are parents. Taking kratom tea away would literally kill people. Pharmaceuticals are legal and kill about 78 people per day (with just opioids alone). Kratom is not a man-made alternative drug. Kratom is nothing like synthetic marijuana, spice, or bath salts. Those are man-made drugs that kill. Kratom is saving lives. Not destroying them. Kratom is a natural botanical that has been used for thousands of years.I strongly oppose the DEA putting kratom on any lists of illicit drugs. It is not a drug. Kratom should be readily available, it is safe, effective and will prevent addiction and overdose. Kratom should not be placed on any schedules for illegal drugs. It does NOT belong to that category of dangerous, abused drugs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4409","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandi Lewis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to strongly ask you not to make kratom a scheduled drug.

Since I started taking kratom years ago, when I have been taking classes, I have shown up almost every day. And for the first year ever, actually was able to obtain six 4.0s and a 3.9, 3.6 and a 3.2 in the 9 classes I took in the last year I took of college to prove it. I no longer experience the extreme anxiety that has plagued my life. \n\nIf kratom becomes an illegal substance, I have no idea what I'll do. As I see it, I'll have two options, neither are good. \n1. Seek out a psychiatrist for highly addictive benzodiazepines, which come with far more side effects and are far more dangerous, having a much lower LD50. \nor \n2. Seek illegal opiates, which needless to say, would also be highly addictive and also come with more side effects and a MUCH lower LD50 making them far more dangerous. \n\nOption number 2 might be likely for me, seeing as I'm already prescribed a controlled substance for ADHD and psychiatrists are very hesitant at prescribing controlled substances to begin with. \nBut it is far more likely for those without health insurance. Regardless, neither is a positive outcome.\n\nWhat's great about kratom, is since I've been taking it, I have never had to increase the dose once since I've started it. I have increased the frequency with which I dose, but I've found if I hit a certain dose, I become a bit nauseous. This is a widely reported symptom of taking too much kratom. And while not lethal, highly discourages the increase of dosage. I have a few friends who have hit that point and never increased the dose beyond it. \n\nIt also doesn't appear to be highly addictive, as I've given friends samples of it, who have then tried it several other times, but no longer take it (to my knowledge). In fact, one of my friends I gave a sample to, actually used it to get off of his 2+ year addiction to morphine (I don't know how long he had been addicted to it, but I know it had been at least for a few years). His addiction had even led him to call the suicide hotline at one point.\nWhen he told me about the withdrawals, I mentioned that kratom might be able to help with that since it has opiate-like properties, only it comes with far less withdrawal symptoms. I've personally taken breaks from it for 2 weeks-a month after taking it daily and the only withdrawal symptoms I had ever felt were a mild tingling feeling in my head for the first two days and slight restless leg syndrome for a week or two (but nothing that an aspirin and a dose of melatonin couldn't help with).\nIn fact, I've found caffeine withdrawal to be far less tolerable (massive headaches and depression the first few days, with fatigue, insomnia and constipation for 2-3 weeks). \nTwo weeks after my friend had switched to kratom, he was free of his addiction and even stopped taking kratom as well. That was beyond what I was expecting, I had assumed he would just substitute his morphine addiction with kratom and possibly relapse back to morphine on multiple occasions (similar to what I've seen with friends and coworkers who have switched from cigarettes to E-cigs and vaporizers). \nI will provide my contact information in case you wish to speak with that friend. \n\nIf kratom is put on the scheduled substance list, there's no doubt in my mind that it will lead to far more cases of the already epidemic levels of opiate addiction in this country. It will only snatch away or make it much harder to obtain the best alternative (as far as I know) to quitting opiates, seeing as methadone is also highly addictive and comes with the same withdrawal symptoms as opiates and opiate blockers interrupt a person's life and can lead to a person relapsing again, as it shoots a person straight into the peak of withdrawal. \n\nIf kratom even becomes a schedule 2 or schedule 3, it will take years of FDA testing and marketing before it would become prescribed as a medication (and seeing as it's a plant, I'm not sure it could become a medication? Don't have enough knowledge on that part of it.). \nBy making substances that are far safer to opiates illegal to consume, it only leads people who already have a predisposition to drug abuse and people like me who suffer from anxiety to seek out more accessible and cheaper substances. And in this case, the only more accessible and cheaper alternatives to kratom that act on opioid receptors are prescription opiates or heroin. \n\nThank you for hearing me and the public out on this important issue!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7140","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Knowlton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a beautiful plant that helps so many.

I was in a couple motor vehicle accidents while away for college about 15 years ago. My name is Sarah  and born and raised on the Island of Kauai. I have had great parents and older brothers . My Mother was from Michigan and is  Retired  teacher and my Father is Hawaii born and a retired Union Carperter  and a Pilot for the Civil Air Patrol. I was raised right , to be kind to all,  to  follow society's laws and just be a kind responsible person.I recycle everything that I can to help our children have a better tomorrow. I do active volunteer beach clean ups as it is very much needed at some beaches in the and areas  and  I am a contributing member of society and do Outreach Clinics for people who have  trouble with hearing.\n I have never been convicted of any crimes, I currently have a license to purchase firearms to go  Hunting with my Dad and Brothers which requires an in depth  background check in all areas mentally and criminally.\n  My Jobs consist of working with peoples personal financial portfolios  and that too require crystal clean background checks .\nMy current and regular 9-5 job position,  I work with many patients from young to old  in the Hearing Health Industry. I  work with very highly confidential paperwork  and with many officials that help run our state in different areas and I am trusted and take this job very, very seriously. \nI am pleading to you , Our Drug Enforcement Agency  to please just allow time for Scientist to catch up and do more testing of this  herb before it is banned .  There has been ZERO  Deaths  that is in result of Kratom alone. The Kratom Association ran by Susan Ash hired a  neutral independent toxicologist to review the cases they found with Kratom and confirmed that it was mixed with other drugs and therefore cannot rule that it was because of Kratom alone.  If this is the reason why , than we need to ban Alcohol and tobacco use since that causes much more deaths hourly than Kratom has in years.\nCurrently there are  different University's and Hospitals that are  showing  definite potential for Kratom  at helping with opiate withdrawals which can either reduce the use of very strong pharmaceuticals such as suboxone and methadone. If anything Methadone alone should be on a schedule 1 drug because of how many Americans are so physically and mentally hurt by it but it is only a Schedule 2 . We  couldn't get anyone to help our family friend get into a rehab because that was what he was addicted to and no one would take him in due to liabilities and lack of equipment to help him detoxify  safely. He needed to fly to California to do so and it cost  a lot of money for a single income family due to his addiction to Opiates and Methadone.  He was brought to life repeatedly and it is a travesty that we are doing this to a herb that has been around for centuries that can help us with the deaths from opiates by allowing people to help their addictions and use Kratom to taper versus Methadone which addicts mix with Benzodiapines  and then never get off drugs.  In Alabama , after they banned Kratom the deaths on opiates jumped up close to around 15,000 more deaths than the previous year.\nFor my pain relief  , with just a 1/2 tsp of Kratom 2 x a day , eliminated my use of Prescription Drugs and has definitely helped bring some happiness and blues skies to my days. It has changed my life and I believe Saved and Saves my life. When on strong pain relievers you no longer feel, you body and brain is shut down to so much beauty this world has to offer and I beg that you take a look at this and see how many people this helps. I am blessed to have the pain I have because while reading everyone else's testimonials , I feel blessed  that this is all I have to live with compared to other people.  Sad but so true.  Some people cannot even get out of bed even with their Prescribed Prescriptions  because of their diseases  but Kratom allows them to get up and live and be parents and teachers. Bottom  line We need your  help.\nThank you so much for allowing me to share my Kratom Story. I was not going to share it  but I feel that I too need to do my part and help put this subject in the light so it just doesn't disappear and lose its chance to save more lives. \nSincerely,\nSarah ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6163","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I research opioid use and addiction.

I am a 42 year-old wife and mother from North Carolina. I am a good person. I do not do illegal drugs and I do not abuse prescription medications. I suffer from both social anxiety and general anxiety. I am on an SSRI medicine, which helps but only marginally. It is difficult for me to go to crowded places like a mall or event. Even going grocery shopping is difficult to do with my anxiety issues. I used to take Xanax, which although did a great job with controlling my anxiety, I did not like how it made me feel when it wore off. And it was difficult to find a doctor who would prescribe it for prolonged use. I was ok with that because I was afraid of the addiction stories I had heard of with benzos. So until I found kratom about a year ago, I was a recluse. Now, I can function much better. I can go get groceries like a normal wife. I can go out in public. I have no addiction issues. When I sometimes have to go awhile without it, I am fine. This plant has saved my life in a natural way without negative side effects or threat of dependence. I am a middle-aged, conservative woman who can only speak with positivity about kratom. Please do not take this plant away from us. I don't want to end up where I was a year ago so overwhelmed with my anxiety that I am a prisoner in my home. I can't understand why this plant is being threatened.

Kratom has helped me in many ways and it has not affected my work, my personal life, my family life or my financial life. I suffer from depression and bipolar type 2 disorder. I have tried many prescriptions and I didn't like the side effects that I received from them. So I decided to take this problem into my own hands and find a solution. I came across kratom, and my life has been changed for the better. That is something you will be taking away from the people. Being able to find your own answers and solutions to your problems. If you schedule every plant or chemical that has healing properties (which kratom surely does have) then you give us no choice other than going to the doctor and take artificial prescriptions that don't work near as well as the natural plants that God generously put on this earth for EVERYBODY to use. Please do not take away this right from us. I am concerned about what I might do if kratom is scheduled. I do not want to take anymore prescriptions and I don't want to do illegal substances but I need something to help my disorder. This puts me between a rock and a hard place. Please do not do this to me and the thousands perhaps millions of others who benefit from this naturally wonderful plant. I understand that you want to benefit from this yourselves, but making it illegal is just absurd in my humble opinion. People deserve the right to self medicate when they have the knowledge and know how to do it safely. I urge you to please reconsider. I am not a bad guy. I am not a drug addict.

These surgeries allowed me to walk but with great deal of pain. For years I was taking so many pain killers including prescription pain medications which was prescribed by my doctor to cope with the chronic pain. Unfortunately over time you develop tolerance to the medication and must regularly increase the dose to get any relief. Really a horrible way to live your life while trying to be a good father, good husband, and good productive citizen. A friend of mine recommended I try Kratom to deal with my pain instead of relying on pain meds, (over the counter or prescribed), and fortunately I did. It really changed my life, as I have not taken any other medications ever since. I have been pain free and without using any pain killers for the past 5 years. The best part, and unlike the confused state while you are taking pain meds, you are fully alert, and functional. I am now pain free, and back being a good dad, and good husband. I am also back doing the things I enjoy best such as racing cars & bikes on track which I had to stop due to pain and also would not do while being under the influence of strong pain medications. Not sure why anyone think Kratom is a drug.... anyone has any doubts, why don't you try it first before making an uninformed decision. For me, drinking Coffee is probably much stronger than taking Kratom. Never felt any mood alterations, or any high, or loss of any control and I am an individual who gets wasted after consuming 1 or 2 beers. I heard the reason you are trying to ban it because someone overdosed on Kratom. Really hard for me to believe that, but I guess anything is possible. If you consume 100 cups of coffee you probably die from a heart attack. If you consume 50 bears you probably die of alcohol poisoning. Hell if you take 10 Tylenol pills, your liver can fail and you can die. Does that mean, you ban coffee or regulate it. Common on ....you want to ban, the one & only product that allows you to break your dependency of pain medications which should be banned as they are dangerous to our citizens. I think if you ban Kratom you will end up sending many people like myself back to using pain medications which are very harmful and dangerous for you. Please think before you act and please try Kratom before you doom it and before believing the drug companies who would love to claim us back into their addiction world.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21373","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Moses Qundil","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"TO WHOM I MAY CONCERN: \n\nI want to peacefully tell you (DEA and other ignorant folks), that your considerations for deciding to even place this herbal remedy as a scheduled substance is absurd. I wish I could speak without silence. However, I am an officer in the United States Military, likewise, a physician that holds a DEA license to prescribe schedule II and lower medication ,and this medication is guilty by association because it has been found in the past in the same places as spice.  I can tell you hold-heartedly that kratom is no different than your cup of coffee. In the past I have had behavior issues (ADHD) and anxiety.  As time has passed, the sitting and standing in contorted positions in the workplace has done a number on my back and knees. I am tired of poisoning my kidneys and liver with NSAIDS and tylenol to get through my day. I had no interest to become a slave to big pharma narcotics and wasn't allowed to join the cult of medical marijuana do to my job. Which never sat right with me anyway. What I have noticed with this substance is I no longer drink coffee, nor do I drink alcohol, and I do not think I have ever more \"even keel\" as I am now. It is safe, almost self-regulating. you consume too much you vommit and you don't feel like any for a few days. If you decide to mix with alcohol you will projectile vommit. when discontinuing after a long period of use. It's like quitting cofffee. You don't feel right, but you can still work without consequence.  Reaction times are not decreased, and if anything, you have greater focus. Pretty much, drinking coffee without being jittery, with the added benefit of equal analgesia of taking 800mg motrin and 500mg tylenol. Oh wait, thats right, it's related to the coffee plant. hmmm I don't see you trying to regulate bayer aspirin, JnJ,  or SBUX. So why why would you want to take something away that can help people live normal lives, gives them green anti-oxidants, and much less heptotoxic and nephrotoxic than your OTC's? Don't hate what you don't understand. Moreover, the science looks promising. and finally there will always be people that ruin a good thing. Everything is a drug/substance that can hurt you if taken in excess. This is includes oxygen, food vitamins and even water.   There will always be some knucklehead out there trying to sniff glue or drink a bottle of robotussin  to get a rush and for those people, why save them?

Even if you were to attribute the few suicides that have been linked to kratom, you would be ignoring the full graveyards of those who have taken their own lives while on SSRIs and other legally prescribed psychoactive medications. Please consider your actions. An all encompassing ban on kratom could have severe, damaging consequences in real peoples lives. I have tried kratom a handful of times and it's more innocuous than any of the hyperbolic accounts, and I have been prescribed vicodin on several occasions. These two substances are not even within the same league. By pushing for schedule 1 status you would also prevent research in to a very promising substance that has the potential to help millions of people. This ban would have severe and lasting consequences. People have been safely using this plant for well over a thousand years while there were over 47000 overdoses on opioids in 2014 alone according to the CDC. I am an upstanding citizen and I stand against this insane action.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15439","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Samuel Cochran","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Since discovering Kratom, I have gotten off the streets looking for pain killers and h.

I suffer from moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and lethargy (probably due to the other two).  I also have had tendonitis since my teens and began developing arthritis in my back, along with severe IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) in my early 20's.  Needless to say I sought relief from myriads of different solutions, from cannabis (lived in California after high school) to muscle relaxers and antidepressants from my doctor. Well, the antidepressants nearly ruined my life in a few different ways (causing blackouts, etc.) but when I found kratom it was like a coffee that also fixes my other ailments.  I no longer needed any antidepressants, no cardio-toxic NSAIDs, I just had a cup of tea in the morning and 1-2 in the evenings and all of those ailments went away.  Kratom can be somewhat habit forming, but much less so than pharmaceuticals, and the \"withdrawal\" effects are incredibly mild and easily masked with over the counter items.  The same cannot be said for any of the other remedies I tried (except NSAIDs of course).  Kratom has allowed me to be more present in life and does not get me \"high.\"  it is comparable to a strong cup of coffee (no jitters) or if i take a large dose, similar to kava kava or valerian - something no one would ever try to illegalize if they understood.  Just because kratom can (in certain doses) interact with the opioid system does not put it in league with what we call opioids- that's like saying valerian root or lemon balm are as bad as liquor, xanax, or GHB - that's obviously a fallacy.\n\nPlease do not ban this substance.  I have seen people quit debilitating drug habits, opioids and others, with this herb, and though it may sound like switching one vice for another, I assure you it is not.  If something helps you but doesnt interfere with your life the way \"real drugs\" do, it's time to put it on the pile with coffee and valerian root.  You can bet opioid use will sky-rocket in the event of a kratom ban.  That's not a threat - i hate opioids as do many other kratom users, but it's just a fact that some folks require it to keep from relapsing into actual drug addiction.  Please consider all of these factors before making your decision.\n\nI dont think anyone is opposed to some light regulation: manufacturing standards, extract quality/potency standards and/or limits, and age restriction.  Just please allow responsible adults the freedom to consume something other than coffee or synthetic pharmaceuticals ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6778","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Abertooth Lincoln","postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban kratom.

In college I had two unrelated surgeries 4 months apart (broken bone repair and appendicitis). I was prescribed 40 hydrocodone for the first surgury and with the first day of taking the medication I felt myself falling in love with the high. It was unlike anything else I had ever experienced. Prior to this I had hardly used any narcotic substances other than alcohol. I weaned myself off the pills so that I could still function in course work but I would still take them recreationally. I had even looked into buying extra pills off of a friend however before I made the purchase, I got appendicitis and was given a 50 pill prescription for oxycodone. The feeling was even better than the hydrocodone but the cravings were stronger. It scared me that my first thought in the mornings would be to take a pill to get that high back. I had the self awareness to realize what was happening and quit but the cravings for the opiate high still persisted. I was eventually shown Kratom by a friend who had used it to kick their own opiate cravings. It was perfect. Kratom took off the edge of cravings while still allowing me to function and best of all, when it wore off I didn't feel any cravings for it or opiates. \n\nI hardly crave opiates anymore and only use Kratom once a month or less, mostly for pain.  Kratom is simply something that sits on my shelf that I take occasionally to curb residual opiate cravings (That are much rarer since discovering kratom) or for injuries from sports. It doesn't impair my ability to function and I can still study after taking it. Kratom saved me from falling victim to opiate cravings and addiction from pills I was given legally.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21949","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To the DEA, pertaining to the legal and unrestricted sale of Kratom, which contains mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. My name is John Ellison. I am a Print Production Specialist, and live in Manchester, CT. I am 61 years old. I am being treated of an Anxiety disorder, chronic neck pain (due to a broke neck in 1997), and chronic knee pain due the the destruction of my left knee resulting from a catastrophic fall. I discovered Kratom when I thought about taking up smoking and to start drinking again (after over 10 years of abstinence) after several unfortunate events that caused a series of panic attacks and resulted in pain increase in my neck and knee. While in the smoke shop I noticed Kratom on their shelves and asked about it. They gave me a web address to look at, since they were not sure themselves about what Kratom could do for me. I followed up with the research and decided to try it. The results were astonishing; pain in my neck and knee subsided; my urge to drink and smoke disappeared; my high anxiety dwindled and I felt more mentally energetic, with a strangely positive outlook. Since there was no other reason to suspect all of these results from medication (I am not on depression medication), I had to believe it was the Kratom. I have decided to make Kratom part of a healthy lifestyle and I am VERY grateful that I did not return to drinking. In closing I have to say the the mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine in Kratom does not feel like a drug, nor does it have the negative side effects that come with even an over the counter pain medication. Also, it does not have the negative side effects of depression medication, or alcohol. Kratom should remain widely available to the public as an uncontrolled herbal alternative. I am actually pleading with you not to make it a schedule 1 controlled substance. I have included the web links I referred to when researching Kratom for my own use:\nensobotanicals.com/kratom/\nwww.greenleafkratom.com/kratom-strains-explained/\n\nIn closing; Kratom has provided me with safe pain and anxiety relief. There is nothing else like it that does not carry negative side effects. Please keep it legal and available.\n\nSincerely,  John Ellison","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1709","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Ellison","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"PLEASE, DON'T take away what's needed most as a dietary supplement\nTo the PEOPLE of the US. \nThis is a wonderful plant that helps many people someday you may need it or somebody in your family may find it useful.

My name is Dawn Grace.  I have a Masters Degree in Community Counseling.  I also have done case management in the mental health field.  I have never been accused or been found guilty of a crime.  I have never taken illegal substances.  I am a mother of two wonderful young adults.  I chose to add Kratom as a daily regimen about 2 1/2 years ago.  It took me over 9 months of research and asking questions to determine to try it.  I have Fibromyalgia,  Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression and a multitude of health issues.  The prescribed medications and other vitamins/herbs and supplements/plants I had tried did not give me the results I needed.  Due to severe pain, fatigue and other symptoms I am unable to work and I wanted to at least be able to do small chores and interact with my family basically do things people can take for granted.  None of the prescribed medications or other vitamins/herbs and supplements/plants were able to do that.  Kratom allows me to have a semblance of life.  I can do things we take for granted such as get out of bed, take a shower, read a book, watch TV with my family, do small chores when my body allows it, take a 10 minute walk, drive my car to store for a quick in and out for an item, decreased my depression and so many other things.  I still cannot work but at least I can do something.  I have never had any side effects from Kratom.  I do not have any withdrawals if I choose not to take Kratom. To see if I would have any withdrawals after taking Kratom for six months I stopped for two weeks.  I had no withdrawal symptoms.  I have never been addicted to any substance including alcohol or cigarettes.  Kratom was able to give me some life back and if I hadn't gotten any results I would have stopped taking it.  There is no danger to the public with Kratom.  It's a natural plant not a synthetic.  It is not a drug.  I use plants, herbs, vitamins, and essential oils for my daily regimen.  Essentially Kratom gave me hope when there was none.  I am no longer considering ending my life because I couldn't handle my symptoms from my illnesses and the many losses I have had in my life since becoming ill.  I would like the opportunity to continue to use plants for my health.  Thank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3380","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dawn Grace","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"i just wanted to say that I had only discovered Kratom towards the end of 2013 when I was at my worst physically and Mentally. I have worked in factories and on assembly lines for years and had been diagnosed with severe carpel tunnel in both wrist and Socratic  arthritis in my right knee from years of repetitive motion. I had moved back in with my parents to help take care of my Father who was a navy veteran and suffering from leukemia. The job I had was repetitive motion for 12 hrs a day and it got to the point where I would wake up in the middle of the night crying  because of my hands drawing up. A co worker of mine who was a recovering addict (pills) had told me about how Kratom saved his life and that it might help me so I tried it and withing a couple of weeks i could perform as usual with no pain and no side affects. My Father was on numerous medications and narcotics and i was able to get him to try it as well and it not only worked for him but he slept more peacefully and was more aware and could pay more attention when spoken to. This has been used for thousands of years over seas and i just wanted to say that not everything is about money or getting a buzz or getting high. I know Police officers and Veterans who take this as well as Nurses and caregivers. please reconsider the ban as people should have a choice and if that choice is choosing Kratom over narcotics or taking it to kill an addiction. It very well may save their life. Nobody that I know that takes Kratom does so to get \"high\" they do it to improve the quality of their life. I have never had any side effects besides some slight constipation nor have i felt a withdraw from not taking it for a couple of days. Please look more into this as things we don't understand do not always have a arterial motive. Sometime we discover thing that do wonders and create miracles in peoples lives and I think Kratom is one of those thing.

I've suffered from several low back pain and bulging discs for years which worsened significant you after having my daughter 2 years ago. The stress of lifting her frequently led me to be in pain on a daily basis which started affecting  my daily life. Not only was it difficult to work and be on my feet all day, but the worst part was I felt like I wasn't being a good mom to my daughter. The pain exhausted me, made me depressed and was too severe for me to play with my daughter the way I wanted to. She would come to me as I laid on the couch, exhausted and in agonizing pain, and ask me get up. And I couldn't because it hurt too much. In months of researching relief methods and seeing a spine doctor I kept coming across discussions of Kratom. I finally decided to give it a try. It has been a miracle. I feel more normal than Ive felt in years. Just a teaspoon of the powder and I feel like I have a young spine again. I'm COMFORTABLE which I haven't been able to say in a long time. Prior to trying Kratom I had been prescribed tramadol which worked well but I wanted something that didn't require an Rx. I am a nursing student and work AND take care of my daughter. I am confident I wouldn't be able to accomplish everything I do in a say without relief and the Kratom has changed my life. I'm a better student, employee, wife and most of all I'm a better mom. For the first time since she was born I am nearly pain free and I'm so glad I finally tried this product. My quality of life is back. I really hope not to lose this resource, I desperately dont want to go back to prescription pain meds.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0938","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Janelle Alexander","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom needs more research before you can give it a schedule 1 classification.

I'm writing to plead that Kratom remains legal. After I went through a terrible divorce I went into a major depression. The kind where you don't get out of bed to even go to work. My family begged me to go to the dr so I finally did. This started the guessing game of anti depressants. I have been diagnosed with major depression, anxiety, and ADD. After trying at least 6 different meds my dr gave up and sent me to a psychiatrist. He wanted to put me on high powered narcotics-one including suboxone. I was naive & wasn't told this was to treat addiction & that he was prescribing it \"off label\" for depression. I just wanted to feel better. After a couple month on it my insurance changed & I couldn't afford the $400 script so I quit. I thought I was depressed before. Ha! I went through 3 full months of withdrawal from this \"cure\" and was ready to end my life. I thought suicidal people were just attention seekers until I felt the pain of feeling the black hole inside & feeling like I didn't deserve to live. Then i found Kratom. After my first dose I felt a little sparkle of hope inside. After the 2nd day I went outside for the first time in months. I have a life thanks to Kratom. I'm back to work, paying taxes, contributing to society, & am finally back to myself. Please don't take this from us. I have made new friends by joining Kratom forums & we are like family now. Scheduling Kratom would be devastating. Addiction rates, depression rates, anxiety, all would skyrocket. We can't give this wonderful natural plant to Big Pharma. They will make it unaffordable & out of reach to the ones who need it most.\nThanks for the consideration,\nJenny Brown","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11837","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jenny Brown","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"please keep your hands and noses off kratom.  you are not the lackeys of the drug companies.  you work for us.  now go mind your own business and stop creating problems where none exists.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19225","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"craig casey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I know of two individuals greatly assisted by using kratom and able to reduce the amount of prescription drugs by half or more.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4969","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Diana Buckley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA\n\nI am writing you this letter in hopes that in time of so much government controversy that your agency does not to it with the current kratom ban.

I do not think that it is right for substances that could possibly help me have a life again to be taken away. I live in Utah and of course I don't have cancer,  or some other disease that is painful and killing you, so I can't even try medical marijuana. If I could afford to move to Colorado, I would do it in an instant. But I'm stuck here with no life because I can't do anything because of the pain I've tried injections, chiropractic work, rehabilitation,  orthopedics,  I have tried so much and I just want the choice to try something God put on this Earth.  I took methadone for almost 10 years trying to help my pain and all it did is cause other medical problems. These natural plants and herbs are God's way to help us and I beg that you please let God do his bidding. Please, I ask you to help end this ridiculous war on drugs and help more children have parents to raise them, which statistics show bring up better, less violent and angry children, helping to make our world better. Even if you do not believe in a higher power, it still makes more sense to end this expensive, pointless war on \"drugs!\"\nI hope you really read this, if so, I thank you from the bottom of my heart!\nJeniffer Hullinger\nUtah resident.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19324","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeniffer Hullinger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't think the DEA should make Kratom a schedule one drug.

I witnessed how difficult it was for him to be in the process of recovering as well as trying to focus on work, because he was not able to get disability.  He also was in between insurance providers for about 2 months after his last surgery.  It was not really possible for him to get perscription medication, so we researched herbal alternatives.  We were able to get Kratom from a local shop and it honestly was the only reason he was able to function during those months.  He would take Kratom on days to manage pain on the days it was very acute post-surgery.  Some days he would not need it, and never noticed any adverse effects from not being on the drug.  Since then, he takes a dosage every so often when the pain flares up, because he is still in recovery.  He does not get woozy or notice any side-effects, in the way that prescription pain medication affects him.  We have also been able to let some of his aging relative dealing with chronic pain try some, and it has proven very helpful to manage pain without being on a prescription.  Kratom is simply a very effective herbal remedy for pain, and is such a tremendous help for people who do not need prescription medication to manage pain.

Before seeking traditional treatment, Kratom was his first defense against withdrawals. Although many may dispute Kratom is addicting itself, the withdrawals are on par with caffeine withdrawals. In other words, this is not a dangerous drug. In fact, it has numerous health benefits when used appropriately and for certain conditions like pain relief. Kratom certainly does not fit in with the proposed scheduling. If you do a quick youtube search of people on Kratom, you'll find that they are completely themselves. I'm sure you've probably seen Kratom users in public and not noticed. This is because it is not psychoactive. At best, it's a mood enhancer.

I am currently waiting for 4 MORE surgeries and have multiple autoimmune disorder. My hips, ankles and hands hurt all the time. My back hurts on a regular basis even though I had corrective surgery and I have an autoimmune disorder called Cramp Fasciculation Syndrom. This is where all my muscles cramp randomly even when I am doing nothing but resting. It is extremely painful when it happens and I am left quite sore for days afterward even after I take my meds to reduce the spasms. I have brought this all up so you are aware of what I struggle with every day. I have pain medication that I can take, but they make me tired, grumpy and I can't concentrate very well. Kratom is a go to for me when I don't want to go through withdrawal and when I just need to take the edge off my pain without doping myself up and ruining my entire day. It often will give some pain relief without the groggy, grumpy and unfocused side effects. Please don't take this away too. There are very few alternatives to pain killers, if any, for people like me. People that will always have to take something to reduce the chronic pain and Kratom can do that during my \"not so bad\" days. For me, although I will always be in some level of pain, having Kratom as an alternative is a God send. I don't have to take nearly as many pain killers and it makes me feel like I have a lot more days where I can feel \"normal\". Again, please don't take my alternative, often more safe for me and those around me, natural medicine away from me. It doesn't hurt anyone around me, it doesn't make me groggy, grumpy or spacey. I feel I should be able to buy Kratom just like I would buy willow bark for tea because it has the foundations of aspirin in it, or many others that help me, but have no affect on anyone else. So many options are taken away from the 'free' people when this should be a choice for me to take, not the government. If you're going to ban something or put limits on something or make it difficult to attain, do it on alcohol. Something that we can buy over the counter, but causes so many deaths...alcohol can deffinitely affect more than just one individual. If you're going to put anything into a class one, alcohol should go there, not Kratom. This just feels like another way that the government 'controls' how an individual wants to live in their daily lives. It makes me feel repressed and contolled. Like my decisions on how I treat myself are in the governments hands and not my own, where it SHOULD be. Let the American people choose how to live their own lives, the way it has always supposed to have been.

I have had these conditions for 10 years, so I  have tried everything to help my conditions. This is my story.\n\nI was prescribed Methadone, Oxycodone, Tramadol, Ambien,  Lexapro, Valium, Gabapentin, Simvastatin and Tramadol to be taken daily. This was just my most recent cocktail of toxic medications. I have been on every antidepressant and medications in the last 10 years.  I would sleep 14 hours a day most days, unable to do anything. I would fall asleep at the wheel driving 140 miles round trip to my pain management clinic. I had numerous car accidents because of the medication. I came down with a severe case of Palmar Plantar Pustulosis (PPP).  PPP is a form of Psorisis where you have pus filled blisters on your hands and feet. I had it on my feet so bad, that the blisters burst opened, oozed, cracked and bled. The blisters were even under my toenails. I could barley walk and when I could, I cried in pain.  I had this condition for 2 full years and had a add a Dermatologist to my monthly visit in the 140 mile trip.  Between my therapist, pain management doctor, dermatologist and all the medications listed earlier, plus the creams and pills for my feet, I was spending close to $300.00-$400.00 a month.\n\nDue to my health problems, I was fired in 2013 and had to file for disability.  In April 2015, I no longer had any insurance and could not afford new insurance. My pain management doctor basically wouldn't taper my medications unless I could pay the full office visit, which I could not. When I called my pain management Dr.'s office as I was worried going off all those toxic medications cold turkey would be dangerous, the office simply told me I would not die. My only option was to stop all the medications . \n\nGoing off all the opiate medications was unbearable. It was pure agony and I was seriously considering taking my life. I didn't sleep except for 2-3 hours a day for 3 full months.  The only thing at the time that was wonderful, was that after 2 weeks of stopping all medications, my feet completely cleared up and to this day PPP has not returned. My spouse and primary doctor were astonished and that led us to believe that  my PPP was due to all the toxic medications I had been on over the last years. My Fibromyalgia and other conditions returned full force.\n\nI found out about Kratom, a natural supplement in June 2015 on a Chronic Pain board after I told my story.  She private messaged me and gave me the information and I researched it and decided to give it a try.  If it hadn't been a natural plant, I would not have taken it. My spouse and myself were amazed at how well it worked  for me.  It gave me a clearer mind, eased my anxiety, pain and fatigue away for several precious hours and I started living again. I wasn't sleeping all the time, I wasn't so whacked out on pharmaceutical medications. The most I felt was the effects of a good cup of coffee. It eased my muscle pain so I could sleep at night without feeling as if I was sleeping on a bed of rocks and tossing and turning all night. It was also inexpensive and I could afford it. I have used the same amount as I had a year ago.  I could walk my dog without almost collapsing, I could spend time with family and friends again after not leaving the house for almost 3 years. It literally gave me my life back, as it has for so many others.\n\nPlease do not take away my quality of life by making Kratom any other thing except for what it is, a natural plant and supplement.  I do support keeping it for age 18 or 21 and older, however, I can't see any one wanting to use it for recreational purposes as it doesn't give the user any type of reward or high.  I also support taking it out of head shops, gas stations or any other retailer that promotes it as recreational.  I fully support keeping it online and through legitimate herbal and supplement businesses that follow guidelines. My greatest fear is that I will no longer have access to a supplement that gives me back my quality of life, lets me be with family or have the price marked up so much that I will no longer be able to afford it as both my spouse and myself are on Social Security and have limited funds.  \n\nThe economic fallout will also be great if Kratom is drastically changed from a supplement to banned substance. From the farmers in less fortunate countries to the mom and pop businesses that have put their life savings in chasing their dream and opening herbal store fronts or online businesses. We are also in an opioid epidemic that we are drastically losing, we cannot afford to have a plant related to the coffee plant placed in the same category as hard drugs.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJudy Steffen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10576","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Judy Steffen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My sister-in-law has benefited medically so much when using Keaton.

I've graduated college with a BA, I have an amazing job, I am getting married in 40 days, and I credit mostly all of my success to Kratom.

When I use kratom, I'm able to relax just a little bit and interact with people 'normally' without that awkward, creeping feeling that my anxiety brings on. Though it wasn't the original reason I tried kratom, I've found that the somewhat severe, sometimes debilitating, headaches I get can often be overcome by using kratom.

I have been taking kratom since I broke my foot a few years ago, and kratom has made the experience of my foot healing far more comfortable. I have foot pain that can make it very unpleasant to walk or climb a ladder, which are two things I must do for my very active job. I manage a warehouse with over $6 million dollars of inventory, and I need to be on my feet all day long in order to help my coworkers and myself flourish. Kratom allows me to work with no pain, and no intoxicating effect. It is not a drug in the traditional sense of the word, it is more akin to a cup of coffee. I have taken kratom every day at my highly competitive and public workplace and if I seemed intoxicated I would have been fired long ago. I operate forklifts and other heavy machinery while on Kratom and I am in complete control of my actions while doing so.\n\nWhen I go on vacation I typically leave my kratom at home, and I suffer no withdrawal effect even though I am taking kratom at least 5 days a week at my job. The only thing that returns is my foot pain. \n\nI was born in America and have lived here all my life. I have never been arrested or accused of a crime. I do not consume any illegal drugs or illicit substances. And yet I am writing you this message anonymously due to my fear and concern over the scheduling and ban of kratom. I do not want to become a criminal. I do not deserve to become a criminal. All I want is to do my job pain-free.

Kratom should not be scheduled. I have seen the difference it has made in my wife's life. I have heard from co-workers and numerous others how much better their quality of life is after finding kratom. Even before my wife and I were married, nearly 20 years ago, she's always lived in pain and had very limited options in what she could use to help her because of allergies or undesired effects (feeling \"high\", nauseated or itching and even unable to function). While kratom may not fix her conditions and it doesn't get rid of them,  kratom does give my wife such an incredible better quality of life and she's able to accomplish more then she ever has been. I can see how much of a difference and positive impact  Kratom has made in my wife's life and I can't imagine anyone taking that away. I do not think that any adult should ever be denied access to kratom tea. It has such a huge positive impact and so many people lead much better quality lives. I don't want to see my wife go back to living with so much pain and discomfort when this all natural leaf helps. There's no reason or excuse for why she and others should be forced to go back to struggling with simple everyday life when kratom really helps. Do not take kratom away from all of these responsible adults. Kratom is their choice. Kratom helps make their lives more comfortable and doesn't cause the negatives that other things can and kratom IS SAFE. Kratom is not dangerous. Schedules are for drugs. Kratom is a leaf, not a drug. Do not schedule kratom. \n\nThank You, \n\nJosh C.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19527","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Josh C","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern, \nMy name is Mark Shaver. I am 49 years old, I am a dad of four, married, a teacher (special education--will finish my masters this spring in fact) and an ordained pastor with a Masters of Divinity from Denver Seminary. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University Northern Colorado in 1989, and with Honors from Denver Seminary in 2001. Ive been teaching and preaching since 1989. \nI also have used kratom for the past 3 years. \n\nMy reasons for taking kratom have been for the simple fact that I use it for a supplement to ease my back pain. From an accident I suffered several bulging discs, have sciatica, and previously was prescribed tramadol, morphine, oxycontin, and methadone. ALL of these drugs ended up causing severe side effects including but not limited to chronic constipation, lethargy, incontinence, erectile dysfunction, MORE pain, and addiction. I could not stand what was going on, and I ended up on methadone finally as a last resort as I was about to file for disability due to the pain levels I had incurred. I did not want to live anymore as well. \n\nI did research online and found that kratom had been used safely in Thailand and in east Asia for hundreds of years and decided to try that, as a last resort, for my pain and to get OFF of the methadone. Within 6 weeks I was off all methadone, I began to feel better, had NO side effects of any sort--and was able to go back to work as a teacher after almost 8 years of being what amounted to bed-ridden and only doing Sunday services for my small church. \nI will finish my Master's in Special Education this year. This is due to kratom giving me my life back. I cannot imagine what would happen if I had to go back to opioids for pain. For myself it is simply a supplement that has helped so much in so many ways it is indispensable for my life. \nThe bottom line for myself is that without the use of kratom, I would not have went back to work full time as a teacher. I would not have entered a program to get another Master's degree. I would not be working, and as well my personal life was deteriorating from the stress on my marriage as well. I am able to coach baseball, tutor kids after school, be a husband, have intimacy with my spouse--I would be living a totally different life. My quality of life--in and of itself--would be a shambles. \nWhat good would it do me to have all these degrees, this amount of experience in working with both adults and children--if I was bed-ridden or stuck on the couch watching Oprah? Nothing. What good would it be to be married, with four beautiful children who need their father--if he is in so much pain you can't go to their games, help coach them--to BE there? Nothing. This is why for myself and for so many others the talk of banning this herb is so ridiculous and the ignorance as well, of who uses the plant, has been such a source of anger for me. We are NOT a bunch of \"druggies\" but professionals, people with a higher quality of life, productive citizens--for which the pharmaceuticals used on our bodies were not working and for which did not lead to healing. That has not been the case with kratom for myself and many others. As a supplement it allowed me to heal, maintain a level of pain that was not debilitating, and it did it without the side effects of opiods and the addiction that comes with them.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20906","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Roger Mark Shaver","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Roger.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

I also know that since you are somehow both the creators and the enforcers of the law that you have a blatant conflict of interest.  Because I am willing to assume that your intentions are good, I will set aside the conflict of interest issue for now, even though your budget and your jobs depend on having (creating?!) illegal drugs to go to war against.  I will also momentarily set aside the obvious fallacy that one cannot wage a war on drugs, one can only wage a WAR ON PEOPLE, and those people are the citizens of this supposedly FREE COUNTRY. (Sorry for 'yelling,' but all caps is the only mode of emphasis this platform allows me.)\nTo the point - ironically, I had never heard of Kratom until I read that you were going go summarily give it a Schedule 1 listing without any due process or public comment.  I'm honestly pleasantly shocked that you backed off on that.  Holy cow, maybe we don't live in a completely dystopian future yet.\nGetting back to the point - when I read about the plans to schedule Kratom I thought, \"Wait, why haven't I heard of this plant?  It sounds awesome!\" So, impulsively, I went ahead and ordered some.  \nA little background - I'm someone who has struggled with mild to moderate depression my whole adult life, I have a tendency to drink too much, I generally don't sleep well and I never have.  I have bad knees.  I had my first knee surgery when I was only 13 years old.  So I have aches and pains even though I'm only 46.\nHere's my report: For the last two months or so I took 1-2 teaspoons of Kratom powder every day.  One in the morning, one in the afternoon.  It's been a great experience.  I've slept better and had more energy than I can ever remember.  My knees bother me less, and I have very little urge to drink.  I've lost some weight as a result.  \nThat's all good and well, but here's the really important part.  Two weeks ago I went out of town for a week and took no Kratom with me.  I felt NO withdrawal symptoms. NONE.  Sure, I didn't feel as great and I didn't sleep as well, but it was just back to how I felt before I had ever heard of Kratom.  I felt no worse.  None whatsoever. \nBased on my experience, I honestly believe that coffee is more addictive.  If I go two days without coffee I get a horrendous headache.  A week without Kratom, no problem at all.\nI understand the concern that there is a risk of abuse.  I haven't tried taking enough of it to see what the concern is, but fair enough.  I would like to point out however, that there is a ton of room for abuse with sugar, tobacco and alcohol, and all of those substances are legal despite the massive toll that they take on our society.  Massive! Still legal!\n I also understand the concern that Kratom products may be impure, laced, etc.  Well, news flash - so is most of our food and supplements. I often read reports that the supplements bought in places like Walmart often contain NONE of the product what they are being sold as being.  I might be on my own on this one, but I would love to see the FDA start to regulate ALL supplements in a positive and non-onerous way to ensure that people are getting what they are paying for.  That would be awesome and beneficial.  But telling me that this plant is not ok b/c a few people took it and then freaked out and called the poison control center is absurd. \nPutting Kratom on the Schedule 1 list would end pretty much all research into these potentially game changing chemicals.  We have an out of control opiate addiction issue in this country.  Bundling Kratom into that and making it more illegal than prescription opiates is absurd.  Kratom has the potential to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.  If you want to crack down on something, crack down on these legal drug pushers in the pharmaceutical industry that are making massive profits killing our people. Please.\nJust be reasonable for once. We aren't children. This is supposed to be a free country.  Kratom isn't killing people, prescription drugs are. Get your heads on straight and do your jobs in a way that actually helps people, not hurts and criminalizes them.\nThank you for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5450","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"C J Ware","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been taking Kratom for 5 years without incident.

It has never been a substance that I want to over indulge in for a \"high\".   It is a natural substance that helps me live a productive life instead of being a disability recipient.  \nPlease do not put Kratom on a schedule as a controlled substance.

As a mild sedative and sleep aid, kratom does the job without hangovers or judgement impairment, in my experience.  \n\nThe dangers of this plant, covered by media, are minimal when compared to prescription opioids and illegal use.  With diabetes reaching epidemic levels, research on glucose control is important.  Kratom appears to be effective in relieving (physical and mental) and relative risks.\n\nThe trend in the country is towards deregulation of marijuana both medicinal and recreational. To over-regulate another plant contradicts the trend and may very well create a black market in kratom.  Research into the benefits of specific chemical components of kratom is desirable but should not be a prerequisite to use. Continued use in larger population can provide valuable epidemiological data that experiments do not. Finally, with the massive health issues - lethal viruses, antibiotic resistant bacteria, Alzheimer's in an aging population, should this be  priority?\n\nI summary, given the lack of scientific knowledge about kratom, its low danger rate, its ling history of use on the planet, and the potential for increased crime, why not leave well enough alone and cease efforts to classify kratom as a drug and especially as a class 1 drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6012","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Opiate addictions are destroying lives; it knows no socio economic boundaries. \nPlease allow this medication to be available and accessible to people \nWho need help with recovery and or so people are not getting addicted.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5541","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Theresa Munkvold","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\n   I work as a Conservation Technician for a local county park district. The nature of my job is such that I am constantly on my feet as well as habitually bending and other very physical acts throughout every work day. I have been in this career for over 10 years. Obviously, with such a physical job being performed over a long period I was bound to have physical ailments. Not a day goes by that I don't suffer from foot, leg, knee, back, and shoulder pain, sometimes all combined in a single day. I have been to a chiropractor, orthopaedic surgeon, primary care physician, physical therapist, message therapist, and accupuncturist. Some have helped more than others, some not at all. None of the prescription pain medications they prescribed helped at all and I refuse to take opioids and as the nature of my position in sometimes operating heavy equipment I wouldn't be allowed to take opioids anyway. Recently I discovered the pain relieving benefits of kratom. It is unbelievable how beneficial this product has been in helping me manage my pain that I suffer through everyday. I know I am not alone in my realization of the tremendous ability of this product to relieve pain. I have found absolutely no adverse side effects of this substance, sans perhaps occasional diarrhea. It does not get me\"high\" or invoke any addicted tendencies.  I know that if you conduct further research you will also find that this chemical is not addictive nor does it produce any egregious adverse side affects or produce a \"high\" any more so than nicotine or caffeine. \n   I am only 35 years and must manage to live the rest of my miserable existence with these constant physical ailments. Please do not prohibit access to this highly beneficial pain relieving substance without first gathering honest, unbiased, factual, and scientifically based information.

I suffered from chronic back pain for years due to scoliosis. I was prescribed Tramadol, hydrocodone, and muscle relaxers. These pills did not do a thing but make me feel in a haze. The pain killers did not help the pain very much and also made my stomach upset. I have also bee a Type 1 diabetic for 22 years and the prescription pain meds messed with my blood sugar levels. I was in the worst pain of my life and Kratom saved me. It was the only thing that worked. I got complete relief and was able to sleep through the night and after the right exercises my back pain subsided quite a bit. I still use Kratom for the nerve pain in my feet. Due to diabetes I have neuropathy of the feet(nerve damage). At times it feels like i am walking on marbles, or like pins and needles all over my feet. Other times it feels as if I am stepping on hot plates and my feet swell if i walk too much or sit too much. Kratom is the only thing that helps. Because of Kratom I can walk, go to the grocery store, and have an active lifestyle like someone my age should.

I have never been a more productive and eager member of society since finding this dietary supplement. I feel cheated that the DEA is suggesting there is no medical benefits from this plant.

It worries me to imagine a world without natural and holistic remedies to help combat health issues. A world where the DEA decides to ban this plant will be a dark and confused one for me. I have energy and motivation when taking kratom, it isn't not a drug and it does not make me high. \n\nI know that because there is an overwhelming response from citizens expressing how kratom has helped them, the correct course of action will be taken to ensure governmental agencies will agree with how kratom should beat be consumed. I just hope my story will truly be taken into consideration to acknowledge how kratom has positively helped me in so many different ways.

I have visited doctors, tried exercise and tried various treatments.  Realizing that pain management would be a long-term necessity in order to be able to be fully functional, mentally and physically, both at home and at work, I sought various forms of pain relief.  I tried various non-opiate solutions that were ineffective.  Learning that the degree of my pain would require opiates by conventional methods and knowing the long-term nature of the issue,  I knew that if I went down the path of consuming true opiates, I would very likely become physically addicted to them; and also, I expected that kind of pain relief could interfere with my work.  Hearing the horror stories of opiate addiction, I decided I would avoid becoming an opiate addict at all costs!\n\nSo, I set out to try some alternative method that would relieve pain, not cause physical addiction and permit me to be fully functional in the daytime.  Upon reading some scientific research suggesting that it was not physically addictive due a unique method of action as well as learning of a long track record of relatively safe use as an ethnobotanical in some cultures, I decided try it.  I found that it was precisely what I needed:  It relieved pain, I was able to maintain a significant degree of mental clarity and it was not physically addictive.  At first, I was concerned it was highly psychologically addictive.  However, I discovered that not to be true with time:  Occasionally, I would venture out to try new techniques of relieving pain and there were sometime months of doing so without any dramatic challenge.  Upon stopping, I did initially have a feeling like the feeling of not getting my morning coffee like something I would like to have but would do well-enough not having it.  The psychologically addictive aspect of it was mild and manageable, especially factoring for its immense benefits.  Despite my trying alternate techniques at time, I have found kratom to be the most consistently effective.  Without kratom, I expect that I would have become an opiate addict with time, entirely physically addicted and very strongly psychologically addicted.  I would loose my freedom of mind and body.  As it stands now, kratom aids me but does not rule me.  I consider it a blessing from God that such a thing can exist that's so powerfully beneficial and yet so relatively benign.\n\nKratom may need to be government-regulated so that only adults are permitted to consume it and to ensure a consistent, good quality product.  However, with all due respect, appreciating the best efforts to prevent harm to humanity, the only proper word to describe treating kratom as if it has no medical benefit and would only be abused, is \"unawareness\" of reality.  It's not only unawareness for the countless anecdotes that should not be dismissed but for the scientific research already available on the subject indicating numerous, novel potential medical benefits.  It's important to leave a legacy that future generations will be proud of and see its wisdom, not something that will need to be reversed at a later time by wiser descendants.  The correct path of how to treat kratom is to to regulate it as something useful so that humanity can get the maximum gain possible from the product,  increasing humanity's freedom to choose self-healing.  Surely, there are many truly malicious synthetic substances, killing many and truly having only minimal medical benefit (if at all) that really need the DEA's attention.  However, kratom is highly beneficial for practical purposes.  Were kratom to be treated a scheduled substance, God forbid, what happened in Alabama recently would happen elsewhere:  You would see more people becoming opiate addicts when they have no alternative means of relieving pain.  On the flip side, if kratom is regulated, we will see humanity improve and progress and if directed at stopping true opiate addiction, save lives.\n\nTypically, when nature's gifts are rejected, it creates a void in human existence and increases humanity's suffering,  Please acknowledge kratom as the gift of the God we trust and treat it with respect.  As commendable leaders , help this nation be guided on a path to use this product with reason and responsibility.  By that path, we and future generations will see the wisdom of the decisions that were made here.  Let us be able to count the many lives that were saved through preventing a dangerous opiate condition plus account for the immense suffering averted through making kratom available to humanity.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3862","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shaun Tuck","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My whole life I have dealt with anxiety issues. I would have panic attacks and frequent bouts of feeling anxious. I refused to take Xanax simply due to the fact that it is an awful drug and changes people completely, it has a high possibility for abuse and are highly addictive, which is the opposite description of schedule 4 drugs which is what it is listed as. Kratom has helped me deal with anxiety be ok in general. The fact that it is even being considered to be a schedule 1 in ridiculous. It has helped curb my anxiety and make panic attacks far less frequent. If this was made illegal, it would have a highly detrimental effect on my life. I do not care if the pharmaceutical companies will lose money, which is the only reason it is being considered for scheduling, even if you admit it or not. I care about me having a way to deal with anxiety that will not ruin my mind and life.

There are many plants from which hazardous substances can derived. It's not illegal just to own, use or sell those plants. It's only illegal to extract or concoct hazardous substances from them.

Keep Kratom legal so it doesn't end up going through the same hell and creating the same problems for our citizen that marijuana has.
