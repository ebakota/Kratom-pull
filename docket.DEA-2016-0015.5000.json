Kratom has been known to prevent withdrawal symptoms in an opiate dependent person. Kratom's psychoactive effects typically fade after a few hoursI. \n\n     In my opinion I feel Kratom should be afforded accessibility to people desiring a natural alternative to pharmaceutical NORCO and opiate drugs. i have just recently discovered and am researching the benefits of this natural herbal supplement that has displayed some super-food and antioxidant type qualities as well.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13142","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"G D Hoffman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name if John Bayne, retired Army Master Sergeant.

I was 23 years old, married with two children ages 5 and 7. The accident was 100% the other drivers fault. I was hospitalized and upon release began treating with a wonderful doctor in the Sports medicine & Rehabilitation field. I was immediatly put on a few different medications. Zydone 10 mg., quantity 120 for pain; Soma 350 mg., quantity 120 for severe muscle spasms & Xanax 2 mg., quantity 120 for extreme anxiety and insomnia . Before then, I had never been on any type of medication for any reason what so ever. My life was forever changed that year in November. \n Before my accident I was very healthy with wonderful eating habits and a daily ritual of power walking 3 to 5 miles. I was a devoted stay at home mother and home maker. After the accident all of that gradually changed. Long story short, after taking strong prescription medicines that were changed, multipled, subtracted from,added to, etc., for 14 long years, my body & my mind were addicted. I was totally dependant on these drugs which led to many other drug and psychological issues. My marriage, my children, my own mind- I lost it all. Life has been more than a struggle for me. I literally fought to stay alive many times. \n Kratom has given me hope. I feel \" normal \" again! Now I am a grandmother to a beautiful baby boy & without Kratom I don't feel as if I could be as productive as I have become. I have been off of all prescription medications as well as illegal drugs for 6 months now which would not have been possible with out this God given all natural amazing plant. Please consider my story while making a desicion wheter or not to allow Kratom to stay as God intended it to be, beneficial to so many. \n Thank you for your time. \n                                              Sincerely,\n                                                  Dina J.

It works for me and I consider myself clean and healthy. Kratom provides relief from anxiety and pain while remaining a mild herbal supplement. \n\nKratom leaf has helped me in the past and again at this time. It does not seem to be dangerous to human health, while it offers many benefits to people. Ive used kratom after having a surgery and after using prescription pain-killers. It works by providing a mild reduction in anxiety as well as energy/motivation depending on the strain. \n\nDue to the mild effects and raw leaf nature of kratom powder, it makes misuse or abuse uninteresting and unpleasant. There is a dose range such that no one wishes or benefits from high-dosing kratom. Taking extra kratom does not amplify the benefits.  It must be taken on an empty stomach which leaves realistically only 1-3 cups daily maximum. If needed I use kratom once in the morning, and if needed once more in the middle of the afternoon. This regimentation worked very well for me for 2-3 months. Having access to this safe and mild leaf brings a lack of fear and anxiety for me. I believe that many people can benefit from kratom especially those who are experiencing lethargy, anxiety, opioid addiction, pain, etc.\n\nKratom has helped me with everyday life. The regimentation of drinking kratom on an empty stomach once in the morning and again in the afternoon has the effect of drinking a green spinach-like salad which I feel helped cleanse my body, and helped me with keeping a consistent diet/lifestyle regiment. Access to this safe and mild herb keeps my conscience unworried that I can rely on it, and avoid harsh alternatives. Kratom is an excellent choice which can help with a spectrum of symptoms. It has helped me and continues to help me work and be productive. From my information kratom is a safe herbal tea with enormous potential to help people live a healthy and acceptable lifestyle. Please do not ban kratom. It may have saved my life and Im certain it can help many others struggling with health. It would be wrong to deny human beings access to this plant. Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16352","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom needs to be studied, outlawed.

It does help with the chronic pains I have from my years in the oilfield and a few car accidents. \nIt really does help. It doesn't have nearly the abuse potential of the opiod drugs. I would take it in the morning with the rest of my meds, and only rarely re-dose later the same day. In the past, I have used strong narcotics for chronic pain. It was very hard to make the meds last through the month, then it became impossible. \nI have never had this problem with kratom. Twice in this past year I stopped taking kratom abruptly, specifically to see if I would experience any withdrawals.

Over the years I have been prescribed pain medications including tramadol and hydrocodone for extended periods of time. A friend who has lupus suggested I try Kratom as it has helped her manage her pain and to have the energy to live a normal life with little to no side effects.  I started using Kratom in September of 2016 and was impressed immediately with the analgesic effects it showed. Since starting Kratom, I have had no need to use an opioid drug and no problem quitting the Norco I was taking daily.  I have been more productive at work and have taken no time off work due to back pain since starting on Kratom. I honestly think it can be instrumental in saving our nation from an opioid epidemic. I hope the intersts of the pharmaceutical industry will play no role in the decisions our government agencies have to make on this issue and I regret that there is even public suspicion of this. I urge the DEA to look at the potential this plant has to help the millions of Americans who are either suffering pain, suffering from addiction, or dealing with the wide range of problems this plant can help with.  I truly respect the serious job DEA is facing in scheduling this and wish you luck in doing so with an open mind. Thank you for taking the time to consider the opinions of the many Americans who will weigh in on this subject.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1170","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Basar","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is more harmless than marijuana.

In  1943 the Thai government was faced with declining taxes from opium sales.  Citizens were turning to Kratom as an alternative to opium, to protect their cash flow the government banned the mitragyna speciosa plant.  As the tree grows naturally and consumption of the leaves either chewed or in tea was common the law was not strictly enforced.  Quite simply the plant was banned to increase opiate use.  Is that the intention of the DEA's plan to place kratom on the Schedule 1 of controlled substances?\n     More recently a drink called 4x100 has become popular in Thailand.  It is a mix of kratom tea and codiene containing cough syrup with cola syrup to flavor it.  The 4x100 brings two issues to the discussion.  First, the effects of kratom are mild, it's not a party drug, and the sellers feel the need to \"kick it up a notch\" by adding an opiate drug to the natural tea.  Second, in the documented cases of fatalities related to kratom it was not the only substance used.  For instance if an individual took valium, kratom, percocet, alcohol, nicotine and cocaine and then died it isn't the kratom that killed them.\n     Many people have commented on the improvement in their lives after they began using kratom.  I am one of them, the leaves help me remain active despite orthopedic problems that cause chronic pain and stiffness.  I prefer kratom leaf to prescription painkillers because it relieves the pain without the mind numbing fog and constipation that accompany the prescription drugs.  To be honest the first thing I did when I read the initial plan to list kratom on Schedule 1 was to make an appointment with my doctor to get a prescription for narcotic pain relievers, because I would no longer have the most effective tool to help maintain my quality of life.  Is that the intention of the DEA's plan to list kratom on schedule 1?\n     Placing kratom on Schedule 1 of controlled substances is a mistake.  There is the possibility that mitrgyna speciosa leaves may offer a helpful alternative to those people who struggle with opiate addiction.  Pure kratom leaf is relatively benign to most people and doesn't pose a danger to public health.  Many people, myself included, find that kratom is helpful in dealing with chronic pain and greatly improves the quality of our lives.  Please, do not place mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine onto Schedule 1 of controlled substances.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19894","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"kent wardecke","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There are far too many people in this country addicted to opioids.

I am a recovering addict of opiates. I have legally obtained and taken suboxone to aid in my recovery. It's my experience that Suboxone and methadone cause worse problems for me than the original problem did. I have no insurance and can not afford treatment. Having said that, kratom has been extremely helpful to me personally. It's the only alternative that people such as myself who are trying to do the right thing but can not afford treatment or don't want to take the current commonly prescribed treatment s for opiate addiction. Kratom  produces no significant problems or dangers. There are no deaths contributed to kratom ALONE . Areas where kratom has been outlawed saw immediate increases in opiate overdoses and death. Kratom is not a danger!!! It is an extremely valuable resource to anyone with opiate addiction problems or others who just don't want to take highly addictive pain killers for chronic conditions. It's is ridiculous to make kratom illegal and will cause much harm and unnecessary deaths if it is made illegal.

I'm writing today to ask that Kratom, and plants like it, be allowed to be scientifically studied. I strongly object to any plant being banned or made illegal if it has not been independently studied for any potential harm or benefit. To me that's not just illogical, it also goes against basic human liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n \nAs a resident of Washington state I've observed the positive impact of legal recreational cannabis, and the evidence confirms what I have seen;  I believe the foundation of this success is common sense regulation that restricts access to those 21 years of age and older, and taxation that benefits communities across the state. Additionally every cannabis product is labeled to accurately quantify exactly what is being purchased, which allows people to confidently know what they're buying/using.\n\nThe anecdotal evidence about Kratom being a beneficial plant is overwhelmingly positive. And there are some cases of people that have encountered issues, but that's the exception, not the rule. I have not tried Kratom because, as opposed to Washington cannabis, it lacks verifiable labeling to quantify the origin and processing of the plant.\n\nIn closing I believe we are all better off when we strive to scientifically study and understand our natural world. No plant or substance should be placed on the Schedule 1 list without thorough government and independent study and societal consensus. Alcohol prohibition was an absolute disaster, and I'd argue the same about the DEA stance towards cannabis. I strongly encourage the DEA to not repeat past mistakes, and make better policy decisions going forward.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and consider my comments.\n\nGregory Teaderman","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16169","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gregory Teaderman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This comment is in reference to Docket No. DEA-442W. \n\nMy name is Holly Jensen and I am a 32 year old consultant for nonprofits. I strongly believe that the DEA should not put kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. I added kratom to my evening tea as a sleep aid. for approximately 6-7 consecutive months from fall of 2015 through early 2016. I experienced an improvement in my sleep and anxiety issues. I used it as a basic dietary or herbal supplement, and experienced no negative effects.\n\nLike 60 million other Americans, I suffer from insomnia. According to my psychiatrist, my insomnia is likely connected to my social anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. I was speaking about this with a friend who is knowledgeable about teas (such as a good old-fashioned chamomile, lavender, and valerian tea to relax). She suggested I look into kratom, specifically the red vein varieties, which have been used naturally for centuries for their calming effects. \n\nI attempted to find and try the most natural form of kratom I could find. I had positive results. I felt relaxed, but not drugged. I was able to slip into sleep more easily, and I felt my anxiety was lessened. I was not groggy when I woke up, which I often am when I take other sleeping aids. I experienced no negative side effects, aside from its bitter taste. \n\n\"Kratom is considered minimally toxic,\" notes a recent literature review in the International Journal of Legal Medicine (2015). \"[W]ithdrawal symptoms are generally nonexistent to mild, even for heavy users.\" (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00414-015-1279-y)\n\nAs Forbes explains, \"An average of 110 [calls to poison centers]cases a year may sound like a lot, but it's not. It represents about 0.004 percent of the 3 million or so calls received by poison control centers each year. [...] The DEA not only fails to put the number of kratom-related calls in perspective; it does not mention that two-thirds of the cases were deemed 'minor' or 'moderate,' while only 7 percent (eight per year) were described as 'life-threatening.' \" (http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobsullum/2016/09/01/the-deas-crazy-kratom-ban-dresses-pharmacological-phobias-in-scientific-garb/#646b946c4f86)\n\nI no longer have kratom in my tea, and I experienced no withdrawal symptoms. I have had addictions in the past to opiods and alcohol, and my experience with kratom was on par with a strong, peaceful nighttime tea. I purchased it legally, of course, online, and received a powered leaf suitable for tea. \n\nI also see this issue from the point of view of an Ohioan. The pain killer epidemic is a catastrophe. I am horrified at the number of overdoses we're seeing in Northeast Ohio. Banning kratom for everyone-- not just those under 18-- will fuel the overdose epidemic. The only beneficiaries are, perhaps, pharmaceutical companies. Public health will in no way benefit from banning kratom or listing it as a schedule I drug. I sympathize with the instinct to restrict supplements out of concern for addiction or harmful side effects. \n\nI did not experience any negative side effects from kratom. I stopped drinking kratom eventually just because it has, in my opinion, a bitter taste. But kratom was an important step on that journey to a more healthy sleep experience. I am extremely grateful that kratom was legal when I needed something non-habit-forming to address my insomnia and anxiety. It can be a long and complex process to secure affordable psychiatric and behavioral/mental health care. This natural option should be available to those who will benefit from it. Can kratom be abused? Possibly. So can alcohol--and cigarettes--both with dramatically greater impact on public health. \n\nI have seen both sides. I have been an addict. I have been in recovery. I have benefited from kratom. I have also lived without it easily. Do not list kratom as schedule I. Scientists should have access to kratom. Particularly in light of the epidemic of overdoses tearing communities apart, we should be able to safely explore natural alternatives. More research is essential, therefore, it should not be listed as schedule I. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration. \nSincerely,\nHolly Jensen\nThis comment is in reference to Docket No. DEA-442W.

Even restricting sales like alcohol or tobacco is unnecessary and would create unneeded regulation and bureaucracy that wouldn't help anyone.\n\nDEA Cites 15 \"kratom related\" deaths, however I'll bet most if not all of those were caused by other factors: like a combination of drugs, and just happened to have kratom in their system, or other drugs + a very large amount of kratom, or something similar. In high quantities, I can imagine kratom can be dangerous, but the same is true of coffee/caffeine, sugar, alcohol, even water itself, etc. \n\nI am certain that far fewer poison control calls are made about kratom than from either cosmetics or household cleaners, and fewer emergency room visits about kratom than scissors. Data shows that the leading cause of adult poisonings is \"analgesics,\" which include Tylenol, Vicodin, and other pain kills, but kratom is not included in this figure (source: http://www.poison.org/poison-statistics-national ) I have requested further data from aapcc.org to help emphasize these points, but wanted to be sure my comment was submitted before the cutoff date. I am sure that you have access to this data yourself and can verify.\n\nA small minority of people are always going to injure themselves with whatever they have around, it's ridiculous to ban a useful coffee-like plant  because of a few fools. That line of thinking would require banning all household chemicals, alcohol, tobacco, firearms, hammers, and just about any other dietary supplement or tool you can think of.\n\nWhile researching kratom for this comment, I learned that many people claim kratom can be used to help break dependence on opiate drugs, including Vicodin, Oxycodone, and Heroin. Anecdotal and historical evidence backs up these claims, and if this is accurate, that is an even greater argument to keep it unscheduled. The pharmaceutical companies regularly increase the price of any medicine that has a lack of competition, which is a monopoly and against the laws of this country, so having a natural alternative that is low-cost and legal to obtain without a prescription is a huge win for this country; and, if proven true, more Americans should be informed how to break opiate addition with kratom.\n\nHowever, even with the ability mentioned above, it still has an extremely low potential for abuse. It has been in use in south-east Asia for thousands of years, and yet \"kratom addiction\" is virtually non-existent. This is because it is no stronger than coffee, and helps to balance the body and mind.  If you drink a cup of coffee and the next day drink a cup of kratom (if you don't drink either normally) you will feel much stronger effects from the coffee.\n\nThe chemicals  believed to fight opiate addiction (mitragynine and 7-HMG) are found in such small quantities, that it is similar to poppy seeds' opium content, so this is why it can help fight opiate addiction, but not cause a danger to public safety. To reinforce, those chemicals are NOT opiates. They cannot be used as precursors to create stronger opiates, and as such do not pose the same risk.\n\nKratom is no way to \"get high,\" there are much cheaper and more effective ways to do this, such as alcohol. \n\nLet's please use common sense in this case and keep kratom unscheduled; as I said, coffee + tea make me unable to function due to caffeine induced headaches, and kratom helps start the morning without that jittery feeling of caffeine.\n\nThank you for your consideration, I am hopeful my comments and research have swayed you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2018","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My girlfriend takes it for pain associated with psoriatic artheritis.

I am a 35 year old Father of three, professional violinist, and full time student at UNA. I struggled with chronic back pain, severe alcoholism, and drug use for the majority of my adolescence, and have been clinically diagnosed with major depression and anxiety/panic disorder. I took kratom in an effort to taper my alcoholism and in lieu of not having any more prescription pain pills, which I had become dependent on. The first time I took kratom, a few years ago, I realized I could stop taking any and all drugs I was dependent on and stop drinking alcohol as well-which was a monumental task for me as my alcoholism had progressed considerably over years of alcohol abuse. I have not drank, nor felt the need to drink since I began taking kratom. Neither have I taken any drugs since taking kratom.I completely turned my life around, with the help of this plant! I overcame alcohol and drug dependence, made positive strides in my career as a violinist, went back to school after acquiring a full scholarship, and earned a 3.8 / 3.5 GPA in my first two semesters in college. This one plant has helped me more than any prescription medication I have ever been prescribed, and as a matter of fact, I was able to weane myself completely off of all medications aside from a mild antidepressant which I cut back the dose down to only half.I made great positive strides professionally as a concert violinist, personally as a Father, and I was able to fully function without being hindered by my clinical depression and anxiety, all through simply taking kratom daily. I was in the process of tapering myself completely off of all medications when Alabama decided to ban kratom and schedule it. I am now, through no real choice of my own, back on medications and still suffering from my conditions. While I still haven't drank any alcohol nor reverted to drug use, my progress has considerably diminished without the help of kratom to control my symptoms. I ask you, for myself and for the millions who could benefit and turn their lives around with the help of kratom, please, do NOT make kratom a controlled substance and do NOT schedule it. Leave it legal available and readily attainable to responsible adults, as if it hadn't been, I would have never discovered it, and would likely still be a chronic alcoholic with no initiative to seek a better life for myself and my loved ones. Because of kratom,I was able to change my life for the better, and everyone suffering deserves that chance. Keep kratom legal for responsible aged adults. It should be their decision to make.

I was a pain clinic patient for years and the last drug I was on was Fetynol 75mg patch every 2 days. I chose to stop opiates because if they didn't have them at the pharmacy and I had to wait which happened often in Florida where I was living I would feel worse off medically than when I started the pain clinic.  The kratom does appear to help them with no uncomfortable side effects except constipation. Additionally I heard it was good to relax the mood as some herbs like St. John's wary does. Well, I'm not sure if it is effectively doing all that, but it certainly doesn't do the opposite.  To say it is a psychedelic or a drug of abuse that could make one high is so laughable. My goodness put it in a tea bag and drink some yourself! It does nothing of the sort! If it's only benefit is to help opiate addicted even think their cravings are diminished than by all means do not make it illegal as there are no harmful consequences!

My name is Drew Scholl, I'm 46 years old, and a successful Technology Manager in Software Design. I was introduced to Kratom by a friend a couple of years ago after going through a difficult divorce. I was often depressed and having a hard time sleeping and concentrating at work. After trying Kratom, I immediately noticed that my mood and focus were both elevated and there was no \"crash\" afterwards. My father has been a life-long pharmacist but I've never liked taking narcotics because of their side effects. I was amazed how Kratom helped me feel more positive, calm, and engaged with my work and my life.  Likewise, I am very active and play tennis, run, and ski throughout the year. Kratom helped reduce the aches and pains associated with common soreness from these activities, as well. Since Kratom relaxes me, I don't take it before I exercise and above all, I've never become addicted to it. There are simply times where I find it very useful. \n\nPlease do not ban this natural supplement!  I'm so thankful for Kratom and I have 2 friends (one that had epileptic seizures, the other has Aspergers) and Kratom has been a life changer for them both.\n\nThank you again!\nDrew Scholl","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9846","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Drew Scholl","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom. There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

Any person who has ever tried this plant does not understand how it can have the definition of a scheduled 1 drug. It is scary to think I will be considered a criminal under the eyes of the US law if I continue to enhance my life with this plant. Kratom has helped me get through my chronic back pain due to HS & college football. I had back surgery at the age of 19, and have never fully recovered. I have used pain killers and found that they are extremely dangerous and addictive. The danger is well known, and the DEA should do everything in it's power to give people a safe and comparable alternative. Kratom is exactly that. A plant from the coffee family has pain killing and caffeine-like stimulant effect, making people with chronic pain productive members of society. The DEA perviously noted Kratom being an opiate; it is not an opiate. Please, do your research, and listen to users that take this beneficial supplement. You will find that a scheduled 1 definition is absolutely uncalled for, and many will assume that there are alternative motives that benefit certain entities if this becomes ban; simply doesn't make sense. Do the right thing by keeping this supplement on the market. You are helping people with pain, drug addiction and depression stay away from dangerous substances that comes from the earth; you are literally saving lives if you keep it legal, and killing them if you make it illegal.

And I again say, were those 15 people who died in a 2 year span under the influence of other drugs!? \n\nI have personally seen the benefits of an over the counter, natural substance Kratom : help pain sufferers alleviate their pain without dangers to their health or becoming hopelessly addicted to a medication, and addicts stop using harmful street drugs. \n\nThe DEA seems to be trying to force the people of America to use harmful, expensive, addictive, unnatural chemical compounds for their personal health or face prosecution and incarceration! \n\nThe DEA,  which is not a medical authority, or a legislative authority is trying to arbitrarily  make laws in a country that has a known and historied way of making laws that do not allow ultimate power resting in one groups hands. \n\nRead the constitution. \n\nI personally believe that with the growing support for marijuana legalization, the DEA is trying to keep themselves relevant with a big healthy budget to exterminate the \"evil drugs\" that are killing Americans (prescribed drugs are fine though, even though they kill more people than guns). \n\nBy targeting a drug that has helped millions of people for thousands of years, to force citizens who pay their salaries to consume harmful,  addictive,  expensive prescription drugs (that takes at least 20 years to find out if it's actually harmful), without any medical basis or study,Is a very blatant power grab to stay relevant and empower the pharmaceutical industry. \n\nI personally think that the DEA should focus on the actually harmful drugs like meth and bath salts, and if their budget shrinks, maybe they should be better at their jobs? \n\nBTW, how's the war on drugs going? \n\nRecord overdose deaths due to what?  Fentanyl\n\nAn engineered drug that is prescription, is killing hundreds of people a year, so many that naloxone is being spread far and wide, over the counter for od's. \nLast I heard it was around 800 ppl died from fentanyl this year alone in the US,  Canada has around 700.  \n\n15 people in 2 years for Kratom, with who knows what else in their systems?! \n\nHow many marijuana overdose deaths?  None \n\nWhy don't you (DEA) stop trying to make laws and crack down on ability to get a truly dangerous drug (fentanyl) off the street before coming after something that actually helps people and doesn't kill them?\n\nI forget, fentanyl is made by pharmaceutical companies, Kratom is grown. \n\nDoes that make any kind of sense to anyone listening?! \n \n\n\n\n ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6112","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Charley Wiseman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my name is Stephen Chitty, 37 years of age and owner at Bang Bang Vapes & Smoke Shop.

While I have read many articles touting the benefits of Kratom I want to tell you a story of how this drug had a profound effect on my son and surrounding family.  My son, who suffers from anxiety, discovered this drug on line and,  as it was advertised as a way to curb the issues associated with anxiety, he decided to give it a try.  What has happened from his usage of this drug over the past 24 months has been devastating.  After Kratom he became addicted to Heroin.  He has lost his job, his family, his house, and has racked up thousands of dollars in debt with his continued purchase of Kratom and heroin.   I want to make it clear that my son comes from a very good and financially sound family background and none of us saw this coming.  He had a wonderful job and family.   This has had an unbelievable affect on everyone who loves him.  He voluntarily checked himself into a rehab facility and is currently undergoing outpatient treatment at a mens transitional living facility.  The past several months has been a nightmare not only in terms of emotions but financially as well.  While it was his bad decision that ultimately led to what has happened he was able to justify his entry into Kratom by saying it was a legal and natural substance.  While I do not disagree with this I do not agree this substance should be so readily available.  Individuals who need this drug for various medical issues should have to go through the vetting process with a medical doctor.\n\nI implore you to consider, at least, the control of this substance via a medical doctor.

I was looking for a way to\nget off the opiates i was chained too and was at the mercy of my doctor because of it. I was tired of that life. Chasing pills.

I was skeptical but willing to try anything at this point. I ordered from a online website and after the third day i knew I found the key to what i was looking for,...I didn't have to go to the doctors and beg pills anymore. I didn't have to chase pills illegally. All it did was give me a sense of well-being and energy and help me focus and keep me on task and take care of my two little boys.....over 10 years later, now my boys have a very present and wonderful mother. I became a legal assistant, a tax payer, I'm able to work out and take care of my body. Whereas before, I was not able to do that.  Kratom changed my life and completely turned me around. I don't want to have to go back to the doctors and beg for prescriptions anymore. It is a botanical and should be considered a dietary supplement and should be available for all Americans to use if they decide that they need to use it. It would be a tragedy to take away kratom after all its given to me and to many others. Please keep it legal.

Your proposal to ban kratom without any significant medical studies backing your claims is indicative of your organization's outlook as a whole; but it doesn't have to be. You have the power, starting with this tiny step, to reconsider your hardline position on the War on Drugs. When the people talk about a waste of taxpayer money, our private and public prison systems come to mind. Which you so happily stock like cattle over this failed attempt at control. \nI'm originally from a small town, Johnstown, PA. It used to be a thriving hub where America's steel was happily produced day in day out, but once the steel mill's left, so too did all of our hope and jobs. With that left all of the recreation opportunity. But still it clung on, relatively safe and happy. That is until a much more insidious type of drug dealer entered our town, the state-sanctioned one. Pill pushing doctors, fat on pharma-money overprescribed narcotic painkillers at an alarming rate. With the powderkeg of nothing-else-to-do in town, use skyrocketed. We went from a safe town to a kid I knew in high school being murdered a couple blocks from my childhood house two weeks ago. Once the doctor's stopped prescribing through legislation, large illegal drug operations found a perfectly intact framework through which to push their product. Now heroin is the norm. \nYou may be thinking, \"Shouldn't you be against this then??\" No, for I've actually done research and considered the issue. Throughout the history of human kind, we have all been experimenting with different intoxicants in various ways. If prohibition of alcohol taught us anything, it is that you cannot legislate morality. Once it was illegal, vicious thugs and gangsters took over the alcohol trade. Use was not effected, but communities were. Innocent people fell victim, and we created more problems than we solved. There's not enough characters here to truly comment entirely how I feel, to cover every base. I know you guys know, and if you don't then I'm not confident that you should be entrusted with anything, let alone people's livelihoods. \nI know the effects illegal drugs can have on people, and kratom is not even in the same ballpark. It is an herb that helps people get through their days. As it stands it's relatively affordable and accessible for those who use it. It helps people get off of opiates, which is a near impossible task. It has never killed anyone on its own, no one breaks into shops to steal it, it's a plant. Stop outlawing nature.\n\nThe war on drugs not only costs this country a large amount of it's lower classes' youth, whether through the prison industrial complex, death from drug related accidents, or \n\nUnderneath all of the bureaucracy and mal-intent, you guys are human just like all of us. Somewhere in there a small shred of empathy clings to life.\n\n\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8946","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would appreciate it very much if Kratom were kept legal.

I have over 5,000 thousand of hours of herbal training, including 3,000 hours of Chinese herbal medicine training. I am also a practitioner of Functional Medicine and I teach herbal and clinical practice courses. For the past 12 years I have worked with over 800 patients with chronic and acute pain. As Im sure you are aware, prescription opiates and NSAIDs can have serious health  consequences, which I see time and again with patients. Over the past 5 years have been recommending Kratom to patients with chronic  and acute pain, often in traditional herbal formulations, and found it to be both effective and safe if used with proper instructions and in correct dosing. I have never had a patient injured by Kratom, even if intentionally consumed in higher than recommended doses. The worst response I have seen has been nausea when improperly consumed. I have had so many patients report very positive effects on their pain, and immense improvements in quality of life as compared to prescription opiate use.\n\nI am very concerned about the current DEA scheduling consideration. Earlier this week I had a patient with fibromyalgia come to my office in tears at the news that she could no longer have access to this remarkable herb that was very successfully and safely managing her pain, and instead would have to resume her Percocet prescription and have her quality of life plummet again. She and I are both concerned that all the side effects she was experiencing with Percocet will come back. I have heard many similar stories from patients with RA, chronic back pain, MS, and other pain conditions. As a clinician and herbalist very versed in the research, as well as the centuries of traditional safe use of this herb in South East Asia (I lived and practiced medicine in Cambodia where it has been safely used for hundreds of years). I have to strongly recommend and request that you do everything in your power to stop this scheduling. I can only hope that you have, or will, familiarize yourself with the benefit to harm balance of scheduling this herb, and realize the impact this will have on countless patients who will have no choice but to turn to substances that are well documented to have great potential for overdose death, liver damage, and addiction. I have treated patients with addictions for 10 years in nursing rehabilitation clinics and outpatient clinics, and have seen the damage done. In my clinical experience, even with long term Kratom use, the withdrawal symptoms reported to me are more akin to stopping coffee or sugar, slight headaches and occasional craving over a few days. Out of hundreds of cases I have had reported to me, no one has been harmed from stopping Kratom or from using it short or long term. Please hold this in mind and weigh it with the 14,000 deaths from prescribed pharmaceutical opiates in 2014 alone. Putting Kratom on Schedule 1 is not the most effective way to encourage research and proper informed use, instead it will directly force countless people to much more dangerous drugs to combat their pain. I support efforts to encourage dosage and proper consumption labeling and quality control to avoid adulteration. As with other herbal medicines this can be achieved by allowing reputable companies to sell it openly under FDA guidelines for nutritional supplements. \n\nThank you for your time and careful consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21163","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Spencer Ames L Ac Dipl OM FMP","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My wife depends on this to be able to move everyday.

To say this plant is a threat to the public is just not true. People should be allowed to take herbal supplements if they so desire. \nThank you for taking the time to read my comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18908","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"K Gunderson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been a lifesaver with the breakthrough cancer pain that I experience that Vicodin  doesn't  take care of.

I want to start of by telling you my story briefly of how Kratom has been helping me. Years ago I was inflicted with combat related injuries while deployed in the Army. My injuries wear severe enough to force me into a medical retirement. I ended up having a number of operations that were unsuccessful and made my conditions worse. The only thing doctors did for me was prescribe massive amounts of pain medications that led to an addiction. The injuries forced me on disability for a number of years. In addition to my physical conditions I suffer from PTSD. I wanted so much to at least get out and go school in attempt to gain a vocation that wouldn't aggravate my physical conditions. Unfortunately, because of myself allowing PTSD to control me I could not bring myself to be around people and get over the fear of gaining an education. One day I noticed that my relationship with my now wife was fading. I realized that I needed to get off the pain medications and face my PTSD. After doing some research and speaking with others in my same situation I learned that Kratom may be able to help me. Kratom had got me off the meds without withdrawal and without becoming dependent on anything else and easing my pain considerably. In addition, it allows me the ability of not having my PTSD control me anymore. Because of Kratom I was able to get out and go to school and acquire two degrees with a 4.0. I am now off disability and working full time again as an aviation technician. I now have purpose and pride in my life again. My relationship with my wife has never been so great. I was able to do all this because of the help from Kratom. I am not addicted to kratom nor do I have any cravings for it. I thought I might tell you my personal experience with kratom and how it gave me my life back.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18264","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Garraty","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep kratom legal!

It is something that I have delt and lived with. I have tried many different treatments to coped with my depression. But what I have found to help the most with absolutely zero side effects is Kratom. Kratom has changed my life and has given the ability to enjoy life agian. I am a personal trainer and competitive athlet. I have very physically fit and would normally have a lot to be happy about.  But my depression was crippling my ability to enjoy anything and could barely get out of bed some days. Which was effecting all areas of my life. But then about 3 years ago a friend recommended I try Kratom which has been known to help people suffering from depression. I can't quit put into words the difference it has made. I weant from feeling nothing to living life agian. I only need to take a small dose once every 3 days and I am not depressed.  I don't get high, I am not altered in the slightest of ways. And I can feel happy agian. \nYou should also know that I am an extremely health person. In fact I am gluten free, dairy free, and only eat clean Protien and veggies. I don't drink alcohol and I work out 5 days a week and I compete on American Ninja Warrior. My job is to motivate people get better themselves and become healthier. \nWhat I am saying is I am as far as it gets from a drug addict I am actually quit the opposite. I use Kratom to treat my depression so I can be a active and productive member of Society. And I would very much like to keep Kratom from being a Schedule 1 narcotic. \nMy name is Sean Grimm and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for hearing my testimony about Kratom and how it has changed my life for the better. \nThank you\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6827","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sean Grimm","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"First, thank you for reviewing all of these comments, and taking them into consideration as you make your final determination. \n\nI'm a screenwriter, actor and father of two living in Burbank, and I'm genuinely not sure where my life would be without kratom. My own particular story concerns G.A.D. (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and depression, which has seen me hospitalized with panic attacks on close to a dozen occasions. Over the years I've tried countless pharmaceuticals to assist in this problem (including several well-known anti-depressants, as well as benzos like ativan and xanax), with little to no success. On that score alone, kratom has been a godsend. In more ways than I can count, a small daily dose of kratom has been a crucial part of my becoming a well-rounded and functioning member of society, and in the several years since first discovering kratom, I haven't found myself in an emergency room with panic attacks - and I owe that to kratom. It has also helped me wean off the daily use of xanax (and ativan), and given me back my life from depression. I'm a better father, husband, son, worker and member of society, because of it.  \n\nOn a secondary nature, a back surgery in 2013 left me - for a time - dependent on hydrocodone. While the pain is still present, it's with the use of kratom that I was able to completely forgo the use of any opiates. While the use of kratom for its pain relieving properties falls below my use of it for depression and anxiety, I still find it an occasional godsend for lingering pain from my back surgery. I'm (relatively) pain free for the first time in 20 years without the use of opiates, again because of kratom. \n\nAs with any substance on Earth, there are always those who abuse and misuse - but the thousands who benefit shouldn't be at the mercy of those select few. Please don't make kratom illegal. While it's too melodramatic to say \"I couldn't live without it,\" I do know this: my life has improved immeasurably since discovering kratom. Unscrupulous vendors, head shops and gas stations - those who present an inferior product - should absolutely be in your sites, and I'm sure most kratom users would agree. But to deny the thousands who benefit - safely, securely - would be a huge step backward. Lives would change. I would change. And thousands denied would turn back the clock on progress and - left with no option but to turn back to opiates - I firmly believe many more would die from pharmaceutical opiates.\n\nAgain, thank you very much for reviewing this - and other - comments. Here's hoping that the weight of the evidence, from kratom users like myself who have benefitted enormously, will factor heavily in your final decision. \n\nSincerely,\n\nA Concerned Citizen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18391","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA and others concerned-\n\nMy name is Jennifer Blair.  Im a 44 year old woman living in Powell, Ohio.  I would like to give you a brief history about myself.  Im a college graduate and I have been a law abiding citizen my entire life.  I was in media for almost 20 years and was successful in my career.  I was a very active person, paid my taxes and paid into the Social Security system.  Then, in 2010 my life as I knew it ended when I became ill with the Epstein-Barr virus, psoriatic arthritis and Chronic Lyme Disease, just to name a few of my ailments.  I had to leave my job.  I spent the next four years in and out of doctors offices.  None of my ailments can be cured; only treated.  And I cant treat my psoriatic arthritis because of my Chronic Lyme Disease.  Ive accumulated large amounts of medical debt that I simply couldnt pay because I had no income.  The one doctor I had to see every month was my pain specialist who prescribed me large doses of opiates.  I didnt want to be on opioid medications but they helped me get out of bed and do the very basic chores of bathing and feeding myself and kept me from committing suicide.  Im not trying to be dramatic when I share that information but if youve ever suffered from chronic pain, you are aware of how absolutely depressing it is to live with constant pain. Especially when you have no hope of ever being cured.  All I can do is treat the symptoms and take one day at a time.  Add to being depressed from my illnesses, I wasnt proud of taking pain medications.  Pharmacists and doctors treated me like I was an addict just looking for a fix.  And I was raised in a very conservative family and had very conservative ideas about myself, my life and my work.\n\nIn October of 2015, I had to make the choice of giving up my pain management doctor.  His office visits and the costs of my prescriptions became too much.  It was costing me about $1,000. per month.  I knew I was going to begin a very ugly withdrawal when my body stopped receiving the medication.  I panicked.  I called all of my other doctors and explained the situation but they either wouldnt or couldnt help me.  As Ive found out over the years, there arent many doctors who want the repercussions from our government/DEA from helping chronic pain patients by prescribing opiate pain medications.  Its a shame but its the reality of the situation.\n\nMy next step was getting myself into a drug treatment/rehabilitation facility.  The waiting list at that time was months.  Like 3-4 months.  Unless I had approximately $4,000. to pay upfront for a private facility, which, of course, I did not.  I wasnt thrilled at the idea of going to a rehabilitation facility because there they take their patients who are addicted to one drug and get them addicted to another drug (Suboxone, etc), but I was terrified to go though the withdrawals which Ive heard can be life threatening.\n\nWith the possibility of a rehabilitation facility gone, my only choice left was to buy pain medication from drug dealers or start using heroin, a much less expensive option.  Then, a nurse from one of my doctors office told me about Kratom.  She had a friend that used it to kick her heroin habit.  She told me it was completely natural and convinced me to try it.  I truly believe God sent me an angel in that nurse.  Ive been off opiates since November of 2015 and am doing better than I had ever hoped.  Mentally Im fantastic and Im even working a little more, which is fantastic as Ive been denied SSD twice.  Before you make a decision to make Kratom an illegal drug, I want you to consider a few points:\n\n1)\tKratom is safe.  Its virtually impossible to overdose on it.  Unlike heroin or opiates, the more you take does not equal a better high.  In fact, Kratom doesnt make me high at all.  It is not a danger to our citizens.\n2)\tThere are not enough rehabilitation facilities available for people in need.  By making Kratom illegal, you are forcing an already terrible drug epidemic to become even worse.\n3)\tThere is NO proof that Kratom is dangerous.  People around the world have been using it for centuries, if not thousands of years.\n4)\tKratom is the best choice for me and living with chronic pain.  There are thousands of me out there.  Dont take away a natural leaf that has helped so many with pain, PTSD, anxiety and other ailments.\n\nIn closing, thank you for your time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22485","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"JENNIFER BLAIR","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not outlaw my means of obtaining kratom.

Kratom supports my health and energy and helps me to be the productive member of society that I am.\n\nKratom is not mind-altering. If it were, I wouldn't be able to ever use it. I need - and want - to be alert and present. It lifts the mood slightly, like coffee but without the jitters. In fact, it a relative of the coffee plant.  It could hardly be described as a drug - the effects are much closer to caffeine and nowhere near even as strong the legal herb kava kava. They do not come anywhere close to anything else in the Schedule 1 Category. This plant with hundreds of years of safe use in its native culture does not produce a \"high\" or euphoria; anyone looking to kratom for a high will be sorely disappointed. The fact that head shops market it deceptively is not a reason to deprive responsible and productive adults of its benefits.\n\nIt's also not addictive, and as a former cigarette smoker who battled the addiction for a good seven years before I was finally able to quit all tobacco forever, I have personal knowledge and experience of what is and is not mentally and physically addictive.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason this supplement should be scheduled by the DEA. I am a law-abiding citizen who contributes to society and I can't imagine a peaceful person like me being put in jail for the occasional enjoyment of a tea leaf. I am kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2881","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Love kratom looking for a good vendor if you send a sample so i can be a loyal customer","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4303","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sebastian Silva","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been taking kratom regularly for a year now and it has done nothing but improve my life.

Keeping kratom legal will help the opiate crisis, giving people a natural alternative to them and a safer way to withdraw from dependence. I have seen this first hand in my carreer. At my place of work we sell kratom to the most diverse demographic of people for a diverse range of ailments. It helps people work and be able to have a normal life after opiate dependence, chronic pain, and all types of problems.

My name is Jennifer Walden. I am 30 years old and I am a certified nursing assistant. I oppose the D. E. A.  Trying to ban kratom. I have been using kratom now for almost a year. I heard about it from a friend that was using it for back pain. They told me about it when I had a problem with abusing opiates. I was skeptical at first but I tried it and it helped me tremendously with my withdrawal symptoms. I tried to quit using opiates many times before but I would relapse because I just could not deal with the withdrawal symptoms. I have been clean now for almost a year and it's all because of kratom. If this ban goes through it will be a major set back for me. I agree that maybe there should be some regulations on kratom as far as how old you should be to by it. I do not think if you are under 18 you are responsible enough to follow the instructions on how kratom should be used. But to totally ban this wonderful plant would be terrible. It can help other people like me who want to stop abusing opiates but just can't deal with these awful withdrawal symptoms.

Could it be that we are simply waiting for big pharma to patent the chemicals found naturally in Kratom and then add some more harmful, unnatural and dangerously addictive chemicals to make it not only more potent but deadly?  I hate to be cynical but what else could it be?  The evidence, the myths, the debunked claims and numbers just don't add up.\n\nI am not a user, never have been and hope to never need to be (though I don't even like to take Tylenol or Advil if I can help it).  But for people with real problems, with those that are strung out and can't kick their drug addiction, and those who live with daily arthritic pain, or the stress (another major killer just on its own), why not wait until we have conclusive evidence from the FDA?   Don't listen to the big pharma lobbyists, let American's have the freedom to avoid the highly addictive and dangerous pharmaceuticals like Vicodin and street drugs like Heroin when they get cut off by their insurance and resort to that disgusting street drug, and let them have the choice of taking something that could save them.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17465","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dan Molina","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not think Kratom or any part of the Kratom plant should be scheduled.

The normalcy of my life is in jeopardy and I'm terrified of going to a doctor in my town where everyone knows everyone else. It might be the end of my career.\n\n\n Please consider this when making your decision. Kratom doesn't seem to cause respiratory depression which is the deadly effect of morphine derived opiates and opioids.  Kratom is not pleasant to consume. It tastes awful and even when taken in capsule form 6 .5g pills is a lot to swallow at once.  Kratom is not very pleasant at higher doses. My experiments have told me it's not worth consuming more Kratom to get higher, because you don't get high you just feel weird. Kratom does not affect my ability to do my job. Kratom withdrawal is nowhere near as bad as other opioid medications. I've taken breaks and definitely felt weird for a day or two but not like full opiate withdrawal. Thanks for reading.

Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n\n4. Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n\n5.

I really wanted to have something Natural that would work with my body and not have the roller coaster effects  like i do on my current med. You see i was a nurse for many years and broke my back i have nerve damage intense chronic  pain and many issues with balance walking etc. Most days even on the meds i was locked in my bed and depression is a major problem. I made my first purchase and it was truly life changing. The constant pain that is my life everyday was less i had slept for 4 hours for the first time in 8 years and i felt better my husband noticed my leg didn't drag as much  as it normally did when my pain levels are high and he said i laughed again. I love being there again for my family and friends i know theres no miracle drug but nature is providing us with something that is darn close and we just might find it helps so much with so many different issues its worth the chance to find out what it can do. Lets turn more towards nature and natural meds than the chemicals we take now that pollute our minds and bodies so that we can have that life with our families doing the the things we love with those we love once again.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7456","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Arica Shupe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, I am a war veteran I spent 8 months in Afghanistan 2012-2013.

I have personally witnessed the many great benefits this all natural plant has to offer from my own personal experience. Kratom alleviated my spinal and joint pain and helped to diminish my anxiety, it also helped me to get my blood pressure regulated within normal limits.  I am also aware of many others that have benefitted from its use, as well from listening and reading their spoken and written testimonials. I have two sons that are veterans of the war in Afghanistan, one who is disabled from PTSD, Depression, Anxiety and Degenerative Disc Disease.  He was having to use large amounts of narcotic medications prescribed by the VA doctors, to regain control of himself upon re-entry to society, and through the use of Kratom he was able to stop using all of these medications completely! He has also since stopped using Kratom altogether without any adverse side effects OR withdrawal symptoms. I have yet to see or hear of one single person exhibit or claim any adverse or negative effects from its responsible use, including the \"intoxication\" claim that is being circulated.  It is my opinion, that it simply does NOT make a person intoxicated and it does NOT cause addiction, which I am basing on my personal previous use and observations of others use. I urge those of you at the DEA that are involved in this decision making process to leave Kratom readily available to the public and allow it to remain legal and unscheduled for use by responsible adults.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChris R.

I was first introduced to kratom seven years ago through a friend I was working with. He told me it would give me some energy and also help with my aches and pains. (Our job included a lot of heavy lifting and running around.) I was pleasantly surprised with the effects and have continued using it through these last seven years. I don't use it everyday, but I try to make sure I do always have some available for difficult times or emergencies. A good example of this is recently I twisted my back and was experiencing some pretty excruciating pain. A little kratom helped me sleep throughout the night, and the next day the pain had mostly subsided. I attribute that healing to the work of my own body, but the kratom helped bring the pain down to a manageable level. I rarely ever go for pharmaceuticals, and being stuck with them as my only option is a huge concern to me, as I believe this ban on kratom could lead to a ban on other herbs which are also not fully understood or researched. My biggest personal concern is that this ban would go into effect and years down the line I may end up in situation where kratom could be a huge benefit to me, but be unavailable. I know there are millions of people in this country that rely on kratom to help them with many different ailments. It's tough to imagine what would happen to all of those people, or any of us (as we age we all will develop more and more physical ailments) if kratom is mislabeled as a danger and put into scheduling with the DEA. I really hope you will allow for more research to be done on kratom, and continue to allow it to remain legal.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChris Wilkie","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20915","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Wilkie","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I retract my earlier statements.

I am addressing the Dea in regards to the scheduling of Kratom. I would like to thank you for the many wonderful things that you provide for this country, but I so believe that the attempt to ban the legal use of such a wonderful medicine that mother nature has given us, is unnecessary and out of line with the oath  that you take to protect us.  In light of the prevailing drug use in this country and around the world,  it would seem the use of a natural and harmless herb that is obviously helping so many that have stood up the tell their story,  would be a welcome alternative to the other options out there.  Without this plant,  many people will have no choice but turn to medicines that are killing them, as they have killed so many already. I do plead with you to consider the long term consequences of such a decision.  I suffer from several ruptured disc in my neck which leaves me in pain everyday.  For 9 years now I have suffered.  For the first 3 years I turned to doctorsfor help which led me to pain pills.  I was still in pain and gathered more problems from their use.  I happened upon Kratom while searching for herbs to help me with my inability to function,and it had given me my life back!  I can't explain it but this herb is unlike any other. Relief, energy,  motivation, nutrition, and a smile I have not smiled in many years.  I can now make it through the day with my five children and wife, sharing it with them after losing so many days to the pain.  I have started a small farm, when I thought i was bound to the bed for the rest of my life.  I plead with you to not stand in the way of healing ourselves with the magic of mother natures medicine! For even God spoke for the herbs to heal us! Please do not make criminals of us for taking our lives into our own hands.  That is a crime against nature and humanity.  Thank you so kindly for hearing all of us, who speak from our hearts. Keep up the good fight, and protect us, don't condemn us for trying to be healthy. Please understand that this ban will label us as drug users out of the very people trying not to use drugs in the first place.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15354","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dwayne Creekmore","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing in response to the possible withdrawal of Kratom from the public domain.

I have a broken vertebra.  Surgery is possible but is dangerous and carries a questionable outcome.  Eventually, I will have to have that operation. \n  However, in the meantime, I cope with the pain using 10 mg of Hydrocodone-- 120 tablets per month. I need every one of them.  I am not addicted to the hydrocodone beyond the need to reduce the pain.  I have searched for other remedies to help prevent me from becoming truly addicted and reduce the strain on my liver from the acetaminophen. Missouri and the VA do not recognise legal medical marijuana. I discovered that kratom works well as a hydrocodone substitute.  I have been using kratom in moderation, the Red Thai variety (known for pain relief properties) and can find no negative side effects beyond slight constipation. As I mix the karatom powder with fiber, this is not a problem.  While it may be possible to over dose on kratom, or become addicted, the amount needed for either I feel would be self-prohibiting in most cases.  I pay for the katrom on my own as the VA has no knowledge of this herb.  It is not cheap. If this pain relief option is legally removed, I will have no other viable legal pain relief options besides hydrocodone or the dangerous operation that carries no guarrantee of success, and may even increase the pain.\n I am 58 years old, hold a BS in political science, have traveled broadly in the US Navy, and until 2014 (when the pain became too great), was a marathon kayaker who has three times paddled across the state of Missouri in less than 80 hours (340 miles). I am not a drug addict. I research and prepare for, and test anything I undertake that may be dangerous, including my kratom use.  I ask that you consider my testimony and at least commission a medical evaluation of kratom before removing this pain mediation substance that, so far, is far less dangerous than the narcotic prescription medicines that are the only legal avenue for thousands of patients like me.   \n Thank you for your consideration and time.  \nBest regards,\nMartin Woodward","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18019","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Martin Woodward","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"More research needs to be done on this plant before we make it a schedule 1.

I tried countless different pills and none of them worked nearly as well as Kratom. I drank Kratom everyday for over a year, and when i stopped in September, I had practically no withdrawals other than trouble sleeping. If you compare that to the withdrawals of opiates or prescription anti-anxiety drugs it is nothing. Why would you ban a plant that has minuscule withdrawals? I think this brief explanation already clarifies that Kratom has a medical use and a low potential for abuse. Kratom is nearly impossible to overdose on unless you combine it with other drugs. If you drink too much Kratom then you just vomit before it can even be absorbed into your bloodstream. If the DEA is aware of the safety and benefits of Kratom and still wants to ban it, then they are not working to help the citizens of the United States of America. Banning Kratom will only hurt the people, other than companies who profit from addiction and pain.

It is mild and I don't need to use it every day just when the pain gets out of hand.  I have not experienced any negative effects and has made my life better.  I am not a junkie and am actually a VP for an auto finance company.  Further, my wife is a nurse practitioner and recommends this to chronic pain patients vs prescribing opiates.

When I take kratom I feel no pain but I can still be a functional human being and get my work done. Please consider keeping kratom legal for the millions of people who use it safely and effectively.

I am a 22 year old head chef for a nonprofit organization. I pride myself on the fact that I am a professional young adult who has had a steady job since I entered the workforce at 16. When I was notified that Kratom was becoming a schedule 1 controlled substance it did anything but put my mind at ease. Around three years ago my husband started taking Kratom to help with his anxiety and the fact that he has a very physically taxing job that would cause him to come home after an 8 or 10 hour shift and fall asleep. Now this doesn't sound like a lot but seven days a week for two years having your husband come home and go to sleep directly after getting off work is a little taxing on one's relationship. My husband was introduced to Kratom and there was a drastic increase in the energy as well as, just being present in the moment. I also found that the amount of anxiety attacks that my husband suffered radically was decreased. We have A 3 year old son as anybody know hat is taxing in and of itself. My husband was now able to come home and spend more quality time and help me with the baby and be less concerned about the things that was giving him anxiety and more concerned about spending quality time in the golden years of our child's life. I've seen what drug use can do,so has my husband,and there are no positive side effects from drugs that should be and are outlawed. Kratom is not one of those. In conclusion I believe that marking Kratom a as a schedule 1 controlled substance would be an immediate health risk not only for our family but for the people in the Kratom Community who use it as a way to cope.

They adopt a new look of the world and are brutally honest and that is a sign I look for.  As I watch them try to get back into life I see how hard it is.  So when I ask them why Kratom isn't a drug.  I hear them all say it helps them kick the addiction and work without crippling pain from the meth addiction.  I ask them why not take the pharma pill and they quickly complain it isn't very good and is very expensive.  So that pharma company will make a lot of money is a simple natural flower herb gets banned.  I have watched their lives very closely and I see the change in their lives.  Kratom has given them back a life and they have gotten jobs and they aren't are zombied out like I see in drug addicts.  They talk clearly and lively and they carry on conversations about what they  want.  It is clear Kratom is helping them.  I ask them what side effects they think they have.  They said a few and I forget them but they added the pharma pill had more side effects.  I think it should be looked at very carefully before banning as we don't have many medicines for ex drug addicts.  This country has a huge drug problem and Kratom looks like a solution and not a problem to me.  All of my friends do take the doses in the normal amounts because its not a drug so they don't over dose on it.  They can afford it and they take the recommended amount because it does cost them money but much cheaper than the pharma pill. Kratom helps heal meth addicts and that is priceless.  I can honestly say I've seen these people turn their lives around and Kratom has been a part of that.  These people could easily end up dead and now I see them smiling and enjoying life and that is good.

I was underthe care of several doctors that specialized in pain management for 16 years. I was subjected to weekly nerve block injections in my face and prescribed many opioid medications for my condition.  I was also prescribed anti depressants for my bipolar disorder. I could not function as a productive member of my family let alone society. I was in a fog, falling asleep standing up whole at work and unable to care for my children properly. I became physically addicted to my  pain medication and my bipolar medication (I tried several), did help my mood swings but left me either too tired to function or suicidal from the side effects. I weaned off my pain medication with a Dr's help but continued to suffer with excruciating pain on a daily basis and I was unable to take any medication to manage my bipolar condition. I began researching natural pain relievers and I found information about Kratom. I began consuming kratom tea in May of this year and for the first time in more than 18 years I am pain free. My moods are stable and my anxiety has lesson ed considerably. I never would have imagined that I could live a life where I would be a productive citizen again but it's happening. Two years ago I applied for social security disability. Last week I was able to apply for a job instead. This plant, this tea that I drink a few times each day has given me back my life. It has given my family back their daughter, their mother. I implore of you to please reconsider making Kratom a schedule 1 drug. This plant when used properly is a miracle not a danger. I would have no decent quality of life without it. I will not go back to taking all those pills with their horrible side effects and physical dependance. I want to be free to use nature to help me live a pain free and productive life. I want to be free to drink Kratom tea each day without having to worry about breaking the law. It's a leave, it's tea, it's not a danger to society. I'm just a normal everyday woman and I deserve a normal life. Kratom helps me maintain that normal life. Thank you for your time. I truly appreciate your taking the time to read this. And I firmly believe that kratom saves lives.

Not only that, but that the DEA didn't think to ask what we the people thought about it before trying to place the ban at first. I have heard the rumors that kratom has been used in high octane drug cocktails, and unfortunately Kratom being mixed into these drinks with other drugs has become \"guilty by association.\" I honestly don't understand why any drug addicts and/or drug dealers would even think to use kratom because it doesn't get you high. I have also heard the rumors abut the deaths \"caused by kratom,\" and again kratom becomes guilty by association because every single one of those people who had died were also using other drugs. Now for my story; I use to be a drug addict, but I have been clean for 8 years. Needless to say, once I started recovery I have been conscientious of the things I put into my body because I know I have a very addictive personality. I was leery of kratom at first because like I said I know I have to watch myself due to my addictive personality, but once I tried it I had no worries at all. I turned to kratom because I did not want to get put on anymore anti-depressants.I have been working really hard in therapy to overcome PTSD and depression, but I still needed a little boost to take the edge off. I had tried so many other herbal supplements such as ginkgo biloba, b12, Tribulus terrestris, Ashwagandha root, green tea extract, Maca, korean panax ginseng, stresstabs (Wal-mart), and 5-HTP. I have only been researching and trying natural remedies for two years, and that was how I found Kratom. When I use kratom I do get sort of a euphoric feeling, but it only lasts for about 20 min. I love how it gives me energy, I feel my body relax, it really enhances my mood, but not to the extent that I get high, and it even helps my back pain in the mornings. I really don't see any way a person can get high off of this product. If anything, I think it would give a person a headache and maybe some nausea if they took too much. I truly feel kratom is a blessing, and an amazing/ more healthy alternative to most medication on the market today.

Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

I have a good job and a family I love. None of that would be possible if kratom were as dangerous as the DEA makes it out to be. I function 110% while on kratom. Nobody around me even knows I take it because you don't get high from it nor does it affect your motor skills. Below are some key facts that will clear up the most common misconceptions I've came across. \n\n-Kratom is in the coffee family and gives similar energy and mood boost. Unlike caffeine, kratom cannot be fatal in large doses. It can only cause dizziness and vomiting.\n\n-The 15 or so deaths reportedly caused by kratom are false. The victims had other, much more dangerous substances in their systems as well as kratom: alcohol, pain pills, and anti-depressants. Kratom has never caused a death by itself, unlike Tylenol and other over-the-counter medicines. The only time kratom was proved to be the culprit, it was found to be a modified form of kratom called Krypton. Kratom in it's raw, powdered or crushed form cannot kill you. It's impossible. If we banned every substance that has killed people we wouldn't have cars, household cleaners, or pretty much anything. More people have been killed by laundry detergent pods than kratom, for example.\n\n-Kratom works by acting on the same receptor as heroin and other opiates which is why it helps with addiction. It does not get you high, though. People confuse being high with an overall good feeling of well-being. Kratom being easily accessible by kids and sold at gas stations is a huge mistake. There's kids posting on social media talking about \"how messed up they are on kratom\". The only solution we need is to restrict sales to adults 21 years or older. This would solve all the negative images issues kratom is getting. \n\n -Kratom is no more addicting than caffeine and is much less addicting than tobacco and alcohol. Alcohol, cigarettes, and prescription pain pills are far more addicting and can fatal but yet they remain legal. Daily kratom users are no different than daily coffee drinkers.  Most kratom users can't start their day without kratom much like coffee drinkers can't start their day without coffee. \n\nIf kratom is banned there will be thousands of people forced to go back to harder drugs or prescribed dangerous pain pills. Kratom is a God-send for these people. Banning this plant will only increase our country's opiate addiction problem but will keep the DEA and rehab centers busy, which I think is the real reason kratom is in their cross-hairs. Here is this miracle plant, capable of helping people with opiate addiction, with zero side effects and the governments wants to take it away. People are turning to kratom instead of spending money on the poisons big pharma wants to feed them to \"cure\" them of addiction. I believe that is the real reason for the ban on kratom. The \"medicines\" rehab centers give addicts are far more dangerous and just as addicting, if not more, than the opiates they're addicted to.  This plant has saved the lives of thousands of former heroin addicts and it is simply morally wrong to ban this naturally growing plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10228","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Derek Hall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This herb is helping my poor son who suffers from Reactive Arthritis.

I quickly realized too, that my aches and pains from sports & exercise have greatly diminished over the years as well. I understand that once the DEA wants something they most certainly will not be easily persuaded, but I truly hope that these comments are read and understood with immense due diligence on the subject. There are very simple questions that we need to ask ourselves with this matter. What is the real reason that the DEA is classifying Kratom as a \"schedule 1 drug.\" Why does the DEA want this to be illegal? \n\nWhy is alcohol legal? Why did some states make weed legal? Why is nicotine legal? All are addictive and Alcohol/Nicotine can kill you via various health diseases. If someone with the DEA could give a very concrete answer as to why alcohol and nicotine are legal, but they want Kratom to be illegal, I would love to listen and try to understand the logic. Unfortunately for the DEA, I think we all know that you cannot. You simply cannot tell us that Alcohol and Nicotine are not worse for you than Kratom.

After 20 years of experiencing joint pain, swelling and redness, I found Kratom to help me cope with the pain and the depression that came with it. A friend of mine who also has a condition that causes chronic pain told me how Kratom helped her. I use to take the max dose of Ibuprofen during flare ups that sometimes lasted weeks. I became nervous of the effects the ibuprofen was having on my body when I started to have stomach problems every time I took the Ibuprofen. As a result of being in pain, being a mom of three beautiful daughters, a wife and owning and operating several businesses I became very fatigued and would sleep any time I could fit it in. My doctor prescribed me Ibuprofen for the pain and Prozac for the depression. I have been taking Kratom for the past two years and I am able to function normally and I have the energy I need to be a productive citizen. Kratom allowed me to cut back on the ibuprofen and the Prozac (which has horrible side effects) I hoped to wean myself off of the Prozac entirely with Kratom and I fear if Kratom is made a schedule 1 drug my quality of life will slide back to where it was before and that is unacceptable.\n\nSincerely,\nKimberly \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3065","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kimberly Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for reading my comment about kratom.

Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment would be immediately shut down.

Some time after starting his regimen he decided to try working again, and found a part time job. He also walks to the bus stop and has commented about the positive effects of some physical activity.  He still has days when his pain is intense and those days are very difficult. He is managing all of this without any medical insurance.

I started it, because of back issues from years ago, I began taking prescription pain killers, such as Norco, then suboxone, and at times muscle relaxers such as Soma. When in Norco, my tolerance got so high, and I had become so addicted, in my worst years, I could take over 40 pills a day, and had to make more Doctor trips, and at times exaggerate my symptoms to get more and prevent from being sick. After years, I was then prescribed suboxone, which at first was great, one lozenge a day, didn't get me as high as the pills, but prevented withdrawal. After another two years on Suboxone, I lost my insurance and had to go cold turkey, which is horrible if you have ever been through it, especially after 10 years of abuse, it's the worst pain imaginable, physically and emotionally, so I would still seek out opiates. I found Kratom in a smoke shop locally and it says it helps with pain and energy, so I tried it once when in total withdrawal, it didn't get me high at all, but the withdrawal symptoms were tolerable and bear gone, I couldn't believe it, a natural plant. Kratom helped me kick my addiction, and when it came time to get off Kratom, it was 10 fold easier than getting off of the pills, little discomfort and tiredness. I have now been using Kratom on and off for two years, it helps with my pain, as well as gives me energy and helps with my anxiety and mood as well, but does not incapacitate me, there is NO high at all, not like taking pills, it is so mild, that I don't think anyone would even try to abuse it, if they did, they may get a headache and feel Nautious, (as I have when testing my preferred dose). And my tolerance is high, since I used it to get off of these killers. Usually 15 grams per dose, anything past 20 just makes me Nautious, but you won't see anyone nodding off, or stealing from their grandmother to get this stuff. Please do not outlaw this natural substance. Just regulate it as an herbal supplement, maybe an age restriction and quality standards, but finally something natural gets found to help, for it to get taken away, would be very bad and very sad for many suffering people, thank you and regards, Justin Stoner.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7616","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Stoner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a great, non addictive alternative medicine for pain, depression, anxiety, and many other physical and psychological ailments.

I have swelling, stiffness, and pain in my hands knees and ankles. Kratom has given me increased quality of life, helping me to relieve pain and give me energy to get through my high paced work day. I am astonished at the amount of claims of Kratom causing addition and overdoses. I have had a little too much Kratom only once, and the only thing it did was made me nauseous. It has no side effects for me. As a Kratom user, I can tell you I've never done drugs, I don't drink, and have never smoked. I have gone weeks without Kratom and have never had any withdrawal effects. I don't feel reliant on this herb, BUT I can say it drastically improves my life. I might not be able to be a functioning member of society without it. I  am 100% opposed to a ban on this PLANT.

It has enabled me to overcome my inability to live a normal, happy, productive life that was ravaged by suicidal depression in which traditional treatments had failed me. A decision to prohibit kratom would result in me once again living a prohibited life devoid of happiness, productivity and a will to live.

When a friend encouraged me to try Kratom instead, I was skeptical but agreed; I can honestly say it may have saved my life. \nHad I not been introduced to Kratom, I would almost certainly have returned to a life of living from fix to fix. Instead, I actually became more productive, had more energy and coincidentally started sleeping again and living with less pain.\nI have never had any type of 'overdose' from Kratom - taking more than I need simply isn't appealing (I find it analogous to drinking too much coffee (both are botanically classified as members of the Rubiaceae family) which I also don't find appealing), but when I was still experimenting to find an appropriate dosage, when I did take more than ideal, it was in no way debilitating, it just didn't improve my quality of life.\nWhile I would like to believe that I have grown stronger as a person (spiritually, strong willed etc.), I do fear that if Kratom were no longer available, should I face another traumatic event in life I may fall into my old traps of addiction. \nI find the intention to schedule Kratom, especially as schedule 1, very difficult to understand, given its long history of use to treat opiate addiction and chronic pain.\nUnfortunately, there are people who will abuse Kratom, that can't be denied. But to take an important medicine away from everyone because of a small number of irresponsible individuals seems entirely contrary to our existing policies on psychoactive substances. Alcohol, tobacco, even many of our over-the-counter medications like Robotussin and Cordicidin are abused by countless people, but we accept that the benefits they provide outweigh the unfortunate potential for exploitation and abuse. \nI accept that there may be long-term negative effects from habitual Kratom use, but so far we just don't have that information, and the absence of knowledge as a justification for criminalization is not congruent with our way of governing. To the best of my knowledge, all deaths associated with Kratom have involved other illicit substances as well and can not be attributed confidently to Kratom alone.\n People deserve the right to manage their pain and psychological weaknesses (i.e. addictions) with affordable (I have been spending about $80/month, compared to hundreds or thousands with illicit and prescription opiates) and natural options, should a person not want/be able to participate in the outrageously expensive world of prescription drugs; and for people in recovery like myself, being given prescription opiate pain killers for surgery etc as the only option is very likely to lead a person back into addiction.\n This country faces a growing opiate crisis and I strongly feel that at this point we should not be eliminating any promising treatment options.\nI hope that very intentional and open-minded deliberation will be employed as the decision making process regarding the scheduling of Kratom continues to unfold. I thank you for taking the time to consider my experience.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22165","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rob Davis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Aloha, I am in favor of Kratom as a legal supplement in the United States.

The herb has become a very significant and positive force in my life, and I'd venture so far to say that it is an herbal treatment for those with opioid addiction.\n\nI'm a 35 year old successful business owner. I'm a property owner in Florida, I've been happily married for 10 years and we're raising a healthy 5 year old boy and 1 year old girl. I haven't touched an opioid in over 5 years thanks to discovering Kratom, of which I take a small daily dose of. The herb gives me a similar feeling to a cup of coffee, but also takes away the desire completely to want to do opioids. I consider the herb a miracle. \n\nDue to a snowboarding accident in 2002 in which I required a month long hospital stay, I became addicted to dilaudid through my IV without ever administering a drug on myself. Once I was healed, I could not stop taking the paid medications and turned to illegal means to support my habit. It was disasterous to my life.\n\nBut through the use of Kratom, I was able to stop using opioids and not need them again. My life is stable, productive, and fulfilling today. Whereas before it was not.\n\nI feel the DEA has overstepped their boundaries in this ban. I know many people that use Kratom for the same propose, and they also consider it a life saver. I should have the legal right to take this herb as a health supplement, and to call it dangerous or without medical use is a mockery of the DEA and our government's purpose. It's so far from being true, and in my experience Kratom is in fact very safe.\n\nIf people are legally permitted to drink alcohol and smoke tobacco, to say I can't take Kratom leaves is completely out of line and unjust. \n\nPlease hear us. We are good people living healthy lives. This ban will create more damage and heartbreak than it will prevent.\n\nI'm happy to share my story with anyone. I'm well known and respected in my communcity by the local business owners, media and residents as a business owner with 4 full time employees, and a young family of 4.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15237","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Heuwetter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am only speaking from personal experience.

Repetitive actions lead to pain that quite often made it impossible to work.  Later it was determined that I have fibromyalgia, and a host of back and neck issues. I wish I could name them all.  Years of doctor visits, following every instruction the various doctors gave me from medications to massage, physical therapy & acupuncture, I was finally told there was nothing more that could be done.  Everyday was, and is, one lived in pain.  Until I found kratom. It was briefly mentioned in a fibromyalgia support group.  Taking it has been a God-send. With narcotics, the pain never stopped. Yet with kratom, I have days that I forget that I have these syndromes. It truly has been a miracle for me.   It is NOT a cure, it is a treatment, just as I use black cohosh for  relief of menopausal symptoms, or magnesium for regularity. I have always lived my life \"naturally\". Choosing organic foods, dietary supplements, etc.  Being careful what I put in my body.  I take kratom in its powdered form, mixing it with a bit of orange juice. Within moments, the pain is gone.  I have no side effects with kratom, only pain relief and the thrill of living my life again.  I have been able to go for walks and even hikes with my husband, cook again, clean house--simple things that most take for granted.

I am a 32 year old stay at home mother to my three beautiful boys. I am also a proud Navy veteran. I served honorably as a hospital corpsman. From the age of 12 I have struggled with alcoholism and that took me to some extremely dark places. Most of my life I have been depressed and confused about my life and lack of direction. It seemed that as soon as I would get my life together, I would turn back to drugs and alcohol and wreck everything. \nOne night in 2014 I deeply harmed myself in an alcohol induced blackout. I jumped over 30 feet off of a balcony and badly fractured 6 vertebrae in my spine. I came very close to paralysis and it was a miracle I lived through this thoughtless act of stupidity. That night left me with horrible pain that I will probably have to deal with for a long time to come. After my injury I was given an obscene amount of pain meds that I would come to rely on. I didn't take long and my tolerance had gone up significantly. I have been on many different meds I couldn't list them if I tried. I abused my medication and would often run out early, then I turned to buying pain pills off the street. I was stuck in this cycle of using and withdrawals and I am not sure how I didn't overdose but I thank God every day I am here.\n I found kratom in 2015. I had a friend who was looking into natural remedies for pain and she was eager to tell me about this tea that could possibly help me function at a higher ability. I have never been much of an optimist but I put my judgement aside and said yes to trying something different. I was surprised by the amount of pain relief I experienced after trying this intriguing tea. I spent the next couple months getting off of opiates under my pain specialists care. I had heard so many positive stories about people successfully managing pain with just kratom that I thought I could do it too. Today I am off of pharmaceuticals, drugs of any kind, and alcohol. I finally have energy and motivation. I don't have to suffer the awful side effects that come with opiate use. Most importantly I am not risking my life on the streets to score oxy. I still have to work every day at my recovery by growing spiritually and helping others. Kratom is not my only answer but it does help with mood stability, focus, energy, sleep and pain relief. I am a proud, intelligent, contributing member of society today and am not sure what will happen if this plant is banned. I hope I would not have to go back to opiates but chances are high, because of the pain I live with.

I started using kratom 4 or 5 years ago. I had chronic migraine-type headaches starting about 15 years ago. Regular off the shelf pain medications did nothing. Sometimes I would use opiods or other prescribed pain killers but my doctor (wisely) switched me to non-opiod meds. Unfortunately, those weren't very effective. I found out about kratom while researching herbal remedies. This worked quite well. Finally, my doctor put me on blood pressure medication and the headaches stopped. However, my arthritis has gotten much worse in the last few years and now I use kratom on a daily basis. If there ever was a \"miracle\" herbal treatment, kratom is it. I have had a small sign business for 26 years. I work alone most of the time. I dig post holes and lug bags of concrete around. I carry 4' x 8' sheets of plywood. \nThe recent recession has cost me over $30,000.00 in lost IRA retirement funds. I HAVE to work as much as possible to survive. Without kratom the pain in my joints, legs, back, hands, etc. is debilitating. I am very careful about the amount I use and I don't abuse the plant or get \"high\" from it.

I am one of those people; for years I battled depression and anxiety, and turned to prescribed drugs and narcotics to help alleviate my dark thoughts and inability to function in a world that is fast-paced and unforgiving. \nLike so many others, kratom helped me overcome these debilitating illnesses, and allowed me to become the successful, ambitious man I am today. I eat well, I sleep well, I take care of myself, and I care about the life I have and those in it. It wasn't a matter of me being weak, it was a matter of finding who I am and aspire to be, which I have. So many others seek the same thing and more, and if the path that guides them to their better selves involves kratom, why is that such a bad thing? \nAny sound experiment will show kratom to be virtually harmless. I am an example myself; I used kratom for 2 years, used it as a pedastal to lift myself from the hell of my illnesses, and then discontinued use once I met my goals. I was a perfectly functional human being during my use, much more so than I before and during the doctor prescribed pills, more so than my alcoholic self, and just as much as I am now. \nI do not know the goal of the DEA's call to ban this wonderful healing herb, but whatever it is, it is based in unsound reason, if not absolute corruption. People have gone so far as to say the DEA is nothing more than the militried wing of the pharmaceutical industry; I don't believe this is the case, or at least, hope not. Regardless of the reason, it has been proven time and time again that this tactic of surpression and criminalization of any substance has been ineffective and even harmful to the public good.\n\nDo not ban kratom, discontinue the downward spiral that is the Drug War, and maybe then we will be able to come together and help everyone overcome their own demons without putting them in chains and locking them away.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20782","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Watson Fitts","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been a chronic pain patient for so long, the pills have hardly any effect anymore.

I have three kids, an elderly father and a husband that depend on me to keep the household and myself stable and I was failing at it. After discovering kratom I got my life back. The pain decreased, the fatigue decreased and I am able to take care of my family and enjoy living. A nice and unexpected side effect of kratom was that the symptoms of bipolar disorder improved.

I am grateful you have opened up the commenting period for the considered scheduling of kratom. I would like to express my vehement opposition to any scheduling of kratom. \n\n\nI have been using this natural supplement for four years to contribute to my mental state and general well-being. I have suffered from recurrent major depressive disorder for most of my adult life. In my early twenties, I found myself in a grave and deepening depression and I sought formal treatment for the condition. Over the course of two years I was rotated through half a dozen different pharmaceuticals with no success. Provided you haven't experienced that, you could try and imagine the pain, anguish, and hopelessness you would feel... but you'd be wrong.\n\n\nAt this point, in the darkest of places I've ever found myself in, my family and physicians tried something desperate; they put me on suboxone. The use of opiates was at the time, and still is now, a fairly radical and experimental approach to treatment resistant depression. However, my situation was growing quite severe, so I was prescribed suboxone and monitored by a licensed physician. In all likelihood, the decision probably saved my life. I was at a point where something needed to change. \n\n\nHowever, suboxone doesn't really lend itself to great overall health, or a productive lifestyle, over the long term. The side effects are significant; extreme constipation, severe nausea, hypogonadism (I needed to self-administer testosterone injections), zero sex drive (probably because of the hypogonadism), and fatigue/excessive sleep. Additionally, since the treatment was so radical, insurance wouldn't cover the costs of the treatment, which was exorbitant. I used suboxone as a crutch to finish my degree, a BAS in Computer Technology, and then voluntarily quit taking it. The hope was that enough time had passed, that enough in my life had changed and I would no longer need it. But this is a condition I am stuck with, and I found myself still needing help every now and again. \n\n\nThis is when I discovered kratom. It is a beautiful herbal supplement. I use kratom to elevate my mood when my depression gets the better of me. There is no cure for depression, but kratom helps me and contributes to my mental well-being. Despite some of what your notice of intent stated, kratom is remarkably safe. Studies, such as those done by Dr. Kruegel and Dr. Boyer, have evidenced that the risks of respiratory depression (the leading cause of death associated with opiate use) is not consistent with the effects of kratom. When I use kratom, it elevates my mood and provides a sense of well being without clouding my judgment or interfering with my cognitive abilities. The most significant side effect I have experienced, in four years' time, has been mild nausea.  \n\n\nIt is my sincerest hope that all of the comments you have received enlighten your perspective and correct your misconception. Kratom isn't a party drug. We aren't drug addicts teetering on the precipice of self-destruction. We don't need you to save us from ourselves. We are responsible men and women of all ages and walks of life. We are your neighbors and productive members of society. For different reasons, and in different circumstances, we found this wonderful and safe herb that helps us be those things; kratom contributes to our overall health and quality of life. You do not have the moral authority to deprive us of that.

It ha allowed me to keep a full time job doing remain a productive member of society, rather than having to go on disability and become a public burden instead/ If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people like me will be criminalized and could be locked up behind bars. Our prisons are already bursting to the brim and the last thing we need is to increase the number of nonviolent prisoners, especially those just seeking relief from chronic pain or other conditions. We already imprison far too great a portion of our population, certainly relative to other civilized countries but even just objectively. \nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement. I have used Kratom for many years as a treatment for fibromyalgia. I have never experienced any negative effects, and the positive effects are far greater than any that prescription medications have provided - without any of the terrible side effects. For example, one of the drugs I was prescribed gave me serotonin syndrome, a life-threatening condition from which I narrowly escaped death. Now I cannot tolerate any substances that affect serotonin production and still, years later, am struggling with the effects of serotonin syndrome. \nThe few so-called Kratom-related deaths all involve other, much more dangerous substances that are doubtless the true cause of death rather than Kratom. To suggest otherwise is simply disingenuous. \nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it. Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose. For instance, in Alabama, when Kratom was banned, they saw the number of opiate addictions and consequent deaths rise immediately. \nCompassion for those struggling with conditions that can be safely treated with Kratom use is what is called for in this situation. Regulation to control for quality would help ensure that users do not end up with contaminated substances. An all-out ban,treating Kratom as if it were as dangerous as heroin, will criminalize more non-violent people who simply want to alleviate conditions that prescription drugs don't work for, and sometimes produce sometimes life-threatening side-effects. Please act on the side of public safety and compassion, keeping Kratom legal.

A carpenter by trade and have been a semi regular consumer of kratom for 4 years now. I have used it for numerous and varying reasons. Anything from relieving the pain of an aching back to using it for a \"pick me up\", similar to how people use coffee.\nWhere I have found kratom to be most helpful to me is in my addiction. I have fought a heroin addiction for 5 years now and in the past year have used the kratom to help manage my cravings.  It doesn't get me high by any means but merely stabilizes my mood you could say. It is an absolute God send when going through opiate withdrawals. In fact I was never able to successfully make it all the way through the withdrawal by myself until I started using the kratom to ease the withdrawal. I can honestly credit kratom with saving my life, loosening the grip of the terrible heroin addiction. \nI have never seen a real negative effect from kratom. No unbearable withdrawal, no possibility of being hurt by kratom if you consume too much- just an upset stomach and a desire to not take too much again. Again kratom has been a true miracle in my life and while I understand why many drugs are illegal, and should be, kratom does not even come close to being comparable to these illegal drugs. I've seen it to be almost exclusively positive for everyone who has used it. It is truly akin to a cup of coffee but with more benefit than just a little extra energy. \nPlease look into this matter more closely and I'm sure you'll find that it should not be made illegal. It is truly a magical plant.  Alcohol is accepted for its mood altering effects and kratom is MUCH milder than alcohol. Asprin or willow bark is accepted and legal while offering similar pain killing qualities. Suboxone is commonly prescribed to help the suffering addict and kratom can offer similar relief from cravings and withdrawal but doesn't cause the user to need to continue to take it because it doesn't make you physically dependent on it the way that Suboxone does. \nI offer you my final plea- please do not do this country and the people who benefit from kratom the injustice of scheduling this herb in the same way as heroin, pain pills, Crystal meth, cocaine, etc.  It would be a beastly travesty. An unexplainable and unconscionable decision that would needlessly make many millions of people's lives harder. \n\nThank You,\nMatthew Frantz","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5752","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Frantz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 40 year old responsible adult female. I suffer chronic pain & weakness associated with Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy, bulging discs, sciatic nerve pain & degenerative disc disease. I was on dangerous pharmaceutical pain medications for a decade. While taking these medications I had to continuously take more medications to combat the side effects of other medications. It was a vicious cycle that caused more harm than good. I tried numerous times to quit taking these medications because they eventually stop working. I ended up in the ER every time due to horrible withdrawal symptoms. I felt hopeless in this situation. Then one day I saw a post in my chronic pain support group on Facebook. The member stated she was able to stop all her dangerous medications & return to a productive life because of a plant leaf called Kratom. I was intrigued. I did some research & placed an order. It was the best decision I ever made. I've been taking Kratom for a year & a half. Since starting, I've been able to quit taking all my pain, depression & anxiety medications. I've been able to do more in the past year & a half then I have in the previous ten.\n\nI believe I have the right to take a herbal supplement of my choice. I don't think it's right to have to fight my government for fear they will take away my Constitutional rights. Adult Americans do not need mothered by an unelected agency of government. Banning this substance will cause even more opioid overdose & death. I was in a dark & lonely path to death, like most everyone that's on pain medications for an extended amount of time.

This herb has made it possible for me to have a full and happy life, and to be the mother my children need. Personally, I was barely able to make it through high-school, most days I stayed home and laid in bed. I had been in a bad car accident at the age of 13, a hit and run where the car I was passenger in landed upside down in a ditch. My back has never been the same since, even with months of physical therapy and chiropractic visits, visits that I can no longer afford to keep up with. A lot of my teen years were spent in bed where I should have been out with friends. I failed classes and got into trouble with teachers because I couldn't bring their text books to class with me because of their weight, and that was when I actually was able to get out of bed. I was placed in hospital home bound (an over the phone schooling option) but that could only go on so long. To sum this up, my childhood after 13 yrs was utterly miserable. A friend of mine introduced me to Kratom about 6 years back. I was skeptical at first, after all pain relievers didn't do anything and I was terrified of staying on pain killers more than a month or so at a time, I didn't want to add one more of my family to the list of crippling narcotic addicts. I finally gave in and tried it, I was desperate to find anything to help. We'll fast forward down the line 6 years and I am happily married, raising two beautiful children, a stay at home mom (actually able to pick up my kids which I never thought would be possible!), homeschooling my oldest and actively being the caretaker for my sons CKD as well. I truly believe that the supplement has given me the opportunity to live a full life and has given my family the chance to see the real me that was suppressed for so long. I'm finally free to live with manageable pain and without living a life of addiction.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5298","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Taylor Harrington","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Any sort of scheduling of kratom would be a disaster for so many people who benefit from this plant.

Opiate painkillers just mask my pain but this actually stops it. \nAs well when I started to come off of my opiate painkillers because I felt comfortable enough to rely on Kratom instead, this herbal supplement stopped my opiate withdrawal effects from being uncomfortable so I could make a straight change from painkillers to the kratom without weaning down off the opiates.\n I can tell you right now as I am sitting in great pain waiting for my morning Kratom tea to kick in, this works much more efficiently, faster, cleanly, and  less side effects as do painkillers. I have never experienced anything negative from it and I am just grateful to find something that can take me off of these horrible pain killers that I've been taking so long but my body became dependent on them.

This natural plant is just fine as an alternative health maintenance supplement.\n\nKratom in recent years helped me get my life back from a dependency to legally prescribed by my doctor, opioid/opiate pain medications (hydrocodone) for an injury that required two surgeries, ambien/zolpidem for my lifelong chronic insomnia, and  Xanax for withdrawal symptoms of hydrocodone and ambien....Xanax just made my dependency worse.\n\nI chose not to go to rehab or see mental health professionals under my right to refuse medical treatment.  This due to the public's associated unfair stigma of mental health and drug rehab.\n\nThat right also should give me the freedom to use any tool or alternative supplement I see fit to better myself.  No law says I can't self improve alternatively and no law should come about barring such freedom. \n\nKratom I feel helped save my life.  It saved my life from potentially overdosing on hydrocodone and ambien, and it saved my life due to the near fatal state the withdrawals put me through. Withdrawal lasted 9 months, and it was hell.  However, Kratom helped make it possible to actually survive the seizures, the emotional aspects, the physical illness, the cravings for the prescriptions, the stroke level blood pressure, the insomnia, the pain, and the insanity of withdrawal.  It made me productive where I could work, pay bills and become a responsible husband to my wife again.\n\nI successfully handled a serious withdrawal without rehab because I used extremely rigorous physical exercise, good diet, determination, and supplementation with Kratom.\nI would not be here to write this letter today if it were not for Kratom. I feel I would be another death statistic of our country's opioid epidemic.  I have seen many things with my eyes in my  previous years in law enforcement that I feel  Kratom could have played a role in helping people with.\n\nLast year in 2015 I became ill and inherited a health condition from my mother.  I have tested positive for Multiple Sclerosis.  Though need further testing and treatment for my illness are very harsh and also far too expensive for me to afford.\n\nThe symptoms of my new neurological condition are often very harsh physically and psychologically.  Kratom has helped me with the symptoms of depression, anxiety, fatigue, extreme pain, optic nerve stress (visual impairment), cognitive ability, and reduced my heat intolerance due to my neurological disorder.\n\nYou might say that Kratom needs to be a drug if it helps with all this.  But I say absolutely not because I don't believe in drugs.  Neither does millions of other people.  I believe in treating myself when I possibly can.  I also believe in the right to self treat with any alternative herbal supplement I see fit that works and does not hurt me, which Kratom does not.  I do not feel any illicit effects from Kratom, nor do I get addicted when I use it.  I have stopped using Kratom very easily every time I was ready to with no withdrawal effects.\n\nKratom is quite sobering, not intoxicating.  The effects are very mild.  The only thing it might do that you would want to call elicit about it is that it gives me a positive attitude.  And there's no law against that either.  In fact this day in age there's not enough of that.\n\nI don't believe millions of peoples' testimony about Kratom is \"anecdotal evidence\", as there are just as many witnesses who can testify that it has helped their loved ones live again.  Also, you don't see heroin addicts, coke addicts, meth addicts and alcoholics on Capitol Hill petitioning and protesting to say that their heroin, coke, meth, and alcohol has saved their lives. They are saying that Kratom has given them their lives back from these horrible drugs.\n\nIf you take away Kratom, schedule Kratom, or turn Kratom into a dangerous drug, you will only be in the opinions of millions making matters worse.\n\nWe The People have the power help in the drug war and we can do our part more effectively with Kratom readily available.  Please let us do our part in this war on drugs and let us use whatever alternative herbal supplements we see fit to help GET OFF DRUGS.  Leave Kratom to us.  It is helping millions of people get off of heroin and other opiate/opioid substances, street drugs and pharmaceuticals, not becoming further addicts.\n\nKratom turned into a pharmaceutical will just be covering it with beuraucratic red tape, making it impossible for millions of people who need it to access it.  It will only end up being priced so high by the medical community that only certain income classes could have it.  This will only put millions at risk to the citizens of our country who need it the most.  Furthermore, outlawing/scheduling Kratom will be a disservice to this country.\n\nThank you for your time","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3085","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dustin Barr","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA,\n\nI am a Purple Heart recepient, Marine corps veteran and I ask that you leave kratom alone.

I was blown up on 7 different occasions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The va insists on putting me on a god awful regiment of drugs/chemicals that cause more harm than good. I find that this naturally occuring plant treats my symptoms better than any drug the va has offered and I am very happy with the results. Further I know this is also the case with many of my Marine brothers.  I have been using this plant for two years now and the only negative side affect I have noticed is increased tolerance. I have not experience any physical or psychological withdrawals when I I do not use this plant. Because I use it as needed sometime I go a month or two before exhibiting ptsd/tbi symptoms and do not need it. However typical use is 1-2 times per week.  I want you to know that not only should you not classify this plant, you should proceed with rescheduling cannabis as well.

Please take into consideration the below comments, as I have very stron personal and professional view points.\n\n     I am a 36 year old registered nurse and mother to a very rambunctious 3 year old and 5 year old.  I was also diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis when I was 27.  The last 9 years has been an ongoing struggle just to maintain a quality of life.  The options for pain management are very slim as I have looked for any alternative to opioids. I can not take  them and work a 12 hour shift where my focus has to be laser sharp at all times because it could mean the difference between life and death. However, as I get older the pain blunts my focus as well. Depression also becomes an issue, as I have had to miss out on a lot of family activities, functions, celebrations, and just day to day excitement with 2 little ones. I was diagnosed with microscopic colitis in 2015 with OTC ibuprofen being a major culprit in the cause. As one can see, it becomes a delicate balancing act to control my pain with pain medications and work a full time job, and enjoy my beautiful children.  I see a little glimmer of hope in this never ending tunnel of struggle.\n\n     The opioid crisis in the United States is alarming.  There has become a stigma created while trying to get the addiction to opioids under control. Most chronic pain sufferers do not want to be on these medications, however it has become almost a basic life necessity to maintain some quality of life.   We struggle with the guilt of having such debilitating diseases, of relying on opioid medication, and of the world now viewing all people on long term narcotics as \"drug addicts\" or \"drug seekers.\" I have witnessed more and more patients struggling to find a primary care physician that will even accept a chronic pain patient, as well as seeing doctors under treat pain in the hospital for fear of the possibility of addiction. I have witnessed patients become addicted by way of necessity and not by choice, and it a sad process to see these patients struggle.\n\n      The research that has been published thus far on the compounds in Kratom that are showing promise to control pain and be non-addicting is a huge breakthrough and an exciting time in the medical community.   I have read testimonies of people who have used Kratom to get off heroin. The possibilities are very exciting and further research must be done. Kratom could be the answer to so many issues, such as, acute and chronic pain and rehabilitation of current addictions.  I feel if we throw this possibility away now it would be a huge disservice to the entire human race.  There is almost a 100% guarantee that every person will have a pain related issue at some point in there life. The ability to control ones pain without the possibility of addiction is definitely something that deserves more research. Please support the option to further the study and research of Kratom.   Please support and help advocate for millions of Americans.\n\n     Thank you for your time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15080","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kelly Ash","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 59 years old and a chronic pain sufferer.

I have degenerative bilateral osteoarthritis in my knees. I have had 4 surgeries in the past 6 years. Due to my young age, I am not yet a candidate for joint replacement surgeries and therefore live in constant pain. My surgeon has suggested on many occasions that I begin a pain management routine that would consist entirely of taking ongoing opioid analgesics. I have refused this treatment as I value my upbeat personality and sharp wit. On the occasions following surgeries that I have taken prescribed opioids, I have felt nausea, lethargy, and depression. 4 years ago I found Kratom through an online chronic pain support group forum. This natural herbal remedy that has been used in its unadulterated form for hundreds, if not thousands of years in the east has been a godsend. I still experience some pain but Kratom reduces the pain to a tolerable level and enables me to live a normal life. I have experienced no adverse side effects similar to opioids. Kratom does not get me high. Those seeking a recreational intoxication from this herb must be largely disappointed. I have been disgusted watching head shops trying to market this miracle herb as some sort of new legal high akin to bath salts. These two things should never be considered in the same category. Banning kratom will leave me only two choices: 1. Live in horrible pain. 2. Start taking opioids and live life as a nauseous depressed zombie.

In fact, they're less severe than those people experience when they're struggling with opipoid addiction.\n\nSpeaking of opipoid addiction, it's worsening. It's gotten so bad that people are labeling it an epidemic (despite that counting as a fear tactic.) If kratom was banned, this problem would worsen.\n\nIn addition, banning it would extend the war on drugs, which many of the public wants ended. We know that it doesn't work.

I started taking Kratom earlier this year for chronic pain as a result of Post Concussion Syndrome, migraines, siezures and Fibromyalgia. These conditions have caused me to become disabled. I wanted to find a natural alternative to what would have been and endless cycle of pain medicines with side effects that are sometimes worse that what I am already dealing with. In doing research I found Kratom and decided to try it. I can tell you without hesitation that it is the best thing I have done for not only me but for my family as well. It has allowed my to function at a better level than before. I have no side effects from Kratom like I do from narcotic pain medicine. It does not leave you with a \"foggy\" feeling as most many medicines do. I have not had to refill my migraine medicine in 6 months. Prior to taking Kratom I had to refill it every 6 weeks. \n\nI am asking that you not schedule this plant as it is helping so many people like myself and people who are using is for many other reasons i.e. withdrawals from opioids and alcohol, anxiety and depression. It truly is a wonderful, natural answer for so many people.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3535","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello Everyone. \nFor more than twenty years I've suffered from severe anxiety. When I'm really stressed, I pull out my eyelashes. It's ugly and embarrassing, causing even more anxiety. \n I have tried pharmaceutical medication and every herbal supplement available. \nNothing worked.\nEarlier this year a coworker recommended that I try Kratom. I'd never heard of it before, but I trusted my friend's judgment. \nMuch to my surprise, Kratom actually helps me! It lessens the urge to pull my lashes, and they have grown back. I feel human again! I can actually function like a normal person in public and not have to hang my head in shame - and actually look people in the eye now! \nThis herbal supplement, Kratom, has literally changed my life for the better. I would be devastated in so many ways if it were no longer legal and available to purchase from a trusted vendor. I cannot go back to the anxiety and bald eyes. \nPlease, PLEASE keep Kratom legal!\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2123","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sherry Ferrebee","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI wanted to voice my opinion on the issue of Kratom being possibly banned. In my experience of using it, it has helped me tremendously as far as my anxiety and depression goes. \n\nI used to abuse substances. I did this for a long time throughout my early 20s. It made me feel pathetic, and made life much, much harder for me. At some points I thought I would never make it in the world.\n\nI've come along way since then.\n\nOnce I found Kratom, it was a Godsend. I no longer crave wanting to get \"high\". I don't even crave Kratom when I don't take it, nor do I take it everyday. It's just something that helps me relax, helps my anxiety and depression, and in general eases up my tension.\n\nI don't drink alcohol, never have liked it. If people can have beer at night to relax, what's wrong with someone having an herb, one in the same family as coffee, to unwind?\n\nIf not for Kratom, I would probably be seeking out more harmful substances. I feel like, in a way, it has given me my life back.\n\nPlease take people like me into consideration, as well as everyone who uses it for things such as pain, sleep, and anxiety and depression like myself.\n\nI've never had any withdrawal from it, but again, I don't use it everyday. I don't get or feel \"high\" off it, just a general sense of calm and wellbeing. \n\nI think if we keep Kratom legal, it can help save a lot of lives, seeing as how we have an Opioid epidemic on our hands, prescription and non rx. \n\nPlease, don't ban this plant. It certainly seems to help not just me, but thousands of other people. People are not dropping dead from Kratom, but they are from Opioid overdoses.\n\nGod Bless, and thank you for reading.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11755","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brent Worley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I use Kratom to control pain and don't consider it highly addictive.

I am not a user of Kratom or any other drugs other than coffee. The DEA needs to carefully decide if it does chose to ban the drug what the effective punishment will be. For too long people get criminal records because a few old white men decide that they can lock up young black men by banning substances they use. The failure of the war on drugs is a result of the fact that citizens are tired of having their activities criminalizes. For instance, I don't smoke pot but I support legalization because young people should not have criminal records and long stretches in prison because they happen to use a small amount personally. It is sad that 15 people have died from this drug. Making it illegal is not going to change that (just like making heroin illegal has done nothing to stem the blight of heroin addiction killing a lot of people - many white which has now changed the conversation a little from prison to rehab which I think is a positive direction from a horrible situation). In addition to working on appropriate responses like rehab instead of prison nothing should be done till the drug has been studied by scientists. If you had done this with pot, millions of people would not have gone to jail on your whim. And alcohol may be illegal instead which I am sure has taken more lives than Kratom. In all this there is an aspect of personal responsibility and it gives rise to the Limbaugh and Trumps of the world when you try and meddle in every part of people's lives. And could drive them to worse drugs that are easier to find, like apparently heroin. If scientists come back and are in agreement with you (my inderstanding from a quick search is while the effects are similar the chemical makeup is not the same as opioids) then make your determination along with a solution other than simply locking up people to keep your staff and prison guards in a job.

I went to a reputable liberal arts university and was at the top of my class, but by the time I graduated I had very severe anxiety. \n\nI was caught in a bad cycle after graduating from university. I was only working low-level jobs, because my anxiety made it difficult (nearly impossible, even) to pursue something more challenging even though I knew I was otherwise capable of doing far more. Because these jobs didn't offer insurance and I didn't have enough money to pay for it myself, I was stuck without a viable solution.\n\nI sometimes turned to alcohol, though the effects the day after always negated any positive anxiety reduction and loss of inhibitions.\n\nA friend recommended kratom, but when I looked into it I was initially skeptical. I was reluctant to try anything that was associated with opiates, as I knew how destructive that class of drugs tends to be. \n\nEventually I decided to give it a shot because the anxiety was so persistent and I wanted anything that might alleviate it. I was surprised not to full a 'buzz' or anything of the sort when I first gave it a try.\n\nWhat I noticed instead was that it helped me to not fall into my anxious thought cycles. I felt healthy and motivated, able to socialize and accomplish tasks and work toward being my best self.\n\nI now take kratom 3-4 days per week, and it still helps me immensely. I run my own very profitable blog and also do freelance writing and business consulting on the side. This is a huge change from where I was even a few years ago, and I can attribute much of my success to kratom helping me overcome mental hurdles.\n\nIt is not by any means an intoxicating drug. It has helped me to focus, contribute to society, cultivate better friendships and romantic relationships, and be my best self. I genuinely fear what might happen if I no longer have access to this plant. Please consider the very real consequences this would have on people like me before you take the plant away.

I am a 29 year old male with a career in the New Home Building industry. I have been taking Kratom on and off for over 3 years.\n\nIn spring of 2013 I had a sports related injury that resulted in cracking 5 ribs on my left side. For the first month after my injury I had a very difficult time breathing, laying down, and moving altogether. I was prescribed narcotic pain medication by my doctor which I was on for 3 months. I understood how quickly people can become addicted to narcotic pain medication and was searching for an alternative. My brother had heard about Kratom and suggested I give it a try. I told my doctor that I did not want any more refills for the pain medication, and purchased Kratom at a local shop in Las Vegas. I never took another narcotic pill.\n\nThe same year after my injury, I started going through my divorce which was unexpected and devastating. I had also heard that Kratom can help with depression and anxiety and did not want to take any sort of anti depressant or prescription anxiety medication. Kratom helped me function throughout my divorce and deal with the depression and anxiety I was facing.\n\nI have benefited from Kratom so much that it is hard to believe. I have stopped taking Kratom numerous times with no negative side effects or withdrawals. The only negative I have encountered when taking Kratom is a mild nausea and stomach ache when taking a slightly higher dose. My average dose would be roughly 5-9 grams per day.\n\nI also find it important to add that I have never felt impaired while taking Kratom in any way. I have always had a clear mind and the ability to work, drive, and function as normal. \n\nI firmly believe this should remain as a legal supplement, and that it has the ability to help countless people who are addicted narcotics, along with many other issues such as depression and anxiety. \n\nI don't believe it belongs anywhere near the Schedule 1 drug list. \n\nThank you for the chance to comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19153","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chad Bolton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has literally changed the course of my life.  I used to be addicted to opioids and alcohol. As a way of treating my drug addiction I was prescribed suboxone. This was effective for a period of time but eventually led me back to active addiction. Approximately,  fifteen months ago,  I had surgery and because I had been on suboxone for three years,  the pain was not relieved by the Percocet or the suboxone.  Somebody recommended I try kratom powder. I was amazed at how effective it was at not only treating my pain but also my cravings for drugs and alcohol. I'm happy to say today that I am drug (including suboxone) and alcohol free. I don't believe that kratom is anymore addictive than coffee.  Please reconsider scheduling this life saving plant.

I was introduced to this plant by a good friend. We were planning to go see a movie, but I told him I had gotten a Migraine (which I have had for 8 years now) and that I instead was just going to stay home and sleep it off. He suggested I try some Kratom tea, and that he was sure it would help to reduce the pain I was experiencing. \n\nI ended up going to the movie theater with my friend that night, and I was able to enjoy it because I no longer was in excruciating pain. Over the next 6 months, I completely stopped taking traditional opiates - which I at one point took everyday, and worried that I would become addicted to them. Kratom allowed me to avoid that unpleasant path... a path I have seen friends and loved-ones go down.\n\nAfter 4 years of utilizing Kratom, along with a positive change in lifestyle, I feel in no way, that Kratom has adversely affected my health. I can only, instead, be thankful for the many benefits I have noticed from using it as a supplement to a healthy lifestyle. I no longer depend on pain-killers to get out of bed in the morning. I no longer worry that if I get a Migraine I might even need to go to the hospital because of the pain it brings. I no longer worry that the pills my doctors said would help me... could kill me.\n\nNo. Instead I worry that I will have to return to the life I escaped, with the help of Kratom. I worry that bureaucrats will rob me of the choice to live a more healthy, and less damaging or risky lifestyle. I worry that because I drink a tea brewed from the leaves of a benign, innocent plant - Those bureaucrats will mark me a criminal.\n\nBut I know that I am not alone. I know that there are many Americans like me out there... and I know that if they are only half as grateful of the benefits this plant brings as I am... than this move by the D.E.A. cannot stand. We will continue to fight this as long as we must. When you have lost everything, and built yourself up again because of something as simple as this botanical supplement - you will move mountains to protect your right to utilize that supplement.\n\nIf the research that HAS been done by independent medical professionals stating the clear and I qoute, \"remarkable safety\" of Kratom, coupled with the first hand experiences from thousands of Americans isn't enough for the D.E.A. and F.D.A., then placing it in Schedule 1 will remove almost completely the possibility of more research being done. Considering Kratom's impressive safety record, and the on-going \"opiate epidemic\" in America; This attack on Kratom, and Americans who choose to utilize it in place of traditional opiates, is the most absurd thing that I have ever seen.\n\nIn conclusion - There are many Americans who perceive that Kratom has helped improve some aspect of their life, or health. They, like I, have found it safe to utilize. The, like I, are simply trying to do what is best for them, and are not hurting anyone. They, like I, will not be silenced by bureaucrats and lobbyists.\n\nThey, like I, simply want to stop being hurt by their own government.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20981","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steve Mills","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"DEA Policies should be based on science not politics.

I just want to voice my opinions on and experience of using  kratom (mitragyna speciosa). I have been taking kratom off and on for roughly five years. Which is to say I will take kratom for several months then stop for several months. I use it to help alleviate severe anxiety and depression and find it helps me to \"deal\" with hard situations in life. Such as recently when my mother was diagnosed with cancer. I am unable to take most prescription anxiety medications due to the side effects such as lethargy and severe shakes. Kratom on the other hand alleviates my anxiety with virtually no side effects. In my opinion there are two things that make kratom superior to prescription anxiety medications such as Xanax. Firstly, when kratom is taken as directed, as an herbal supplement, it does not induce lethargy and an inability to function in daily life when enough is taken to alleviate my anxiety and the same can not be said for Xanax. Secondly and probably most importantly is I am able to take it for several months and stop \"cold turkey\" with no physical side effects. The first and last time I used Xanax to treat anxiety I only used it for a 2-3 week period. At the end of that several week period I experienced what I believe to be withdraw symptoms caused by the Xanax. I was unable to sleep and felt very uncomfortable physically for 3 or 4 days. Kratom has never had that negative effect on me and I expect it never will after 5 years of use. The fact that the DEA has determined there are no medical uses for kratom but there are medical uses for Xanax and other worthless addictive prescription anxiety medications is pure insanity.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3166","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeffrey Elliott","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom got me off opioids and saved my life","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17643","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban Kratom?

And because of the fact that these compounds are naturally occurring in a plant that freely grows in an abundance of regions, it seems the Agency would be initiating yet another impractical war on nature simply because of a psychoactive constituent of the plant numerous people have been using for thousands of years with no actual reported deaths from the active compounds alone.\n\nPlease desist on this endeavor before many (easily tens of thousands of) people are forced back into the arms of their former addictions or otherwise unable to get a relatively safe natural alternative to many pain management substances actively pushed by the pharmaceutical industry, whom I believe are lobbying for this ban to be enacted because they realize it will hurt the sales of their very profitable opioid pain medications.\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21017","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Allard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I am a 58 year old mom and grandmother, and I am a Kratom user.

I bought my 1st Kratom online out of desperation.  It had gotten so bad that I was staying in bed most of the time crying and not sleeping from the pain.\n\nI am a glass blower by trade that works on a big spinning machine called a lathe.  Unfortunately my legs were hurting so bad I could not work for more than an hour or two tops.  I need to work at least 8 hours a day, 6 days a week to be able to sustain myself and my girlfriend who is suffering from fibromyalgia.  So my parents had to make my $2,000 a month house payment cause I was barely getting enough work in to pay utilities and buy some food. \n\nIt's bad to be hurting in bed all the time, but it's even worse to become a giant burden on your retired parents.  The mental tolls were great and I slipped into depression.  All I did was watch Netflix series episodes over and over.  Pathetic! \n\nAnd now back to my 1st Kratom delivery.  The Fast Strains gave me enough energy to get out of bed and start working again.  The slow strains helped me get through the pain and helped me sleep.  In less than a month my entire world had turned around.  Kratom is a miracle to me! \n\nWhen the DEA announced the Kratom Ban starting at the end of September, I went online to a wholesale distributor and got as many kilos of Kratom as I could so my new promising life wouldn't stop.  Kratom is so important to my good health I sold things at pawn shops and on Ebay to stock up on it before the ban.\n\nThis shouldn't be!  Kratom may be dangerous combined with other drugs and have sent some people to the hospital.  But as we know people OD and die from drinking bottles of \nteriyaki sauce and many other legal things.  I have used Kratom extensively for the past year and have never overdosed.  All I've gotten from these natural tree leaves is relief.\n\nKratom is a valuable tool for many human ailments and has been used in other countries for 1000's and 1000's of years.  \n\nGentlemen please spend your time and efforts solving the opiate epidemic in the U.S. and leave Kratom alone please.\n\nSincerely, \n\nJohn Matthew Patrick","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13087","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Patrick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm writing in hopes to stop the ban or classifying Kratom as a Schedule 1 controlled Substance. I worked as nurse for 26 years b4 becoming disabled in 2010 by pain, CFIDS, Fibromyalgia, Lyme disease, Gen Muscular Dystonia,DD&JD, & Osteoarthritis. I started using Kratom about 5 months ago as an alternative to improve my health issues. It has been successful & without all the bizarre & horrible side effects I have suffered from conventional meds. Since I started, my fibro fog has improved greatly, my BP has normalized, I haven't had a panic attack & I was plagued with them alost daily.. I no longer need my Ativan. I require less opiates for pain and have fewer opiate & benzo side effects . I've been able to increase my activity levels in some areas without paying for it for days after. I have no withdrawal issues when I stop Kratom & don't crave it. I've been on opiates for a long time which causes tolerance, but with Kratom , I can take less opiates or not take any at all on some days and that has been unimaginable b4 Kratom. Kratom is a natural, beneficial, safer alternative, better than marijuana, to use and we should be allowed to make that choice. Of course Big D Pharma doesn't want it out there because it effects their pocketbooks. Many legal pharmaceuticals have cost me & my family members many lasting side effects & permanent disabilities. With Kratom, I've even contemplated trying to work part time or at least trying & I haven't even considered that in 6 years. Please do not ban or schedule Kratom, especially on the flimsy excuse the DEA wishes to ban or schedule it. They have overstepped their bounds on this one.Even they negate their own case when they said they couldn't prove that Kratom caused the deaths of those 12 people because they all had illegal or prescription substances, either higher than prescribed, or not prescribed to them at in in their systems. People can literally kill themselves with water by water intoxication. I've seen it, not pretty. If they had any real sense or wanted to make a huge difference, they would hand it out to heroine, cocaine, & opiate addicts , especially those who want to get off that destructive merry go round. People can't afford drug treatment programs & there's so much stigma & repercussions that follow treatment, unless your a movie star that people won go inot trear-end bease oF that and cost.. Kratom has helped people in the states for decades & other countries for centuries. Please do NOT ban or make Kratom a scheduke 1. It has helped me immensely & I know others it has helped also. I know noone of hundreds of people that it has hurt. Please leave Kratom, alone. It has made a huge difference in my life without the side effects of pharmaceuticals, many horrible, some I can't afford not to mention long term side effects on the ones I can take.

I have only used it regularly in the past 3 years.  I became addcted to heroin while living in Chicago, IL with my ex-girlfriend.  We had a big fight, I wanted something to make me feel better, and it did....the consequences were disastrous however.  Kratom helped me kick it while not getting me high.\n\nAs a natural substance, I feel that kratom is a very useful plant, and depending whom I speak to-a gift from God.  I had been suffering from depression and anxiety for years and years, I rediscovered kratom and it made all the difference in the world.  Truly like night and day.  I am stable these days in a way that I never have been before, I have recovered and I didn't think that it was possible before.  I kicked my addictions to alcohol and hard drugs with the help of kratom.  I can take it as needed and it just makes me feel more motivated, social, and empathetic towards others.  \n\nI think it would be a huge mistake to schedule this plant...it helps so many people, including myself.  My family has seen the difference in me since I was able to conquer my addictions, kratom helped me to get off of harmful substances.  I have a steady job, have gotten promotions, met a wonderful woman who I can now call my girlfriend, have cultivated and formed new friendships, and I am happier than I have been in many years.  \n\nPeople use kratom to kick opiates.  The heroin, opiate epidemic and kratom are two VERY separate things.  People aren't dying from kratom use and I have heard so many success stories that it's truly a miracle plant.  Kratom should remain legal, and many people feel the way I do.

The Surgeon General sent a letter to many professionals in the medical community at the beginning of September of this year asking the medical community to address the opiate epidemic that is taking 100,000 lives each year. In the email, medical professi9nals were asked to think of patients addicted to opiates as patients suffering the deadly side effects of prescription medicine instead of treating them as addicts by choice. Along with this, the Surgeon General continued to implore the medical community to pursue alternative methods to the traditional opiates in order to combat this epidemic. In addition to the Surgeon General'sent plea to the community for alternatives to opiates, the US Senate and Congress have both rallied together to stand against the ban on kratom. Our Representatives, like Senator Pocan, have taken the needs of the people into consideration and have found that the DEA along with the FDA should allow kratom to remain available to the public unhindered. This decision came about from discussing with our Senators and Congressmen/women the various patents that have been applied for which attempt to use kratom as analgesics, as opiate withdrawal prevention, and as immune boosting compounds. The agencies that have researched kratom in one or more of the aforementioned capacities included but are not limited to: The National Institutes of Health, The University of Mississippi, The University of Massachusetts, and the National Institute for Drug Abuse. The Director of the NIH recently posted an article on the NIH/Drug Abuse website, citing the Surgeon General's previously addressed letter to the community as a means to further urge medical professionals to help prevent the further growth of the opiate epidemic in the US. Hundreds of thousands of lives can be lifted out of the pit of pharmaceutical addiction should our government choose to keep kratom and its alkaloids available to the public without any hindrance. Kratom is a natural tea that continues to improve lives every day. Illegalizing this supplement would cost billions of dollars in lost tax revenue and millions of lost lives in the failed Drug War in the US that has spun out of control into a War on Wellbeing. In order to begin healing our nation of the opiate epidemic, we need to consider alternatives. This should include kratom and all plants and herbs and their continued availability to each and every US citizen.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23075","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Maria Jackson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI was recently introduce to kratom.

I'm a 31 year old paramedic from southern, rural Kentucky. I'm writing in concern and opposition of the potential scheduling of Kratom.  I began using Kratom approximately 9 months ago. I began using Kratom as a natural alternative to help me deal with my Rheumatoid Arthritis, Sjogrens Syndrome, and Fibromyalgia. Kratom has became a part of change I have made to live a more natural lifestyle including things such as making my own soap and beauty products. Kratom has helped me go from spending all of my free time in bed or on the couch while wondering how much longer I would be able to continue working, to spending quality time with my family, cooking dinner, cleaning my house, playing in the floor with my 2 year old son, and even beginning a new hobby of woodworking and restoring old furniture. However, right now I'm scared that all of this will soon be ripped away from me because of this possible scheduling. All of this along with my current job as a Flight Paramedic are uncertain.  In my almost 9 years as a paramedic in rural Kentucky, including McCreary, Clinton, Laruel, and Harlan Counties which are ridden with drugs, I have never once been called to someone who had overdosed on Kratom, nor had I even heard of it till l began my personal search for health betterment. I've worked countless Heroine and prescription pain pill overdoses. Many resulting in death and families destroyed. Knowing that Kratom has helped and saved so many of these people and even helped them get their lives back and all of this could be taken away from them as well is very disheartening. It is hard to even understand why use of a natural plant like this that has given us so many benefits with little, or in my case, no side effects, is even being threatened.  In short we all want to remain productive members of society and productive members of our families. Kratom helps us do this. Please don't take that away. Don't take away my son's mommy.

It helps many people in their lives and in my opinion is no more harmful than a cup of coffee. To me, kratom is an herbal supplement, with little to no side effects. If we the people have the right to choose other supplements, why should we not be able to choose kratom? I agree that it should be studied more, but it has been used for hundreds, if not thousands of years safetly in Thailand and in the United States for at least a couple decades so I do not think it should be deemed a dangerous substance and banned outright. Now if there was undeniable proof of it being dangerous and harmful then I would understand.                                                                                                                                   As for me, I've been taking kratom off and on over the past four years and have never had any problems from it. I feel like it helps keep my energy levels up during the day like coffee would, and this is important because I work construction. Also important is the fact that it does not cause a high, I retain clarity of mind and no feelings of intoxication. I feel this plant also helps ease the sore muscles after a long day of work and makes sleep much easier. Now I'm not saying kratom cures anything, but I do feel like it has a lot of potential and I've benefited from it immensely. So I'm going to ask again, please don't take away the freedom for people to choose a safe plant that they may benefit from.

Find out from first hand users whether its detrimental to society or not. I DO NOT think it poses any threat. If it's regulated to 18 years old and older, fine.

I had an automobile accident and received a compression fracture.  Because I am in recovery from drugs and alcohol I refused any pain medication stronger than Ibuprofen.  I was suffering so greatly from pain that It was affecting every part of my life.  My work was suffering along with my relationships with everyone because I hurt so much that I couldn't do anything other than push myself constantly to get through my work day just to go home and lay down until I had to get up to go back to work.  I felt like a prisoner to the pain.  I also live with Bipolar Disorder and the depression I was going through due to the situation was also crippling.  I felt like I was losing everything that was important to me from the unbelievable pain I was in.  Reluctantly I tried the Kratom to see if it would help since nothing else was.  I have worked and fought really hard for my recovery from drugs and alcohol so I was unable to take any pain medication that was mind altering so that limited my ability to try and control my pain.  From the very first dose I took of Kratom I had a remarkable result.  My pain was diminished enough that I for the first time in over 6 months I had relief.  I could not only work and function somewhat normally again but I could smile.  The pain relief was absolutely remarkable.  I  began to take the Kratom regularly with my other medications daily and the results were amazing.  Not only was my pain relieved but my depression was also under control.  I feel like a new person.  For the first time in my life I feel in control of my mental health and of many other aspects of my life.  I was able to decrease my Bipolar medications and stop taking medications for the severe anxiety I experience. Kratom has essentially helped me take control of my life and I have become a very productive member of society.  I have been thriving at work, in my recovery from drugs and alcohol and in my relationships with family and friends.  Kratom has been such a wonderful discovery for me and I ask that you keep it legal to help people like me continue to take control of their lives in so many ways.  I know people use Kratom for different reasons but my positive results have added to my life in several different ways.  I have struggled with my mental health since I was 13 years old and I will be 40 this upcoming year.  This is the first time in my life that I have had such amazing relief from depression and mania.  I initially took the Kratom for my pain but the greatest thing it has helped me with is my mental health and I can't tell you how much better my life is.  It is truly worth living and I look forward to each and every day.  Please let people continue to take back their freedoms from pain, drugs, depression, and the many other things that i'm sure Kratom can help with.

For the last 15 years I have been in excruciating pain and the doctors have tried everything from cortisone to nerve oblation, but nothing seems to work.\n\nThey put me on Vicodin first, then Oxy. For years I took oxy. Every month having to increase the dose to keep up as my body adjusted to the drug. Finally, something occurred that made me want to quit taking opiates. I snapped and yelled at my daughter for the most trivial thing. This is so unlike me that it scared my wife. I could tell by the look on her face. That is when I realize that after so many years of opiate use had changed me and the way I look at my life.\n\nI can tell you that living with the kind of pain I face every day is unbearable to most people, and I have heard of some who have taken their own life rather than to live this way until the natural end. Nevertheless I had to quit opiates. How many more of these stupid pills would I take until my wife woke up with me dead lying next to her? I decided to quit.\n\nI tapered a little at a time until I was completely off the opiates. I had never even heard of Kratom, or I might have used it to help me with the withdrawal. I had quit the prescription drugs but the pain didn't quit.\n\nIt was unbearable but I refused to return to opiates. I used high CBD containing marijuana tinctures which provided only a slight amount of relief. Then a friend told me about Kratom. I had never heard of it before but figured I had nothing to lose, so I tried it.\n\nIt does not cure my pain. It takes it away so I can enjoy my life and do things a normal person can do, for a short time. I am able to ride my motorcycle, rake up leaves in my yard, and even indulge in some social activities which I had mostly given up on. It is hard to enjoy ones self, or think about anything else than the pain, but Kratom seems to do the trick for me. I don't take it every day. Maybe twice a week or so. It has improved the quality of my life so much that I am sometimes able to forget that I am irreparably broken.\n\nIf you were to make Kratom illegal, you would be making criminals from people like me. Because since it is the only thing that works without any of the effects of long term opiate us, I would continue trying to find it. You would be creating a profitable black market for individuals who could care less about anything but the money they could make which would mean the source would be less reliable and subject to contamination or spiking with other substances. At best the pharmaceutical companies would take over and synthesize its components, which would make it unaffordable.\n\nAs a person who has found relief from the pain, and the depression that being damaged can cause, I ask you respectfully: Please don't prohibit the use and sale of this plant. We don't need another war on drugs, especially one that hurts people like me. We aren't drug addicts. We aren't criminals. We are people like you. If you were in our shoes, wouldn't you want this helpful plant to be accessible to you or your loved ones?\n\nThank you for listening. Sorry to write this letter anonymously. I really wanted to use my name so you could contact me. But like I said, if this becomes illegal, you will be making me a criminal.

In 2009 my mother died from breast cancer after a long, drawn-out battle and in 2011 my Fiance and girlfriend of 7 years died suddenly of an opiate overdose. I was extremely depressed and found myself drinking more and more alcohol each day for the  temporary comfort it provided me. It came to the point where I was drinking everyday and became addicted. I tried to quit drinking and would go through the physical withdrawals of shaking, sweating and pains. This made it impossible to go to work without drinking. In my opinion alcohol is one of the worst drugs to be addicted to because of how easily obtainable and how prevalent it is in everyday life. It greatly affects your mood, personality and judgement. It makes holding a steady job and excelling almost impossible. Everyday I would go through the ranges of being hung over and in pain in the morning, to needing a few drinks to feel \"normal\" then passing out from having drank too much. It was a horrible way to live. I tried quitting many times, almost daily. I could stand the physical withdrawals but the increased depression and anxiety that came along with it was crippling. I went to support groups, family members and then the internet for help. Thats when I found Kratom.\n\nI read in a discussion group online that Kratom has helped many opiate addicts and alcoholics overcome their addictions. When I first tried Kratom I was shocked at how pleasant it was. It elevates your mood giving you a sense of well being without doing so in an overpowering manner. It doesn't affect your judgement or motor skills in a negative way, allowing you to perform all your daily functions normally only with the benefits of an elevated mood. I was able to quit drinking through the use of Kratom practically immediately. My elevated mood left me with no need or desire to drink, allowing me to simply stop. In my experience, it is impossible to overdose on Kratom. If you do happen to take too much, you simply get an upset stomach which leads to the evacuation of the excess kratom. Even when taking \"too much\" kratom you are still in complete control of your judgement and motor skills, you simply have a stomach ache. I was even able to quit taking all the antidepressants prescribed to me because the kratom alleviated my depression more than any of the prescriptions ever did. The potential for addiction to kratom seems to be on par of that of a substance such as coffee. When I stopped taking kratom after taking it daily for months I experienced very minor negative effects. I mainly missed the elevation in mood along with very minor cold like symptoms. It was very easy to continue functioning properly even when going through kratom withdraw. When compared to the withdraw of other substances such as opiates, alcohol and benzos there is no comparison.\n\nThe potential benefits of kratom for people suffering from drug addiction, constant pain, depression and so much more are almost limitless. In the midst of the largest opium epidemic the world has ever seen a ban on kratom not only seems unintelligent but downright criminal. I'm afraid that the pharmaceutical companies will use their power and funding to influence the DEAs ruling on kratom because of its ability to cut into their profits. These companies put their profits over the lives and well-being of millions and millions of people. Please do the right thing and keep kratom legal and available to those who need it and allow the proper scientific testing to be performed.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10793","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin Mitzak","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been a kratom tea drinker for the last three years now.

At 27 I had to have my spine fused and after depending on pain medication for 8 years and being completely controlled by the medication, I found Kratom. I was on the verge of destroying my life and my family when i did some research on natural remedies for pain and was beyond relieved to find an alternative to the narcotics that prevented me from living my life. Without pain relief, I am immobile and cannot function, but since I discovered Kratom, I no longer crave the high that opioids provided and I am able to have a normal life without the fear of addiction and constant mood swings taking away the life I strive to lead. When I first began taking the supplement, it provided a bit of euphoria, but after a couple of weeks, I began to notice that feeling dicapating, yet it still provided pain relief. I was relieved when this happened because I knew that had that been opioids,  my body would have been telling me the dose was not effective and I need more for relief, when in reality it's my brain seeking the euphoria and in turn telling my body I have pain and require more to relive it. I have been taking Kratom for almost 2 years now, and this is the longest length of time that I have gone in the past decade without battling that demon. I could very easily be prescribed to opioids for daily use, but as long as I have a supplement such as Kratom to relive my pain and not interfere with my mood and personality, I will never be back on prescription pain meds. Banning this organic and side effect free  alternative for me would mean I would have no choice but to rely on prescription pain meds again, and that scares the hell out of me. I sincerely hope this supplement is not banned and the hundreds of  thousands of people like myself are not forced to turn back to the miserable life prescription pain meds cause just so we are able to get out of bed every morning and attempt to lead a semi normal life that inevidibly leads to addiction, destruction, and too many times, death. \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0602","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello DEA.

Life, because Kratom helps those addicted to opioids stay off opioids that may otherwise kill them. Liberty, because the DEA is attempting to restrict the free will of citizens to make their own decisions in their own lives. Pursuit of happiness, because it defies addicted citizens' ability to live a happy, withdrawal-free life.\n\nI see the DEA's policy of \"ban now, ask questions later\" to be very troubling. That being said, I applaud the DEA for withdrawing this in order to hear public opinion. I only hope it makes a difference and keeps Kratom available to the citizens that need it.\n\nThere have been no documented deaths attributed to the use of Kratom on it's own. The 16 deaths between 2014-2016 that the DEA cites as being attributed to Kratom, the users were under the influence of other drugs along with Kratom. Probably opioids. Kratom does not induce respiratory depression like opioids do.\n\nI would prefer to see Kratom remain off the controlled substances list. I hope that if the DEA finds the absolute necessity to add Kratom to the controlled substances list, they make it only Schedule V or IV. Kratom does not have a high potential for abuse so it should be regulated accordingly, but only if absolutely necessary.\n\nI commend the DEA in their efforts to get extremely dangerous drugs off the streets. Drugs such as heroin, meth, and crack cocaine. But I do not want to see the DEA criminalizing drugs that appear to be virtually harmless with no evidence to the contrary. We've already been through this with cannabis and it's taken decades of activism to reverse that mistake, so please do not make the same mistake here.\n\nThank you for reading.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3206","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Renny Hagen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 19 year old who has battled with drug and alcohol addiction.

And I most certainly cannot work or drive while under the influence of narcotics, because they also knock me out, or make feel and act like a drunk fool!!! But I can take the smaller amount of kratom and it seems to motivate me,but most importantly it eases my chronic lower hip and leg pain, and chronic neck and shoulder pain, in which gives me awful tension headaches. I have not had any noticeable side affects either, so this too is a plus. I also have not had to take IBU motrin when I used the kratom either. So I have to ask why this is even up for debate on whether to or not to make this a controlled substance. It doesn't make you high, or give me any of those awful side affects, and I have not had any kind of withdrawal symptoms on days I haven't took kratom. I just felt my pain more and had to resort to aspirin and IBU motrin and still not be relieved from my chronic pain as well as I am when taking kratom. So please don't make this another controlled substance. I mean everything can be abused, but please don't punish everyone because of that small percentage of people who have and will continue to abuse anything they come across.

I spent one year in Iraq and encountered incoming mortar fire on a daily basis.  When I returned home just before Christmas of 2009, I had a lower back injury (bulging disk) and could barely move without extreme sharp pain.\n\nOver the course of 6 months I went through physical therapy at my local VA three times a week.  We did exercises to help strengthen my muscles around my lower back and learned stretching techniques to help deal with the pain.  After the 6 months of therapy I felt a lot better but was informed that the injury was permanent.  I would go a couple months without pain and then it will flare up and return for a month or two. \n\nTo top off the back injury, shortly after returning home I started showing signs of PTSD.  I would have extreme anxiety attacks where I could feel my mortality and felt as if my heart could stop at any minute.  I was so terrified of death even the sight of a grave yard could trigger the attacks.  I also was over paranoid about anything and would find myself sleeping on the couch by the front door.  Having never owned a gun in my life, I purchased a AR-15 and about five other firearms because I felt insecure not having one by my side. \n\nAs time went on I realized I had little interest in doing the things I loved before and I was constantly angry over the littlest things.  Driving anywhere or being in a crowded public place was damn near impossible without my blood starting to boil.  I would find myself lashing out at my wife and kids over things that were so petty.  I finally decided I needed help.\n\nI went to the VA and starting discussing my issues with a counselor and psychiatrist in late 2010 and still see them on a monthly basis to this day.  We tried many different anti depressants, sleeping aids, group counseling, personal counseling, you name it and while it did help me a bit nothing really took care of it.  I decided to start doing some research to see if there was any other options.\n\nIn June of 2015, a friend of mine introduced me to Kratom.  I was told it helped him with his pain and also provided a mood lift.  I decided it couldn't hurt and that I would give it a shot.  I took my first dose on a empty stomach and with 30 minutes I could tell something was different.  I was calming down, started to feel happy, I felt ambitious to go do something, I actually started to feel normal.  To top it all off, while it didn't completely eliminate my back pain, it helped immensely!  I now had manageable pain instead of unbearable pain. \n\nFor about 6 months I took it on a daily basis.  I had a lot more motivation, I was calm with my kids and enjoyed doing more with them, dealing with crowds was getting a bit better, I could sleep good, overall everything was going well.  I now no longer take Kratom everyday.  I use it here and there when my back pain returns or if I feel that I may be going into a stressful situation.  I am happy to have found such an amazing natural alternative to pharmaceutical medications.\n\nPlease reconsider your action to make kratom a scheduled substance.  This plant is very important to me and my family.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4986","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Miller","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a nurse I have seen many people lose their lives to \"pain medications\" that arr currently t given to patients.

This causes my joints to be extremely loose and I frequently suffer from hip/shoulder/knee sublexations and dislocations. I am severely disabled, suffer chronic pain and am bed-bound most of the time. My quality of life used to be okay because my pain was controlled, yes by opiates. But because of the actions of this agency my doctors all fear for their licences and slowly but surly my prescriptions have been lowered. I do not abuse them, i never fill them early or take them other than how they are prescribed. But as a direct result of your \"war on drugs\" I can no longer walk my dog, or talk a walk with my husband. I can barley wash the dishes or shower myself. This has left to search for other ways to treat my pain. I use heating pads, ice packs, I get nerve blocks and cortisone injections (even though cortisone makes my condition worse in the long run). I do PT, I stretch, I have special bath salts, I get botox injections (for pain, not vanity). I do ALL of these things, all day, every day is about trying to regulate my pain, that's all, thanks to YOU! I finally got a recommendation for Kratom from a fellow EDS patient and it relieved my pain enough that I was able to do house chores! I was able to be an effective person/ human being for one - effing - day! It is the first thing that has effectively helped with my pain in so long and you're about to ban it without even doing any studies?!?! SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!!!! I can only pray that someone you care deeply for is afflicted with an awful chronic illness and finds themselves without pain relieve because of you.

My former job was a DoD Technical writer. Due to a myriad of illnesses I have been unable to work as of late -  however I now have hope. \n\nI suffer from a myriad of autoimmune related maladies: fibromyalgia, sarcoidosis, Antiphospholipid syndrome, intractable migraines, chronic idiopathic hyperalgesia with allodynia, interstitial cystitis, & debilitating osteoarthritis. \n\nPain management has been challenging because; the available drugs are ineffective, have intolerable side effects, and have cause increased pain due to my condition of hyperalgesia. Long term use of opioids only led me further down the road to an increase in depression, lethargy, increased pain, & a host of cognitive problems. I also suffer from hearing loss due to long-term use of opioids. \n\nI follow a strict healthy lifestyle. I never indulge in alcohol, recreational drugs, or junk foods beyond treat of an occasional cup of coffee or piece of chocolate. I have had to adapt this lifestyle to try to manage my medical conditions. This has had the most significant change in most conditions. \n\nBecause of my hyperalgesia, I have had to look into alternative medicine since opioids actually cause more pain. After going through withdrawal from Fentenylpatches, & morphine, I was still unable to function from the pain. After being on bedrestfor over 6 months, I gained an additional 50 lbs due to inactivity. This only served to cause more pain on joints and sensitive areas. My doctors wanted me to return to pain management with opioids again. Instead I found a healthy supplement that has assisted me in slowly regaining all that I had lost. \n\nI have been taking small amounts of unadulterated, whole leaf Kratom as a supplement to my daily vitamin & mineral regime. It has made a tremendous difference in my quality of life.  Most importantly, by adding this to my daily stretching, eating well & the use of a few necessary prescription medications I have re-gained my  mobility. I went from taking over 15 daily medications to 5. My liver enzymes have returned to normal. And I feel significantly better. \n\nI still struggle with daily activities but have been able to focus and regain some mental stamina rather than all of my energy focused on indescribable pain. I feel more hopeful than I have in years. Oddly enough, my medication resistant depression of more than 10 years has abated. My anxiety disorder that has held me at bay since my teens has lessened. I find myself reaching for the anxiety medication less and less. I am hopeful that perhaps with more occupational therapy I could try to return to work one day if my progress continues. \n\nI fear that making Kratom illegal would relegate myself and others, those who prefer natural supplements and those who have run out of options, to a life of being bedridden and unable to participate in life. I know that I personally am not prepared to return to a life of pain where I am only surviving, not thriving. Please allow me to continue to make choices that are good for my health. I truly feel that if Kratom were made unavailable, myself and so many others that benefit from this supplement would suffer needlessly.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4680","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kimberly Boulaid","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Matt Byron. I am a 36 year old sales executive. I am VERY opposed to adding kratom to list of schedule I controlled substances. This would have a few negative implications for me.\nI discovered kratom through a friend while asking for advice on a new antidepressant to try. She said it had helped her depression where other medications had not, and not to mention the cost of dr. prescribed meds being nearly unaffordable. I'm not a big proponent or herbal remedies--but I must admit, this leaf has made a serious and positive impact on my life. \nInstead of trying new pharmaceuticals, I decided to try keeping it natural.  Anti depressants can take up to 6 weeks to work, and I was suicidal. The kratom almost instantly alleviated a large part of those feelings. I take 2mg of powdered kratom in the morning as a tea, and thats it! I have also stopped taking it for a day, multiple days, and 2 weeks to look for symptoms of physical or psychological addiction I had seen mentioned online, but experienced NONE of that myself---even after months of daily use. \nKratom has also made my long days at work more \"bearable\" while not forcing me to resort to powerful, mood-altering medications like valium or xanax. I found kratom has relieved much of my anxiety as well! \nPlease keep this wonderful, natural plant legal in the US.

I have seen three surgeons and in to be scheduled to see a fourth. Not a one has recommended surgery saying that I \"could come off the table in worse shape than I went on\". The Pain Care Clinic started prescribing opiates shortly after my work-related accident. Along with these opiates I found myself taking more and more pills to counter what side effects the opiates seem to be causing? I have been taking Kratom regularly for over a year now and am no longer taking any prescription pills. Along with that I no longer have any desire to drink alcohol, which was a real problem while taking opiates. I was drinking 3 to 6 beers a day along with three 10 325 Percocets! I never drink home alone anymore and seldom drink socially. This is great news for me! Not so much for big Pharma and the beer manufacturers across the country. I am currently taking  20-30 grams a day.  4-5 grams at a time.  4-6 times a day?  This plant has little side effects. The only one of which I have experienced is I need to have something in my diet to soften my stools. That's it, no other side effects that I am aware of! \nWhen I first heard the news of the DEA making Kratom a class one I had thoughts of leaving the country. I can only imagine that I would become a good for nothing, suicidal, pill popping drunk, should Kratom become illegal?\nPlease take the time to research this harmless plant before making it illegal for hundreds of thousands of people like myself. I would love to answer any questions you might have or be a part of any research to make this happen. I honestly believe that I am doing the best thing for my body and using this plant for pain relief. The only other alternative I am aware of would be alcohol opiates or cannabis? None of which seem to work as well as Kratom does for me.\n It's amazing !  \nThanx for reading.\nSincerely, \nSteven D Webb Sr.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6275","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steven Webb","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Justin Blais, I'm a 42yr male who has worked as a firefighter for 20 years.

After many failed attempts he credits Kratom for saving his life. In my line of work I see at least a couple OD deaths a month. Most are from Oxycontin. This is the drug that should be more closely regulated, its basically Heroin in pill form and now that it's harder for Opiate addicts to get pills they've switched over to Heroin. We now have a Heroin epidemic in my area and from what I understand throughout most of the country. Why would you make illegal a PLANT that helps people get over their addictions. If you do the research on the FEW people that have died with Kratom in there system they were also taking a bunch of sych drugs. No a clear cut correlation and more studies need to be done.

He liked this because he was still able to participate in the family because he was no longer in pain or sleeping because of pain medications that the doctor's would normally prescribe. Also, he suffers for anixety. After starting kratom, the anixety attacks happened less and less and he was finally able to sleep at night. This has improved our family life. I take kratom in occasion also for anixety or back pains. Never have I been addicted or needed to have it after comsuing kratom.

I have never drank, never smoked, never used illegal drugs. Ever. I was a mom, a Sunday School teacher, and a mentor to teen girls at risk. In 1995, I was hit by a drunk driver and was in critical condition for 19 days. I went through 13 surgeries on my spine, hips, legs, and knees. Afterwards, I was on pain meds, but I was still in constant pain. I could no longer drive, no longer teach, no longer mentor. I couldn't cook, clean, or take care of my four school-age children. Four years ago, after being on pain meds for 17 years, my doctor said she could no longer prescribe them and I'd have to go to a pain doctor. I went to my first visit. The waiting room was overflowing and dirty. Most of the people in the room looked pretty sketchy. I finally got to see the doctor. He had me raise my arms over my head (my pain is in my back, hips, and legs), and handed me a prescription. I felt dirty, like I was doing something illegal. \n\nI went back to my primary care doctor, and I cried as I told her how horrible my experience was at the pain clinic. She said she was sorry, but that was the only option now. She suggested I try to take a break from pain meds entirely. The thought of that scared me to death, as I hurt bad enough with them and I was always watching the clock to see when I could take my next dose. But I really didn't want to go back to the pain doc at the pain clinic. So, I agreed. My doctor warned me that since I'd been on pain meds for so long (vicodin and oxycodone), that I'd probably be sick for a few days. I was also in so much pain that I thought I might die from it. The sickness passed, but the pain didn't. I didn't know what to do. At my doctor's suggestion, I tried Lyrica and other arthritis meds, but they didn't help me. I tried anti-depressants, muscle relaxers, you name it. Nothing helped. I finally asked her to send another referral to the pain clinic. \n\nWhile I was waiting for my appointment date (it was almost three months away), I looked on Google for alternative treatments for pain. I found Kratom, and ordered some. Always the skeptic, I put it back for over a week. Then, one day, my pain was so unbearable, I pulled out the kratom, shoved some into vitamin capsules, and swallowed. Thirty minutes later, my pain was gone. I was amazed. Since then, I use it regularly when my pain is unbearable. Between usages, I have no cravings and no withdrawal. It truly is a miracle, I am able again to be a mom, take care of my family, and mentor  teens. \n\nWithout kratom, I'd have to return to vicodin--and I'd have to go to that horrid pain clinic. Please keep kratom legal and available. It has so much improved my quality of life. Thank you.

There IS no epidemic of kratom abuse. There IS, however, quite a bit of responsible use by responsible and FREE adults. Given the amount of people that we know use Kratom in the U.S., if there were a problem we would definitely know about it by now. The claims about the number of calls to the CDC are quite meaningless given the lack of specificity and when put into context with the sheer volume of calls and crisis events involving many other LEGAL and OFT- ABUSED substances like alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, prescription meds of all types, garden plants such as datura..etc.\n \nThe other claims that your agency put forward regarding the fallaciously reported \"15 deaths\" have  been completely revoked through logical analysis by many respected scientists, journalists, politicians and state governments (i.e. Florida). Thus, the entire premise of protecting the public from the \"scourge\" of Kratom is unfounded and illogical. \n \nI believe that Kratom should be considered an herbal supplement, as it is used in the same way people use kava, st.johns wort and coffee  ( and as you know, Kratom is in the same plant family as coffee ). It's a very mild stimulant and also provides a slight and gentle mood lift that seems to go away if used too frequently. Many people use kratom to manage fatigue and stress, or as a mild pain killer instead of the more abrasive and addictive opiate prescriptions. It's  completely preposterous to claim that kratom is anything remotely close to actual Opiates ( the 'LEGAL' drugs that kill 10's of thousands a year and ruin the lives of even more people through addiction disorders) . The \"addiction potential\" has been found in many scientific studies to be similar to caffeine. And while absolutely anything can and will be abused, the consequences of doing so are quite mild and less harmful than the effects that your prohibition will cause users. It has also come to light that many people have managed to curb their use of heroin and other narcotics by \"stepping down\" to kratom during the withdraw period.  It's sad to think that by making this gentle and safe herb into a scheduled substance, you will be driving thousands of productive citizens back to their living hell of street heroin and back alley drug deals. For shame.\n \n  A citizen of this great nation should be able to decide for themselves IF and HOW to use kratom, the same way that we seem to tolerate an Adult's choice to USE alcohol or nicotine. ( 2 drugs that kill more AMERICANS than any other drug on your bizarre and hypocritical list of scheduled drugs...without a doubt....no contest)\n \nAnd just why is it that ALCOHOL and NICOTINE aren't scheduled? If these 2 drugs don't fall into the \" highly addictive with no know medicinal value\" category, then I  think that the entire CSA should be examined by our new government in January.  This is clearly the logical weak spot in your entire operating principle of \"safeguarding the public\".  \n \n Not only is the prohibition of another harmless plant counter productive, it will be met with OVERWHELMING resistance, as evidenced by the little preview backlash that your agency received from the citizenry and bi-partisan law-makers (ie. your bosses)\n\nThere are more reasonable regulations that could be enacted such as quality controls and responsible marketing to keep it from being sold at headshops as a legal high, and even an adults-only age restriction. Why are you instead trying to punish respectable citizens with severe prison sentences??\n \nThe whole game has changed. The populist movement that recently rejected the establishment by electing Donald Trump, is spreading like a wild fire. The people are smarter than they used to be. Things are changing rapidly. It should be loud and clear to the DEA that AMERICANS do not want an expansion to the ineffectual drug war. Also, go and look at the President Elect's early views on the DEA and the Drug War. He's not a fan of the way you guys operate and he understands what a COST/BENEFIT ANALYSIS is. He will obviously take note of our resistance and reevaluate your practices should you go ahead with this overreach. \n\nPlease see reason.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16967","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Trenton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me with post surgical pain","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19040","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"martin greco","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me so much with the benzo withdrawal I am currently experiencing.

Kratom gives me hope he may one day be able to manage his pain completely without the use of perscription narcotics. I have been searching for 10 years for a viable alternative gor him and finally have found some hope. Please save people from perscription narcotics addiction and do not schedule kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17849","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Buck Sugden","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Although not all information is known about the plant in question and it's properties, I believe that there is enough evidence (albeit mostly anecdotal), to prevent this substance from being banned for personal/medicinal use.

It's a mild-to-moderate stimulant. I've used it for years with no ill effects--I continue to run a successful small business and care for my children. It has only helped me to stay active, and ease my back pain, without me having to use prescription opiates.\n\nKratom is not unsafe--the DEA has linked Kratom to only 12 deaths (far fewer than from even caffeine or sugarcane), and in most of those cases, kratom had been combined with killer drugs like heroin. Simple logic tells us that this data is barely relevant or useful. \n\nThe limited research we have suggests that kratom acts on opiate receptors in the brain--so does chocolate, cheese, and many other things. Some people have used higher doses of kratom to help them get off heroin or the similar, highly-addictive, prescription pain pills; the FDA also called this a \"misuse\" of kratom. Kratom isn't killing people like heroin, and--unlike heroin--kratom isn't responsible for criminality, and won't make anyone lose their job, friends, or family. If anything, this suggests that we have an opportunity to curb prescription and heroin abuse. (And if kratom is scheduled alongside heroin, anyone who tries kratom and sees how innocuous it is, might then wonder if the DEA is also lying about heroin's dangers. So its scheduling would delegitimize the government's stance on heroin.) \n\nAlso, kratom isn't new--it has been used for literally thousands of years in Southeast Asia (and yet we've never heard of it, which alone points to how safe it is) and in many of those countries, it isn't considered a drug. In countries where it is considered a drug, it's compared to coffee, associated with working hard, and sometimes promoted as a better alternative to marijuana. How am I aware of all of this, yet the DEA isn't? Respectfully, but honestly, the DEA should be ashamed. To try to try to designate a plant Schedule I before even researching it or consulting scientists or the public? That should be criminal.\n\nWe spend at least $50 billion a year on the War on Drugs. Since it began in 1971, we've spent over $1.5 trillion. The addiction rate? Literally unchanged, 45 years and $1.5 trillion later. The War on Drugs stigmatizes those who abuse them, which deters them from getting treatment. We should not be criminalizing kratom users, jailing people who choose a leaf over far-riskier pharmaceuticals. \n\nKratom is currently legal, inexpensive, and it's been time-tested for thousands of years across the globe. But ever-growing numbers of people have been using it to replace prescription painkillers--opiates, which are essentially medicinal heroin, and one of the most lucrative prescription drugs on the planet. Pharmaceutical companies want to protect their profits, and hugely-influential lobbyists have ties to the FDA and DEA. I believe that this proposed scheduling is motivated by ignorance, but also by profit-protection. It's intended to protect the pharmaceutical industry's monopoly on treatment options.\n\nI am a father and the owner of a successful small business. I've used kratom, on average, twice-a-month for three years. I don't use illegal drugs. I can attest personally: at low doses, kratom is like coffee without the jitters. At higher doses, it eases pain while allowing me to stay active. This isn't a prescription painkiller that makes you groggy or lethargic--it's more likely to make you work longer hours with less pain. I've never struggled with addiction, but in my experience, kratom is nowhere near as addictive as cane sugar. (When will we admit that sugar is a dangerous drug? Sugar delivers a rush, causes health problems, rots teeth, and is very addictive. It's a clear, statistical fact that kratom is less dangerous cigarettes, and even less dangerous than sugarcane.)\n\nI am not a criminal. I do not victimize anyone. Please do not criminalize me. Please don't criminalize an herbal supplement that, frankly, belongs in the grocery store with the other herbal supplements.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0369","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thomas Dalton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please this has helped my friend.

First Doctors were encouraged to prescribe pain meds freely and now it is nearly impossible to get pain medication for chronic pain sufferers because of the DEA and FDA cracking down on Doctors prescribing, regardless of your statements about that not being true.  Let me tell you my story.  I am a 51 year old female who has been suffering with chronic pain and auto immune disorders for 10 years now. Everyone knows that if you take any prescription drug such as Vicodin, blood pressure medications, anti anxiety, anti depressants, gabapentin, Lyrica for example, sudden stopping of it will lead to very uncomfortable withdraw symptoms.  I have taken all of these and experienced horrible withdrawals when a prescription runs out or forgetting to take it.  But, only opiate medications are you labeled a drug seeker or addict if you run out, can't get a refill because the Doctor hasn't ordered it yet or the pharmacy won't refill it a day early because it's the weekend.  Even if taking as prescribed.  Only opiates are you humiliated by peeing in a cup and having your pills counted on top of suffering from chronic illnesses and having to go in to the Doctor office to get your prescription now, which is very difficult when disabled.  Or if you go to the ER in terrible pain and they think you are there for drugs.  Now I realize there is a problem with addiction and pills were being abused or sold.  But to lump everyone together has gotten out of hand!  Now we are forced to go to a pain management clinic to get our much needed medicine to function in the real world.  These are experiences from people that were forced to go to them because their Doctor refused to prescribe pain medication out of fear of losing their licenses for over prescribing:  They have been told they must take the pills if they desire treatment and when they have told them they have had addiction issues, they refuse to treat them.  And Insurance won't pay for traditional treatment they offer outside of pain management.  They have been kicked out for not taking all their meds.  They have been kicked out for running short by a couple days worth.  And that leads them to be red flagged and then NOBODY will help them.  That leads them to seek either drugs on the street or alternatives.  I have wound up going to people I know to buy them and wound up becoming addicted which lead me to theft charges for stealing from my employer to fund my habit.  I was put on suboxone and when I was weaned off it, the withdraw from it was worse than the pain meds I was buying.  Then I was told about Kratom.  Let me tell you, it has been a lifesaver for me.  It got me over the hump of withdraw and post acute withdraw and helped me get back to being a functionable person again.  I was laying on the couch all day unproductive.  Kratom does NOT make me high or affect my judgement. It does not create a need to take more like opiates do.  I do not suffer adverse side effects or horrific withdraw symptoms when I don't take it.  What it does do is help manage my pain and actively participate in my life with my family and to be able to hold down a part time job.  It brought me back from the brink of despair thinking that the rest of my life was going to be miserable with pain by just existing. And it saved me from falling back into the brink of addiction again since I am one of those that nobody will help.  In an odd way, I am grateful for that because I would have never found Kratom.  There is a reason why you don't see it being sold on street corners and back alleys because it's not a recreational drug.  It is a supplement much like St Johns Wort and vitamins and minerals which do more for me than medications I was prescribed that made me worse than the symptoms.  If you are going to make it harder to get medications for pain meds and take away a natural alternative to it, then what is your end game?  To let us millions of chronic pain sufferers be criminals for taking a plant that is ground up and safe to use?  Or be a criminal for turning back to the streets to find something that helps me relieve my pain so I can get out of bed, shower and leave the house to be a productive member of society?  Of the 15 deaths that were Kratom related, every one of them had another lethal substance in their body.  Nobody has died from overdosing on Kratom.  You can't.  You will throw it up since it has it's own fail safe built in.  The real problem is the illegal drugs pouring into our country and the deaths related to them.  Alcohol is legal and how many deaths per year related to alcohol?  And tobacco?  Even methamphetamines are not classified as a schedule 1 drug and it kills thousands upon thousands per year.  Please do not ban or schedule this life saving natural plant from the millions of everyday people that use it.  We aren't hurting anyone and this plant is not hurting us.  Thank you.

There's a simple reason these drugs are so addictive: they reduce the body's own production of natural opioids, so that the absence of the drug feels like hell on earth.\n\nKratom, as an opioid with far, far less effect on the body's natural opioid production, and hence far less potential for addiction and abuse, has a real possibility of ending the deadly opioid crisis.\n\nIf you place kratom on Schedule 1, the likely results are:\n\n1. slowing research into use of kratom as a replacement for current prescription painkillers, thus prolonging the opioid addiction crisis and leading to 10s of thousands of unnecessary deaths\n\n2. criminalizing the behavior of citizens who have discovered kratom as a replacement for prescription painkillers, leading to their suffering, unnecessary imprisonment, and other consequences\n\n3. causing teens who are curious about drug experiences to seek out far more dangerous drugs instead, such as crystal methamphetamine, since the DEA will have erroneously suggested that these substances are similarly dangerous\n\nThere is no possible benefit of placing kratom on Schedule 1 that is even in the ballpark of these negative effects.  We still don't even have a single reliable report of a death due to kratom - all such reports involve multiple other drugs and unreliable witnesses.\n\nPlacing kratom on Schedule 1 is such an obviously bad idea that I am amazed it was even proposed.

We believe that it is vital that plants with a long tradition of therapeutic use such as kratom remain accessible to the public.'\n\nI fully support the American Herbalists Guild in their statement above.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23022","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jemimah Baird","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello DEA, I just want to reach out to guys and inform you of the great benefits kratom has to offer.

I do not use mitragyna speciosa for any condition or ailment, so my opposition is not based on personal expierience in using the herb, but on the reports of individuals who have used it. According to an article 'Neuroscience and biobehavioral review' written in 2013 by Dr. Zurina Hassan,PhD, there has been no known clinical research to ascertain any benefits or health risks associated with the use of the herb as a supplement. The testimonies I have read, seen, and heard from personal conversation, online videos, and articles have overwhelmingly tauted (mitragyna speciosa) kratom as having effective medicinal uses for the treatment of pain, anxiety, depression, PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), Opiate withdrawal, etc. In light of these testimonies, I cannot support a proposition to schedule this herbal remedy that effectively treats the ailments, conditions, and disorders of many people. It would be unethical to esscentially ban an herb that treats opiate withdrawal. Our country is in need of this herb because of the deadly heroin epidemic, also there is good evidence of medicinal benefits. At this time, I have not seen any evidence that the side effects of (mitragyna speciosa) Kratom would be any more severe than over-the-counter medications at the local drug store.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7343","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-26T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zachary Flood","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern:\n\nI am the Managing Partner and Founder of one of the largest Consumer Protection law firm's in the country.  As an Attorney, and as a person of strong Faith, I am against the use of illicit drugs.  Roughly two years ago, when I was 34, I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.  As a result this disease, I have spent weeks in the hospital over the past two years, have lost eyesight in my right eye, and have suffered indescribable pain.  Before finding Kratom, I was  bedridden roughly two days a week, and when I was walking I regularly needed a cane to walk.  I was also regularly taking prescription painkillers which, although did alleviate some of the pain I was hesitant to take regularly because I didn't want to become dependent upon them. Additionally, I frequently suffered from MS \"Brain Fog\" and was often unable to clearly articulate myself.  As you can imagine, this greatly impacted my ability to practice law.  As importantly, my active lifestyle had deteriorated and I had gone from regularly working out at the gym to laying in bed.   I was certainly prohibited from entering mountain bike races as I had once done before I was diagnosed.  \n\nRefusing to accept my diagnosis as a death sentence, I started doing research on MS websites as to alternative methods of pain management and stumbled upon many people with MS praising Kratom for its ability to \"clear\" their mind, manage their pain, and regain their pre-diagnosis lifestyle.  Since starting Kratom two months ago, my life has changed.\n\nI am now able to live and work without any impairment whatsoever.  I am now able to work out as I did before I was diagnosed, and the chronic pain in my back, hands, and legs is gone.  As remarkably, I was able to throw away my cane.\n\nI do not find Kratom addictive and I have no withdraw symptoms or cravings on the days that I do not take the supplement.  Its pain management far exceeds any prescription painkiller I have ever taken.  I do not see anyone wanting to use Kratom for recreational purposes, any more than one would use Coffee for recreational purposes.  There is no feeling of being inebriated using Kratom.\n\nKratom has, literally, changed my life.  I plea with the DEA to not list Kratom as a Schedule 1 Drug, or take any action making it more difficult for people, especially law abiding citizens like myself, to obtain.  Kratom has changed my life, and the lives of many people diagnosed with MS.\n\nThank you for consideration of my remarks.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2282","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeffrey Hyslip","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"this is a safer alternative for withdrawals from opiates and pain. i do not believe it should be banned or schedule 1.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2823","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"laura miller","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be listed as a controlled substance for the following reasons:\n\n\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17618","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Srikanth Raghunathan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was addicted to Methadone for 4 years.

In 2013, his physician stopped prescribing cold turkey, which left my husband in a terrible place. My husband works long hours at a physically demanding job and was barely able to function due to the terrible withdraws he was having from taking Vicodin for such an extended period. He ended up going to a Psychiatrist who prescribed an even worse (in my opinion) medication - Suboxone. For two years, my husband was not himself. In 2014, he began having numbness in his hands and legs. He saw a neurologist who told him he was going to have to have a cervical spine fusion. The surgery was successful, but my husband still has pain. Not wanting to continue with the Suboxone for a variety of reasons, he began doing research into more natural pain remedies and found Kratrom. Kratom has been an answer to our prayers. It has saved my husband's job, our marriage, and sometimes I think his life. Neither my husband or I use illegal drugs, alcohol, or smoke cigarettes. We are highly functioning members of society with a house, 2 children and 2 dogs. We are faithful people. We are good people. We are law abiding citizens. If Kratom is banned in the USA, crime rates could increase because there is a great possibility that these poor people suffering from pain may feel forced to break the law in order to feel normal. Kratom does not have bad effects and I honestly can't imagine that it could possibly cause 1/2 the damage of alcohol.

I am 38 years old and I am a business professional working for a large corporation as an IT Database Administrator.  About 10 years ago, I went through a very dark time in my life.  I found out my fianc was cheating on me with my best friend.  The housing market crashed right after I purchased my first home and within a couple of years I found myself single and alone and in foreclosure on my house.  I was in an ungodly amount of emotional pain. It was around this time that someone introduced me to oxycodone.   I found that I could take one of these pills and all of that emotional pain I was feeling was gone.  As you can imagine, within a few weeks I had become addicted.  This was when things went from bad to horrible.    I would try to quit using the pills every weekend so that I could make it back to work on Monday, but it never worked. I might make it a day or 2 into the next week, but eventually I would always return to the pills.  My work performance started to drop off, which eventually led to me losing my job.  I had lost a large part of my life before oxycodone entered my life and the pills made sure to take away anything I had left.  I was depressed to the point of being suicidal.  It was around this time that I ran into an old friend.  He had also had a painkiller addiction but he told me how he was able to get off of them using a natural plant called kratom.  At first I didn't believe him but I was desperate to get my life together so I decided to go to a local kava bar that sold it and give it a shot.  I was shocked when it turned out that kratom held the answer just like he said it would.  Within a couple of weeks I was completely off of oxycodone and felt none of the withdrawal symptoms I would always feel when trying to quit.  This was about 5 years ago.  Now I take small doses of kratom every day.  The kratom helps me with severe anxiety problem I have always battled.  It allows me to be myself without constantly feeling held back by my own anxiety. I started working at this company 3 years ago.  I started on the bottom rung, answering the help desk line all day to help customers with their basic issues.  Over the past 3 years, kratom has helped me to be the best I can be.  I have been promoted now 4 times in the past 2 years to the point that I was put into a better and more lucrative career path in Data Management.  If it wasn't for kratom I may not even be alive, but with the help of kratom I have not only turned my life around, but my quality of life has reached new heights that I never even imagined possible.  I can only assume that my story is not unlike thousands of other kratom users who classify kratom as a miracle plant, and it scares me to no ends to hear that the DEA is looking to ban the one thing that has been my absolute savior.  I implore you to listen to my story, as well as all others and to do what's right.  KRATOM IS NOT DANGEROUS! Anyone that has ever died with kratom in their system has also had other illegal or prescription substances in their bodies as well.  I can agree that perhaps there needs to be regulation, but to outlaw it would be devastating to this country, as the already absurdly high rate of opiate overdoses will only increase rather than decrease.  Please turn your attention to prescription painkillers.  These are the drugs that are killing people.  Kratom provides the benefits to these painkillers without the negative side effects.

I personally don't don't consume caffeine, however my husband imbibes regularly in a tall icy Coca-Cola. \n     In 2007 we invited a young man, his wife and three children to live with us.  They had hit a rough patch - Fresh out of jail having served time for non-support and driving without a license he was unemployed.  His wife was 8 1/2 months pregnant, couldn't work while he was gone and they had lost their apartment. The family was homeless.  We did not know at the time that he had a pill problem. \n     Over time, his child support was caught up, his driver's license was reinstalled, and he had different jobs that were almost enough for him, his wife and his (now) four children to move out.  Success was always lost at the last minute.  Something would go wrong;  the boss cheated him out of a paycheck, he lost his wallet, there was a mix up in the of hours he worked.  In retrospect,  we were nave and missed the obvious signs of drug addiction. \n     One day, he took me aside and told me  he was again addicted to opiates (he had been through this before). He wanted to quit, but he needed help.  This was an extremely tough process that, at times resulted in me giving him money and a ride to his pill pushers (usually 85-year-old ladies supplementing their Social Security) because I couldn't stand watching him wither in the pain of withdrawal.  Finally, he started on methadone which seemed like a godsend. In reality methadone is no different than other opiates, or for that matter heroine,  and he was soon abusing methadone. Again, we didn't recognize what he was doing. He would take all of his weekly doses at once to have a GREAT Monday-Tuesday high, then he'd be sick in bed the rest of the week. We believed him when he said it was the flu or side-effects of methadone.\n     When that behavior was figured out, and we were watching his methadone intake much closer, he began sneaking out and supplementing with pills. When that was discovered and his money was much more closely monitor, he began supplementing with meth as that is much less expensive.  Meth was pure hell, and we all thought we had lost him.\n     Available rehab for uninsured people is nothing more than a  dehumanizing group lock up that allows you to suffer cold turkey withdrawal  in the most painful way imaginable. We couldn't do that to him, but if he ever got caught and put in jail, that's what he was facing. He avoided that.\n     As is common with methamphetamine addiction, he went into a psychosis. He was sure that the government was spying on him and all of us were against him.  He started gathering large knives, talked of killing people he caught following him and, quite frankly, became a very scary person. At one point he tried to kill himself cutting his own wrist.\n     It was during that time, in desperation, I actually Googled \"homeopathic cures for opiate addictions\" and came across the term kratom.\n     It wasn't quite overnight, but he is now almost two years drug-free. He and his wife and (now) five children on their own, supported by his 40+ hours per week job in construction/home repairs.  When clean he was always hard working and a very talented man.  \n     He is still a regular user of kratom, and from what I have come to understand, it helps him with his underlying depression and gives him the energy that depression robs from a person. \n     If there were a way to get high on kratom, I do believe he would've found it and abused it.  Instead, it just took away his cravings for opiates, but left him with the energy to have a good life.\n     I am not a regular user of kratom and would personally not suffer if it were banned.  That said, I believe wholeheartedly that kratom should not be rescheduled or reclassified as harmful in any way. I have seen the life-changing difference kratom makes, and I believe it would be not only unjust but harmful to take this option away from people trying to take control of their lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5037","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Iris Fields","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I oppose the DEA making kratom a schedule one drug.  Here is my kratom story.  My husband had a carcinoid tumor on his appendix, but it went un-diagnosed for years.  His doctor's prescribed opiates and benzodiazapines.  For 10 years he was addicted to prescription drugs.  He tried methadone and suboxone to try to get off of them.  It only switched one drug for the other.  Both were horrible substances that made him feel terrible and kept him unhealthy.  He finally was able to come off all drugs cold turkey. For over a year he suffered from PAWS (post acute withdrawl  syndrome).  He was miserable.  Nothing would help his IBS, he was depressed, he suffered from anxiety, he saw no hope.  He was in danger of going back to opiates, which he started dabbling with again.  He didn't want to go back to that way of life.  And then we found Kratom.  \nIt was the most amazing and life changing substance he has ever come across.  With in one week he felt great for the first time in over a decade.  He had energy, he could sleep through the night.  It made him feel normal again.  In the last year my husband has lost 60 pounds, went back to work full time.  We are able to go camping, something he could never dream of when he had IBS.  His depression lifted, he started exercising. The gray tinge on his face from opiate use is gone. The before and after is amazing and it is all due to the use of Kratom.  Not only has it been a life saving miracle, but it is very affordable, which is a God send since we do not have insurance.  Kratom saved his life.  It brought the quality back to his life.  He is not in pain and he is no longer suffering.  If you make Kratom illegal it is going to have a devastating effect, not only my husband's life but countless others who could benefit.

That was the easy part.  Prior to that I had suffered terribly for months, unable to eat more than crackers, lost almost 40 pounds in a two month window and the pain was intolerable spending most of my time in bed.  I was put on Steroids to reduce the inflammation in my intestines and never truly felt better and Tylenol for the pain. Fast forward to March of this year (2016), many doctors appointments, lab tests and emails back and forth as to why I continued to feel like I had been hit by a semi-truck and many other problems which I couldnt possibly list, to be told I have Fibromyalgia in addition to the IBD.  Some days are so bad I cant get out of bed because the pain has me in a fetal position while I cry. Not an easy adjustment for a woman that was a single mother for 19years, active, just turned 49 this month and a soccer manager/mom for 12 years.  I was always on the go until this struck me.\nI have worked for the State of California for 10 years and have a very fast pace job that I enjoy doing and am proud of.  My life has dramatically changed over the last 2 years, I now only have the energy to go to work on my better days but there is no energy left after work and the pain from sitting most of my work day is horrible. My quality of life is terrible (who am I kidding there is no life), my only goal is to get to work and get back home to rest. I have since depleted all of my sick leave hours and the only thing I am given for pain is Tylenol. Muscle relaxers for the spasms and a sleeping pill. Tylenol doesnt even touch this kind of pain that my Fibromyalgia causes and I cant even begin to attempt to explain how debilitating it is. I was taking the max dose per my DR of Tylenol and it has concerned me as to what it is doing to my liver after almost 2 years. You cannot even concentrate with the chronic pain that I have on most days, not to mention the muscle spasms, migraine headaches daily and the list goes on.  I currently have an average of two to three decent feeling days a month and I use the term decent loosely. I have been petrified that I wont be able to continue working because most of my symptoms are similar to MS and extremely debilitating.\nAfter a conversation with a friend of mine regarding my diagnosis and my symptoms he mentioned a friend of his that has been in the same boat and was taking something that has been a pseudo miracle for her.  He made a call and told me Kratom.  Id never heard of Kratom prior to that day.  So, once again I started on my research quest to find out what this Kratom is and couldnt believe the information and testimonials I read.  I was at such a desperate time in my illnesses that I wouldve given anything a try.  I ordered Kratom tea in capsules with not a lot of hope they would help me but had to at least give it a try.  It was the best thing I couldve ever have done, after my first day I couldn't believe the relief I have.  I am getting some of my life back!  My daily pain is tolerable; the Fibro Fog you experience from being in chronic pain has mostly subsided and fewer migraines which are daily.  I can actually make a dinner plan on occasion and get some of my household chores completed after work that I havent been able to do in a long time. Ive now been taking Kratom for about a month and overall I have to say its been a bit of a miracle for me. Now I am in fear of having this bit of quality of life taken from me because the DEA wants to reschedule Kratom.  I am begging of you to not allow this to happen. Fibromyalgia is not a fatal illness but the number one cause of death due to Fibromyalgia is suicide.  Most people cannot take being in pain all day, every day nor should they have to. If Kratom is rescheduled Im in fear of being a felon for taking a natural plant based capsule (similar to the Turmeric capsules I take) because the DEA making a hasty uneducated decision.  I would love to tell people about my Kratom experience but because of the stigma right now around it I wont. Please help us with chronic pain and hold off the DEA until the proper research can be done.  Ive only recently gotten my life back and would hate to be back in bed for the 10 hours I am home after work, possible lose my job that I love due to absences from the pain and being able to be a little social.  Ive been locked up in pain for too long and hope; no beg that you will reconsider.\nSincerely,\nGeorgia Kattenhorn\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1971","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Georgia Kattenhorn","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There is no question that taking yet another natural alternative off the market will increase overdose deaths. With the state our country is currently in with the heroin epidemic, who on Earth in good conscience would propose what you are planning to do, and have the audacity to assume you are \"doing the right thing.\" You should be ashamed of yourselves for even considering it. Are you seriously devoting time to this when thousands and thousands of people in the country have overdosed on LEGAL medication approved by the FDA this year alone? (not that FDA approval means anything in real-life, or we wouldn't allow pharmaceutical companies to profit immensely from obviously unsafe drugs).\nIn case you are unaware, people are dying from prescription medication, cocaine, heroin and other already illegal opiates and benzodiazepines: https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates \nDoesn't it seem morally right to allow access to safe options, rather than taking them away before you even understand one iota of what you're trying to destroy? Let me put it this way, the only reason ANYONE is in support of this proposed ban is SOLELY because of one or more of the following:\n1. Profit:\nThink about pharmaceutical companies and what they would do if a safe alternative to their \"options\" were being used by so many people that their margins were affected. Just look at Suboxone, an FDA approved treatment for opiate/opioid addition that makes their manufacturers a BOATLOAD of money daily, and it's guaranteed to make the user addicted to it...because it is STILL an opioid. That's not a solution, it's a corporation's bottom-line.\n2. Misinformation/Ignorance:\nI don't mean ignorance as \"stupid\"; I mean that people are so uninformed or misinformed on what this is and what it does that most of the people in this category believe that Kratom is an opioid, which is undeniably FALSE. There are no opioids in Kratom. There are only the compounds the DEA wishes to ban, because they don't understand them. There is no place in our society today for allowing others to suffer because of someone else's ignorance. I know people are getting relief from Kratom, and they absolutely should have access to it. Do you know why people who advocate Kratom are never on the news as part of a terrible crime resulting, at least in part, from drug use? Because those people do not engage in that behavior. They are not junkies trying to get their next fix; they are functional, productive members of this society and the majority are over the age of 30. When's the last time you saw a Veteran that fought for our freedom being denied access to morphine when they needed it? Me either. But we seem to think it's OK to take their Kratom away....absolutely unacceptable.\n3. Their jobs are at risk if the American People are not constantly in a state of fear about the drug situation in this country. You know who you are\nLet's look at the facts:\n1. Nobody has ever died from consuming only Kratom. The original intent to schedule posted here in August 2016 blamed 16 deaths on Kratom. The toxicology reports indicate that all of them were taking multiple drugs, and with most of them being the kinds of drugs that have been known to kill people, it makes you wonder why the DEA would include that in the first place. Do you really think the American people are just stupid and won't do the research, or did you think you're smart enough to not get caught?\n2. Tylenol can destroy your liver, but that's still widely available. Drugs are approved every day in this country that can easily kill anyone who uses it. Is a treatment for Restless Leg Syndrome really worth going into convulsions or death? Apparently that's more acceptable a risk than allowing Kratom to do what it does and help so many people to live their lives the way they want, with no side-effects?\n3. There is a government established \"acceptable\" number of deaths every year from chlorine in tap water. So why do we still drink tap water? Because it is needed. Kratom is also needed by many people, and yet it hasn't killed a single person on it's own and we need to even spend time discussing banning it? Come on, really?\n4. People are getting relief from a wide array of difficulties and pain that they would otherwise have to suffer through. Being miserable isn't good for the individual or their community. So why aren't we simply discussing how to make this a regulated product that ensures the safety of anyone utilizing it so that people can still benefit?

I am writing to you today to urge you to keep Kratom off of the Schedule 1 list.  \n\nI am a 41 year old stay-at-home mom of a precocious 4 year old boy and a wife to my wonderful husband.  Shortly after our son's birth I became very ill, and after 1.5 years of bouncing around from doctor to doctor trying to find what was wrong with me, I was finally given a diagnosis of late stage Lyme disease.  I am currently still in treatment for this disease, which causes me debilitating pain and fatigue, among many other symptoms.  I have found kratom invaluable in helping me with the pain and fatigue effectively without serious side effects or dependence.  I take it almost daily to help me have a semblance of a quality of life.  Unlike opioid drugs, kratom has been safe with minimal side effects for me other than occasional constipation, with better effectiveness for my pain.  It is similar in energy giving properties to coffee, which is legal and unregulated, without the jitters or anxiety that can come from drinking too much caffeine.  I have been taking it for well over a year now, with no noticeable tolerance or dependence.  This is not a substance I use recreationally to get high.  I take it for the significant benefits to my quality of life.  \n\nIf this were to become illegal to purchase, my life - including my son's and husband's lives - would definitely suffer for it.  To make me a criminal for trying to obtain a naturally occurring plant like Kratom that allows me to be a better mother to my son seems heartless, especially with so little evidence of harm. (of 660 calls to poison control, only one reported death, and that one was taking a combination of strong psychoactive medication in conjunction with kratom, so causality is unclear). www.medscape.com/viewarticle/866904\n\nTo say that kratom has no medicinal value is patently false.  I know many people like myself, who find kratom an invaluable adjunct to their lives because they are dealing with chronic pain and illness like myself.  At the very least give researchers time (and funds) to set up some quality clinical trials before making this determination.

It is pain that I deal with daily and am accustomed to. I tried years ago to take prescription meds to help deal with this pain, but quickly realized that I have an extreme sensitivity to them. I tried every different kind they could think of and at every possible strength. Regardless of what I tried, I wasn't able to find one that allowed me to live and function in a normal and comfortable way. Because of this, I learned to deal with the pain as best as I could. A few years ago, I was in introduced to kratom. I had never heard of it before, but my friends swore by it. I trusted them and decided to give it a try myself. Here it is, years later and I am still using kratom. I do not take it every day and have never felt a dependence on it. But there are days when my pain is exceptionally bad and those are the days that I am glad to have it as an option. I appreciate that this comment period has been opened up and that we are able to share our stories and voices. \nThank you for your time. \nKendall","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1896","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI heard about this website through a Joe Rogan Experience podcast.

I was told at 30 it was inevitable I would have to go on disability.  I have been fighting since.  I had to stop pain management after 5 years and had to suffer.  I found kratom about 2 years ago and it was a miracle plant from the beginning.  I received my first samples in the mail and took it within 30 minutes I had felt better than I have in my  life.  I remember that day very well.  I did not take an opiate for 2 years except for the occasion Tylenol 3 for a migraine.  I have stopped kratom without any withdrawals unlike pain medication.  I have had no side affects from kratom and am very susceptible to side affects of medication.  Kratom is a plant in the coffee family and is not addictive. Kratom saved my life. I live in AR so in February 2016 kratom was made a sched 1 here.  I do not understand how you can make a God given plant into a narcotic, though it works on the same receptors it is not a drug It is an herb, a plant.  Kratom helped me more than anything and with this ban I was forced back into a life that I do not want. I can not work without something for pain and anxiety as I can not be around people my anxiety is so bad.  Kratom helped literally every ailment that is wrong with me.  I had to wait 3 months to see a doctor that would help me after the ban.  My quality of life has gone down so much since I was forced to go back to opiates.  I cry daily because I do not want the medication but my rights to treat myself with Gods given plant has been taken away.  I am not as happy as I was, my pain is worse than ever, I can not play with my grandkids like I did with kratom.  Please do not make anyone else go through what I am going through it is torture. If kratom is banned it will send so many back to a life they hate, to overdoses, etc. I can not think straight on medication, kratom made me clear headed and help take the fibro fog away.  It gave me energy to get through the day with my chronic fatigue.  It does not make you high or give you a buzz it just works. There are no overdoses because you can't overdose it has a built in mechanism that makes you sick and you throw it up and go to sleep.  If you take to many opiates it will kill you, none of the cases that are claimed to be kratom deaths all had other substances in them it was not kratom.  Please do your research and give kratom its due diligence banning it is a huge mistake. Kratom makes you a more productive member of society.  So many people will wind up on disability.   I have honestly thought about moving to be able to go back to taking my kratom.  Big Pharma wants kratom to be banned so that it can make money on the things people hate.  People are being sent back to doctors for prescriptions, then the doctors that we are forced to go back to get in trouble for writing the very thing the government makes us take to be able to even get out of bed.  Then the doctors have their license taken away for writing prescriptions and people are forced back to the street.  You have to wonder if you will even be able to get your prescription, if not your screwed because no more kratom for you because the government took away a plant, a plant, then when you are an addict trying to take medication because you need it and trying to take it right, but then you are still hurting because it doesn't help.  Opiates make you forget the pain and make it worse, kratom actually helps and takes away the pain it actually gives your life back and why would Big Pharma want us to have a plant that helps you get off opiates, heroin, etc.   I am crying just typing this.  Please I am begging you PLEASE don't make others go through what i am having to go through.  Please think and research and let us live because so many will die.  After the doctors can't write anymore what is left?  Sending people back to heroin?  Kratom helps you get rid of that to.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18038","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bethany Cook","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This supplement has reduced my prescription dependency.

I had back surgery some twelve years back and ever since I've been prescribed oxycodone and other pain medications. I had gotten use to the fact that I would probably be on these medications for the rest of my life even though they weren't helping my pain anymore it had just became an addiction to them that would literally keep me from working or doing anything for that matter anytime I would try to stop using them. I started researching natural ways to help stop the pain and help with the awful withdrawal symptoms I would have. That's when I learned about Kratom, I immediately thought how could a natural plant or herb help me get through these things but I figured I had nothing to lose but everything to gain if it helped relieve my pain and function clear headed again and not to be in a fog all the time. I ordered Kratom through an on line reputable vendor after researching everything I could on this plant and didn't even think about going to what they called a \"Head Shop\" which that alone wasn't appealing. I ordered a sample pack and was amazed at how it helped with my pain and also the dreaded fog was gone, I started being more clear headed and focused at work not to mention I had enough energy to do more with my family after work versus just taking my prescription and sitting in my chair everyday after coming home. I've read what the media has covered on Kratom and the initial negative comments made. I have been using for just under a year and am thankful that I found it so that I can continue to be a productive member of society and provide for my family. 'm asking that the government allow more research to be done on this plant which is no more addictive than caffeine can be at least in my opinion. If I don't use Kratom I'm still able to function unlike missing or stopping  a dose of my prescription. Kratom has been what I've needed to get my personal and professional life back to where it was before I legally became addicted to a prescription drugs. My thoughts are if there is something natural that can help people with so many various issues whether it be pain or anxiety and many other reasons people use Kratom to help with we owe it to the American public to allow more research to be done, and if something natural has the chance to stop the increasing drug epidemic our country is in then we shouldn't just immediately classify it as a schedule 1 controlled substance if it actually helps to beat this drug war we are in. I also agree to some degree of regulation when it comes to age limitations and having anything added or enhancing of this plant/herb other than its natural state.

The DEA's own definition of a schedule 1 substance taken from their own website is: Schedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. \n\nKratom, and it's psychoactive constituents, are used in many countries for pain relief, anxiety, energy, and opiate detox/ withdrawal.  They clearly have medical uses, just as cannabis clearly has medical uses (another hypocritical DEA scheduling issue).  While there is a risk of abuse from using the active psychoactives of Kratom, the consequences of that abuse physically and sociologically are far less severe than other schedule 1 drugs.  \n\nLabeling these psychoactives as schedule 1 is not only hypocritical, but it removes the ability to study it in the USA if labeled as such, which in turn takes away a plant from known medical application.  Every substance has a risk versus reward continuum, and this risk is extremely low to the patient's health and society's crime/ abuse impact.  \n\nI would think the DEA has much more important battles to pick, and time/ money could be much better spent redirecting its efforts toward meaningful impact decisions.

At best, the argument against kratom is based on faulty, hasty science. I applaud the DEA's decision to seek input from the FDA before moving forward with this ban. \n\nYour standards claim that Schedule I is for substances \"with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" Kratom meets neither of these conditions. I will also address your third criterion, \"lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision\", and some other justifications that I believe are illogical. \n\nRegarding medical use:\n\nIn the absence of a peer-reviewed study confirming kratom's health benefits, we must rely for now on anecdotal evidence, which overwhelmingly says that kratom is an effective treatment for chronic or post-surgical pain (and therefore a safe alternative to opiates), and that it can help opioid addicts eventually stop using drugs altogether. Please do not conflate \"absence of evidence\" with \"evidence of absence\".\n\nRegarding potential for abuse: \n\nThere has not yet been a large-scale study calculating the rate of side effects or addiction, so again, we must rely on the numbers available, which say that kratom is safe and not addictive. The DEA itself has claimed that millions of dosage units have entered the US, but that the drug has only been implicated in 15 deaths (in most of which, kratom's role was unconfirmed), an incredibly low rate. \n\nRegarding the lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision:\n\nMedical research has not yet caught up with this helpful drug, and therefore doctors haven't had a chance to develop usage guidelines. Furthermore, kratom research may be the key to safer pharmaceutical painkillers, but if the substance is scheduled, such research may never get off the ground, and the current trend of opiate prescriptions will be forced to continue.\n\nRegarding your claim that, \"the identity, purity, and quantity of these substances are uncertain and inconsistent, thus posing significant adverse health risks to users\" (in your Proposed Rule document from August 31):\n\nThe most effective way to protect people from this problem is with FDA regulations. Scheduling kratom will only force it onto the black market, thus further exposing its users to additives, impurities, and other dangers.\n\nKratom does not meet the standards of a Schedule I substance. It is a safe recreational drug, and a potentially useful (but currently under-researched) medicine. Banning the substance will not make America safer. It will only serve to exacerbate America's opioid addiction problem, completely destroy the quality of life for many chronic pain sufferers, and create more health risks for kratom users.\n\nThank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22737","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps thousands of people get off legally overperscribed opiates.

My name is nick romanoff I'm 23 y/o. I am full time pre med student and worker at a tool store. StartI ing with reasons I inject kratom, I have 4 bulging spinel discs in my lower lumbar spinal region and hairline fracture on my L-2 vertebrae. I fight for kratom because without it I wouldn't be ableaving to go to school or work because the pain gets so deep and strong it's near paralyzing.  Being the age I am ,  any doctor I go to with (wit medical background paper proof)  I can't get handed any pain killers. Assuming my age dictates my ability to think  and act makes it impossible to have care to live my life and keep trying so I can help people like me after I finish school. Kratom I never had to worry about what the doc would think.( Think) because dea, fda and cdc looking at this knows the body reacts to specific people, and only the person can say 100% what is felt, taste or seen . Being 23 I have high o.d amount age group. With kratom , I never needed to convince a person of somthing they can't feel and if detailed enough say it's a lie. Truth is painkillers scar me too. I had norco for 4 years (10/355mg) and was become dependent. Kratom has been 2 years daily but when I'm out its only like missing coffee, nothing like what's legal . You know motrin vs kratom od statistics so I'll skip the story of that od difference. Long story short I'm asking a question and you can choose the answers: what will I be if my crutch is kicked away? . If illegal are you gana be able to help me with my pain? Will you pay for surgery to fix my back? Yes plan on surgery at age 23 for my back .... idk I'm to young for this and it hurts me emotionally it's not just physical.  I'm not taking stuff the rest my life for pain . I just can't pay for somthing like that at my age so I need help till I fix the root problem. There is no risk to kratom , please, at least for 5 years or forever keep it legal . I'm crying begging for you to at least let me finish school so I can start my life and open ability of fixing this  problem. \nI'm nock romanoff, an I'm not kratom.

I'm 30 years old, and my great passion is (thankfully) also my full-time job. I'm an event professional, coordinating the planning and execution of events ranging from small R&D strategy sessions to music festivals boasting more than 18,000 attendees. I grew up in a family that founded multiple bluegrass music festivals, and I'm so thankful that I was raised to love this labor of mine.\n\nUnfortunately, my job and passion doesn't always come easy to me. I was diagnosed with spondylolisthesis when I was 19 years old. This is a birth defect of the spine, which results in one or more vertebrae sliding out of place, causing misalignment, poor balance, and chronic pain. At age 29, I was forced to have spinal fusion surgery (age 29!) to keep it from becoming worse. By the time of my operation, my L5 vertebrae had slipped more than 75% off of my S1 (sacral joint). There was no way to safely postpone the surgery. It could only be corrected to about 50%, so I still have a chronic pain and am now starting on month 11 of physical therapy. \n\nTo cope with the pain, which was often so bad that I couldn't sleep, my doctor had no choice but to prescribe me numerous opiate painkillers, nerve medication, and muscle relaxers. All of them left me in a fog, and my job and family suffered for it. I have a 9 year old son who loves nothing more than to go hiking with me on weekend and I wasn't able to go more than a mile without being completely overcome with pain. And this was AFTER my surgery. At this point, I started getting very depressed about my situation. I mean, I was 30 years old and facing down a life of either chronic pain, or long-term vicodin use. Having grown up in eastern Kentucky, I had witnessed first-hand how destructive prescription painkillers were, and the thought of having to rely on them terrified me. I tried super high doses of tylenol, modified yoga, steam, electrotherapy, a new mattress, even new shoes. Nothing worked as well as the heavy-duty painkillers, and it just sucked. \n\nAbout three months ago, a friend recommended that I try kratom. I'd never heard of it, so I did some research and ordered a beginner's pack from a recommended online vendor. After the very first use, of which I only had to take about 1 tsp., I felt better than I had in years. My pain was nearly gone, but I didn't have the opiate fog. I had energy, I found myself able to walk farther and perform better in physical therapy, and my depression lifted. Even my anxiety, which had moderately plagued me since my teenage years to the point where I had trouble being the passenger in a vehicle without a mild panic attack, became a non-issue. I honestly have never felt better than I have over these past few months, and I wasn't \"high\". I wasn't in pain, and I was happy. But when I heard that the DEA was planning to ban it, making it a Scheule 1 no less, I was shocked and heartbroken.\n\nI was a teenager once. I tried a wide variety of party drugs, drank beer, and got into all of the usual trouble a teen does. I can tell you right that kratom in no way resembles the drugs currently listed as Schedule 1. Not even close. Kratom is no \"legal high\". At most, it is the world's greatest cup of coffee, sprinkled with a safe painkiller that doesn't get you hooked. In light of today's opiod epidemic, how on earth could something that safely replaces such a dangerous family of drugs be deemed as a health hazard with no medical benefits? I won't repeat all of the statistics that show how many people have died from opiate overdoses vs kratom. But I will tell you this: banning kratom will absolutely do more harm than good. Banning it is simply unsafe, and irresponsible. Even my surgeon, who didn't know anything about it until I told him a month after I started using it, now sings its praises and advises most of his patients to use it in place of traditional opiates. \n\nThis stuff has gave me my life back, and I'm not even one of the most extreme cases. I've heard testimonials from disabled veterans, accident survivors, even those born with crippling deformities talk about how much it has helped them. Banning it will make criminals out of millions of people who have finally found safe, non-addictive relief. \n\nPlease, I urge you to reconsider this. Let universities and labs continue studying kratom, because they continue to find how helpful it is, and it could very well save the lives of hundreds of thousands of opiate addicts. Our country is being crippled by these new surges in heroin addiction, and there's an alternative that won't kill people. How on earth does it make sense to ban the one thing that might be able to save us?\n\nI don't want to go back to painkillers. I don't want to go back to sleepless nights and being unable to stand. \n\nI'm 30 years old. I want to enjoy the rest of my life without pain or pills. My son doesn't want to lose his hiking partner again, and he wants his whole \"Mom\". Please don't make me a criminal. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2015","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mallory Smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I oppose the ban of kratom tea.

From Central Louisiana and I would like to take a few minutes of your time to share the HOPE I have received since discovering kratom. I spent 12 years of my life, from 14 years old to 26 years old, addicted to opiates. My journey started with a basketball injury and it required me to take painkillers for over 6 weekd. I never went more than 24 hours without opiates in my system from that day, at 14 years of age. I had no hope, I lived a miserable life, I lost contact with my children, my family had to basically \"bury me alive\" (actually words that were told to me), I couldn't hold down a job, my life was utter CHAOS. I finally got help and got off the opiates and now have a chance. That chance, however, has been created thanks to Kratom. Kratom keeps me going, it helps when my back goes out (3 slipped discs and 1 shattered disc). I have my family, children, and my wife behind me today. I have held down steady employment for 1.5 years to date. Most importantly I haven't touched opiates or any illegal narcotics in over 2 years now. I understand this is a touchy issue for some of you, but i BEG YOU AND URGE YOU PLEASE DO NOT BAN OR LIMIT THIS PRODUCT FROM AVAILABILITY. Half the reason I turned to illegal narcotics and to buying painkillers illegally is because I can not, like most Americans even with Obamacare, afford to visit a doctor. Kratom has saved me from a life of addiction, crime, and simply being a menace to society. Ive taken this product for over 2 years now and have had NO ISSUES, never overdosed, never even had as much as a stomach ache from taking this product. I understand bath salts, the \"legal weed\" mess, and designer drugs, however, this beautiful plant is in NO WAY ON THAT LEVEL! This herbal remedy isn't even as harmful as the horrendous effects Tylenol causes. If there was significant risk I would not be writing you, I would not even touch this product if that was the case. I sincerely hope that an HERBAL REMEDY that has not caused any death, overdose, or hospitaliztion of ANY KIND will not be stolen from the American public due to lack of research and knowledge. I will stand behind the American Kratom Association and all people fighting for the survival of our rights to be able to freely purchase a HERBAL REMEDY. Lastly, I ask that you simply keep the people like me in mind in your decision, the success stories created from a simple, non harmful product. Thank you SOO much for taking time out of your day to acknowledge my story, if it wasnt for kratom i WOULD be in the streets still doing the very things I despise just in order to survive, please keep us in mind in this decision. I hate the life of crime i lived, but I sincerely FEAR I'll end up back on hardcore drug use if kratom is stolen from us. I thank you for all you do to protect us and ask PLEASE DO NOT BAN THIS MIRACLE!!!\n\n                                                                   THANK YOU,\n                                                                   BRENT W.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8250","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brent W","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have had two open heart surgeries, endocarditis and and pacemaker implanted.

Scheduling Kratom would be a move in the wrong direction - it would expand and perpetuate the failed \"War on Drugs\", and remove folks' rights for a victimless act. From a purely logistical standpoint, we already have an overwhelming percent of our populace with their freedom taken away - our prison system cannot continue growing. \n\nOn the whole, the United States of America is based on the belief that the public are their own rulers - that is, we are not supposed to have a ruling class telling the masses what to do, believe, and think. This should expand to drug policy, where an overwhelming majority support an end to Richard Nixon's racist \"War on Drugs\". The United States' federal government has an obligation to listen to its populace's needs and desires, and try its best to act accordingly. Sometimes, this means admitting that programs were wrong in the first place and must be ended. Sometimes this means admitting we were wrong.\n\nPractically, millions of people in the United States already safely use Kratom for a pain reliever and to detox themselves from powerful opioids. If we were added to Schedule I, we would be removing those peoples' choice to care for their own health as they choose. Moreover, it would remove all opportunity to study the drug and scientifically vet its medicinal possibilities and study its affects.\n\nI urge the DEA to not schedule Kratom, on the basis that doing so would perpetuate our priston crisis, remove peoples' freedoms for (what would be) a victimless crime, go against the will of the public, and remove peoples' ability to care for their own health as they choose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2825","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dana Conrad","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The opioid crisis is a real thing in America.

I obey the law, pay my taxes, work hard, and try to raise my son to be a great citizen. I also suffer from chronic pain resulting from an abdominal infection almost a decade ago. Tired of using prescription painkillers to manage the chronic pain, I quit taking them two years ago. Breaking the chain to those pills was freeing, but I still had pain that was unbearable at times and wore me down each day. I found an article on kratom and decided to give it a try, not really expecting it to help but willing to try some natural alternatives before falling back into the prescription trap. Since then I have never looked back (except with disgust) at my reliance on prescription pills. Hearing complaints about kratom being \"addictive\" makes me chuckle. As someone who took prescription opiates for almost ten years, I can tell you that THEY are what is addictive, not kratom. I wanted my life back, and I got back it back with only a small, inexpensive mug of (really disgusting) tasting tea on most afternoons. I don't get anxious when my tea supply runs low. I don't feel bad if I miss my cup of tea for whatever reason, even if it's for days. I don't worry about a substance taking over my life anymore. Kratom does for my pain what my morning cup of coffee does to jump start my day. If kratom is banned I will eventually have to return to prescription pain killers and that thought is bleak. Please consider the risks and negative results of what this ban would mean for people like me.

I damaged my back on the job in 1986, and deal with chronic pain.  The difficulty with taking drugs to offset pain is that they also inhibit my ability to be productive.  In the late fall of 2014, I had a job to install hardware on exterior doors as the temperatures dropped and the winds picked up; but, I had a deadline.  It had to go.  My good fortune was to come across Kratom at that very time, so in lieu of Hydrocodone and Codeine, I tried a white Kratom.  To my delight and surprise, I was warm outside, even though the wind chill factor was at -25 degrees.  I worked all day, and even my feet were warm.  I had energy, but not like speed.  I had pain relief, but not with side effects.  I have used Kratom since then, and every time, the results are the same:  manageable pain and help with energy.  There is no addition.  I know addiction.  There are no hallucinations.  \n\nThis is the perfect solution for me; and to make it illegal is to rob me of a promise of God, who provided mankind with every green herb for his well-being.  Genesis 1:30 \"And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat.\"  \n\nNo one should have the power to take away a gift of God.  No one should have the right to weigh in on this topic without having first suffered from chronic pain, and second, given Kratom a trial.\n\nMy conclusion is that if God created it and gave it to men, and it is used responsibly, it is good.  That is certainly the truth for me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8440","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Wiant","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been a life saver for me as I suffer from depression and refuse to take Meds for it.

In 2013 I lost my dad to cancer, mesothelioma, it was sudden and devastating. We knew nothing until he had only a month left. When he passed and my nephew went into the marines I moved in with my mother to help and take care of her. I work 6-7 days a week. I have fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and severe arthritis. I also have Restless leg syndrome which to most people is not a big deal, unless you have it. It is seriously destructive to a person. I tried a couple medicines that my doctor prescribed but they either did not work or had bad side effects and I felt unable to do what is needed with a clear head. I can not be drowsy or have my head in the clouds. The only medicine that I take is a Bayer everyday and advil when needed. I dislike swallowing any pills. I found Kratom by searching online for natural herbs to help me. I read about it for a couple months before I decided to try it. That was 7 years ago. I feel blessed to have found it! Could I live without it, yes I could BUT my quality of life would diminish drastically as well as my kids would suffer. I don't do drugs, or drink, all I do have is Kratom. I take it seriously. It has improved my life tremendously. Anyone who believes this is dangerous had not researched it thoroughly. Kratom is safe. If people can walk into a store and buy alcohol, cigarettes and OTC medicine then Kratom should be left as is. All those items are much more dangerous and I see many more stories of how alcohol caused a wreck or someone had too much and OD'd. Or how someone took too many OTC medicine and is in critical condition or died. Cigarettes kill with millions of chemicals, most unknown....yet all these items are freely for sale. Why? Because freedom to make our own choices. Most of us choice what is best...we buy the medicine and use it as instructed or we have a drink or two and stop but some go too far...doesn't mean everyone does or will and has not stopped the sale of these items. Kratom is respected among our community. We respect this plant...please don't be so quick to ban or make purchasing this plant harder.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21562","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has, quite literally, been a life saver for me.

Additionally, the one death noted in the CDC literature admits that the person was also exposed to Paroxetine, an antidepressant and Lamotrigine, an anticonvulsant/mood stabilizer. It does not mention what the death was due to. \n\nIn its intent, the DEA states \"Because the identity, purity levels, and quantity of these substances are uncertain and inconsistent, they pose significant adverse health risks to users.\" This may be true, but it is not sufficient to classify Kratom as a schedule I drug.\n\nIn its intent, the DEA states it \"is aware of 15 kratom-related deaths between 2014 and 2016.\" That is approximately 7.5 deaths per year in which Kratom exposure was present but not necessarily the cause of death. This is in contrast to the tens of thousands of people who die every year in the US alone due to unintentional overdose of non-opioid prescription and over the counter medications, all FDA approved as cited by the CDC.\n\nThe allegations being made about Kratom by the DEA are dramatic, untrue, and incomprehensible.

I will tell you I work in Austin Texas for the state government as a Network Specialist in information technology and that Kraytom has been a blessing to me. \nI have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I have used opiate painkillers and have become addicted many times over the years and found that Kraytom was a great solution to that issue. Kraytom as I am sure you know by now is not an opiate, doesn't suppress ones respiration and simply stimulates the opiate receptors with out binding to them.\n \nKraytom relives pain, helps overcome addiction and makes peoples lives better and more manageable. I can see that that might be a problem for some of the doctors and pharmaceutical companies who much prefer we use opiates like Vicodin, Oxycontin and Percocet to relieve our pain and things like Suboxone for addiction. The cost of a simpler and gentler solution is not good for there bottom line.  \n\nPersonally I would rather use a mild all natural supplement that comes from a plant. \nIf anyone says they cannot find a medical purpose for Kraytom, they are just not looking. \nI hope and pray that you will do the right thing and leave this plant available to those who need it because the result of banning it would mean thousands of deaths and many people going back to a much more harmful alternative.\n\nThank You for taking time to hear from us in the Kraytom community and please don't turn us into criminals, heroin and opiate addicts with your decision.\n\nThanks Again,\n\nCharles in Austin","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11299","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban Kratom!

I use to be a drug addict for many years, dabbling with almost everything, but opiates were always my issue.\n\nIt took me a long time to finally get off of the opiates, I was on Suboxone for almost 2 years before I discovered Kratom. I then started to take Kratom, which I would never take to get high nor would it even give me a specific high that would \"mess me up\", but it would make everything okay and the withdrawals non-existent.\n\nEventually, I had gotten off of everything and was clean for a long time.. but I just felt depressed, empty, tired, and just sad all of the time. I decided to try to use Kratom instead of having to go on any anxiety medication or depressions medication with HORRIBLE side effects and very hit or miss efficiency. I've been on anti-depressants before and they have made me worse and suicidal . But with Kratom, I take just a small amount each day and I feel very productive, gives me a slight energy boost, gives me the motivation to get through each day and become a normal citizen and a productive member of society. \n\nFor the first time I have ever had a job for over a year and I am always told how amazing on an employee I am. I go to college and finish classes and I'm on my way to finally accomplishing my goals. This would all not be possible without Kratom. \n\nI know I am not even close to the only one that has a story like this, and Kratom is like my caffeine. Please don't ban Kratom when it causes less deaths and OTC drugs do, alcohol, caffeine, etc. There is only a very small percentage of people who buy kratom with CRAZY extract and potency that use it to get high. That is the 1% of us users. \n\nIf anything, make the conentration of Kratom and it's alkaloids illegal, but not the powder or leafs which cause almost no harm to anyone.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2310","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nick Cuccaro","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Rebecca Bean and I am 50 yrs. old.

This occurred when I was 15 years old. I went to a lot of different doctors and even specialists that could not come out with a solution just a temporary fix that was with prednisone steroid pills and pain pills. I did not know anything about addiction, but I kept taking pain pills a lot because my doctor would prescribe me a lot and unknowingly I became addicted to opiate pain pills. I turned into a different person and was very ashamed of the person I turned into during my addiction. I have been in jail multiple times, incarcerated in prison for 5 years on a 12 year sentence, rehab 4 times, and just could not stay out of trouble, and this lasted for over 10 years. My problem was even though I am an addict I am also still in a lot of pain when I have flare ups due to my disease, which is multiple times a month, so I go to the doctor and he prescribes pain pills, I take them but loose control every time. I have tried non-narcotic pain pills but it does no good for pain. A friend of mine I met in a narcotics anonymous meeting who had been in a horrific auto accident told me about Kratom . I was unsure at first but I gave it a try. Kratom helped me and changed my life I never thought was possible. And since the first\nDay I tried Kratom I haven't turned to drugs since. I have been using Kratom for 2 years now and have a great job, engaged to a beautiful woman, new car, I am very good friends with my parole officer who tells me my story is motivation for others and is very proud of me. I haven't been in any trouble and have a great life and I owe it all to Kratom. There were things in my life I wanted so bad to achieve but never could until I found Kratom, it truly is a God send. Please re consider the ban. I am an addict and have used drugs, and know first hand the downward spiral it send people on and the evil it can cause in people's lives. But Kratom is not a drug, it's not even close to being a drug.

I have been using kratom for almost 3 years after i was introduced to it by an online support group for chronic pain.  I have kyphoscoliosis and degenerative disc disease and must live with the pain on a daily basis.  The kratom helps me to deal with the pain which can be unbearable at times.  Between working and the cold Michigan winters i was forced to drop down to part time work at a job i had been with for nine years at that point.  Being in my late 20's this was very scary to me. Since starting the kratom i am happy to say i am a full time working member of society again, and have been with the company 13 years now.  My doctor was also both happy and surprised at how many less hydrocodone tablets i have to take a month now.  With the pain pills i had to take them everyday or i felt off.  I would lack energy, be tired all day, have stomach discomfort, and lack motivation when i would take a day off from the pain pills.  With the kratom i can use it during the work week and only use it on my off days if i have a bad pain flair up, have an event to attend, or a social obligation fulfill.  Please do not ban kratom as it would affect my life and social well being greatly.  Me as well as tens, if not, hundreds of thousands of americans depend of this plant to help with our quality of life.  I unfortunately would have to drop back to part time work and would depend on food stamp assistance and government funded insurance.   Kratom is an amazing herb, and as Americans we should have the choice as to what we put in our bodies.  The only negative side effect i have had is constipation, but it was far worse with any of the multiple pain medications i have been prescribed.  Please take my comment into consideration when deciding what actions you take regarding the ban.  Also do not hesitate to call me if you would like to talk or have questions.

I have a wife and 3 children ages 4, 3 and 2 years old. Ive never had an issue arise that Ive needed or felt the need to write those who represent me in Washington. As afforded to me by the 1st Amendment of the United States Constitution, today, I am choosing to exercise that right. You are most likely not aware, but on August 31st 2016 the Drug Enforcement Agency filed in the Federal Register an Intent to ban the plant known as Kratom.\n\nKratom is a plant thats native to southeast asia, its leaves have an alkaloid that many individuals who suffer from incurable and debilitating diseases, like myself, use in replace of strong, addictive pharmaceutical pain killers like immediate release morphine and oxycotin, both medications that I previously took on a daily basis. I suffer from Anklosing Spongylitis, is you dont know what that is, its an immune disease that makes my body attack all of my cells, so my bones inflame.\n\nI spent many years on these addictive and deadly mediciations before finding an entirely organic and natural plant known as Kratom. The DEA has painted a completely incorrect picture that has been refuted and debunked by actual science. For me and many others however, whom you will hear from in the next few days, this is the only solution we have ever found to manage our chronic conditions safely. I say safely because even at high doses, its been proven that the active alkaloids in Kratom do not lower respiration. If youve seen the picture on CNN yesterday of the 2 dead parents whose child was in the back seat, alive  you know too well that oxycotin, vicodin, heroin and other natural opiates cause respiration depression. Thats why these people die.\n\nYou may have conflicting ideas of where a heroin user comes from, and while Ive never been one, I can say that its as easy as being a chronic pain patient whose prescribed legal medications and for whatever reason, your doctor no longer prescribes them to you. While I am lucky, millions of your constituents, people with families and children, are not so lucky. Thousands of these people have discovered Kratom, a natural solution instead of pharmaeutical methadone, which one must be on for life to control their previous addiction. Kratom allows a former heroin user to stop without horrific discomfort. Despite 660 poison control center calls about Kratom in the last 5 years, a fraction of everything else from peanuts to soap, Kratom was not the cause of a single death.\n\nBy the DEAs ban on September 30th, which they did not approve through you, something they are required to do, there will be thousands of deaths per week in our Country instead of just hundreds. In Alabama, where Kratom has been outlawed, overdoses have more than doubled since the ban. This is not for the safety of Americans, its for the financial benefit of a few.\n\nI am asking that you write a demand letter to Chuck Rosenberg, Administrator of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency asking him to immediately cease the September 30th intent to ban Kratom until congress or the senate has an opportunity to review facts from all sides.\n\nI thank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1016","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Holly Smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I use this natural medicine for pain and anxiety as im allergic to the pain meds and from the doctors.

Kratom was more effective than Tramadol which is a prescription pain killer. It also was very affordable.\nKratom is no more addicting that coffee or coke a cola. This is why I find it amazing that the DEA would be considering banning this. I also find it interesting that researchers are trying to get a pattent on this Asian leaf.

It's a plant that's related to coffee, and coffee is legal. That said, I've used different strains of Kratom for about two years and have never suffered negative consequences because of this plant. It helps with my chronic pain, and that's better than taking opiates, correct? Because the DEA monitors my family physician so closely, she is nervous about scripting opiates for me. I had a horrible accident over a decade ago, and in spite of physical therapy, daily exercise, massages, acupuncture, and countless visits to orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and my family practitioner, there is no cure for my chronic pain. Kratom has been a life saver for me when I am unable to get opiates. Please do not schedule this plant as that's crazy - it is not dangerous, nor is it habit forming. I can attest to it! I think it's irresponsible for our government to begin telling physicians how to practice medicine, and I think it's crazy for the government to take a harmless plant and schedule it because of what? People drive cars and kill others because of their poor driving. Do you take that person's driver's license away? People eat themselves to death and become morbidly obese, diabetic, and have heart problems along with other chronic diseases. Do you take food away from those people and make them start exercising? Of course not. Food kills people. Cigarettes kill people (especially second hand smoke). Alcohol is a HORRIBLE drug, yet it's legal just like food and cigarettes. But the government thinks Kratom is a problem? You people in the government need to think a little harder about what the real problems that are occurring in this country and stop worrying about Kratom. Big pharma also needs to be roped in as the legal drugs being scripted daily are a HUGE problem. Cancer drugs and radiation, anti-depressants, etc., are far more dangerous Kratom. Please think this one through, and look closer at what's really going on in the country, and where you, the government, can help your people.

I hold a BA in Psych-Bio and have been in and out  of graduate school hoping to someday get a Masters in Public Health.  I have struggled with mental illness, chronic pain, and addictions of all kinds since I was 13. After  several attempts to get sober, I finally \"got it\". January 31, 2014 was the day I took my last drink. While I was in rehab, I was terrified of going back to my home where there were painful memories and many triggers that, I feared, might  precipitate a relapse. Through the help of Alcoholics  Anonymous I was able to stay sober for several months. \n\nIn late September of 2014 I underwent oral surgery which left me in severe pain. I was prescribed Vicodin despite having told my doctor that I was in early recovery. He said \"You're going to need this. Trust me.\" I was afraid of the pain that I was sure I'd experience. And, honestly, the fact that I had just been told by someone who obviously knew more than I that use of narcotics was NECESSARY, got my mind spinning. Yay!  Pain? Who cared about the pain! I was going to get high - sanctioned by a professional. I quickly used up that meager supply of  10 pills and went  to another doctor, then another collecting more prescriptions. Then I re-injured my back and experienced severe pain and was unable to walk for several days. I couldn't leave the house to get to the ER. A \"friendly\" neighbor came by to check on me and kindly offered me oxycodone. He was  very responsible, knowing my history of addiction but  also not wanting to see me suffer.  Each morning he brought  me just three pills and  told me to only take one every 4-6 hours. Of course that didn't happen. But,I told myself, at least I wasn't drinking! \n\nEventually, my back got better and I had to face the music and get honest with everyone. I first told my teenage daughters, whom I had lost physical custody of due to my unstable mental health and my addictions. They supported  me and  loved  me. Emboldened by their reaction, I went to my AA group and told them what I had been up to over the past few months (I had continued going to meetings occasionally). They too treated me with love and respect. That was  November 28, 2014. I have  stayed happily sober since  then. \n\nAround  that time I was diagnosed with Tardive Diykenesia, a rare syndrome resulting from years of  treatment for  bipolar disorder. Despite lowering my dose  of Geodon, the symptoms of TD got  worse  and  worse. If you're not familiar with this neurolgical condition, I'll briefly  describe my symptoms: My hands, feet and jaw move constantly,. At first these were just embarrassing. Approximately 6 months ago my jaw movements became more exaggerated and painful. Then I started experiencing very painful muscle  spasms in my neck and shoulder area. I couldn't  even hold a book for more than a few minutes. Finally  when I got to the point where I was having horrible, blinding headaches, I wasn't sleeping so I was exhausted all the time, and  wasn't able  to work my part-time job. My doctors talked about putting me on Xanax. I refused because I KNOW I would  end up abusing it. We settled on Baclofen and  Flexeril, as well as treatment  with a TENS unit. I got minimal relief from this combination of treatments. Someone suggested I try using Kratom. I researched it  and read the  stories of  people  like me - people who had struggled with addiction and/or chronic pain. The stories these people  told gave me cautious hope. \n\nI started  experimenting with the different strains of Kratom in mid-October of this year. \nI IMMEDIATELY got some relief from the pain in my neck/shoulders. I was able to sleep through the night. I was still waking up with mild-moderate  pain in that area, and  bad  pain in my jaw.  I have not taken Baclofen or  Flexeril in over 3 weeks, except on two occasions. I still suffer the involuntary movements. I take Kratom three times a day. I have been able to return to my part-time job lifting heavy boxes on a loading dock. (My career as a research lab manager had ended 13 years ago because of my addictions.) \n\nMy story is just one of thousands. Every day i read stories about people in early days of recovery from opiate  and alcohol addictions. people who had resigned themselves to a life of misery. If you would  just read some of the amazing stories of  people like me who have  found  relief from crippling anxiety, depression, or pain, you'd never seriously  consider banning it. Kratom is  a safe, natural substance.  The only negative  side effects I've encountered are slight nausea and sleepiness. And those were when I was trying to determine what the best dose was for my needs. The quality of my life has improved  immeasurably in such a short time. I'm confident  that the next time my  back injury causes me pain that I won't even have  to consider opiate pain meds.\n\nPLEASE don't  take away Kratom. This substance is literally saving lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18845","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have friend whose life was going down the drain because she was addicted to opiates.

I have been for many years an alcoholic, serious alcoholic!  I was going down a deep hole and i seemed to be there deeper and deeper.  But, about two years ago a good friend of mine led me on to checking out an herb called Kratom.  I read some reviews on it and really didn't know what to expect, but I'm always open to trying new things therefore i got a little bit just to see what it is and how it may make me feel.  After the first try, i immediately rid myself of anxiety, depression, and slowly got on the wagon and stopped drinking.  It didn't happen all at once, but slowly i began to drink less and eventually got myself to a point where i can control myself and don't feel terrible going through withdrawals if i didn't put any alcohol in my system.  Kratom is not something to abuse recreationaly, at least i don't look at it that way.  For my its actually medication for many things.  it helps me not to drink, it helps me with anxiety, and lastly it helps me with depression...not to mention that it is also great for getting good sleep, especially if you have insomnia which i unfortunately being an alcoholic also experienced many times.  I really hope that this natural remedy can be available to the public.  If it goes away for reasons i would never understand, i will for sure resort to my old ways.  This is my daily alternative to drinking and potentially other drugs.  I can function, drive a car, go to work, go to the gym, etc...It is really an amazing thing that has changed my life and given me hope for the future.\n\nPlease, don't make this a scheduled substance, many people will suffer, and for what??","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6927","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tom Gornicki","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The opiate epidemic is a very real and urgent dilemma that has plagued millions in this country.

He desperately wanted to be normal. He did not want to be a drug addict just to exist.  He heard about kratom and did extensive research.  It has worked miracles for him with no side effects.  He does not feel high.  He feels normal. He is now enrolled in college. He smiles and laughs and has been completely clean and sobe for 2 years!  I lived in fear of loosing my son for years.  Now I am scared to death he will not be able to stay clean and will relapse. Not because he is weak but now he knows,how it feels to not be depressed and anxiety ridden.  I fear we will be back into the hell we were. I fear,I will loose my son. Kratom is a natural substance. It's a leaf off a tree. Everything g put on this earth is for a reason.  We should be able to address our own health issues naturally and not be forced to take pharmaceuticals that have many adverse side effects.  Please consider the lives you will destroy. The lives you will end by making this herbal supplements unavailable and even worse illegal. Sending more addicts and people with pain ptsd to prison.

I work full time for a local hospital and attend college part-time, online.  The reason I am so 'behind the curve' in many ways is because for the last 24 years of my life I struggled with alcoholism.  Alcohol consumed and destroyed nearly half of my life.  In February 2016 I wanted to die.  With two beautiful children and a bright future, I wanted to stop living because I wasn't in control of my own life.  Booze had taken over.\n\nI made it through that darkest of days with the help of my Primary Care Physician, and with the help of kratom.  A friend of mine gave me a small amount and it got me through the withdrawal period, and has been instrumental in keeping me sober for the last 9 months.  In September I learned of the DEA's intentions to make kratom illegal, and I became very fearful.  Fearful of a future where I didn't have the help I need to keep my alcoholism in check.  I feel like everyone needs a little help in life; coffee to wake up in the morning, a good friend to talk to when times are tough, a quiet space to clear the mind.  Kratom offers that 'little step up' for many people struggling like I do.   I hope and pray that kratom stays off of the banned substances list, and beg the DEA to adjust their stance on the issue.  \n\nThank you for considering.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJennifer Jansen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3392","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Jansen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has saved our family!!!

BEFORE being on opioids (in my 20's when I was in college) I NEVER even took something as simple as a Tylenol or an Advil for a headache.  I am in the WORST IMAGINABLE PAIN POSSIBLE!!  I have been diagnosed officially from a doctor with:  Chronic/Late Stage Lyme Disease (along with Co-Infections and Parasites), Severe Interstitial Cystitis, Severe Adenomyosis, Bad Mold Exposure that is causing me GREAT DISTRESS (possible black mold exposure), Endometriosis, Osteoarthritis, Fibromyalgia, Lower and Cervical Back pain (because of 4 bad discs in my lower back, spinal stenosis in my lower and cervical spine, degenerative arthritis in my lower and cervical spine and bone spurs in my lower back, with one disc in my lower back that is so bad from arthritis it has lost ALL the cushion--so it is bone on bone).  I get bad depression and anxiety because of my Lyme Disease in my brain.  I also have Severe Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  I have begged my pain specialist (who I have had for SEVERAL years now) to put me on more opioids because what she has me on is JUST NOT ENOUGH for the amount of pain I am in.  She refuses to put me on any more pain medicines than I am already on (and I have been on my current pain medicine I am on for around 2 years now).  I cannot take anti-inflammatories to help with the inflammation from arthritis (like Aspirin, Advil, etc.) because I have a very bad ulcer (diagnosed by a Gastroenterologist with and Endoscopy).  I cannot take Prednisone either (for inflammation) because it makes my Lyme worse (NO ONE with Lyme takes Prednisone--taking Prednisone with Lyme can be a death sentence).  I was sitting at home, not able to get off the couch because of SEVERE PAIN, not able to sleep due to SEVERE PAIN, not able to play with my kids because of SEVERE PAIN, not able to clean my house or cook meals because of SEVERE PAIN, not able to spend time with my husband because of SEVERE PAIN.  I was even missing my appointments for my pain specialist (to get my actual pain medicines) because of being in SEVERE PAIN.  I WAS NOT ABLE TO DO ANYTHING because of SEVERE PAIN ALL THE TIME!!  My husband has to do EVERYTHING for me (and it is starting to get to him, because he already works a full work week on top of cleaning, taking care of the kids, cooking and everything else--because I am too sick to do anything or to have a job).  I started taking Kratom and it is a miracle drug.  It works BETTER than my pain medicine.  It does not give me the side effects that my Percocet gives me.  It does not give me the high (that I HATE) that my Percocet gives me.  It actually helps my pain BETTER than the Percocet.  Plus it is a diuretic which is good for me with my Interstitial Cystitis (it helps me stay regular, which helps my pain with my bladder).  I have NEVER taken any other drugs EXCEPT Percoet and Kratom.  I HAVE NOT taken illegal drugs of any kind.  I WILL NEVER take illegal drugs of ANY KIND.  I have never been to jail or prison, and DO NOT INTEND to ever go to jail or prison for doing something illegal.  When I do not take Kratom I am getting up ALL NIGHT LONG (approximately 20+ times a night to pee (because of bladder pain with my Interstitial Cystitis) which causes me to get NO SLEEP.  Then with NO SLEEP I am irritable and it is an endless cycle.  If Kratom gets taken back off the market I am back to taking my Percocet.  I am back to being in SEVERE PAIN and NOT GETTING TO DO ANYTHING with my kids OR my husband.  I will be back to getting the high (that I DO NOT LIKE).  I will be back to getting side effects that I DO NOT like (like dizziness, fatigue, etc.).  I will be MISERABLE and in SEVERE PAIN ALL THE TIME again if the DEA makes Kratom illegal.  PLEASE DO NOT make Kratom illegal.  PLEASE, for me, so that I can take care of my kids and enjoy time with my husband.  If Kratom becomes illegal I WILL NOT take it, because I WILL NOT chance going to prison for taking something that is illegal.  I just want to take Kratom (that is legal) and have a NORMAL life (which I WAS NOT having taking opioids).

He had been clean, in rehab in Annapolis, MD, and doing well for almost a year, and then one day he relapsed and took more than his body could handle. He died alone in a bathroom stall with a needle in his arm. \n\nI had never heard of Kratom before I heard that the DEA was considering moving it to Schedule I. I still have many friends who struggle with opiate addiction. I would never presume to say that Kratom could ever be a cure-all, but these people deserve a chance to turn their lives around if there is any evidence at all that Kratom could help them with their addiction. \n\nThis isn't in my hands, but I can only hope that you allow Kratom to be studied as it should be to see if it could be used to help this terrible opiate addiction this country is going through every day. Moving Kratom to Schedule I robs these people of any chance that exists to help better themselves and deal with their addiction. \n\nI hope you do the right thing.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9248","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Liam Smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nMy name is Aidan Weber-Concannon I am 18 years old and a student studying abroad at Mcgill University.

I want to thank all of the parties responsible for delaying the process of placing Kratom as a Schedule 1 Narcotic as well as those willing to listen to feedback from the public.  I will keep my comment brief.\n\nI was diagnosed with PTSD six years ago; however, I struggled with it for years before that.  I have seen therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists in an attempt to work out my issues.  I have been prescribed upwards of 30 different prescription drugs to help with the Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia, Night Terrors, Panic Attacks, Compulsive Behavior, and all the other terrible things that go along with PTSD.   Even with talk therapy, none of the pharmaceuticals relieved my suffering.\n\nIn February of this year, I gave up.  After years of contemplating suicide, I finally made an attempt.  I was (obviously) unsuccessful. After a month long stint in the hospital, I returned to my life, still hopeless.  A friend of mine suggested Kratom.  For the longest time, I was skeptical of holistic remedies.  However, after just a week or so on a daily regiment of Kratom, I FINALLY FOUND RELIEF. \n\nI use Kratom on a daily basis.  It manages my anxiety and depression and even helps me sleep.  I can honestly say-\n\nKRATOM SAVED MY LIFE\n\nI have several friends who use kratom for a variety of ailments: pain, depression, opiate addiction, etc.  Kratom has turned their lives around, as well. \n\nI am now a happy, contributing member of society.  Without Kratom, this would not be a possibility.\n\nPlease consider the well-being of thousands of Americans before you move forward with the Kratom Ban.

I use kratom for aches in pains and many other issues I have . Such as severe restless limb syndrome , social anxiety , ptsd and insomnia. I am not saying kratom is a fix all by any means.

I have turned many people in my family and many friends on to kratom . My aunt has fibromyalsia and degenerative disk disease. She takes kratom to help give her a mood lift and energy . Because all the prescription pain pills she has to take makes her sluggish and depressed. Kratom has helped so many people with so many different problems . Alcohol for example is so much more dangerous ! Kratom has no such ability to make you intoxicated ! A person could go to a gas station or a Walmart or any place and purchase enough alcohol to kill themselves! No one has ever overdosed on kratom or hurt other people because of it . This ban is the worst thing that could happen to a country that is riddled with prescription pain medicine and illegal substances. Please don't take away this amazing plant. This plant is no different than green tea or coffee. Kratom is completely harmless. I would never do anything that would impare my judgement or the safety of my family and my coworkers. I don't even drink alchohol any more because of kratom . I am still taking my prescription medicines as I should . I believe that medicine has its place . I also believe that there are natural sources that can help with certain maladies . Please for all the people and myself that use this beautiful plant . Don't take it away.

I suffer from chronic pain in my neck, knees, and back. I also have nerve damage in my feet and suffered over 20 concussions playing football in hs and college. I have been prescribed opioid painkillers since i was 15 years ild and consequently have dealt with addiction and alcoholism as an adult. About two years ago my friend introduced me to kratom and now i am substance free, my pain is manageable for the first time in my life, and i am a small business owner, father, husband, and athlete without addiction slowing me down. Kratom is not harmful. It works on opioid receptors, but does not depress respiration so it is not able to be fatally overdosed on like oxycontin. My sister is a public defender and my mother is an emergency room nurse and their whole careers are dealing with people struggling because of oxycontin and other prescription pills leading to heroin abuse and addiction. Kratom has allegedly been linked to 15 deaths in 6 years,, oxycontin is responsible for thousands of deaths every year. The Sackler family, the fda they funnel money to, and the DEA, the armed enforcers for the fda, are making millions on the suffering of Americans, there is no way you can spin that anymore, we know. The people can see the corruption clearly and we are tired of it. Kratom can help free people from opioid addiction. That should benour primary goal, heping people live healthy lives. Kratom saved my life. Saved my business. Saved my children from growing up without a father, my wife from not having a husband. I no longer have to deal with the anxiety of chronic pain. I think putting an age restriction on kratom is important. But not fda regulation. We dont want pills and extracts, we want plants and herbs.

I then graduated to stealing my mothers pain meds while living with her and any time I would visit her after moving out. To make a long story much much shorter, By the year 2000 I was doctor shopping at all the favorite pill mills in Florida and was up to 240-10/325 norcos per month. In 2006 I was involved in a hit-and-run crash where I t-boned a van going 40mph...he drove away while my car started to smoke. Somebody(guardian angel) broke out the drivers window and pulled me out right before the car started on fire, With 3 broken ribs, a fractured arm, and a bruised heart I spent 2 days in the cardiac unit and the pain train of meds rolled along! They loaded me full of pain medication that I couldn't even pronounce and I loved every minute, even with my injuries. Well, needless to say, my life really tanked after that. I was snorting roxies that I stole to get and ended up homeless and living in a \"tent city\".By the grace of God on September 5th 2011 I came out of my stupor long enough to look up and ask God to help me, a God that I blamed for everything that went wrong in my life...and HE did!! I knew I was done drinking and drugging myself to death, which was inevitable! I was \"lucky\" enough to get a bed in a residential recovery program back in Wisconsin and I knew that this is where God intended me to be. A year later I left the program, got a great job and eventually bought a car, got my own place and was loving life! About a year after that I started feeling pain that I couldn't stand...the injuries from that hit-and-run were rearing their ugly heads. Oh, the doctor I went to was more that happy to prescribe any kind of pain med that I wanted, but I couldn't go back down that road because death was waiting for me if I did. I started surfing the web on natural pain medication,and what do you suppose I found? KRATOM! I didn't research a hell of a lot because I was in so much pain! I found a vendor on Amazon and I bought my first 4 ounces of kratom...it was a red for pain and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it! I did a perfect choke and spray all over the kitchen counter and myself trying my first dose!! I wasn't going to let that deter me!! When I was able to finally get about 1/2tsp. in my system, the \"magic\" happened! My pain went from a 10 to a 4 almost immediately and I knew that God had blessed me with His plant, His herb, His natural medicine! That was over 2-1/2 years ago...KRATOM saved me! I will go down fighting for this God-given natural plant that He placed on this earth for our benefit!! I will NOT give up what has made me whole again! I was facing my later years with a cane or a walker, or even a wheelchair! This family that we have has a special bond, a shared belief, and a will that won't be defeated!

I applied to 11 jobs, cleaned my house so my wife would have a nice apartment to come home to, and I went grocery shopping.  I felt so much better and was so proud of myself that I was able to turn my mood around so much!  \n\nI actually got a little choked up thinking how miraculous this change in mood was.

I am a normal middle-aged person with chronic pain stemming from sports injuries I suffered in my youth.\n\nI mention this to emphasize my commitment to public service and the public good. Public service is my life. I was on the brink of losing my ability to work due to chronic pain and that disturbed me so much that I noticed that, at the age of 55, I was starting to experience signs of depression, and that scared me.\n\nDoctors had been prescribing strong NSAIDs for me for the last twenty years. I cannot take them any longer. Before I found kratom, I used a dosage of diclofenac suggested by a doctor that caused debilitating side effects. NSAIDs do cause internal bleeding, stroke, and heart disease, this is a fact (1). The men in my family all die of heart disease. I do not need any help in that area.\n\nSo I lived with the pain, often unable to sit long enough to grade a simple paper, unable to attend meetings, and growing increasingly concerned for my family's well being. \n\nThen I found kratom. I cannot tell you how much it has helped my life. Truly, it has changed everything. It allows me to work. It does not get me 'high'; on the contrary, experiencing less pain, depression, and anxiety, it allows me to focus, work, and enjoy my day. \n\nI have been using kratom for about 1 year and have experienced no negative side effects. It is not addictive for me and I find it to be safe and effective. I am a responsible, law-abiding citizen and I resent attempts to ban this supplement. And I vote. I vote every chance I get. \n\nTo limit access to this truly helpful dietary supplement would be a disaster. It would be a destructive, uninformed, bone-headed move, and people will suffer if you ban kratom. \n\nPlease, please take a balanced, informed view of this. Serve the public well.(2)\n\nFootnote 1: No citation required.

While kratom is not a perfect solution, it has been a miracle, given to us when we were in the darkest, most dangerous and most agonizing times of our lives, and I cannot stand by and let you take it away from me, the people it is helping, and the people who it has not yet helped, who may die without it being available. The effect criminalizing kratom would have is that of destroying people's lives, taking hope away from millions, taking millions or even billions of dollars out of the economy when the people who have good jobs suddenly are forced to quit or be fired when they can't function normally anymore, and I absolutely 100% guarantee you will have millions of more addicts and future addicts if one of the things that help the most in the world for these people is taken away. \n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider your thought process of potentially banning kratom, for the sake of the economy, for the sake of the lives of millions of good people, and for the sake of the future of this great Country.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0905","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, thank you for taking time to read this.

I work in a very physically demanding job. A lumber mill. it I so demanding that I suffered a shoulder injury at aged 27 normally only seen in professional athletes. This injury required surgery. Needless to say opiates have been and always will be an option for me. But the risk of opiates far out weigh the rewards in my book. So I take Kratom. Unlike opiates I do not feel high. I do not have an altered state but I am able to work. Maybe it's the old placebo affect and if so I don't care. What I know is unlike opiates I was able to take Kratom for a year straight and stop instantly when I heard it may become illegal. You know what withdrawal symptoms I had NONE . The same cannot be said for caffeine let alone opiates. The only adverse affect I had was a return in pain so severe that I thought I would have to return to using prescribed opiates(which I hate). You're telling me with all the diet pills and \"brain pills\" that can be bought. The fact that little kids overdose on energy drinks with deadly consequences, you want to outlaw something that literally has no proven adverse affects. The difference between you and us is you just look at it. We live it. I have lived with an injury that requires expensive, harmful, disgusting, mind altering opiates and made the decision that I won't be another statistic. I have no interest in marijuana, which is perfectly legal in my state. I wanted something that helped with pain without altering my mind and causing adverse affects. If you want to take harmful drugs off the market type energy pills and diet pills into Google. But maybe the real issue isn't about protecting people at all. In which case everything we have said is moot and your decision has already been made.\n\nSincerely,\nWorking,upstanding,crime free,American","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7972","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Sir or Madam,\n\n     My name is William Hubbard. I am an accountant and small business owner in North Carolina. It has come to my attention, along with many others, that there is a proposal to include Kratom as a schedule 1 drug. As part if the comment period on this proposal I would like  to put forward my opinion on the matter, as well as my experiences in using Kratom.\n      I first found out about Kratom 5 years ago. I have dealt with depression and anxiety through much of my life, and as I have aged the occasional knee and back pain from years of sports and current exercise. Since beginning use of this natural herb my depression is manageable and my anxiety in social situations has improved as well. It has also helped with pain, without the use of heavy drugs, and gives me more energy as well. In my experience, it has never caused hallucinations, black outs, inebriation, motor skill impairment, or any of the other effects of hard drugs. In my estimation it is most analogous to strong coffee. The only adverse side effects are occasional jitters, much like too much caffeine. Many people I know experience no effect whatsoever, positive or negative from Kratom. I have also never know a person to become violent, or addicted to the plant. I have stopped usage many times with no ill results.\n      I do feel that Kratom should be treated as an herbal supplement, much as Saint John's Wart, to ensure standardization, and product safety. However, I believe extracts could be a potential issue, never having used them I won't comment further than that. \n     In closing, I believe there is no call to ban a harmless plant, that helps many, as a knee jerk reaction to media stories with no backing in science, or statistics pointing to a danger.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1168","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Hubbard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have several different health problems, fibromyalgia, trigemenal neuralgia, degenerative disc disease .

Alcohol  deaths even. But not one time has there been news of people using kratom.and turning up dead.  Something needs to change in this country. We have pharmaceutical companies controlling the very people who are supposed to be taking care of the citizens health and well being, but they  allow big pharma to influence their decisions that can affect millions of patients and users. \nKratom is a naturally given plant that helps so many people. Why take it away from  the millions of people?  Speaking with those who use and discuss kratom, it doesnt have the side effects that the pills,  drugs and even alcohol does to our families.  If anything, it's brought many of them back into the family. \nAs a USMC veteran I have a few issues that came with serving this country. I have  degenerative disc disease, a wrist that was broken in boot camp in 1987, then the VA did more damage to.it with a surgery a few years back hat failed.  I have bad knees and severe depression. Kratom helps me deal with these issues everyday. Yet I go work in a medium security prison, and guess what, in a place like that you have no time to.fiddle fiddle. You need to be quick and clear headed. Kratom helps me be able to work and handle the stresses of the job of a CO.  \nPlease do take the thousands of comments in to.consideration. We know our bodies.

I am writing to the DEA to express my opinions and experiences about kratom. Not only is kratom less harmful to the brain than legal substance such as alcohol and tobacco, but it has a lot of medicinal potential. Although it is currently unrestricted, only 15 deaths have been kratom-related, and in each case, it has not been confirmed that kratom was the reason for the death (link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00414-015-1279-y). According to the DEA's website, schedule 1 drugs are drugs that have no accepted medicinal qualities and have high addiction potentials. Not only does Kratom have a lower potential for addiction than opiates, but many qualified health professionals agree that kratom is an effective pain killer, and could even be substituted for opiate pain relievers with less negative side effects (link.springer.com/article/10.2165/11596830-000000000-00000). There are also many cases of individuals using kratom to help kick their opiate dependence. \n\nI have even been curious enough to try kratom for recreational purposes, and my experiences were very mild. I took around 4 grams of powdered kratom leaf. After about an hour, i was feeling a little giggly. This slowly turned into a content, warm feeling that everything was going to be okay. I did not experience a hangover or a desire to take it again. It was an extremely mild experience compared to alcohol or tobacco, and i did not feel crazy or addicted to it.\n\nThe DEA's move to schedule kratom really shows how disconnected the agency is from scientific research and public interest. If the DEA were interested in our health, then they would not ban a plant that helps people beat their addiction. A plant that could be a safer alternative for pain relief. Perscription opiate deaths have been on the rise in recent decades  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22048730) and i think the DEA shares in the responsibility to find a solution for these societal issues, and the first step is allowing researchers to study the plant, and allow individuals to self medicate when the medical options dont work for them.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5536","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Munkvold","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have chosen to take kratom instead of narcotic pain relievers and it has helped my pain tremendously I suffer from chronic back pain and with out kratom I would suffer daily this does not give u a high like other drugs it is more like a strong cup of coffee with effects similar to caffeine.

I struggled with depression for a long time after the suicide of my father and loss of my first love in a car accident. My dad was addicted to prescription pain killers. He struggles for years to try to get clean. Going to methadone clinics and rehab. He was never able to get clean bc of the mental hold addiction has on a person. I was depressed severely. I consumed alcohol legally to help ease my mind. We all know alcohol causes more problems than it could ever solve. While nursing a severe hangover someone gave me a Vicodin. Long story short I soon became addicted to the very same thing that ruined my childhood and took my fathers life. I was a walking felony. I was still a productive member of society. I was never so messed up I couldn't function but it had a strong hold over me. I tried to quit many many times. I turned to suboxone. I tried to go cold turkey. Nothing ever worked. I did some research and discovered Kratom. This was the best thing to ever happen to me. Within 5 days of taking kratom my pain pill addiction was GONE! I was no longer a prisoner. I didn't have to search for pills to get me through the week. No longer had to deal with the scummy people that sold them. No longer worried about being caught with something that would label me as a criminal. I could poop again. All because of Kratom. Because I now have something to treat my depression and anxiety without all the side effects that come with prescription pills. Kratom is not dangerous. One can not overdose on it because the body won't allow it. If you ever take to much you would throw up and know not to take that amount again. I take it regularly to treat depression, anxiety and chronic fatigue but I DO IT BY CHOICE. It can be addictive. Anything can. Alcohol, gambling , eating , nasal spray etc. it should be solely up to each individual person how we choose to treat our problems.  We should not have to be forced to turn to prescription medications. There is risk with everything consumed. We shouldn't have to be criminals and walking felonies because we know what works for us. Kratom has helped millions of people. Millions of people that once felt they were a prisoner of prescription medications. I have my life back again. Please don't take this natural healer from is. We should have the right to choose. We should be able to know our own limitations. We don't take this to sit around messed up. We use it to be able to live a happy healthy life. To deal with the pain the PTSD whether it be from war or childhood tragedies, from life from heartache. Our brains aren't always able to naturally fight these things. If it was there would be no such thing as prescription pain pills and anti depressants. This is a wonderful plant!!! Not only should it be legal but people should be more aware of its capabilities so they don't have to turns to prescriptions with tons of side effects. Herron is an epidemic in this country. Kills thousands daily. With this plant a person has the power to quit and not turn back. No one wants to be an addict!! Let them have and option!!! I beg of you with all my heart to see the benefits of this plant FAR surpasses any of the risk. Don't take this natural healer from us.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4052","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lindsey Taylor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Good evening, I have only been using kratom for about 6 months, and I am amazed with how this helps regarding pain relief. I have been battling an off and on back issue (L5/S1 disc issue) for a few years now, and have been prescribed all sorts of medication to help reduce the pain. Not only do I feel like most of the medication did not help relieve the pain, but it was a nightmare trying to ween myself off of some of the pills. To me, kratom has been a saving grace, and I have had no issues with any kind of kratom \"addiction\". It has been fantastic with pain relief, as well as giving me a little burst of energy and helps me focus, to get me through the day when needed. I work in a warehouse for a tile distributor, and am constantly lifting materials as heavy as 100 lbs all day long. I am quite confused on how there is even a thought to ban kratom, and move it into a category with something like heroin. Absolutely blows my mind! Maybe it's just me, but kratom does not provide a high that would be a concern to endanger myself, or others. The only side effect I have ever had  was a slight nauseous feeling when I first tried it. Occasionally there may be a slight feeling of euphoria, but the most important thing to me is the pain relief. I really do believe that there needs to be some research done, to prove that there is no comparison to include this as a schedule 1 drug. Banning this substance before any scientific research has been done is outrageous! There are many other things out there, on the streets, etc., that should be a priority than a natural plant that has many positive characteristics. By taking away a solution for natural pain relief, more people will be going back on prescription drugs and having issues with a true addiction in the future. It's already a massive issue with opioids, so you can count on it getting alot worse if/when kratom is taken away as a positive alternative. Hopefully a thorough process will be done before a premature decision is made without any research to back the final decision. Thank you for taking the time to read this message, and I wil be keeping me fingers crossed that kratom will not be taken away from us.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17762","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"ive been taking kratom for over 6 months. it has helped tremendously with my social anxiety and sweaty hands. a condition called hyperhidrosis. i take small amounts of kratom every day not just for anxiety and sweaty hands but aswell for motivation and getting things done in school. it motivates me and just makes me a happier person. i was taking 150mg of zoloft, an antidepresant for over one year, nothing worked for my anxiety not even the antidepresant. as soon as i tried kratom, my whole life changed for the better. i curently dont take any synthetic pills because kratom has replaced almost all of my medication. even when i was going through some withdrawles from the zoloft, kratom helped tremendously for the headaches and body withdrawles. this is a herb and should not be banned it helps millions of people everyday and it would be a shame if it was banned. theres nothing bad about kratom you cant even overdose, your body will just throw it up. please dont take our natural herb that helps many. all i can say is that it has changed my life for the better.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14824","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"diego lupis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 29 years old and live in Washington State.

I believe, in the spirit of autonomy and independence that our country was founded upon, the lack of controlled, double blind / placebo studies demonstrating the clear efficacy of a substance should not be substantial enough to permit anyone or any agency to determine that it is of no medical value.  I believe if that is to be the conclusion then that burden should fall to the body or agency seeking to ban it's access, and I think those results should have to be very conclusive towards that determination.  I think that this alone will preclude any further serious consideration of banning or otherwise scheduling Kratom, but at the least a process like this would legitimize the position that there is inherent danger in Kratom, a claim that, absent of such evidence, will appear to be and likely will be unsubstantiable scientifically if not also transparently driven by secondary interests. \n\nThank you for your time","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17080","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":" I have chronic low back pain that I was taking opioids for.

It poses no danger, whereas the standard treatments for this problem common to journalists can injure and kill.\n\nThank you,\nKim LaCapria","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8326","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kim LaCapria","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am very concerned and angry that this wonderful plant Kratom is being stripped from my life.

I hope access to this drug becomes impossible for me. I was sober before (for 5 years) but now have become totally addicted (mentally and physically) to Kratom. It is a lesser evil than alcohol or heroin, but it is ruining my life all the same. In some ways it is even more insidious because it can be \"managed.\" But managed at what cost? It's just another way to get high and let your life slip away. I was happy when I heard about the ban then upset when I heard it was withdrawn. I hope a ban goes into effect - simply so I can get sober again.\n\nThat said - I wouldn't want to see ANYONE locked up for possessing /using. And if Kratom was available when I was a heroin addict (many years ago) - I think it would have saved me years of struggle kicking that.\n\nStill - for me it is just replacing one drug for another. It is less harmful but is currently slowly taking me out of any productive existence. The physical withdrawal or fear of that withdrawal keeps you hooked. The effects are great - like taking a small bump of heroin or several percocets or a low dosage of OxyContin. It's a very satisfying high (I love it and that is the problem) and the withdrawal is very similar to opiate withdrawal (bad part lasts three days, but you don't feel quite normal for about seven). Overall much much more mild than heroin withdrawal but not fun at all.\n\nFor myself I sincerely hope it gets banned so I can resume my sober life.\n\nI'm sure you all will make the right decision and thank you for considering my comments.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4565","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 46 year old male and Director of Technology in the Health Industry.

I first looked for a natural alternative to my mothers horrible medications for my moms migraines and fibromyalgia. I also decided it would supplement my life in the most positive way. I am an experienced pharmaceutical and illicit drug user considering it all started with my car accident and dealing with pain but soon escalated into a deep depression and spiral of opiate addiction. I've been addicted to every opiate on this planet and its complete hell. Opiates destroy your brain and thinking, they make you live in a fog and change you as a person, they destroy your soul. Kratom is so wonderful I do not have words to describe this god given plant that was here before western civilization came. It should of been used since human existence. Kratom is not a DRUG... its not anything remotely close to heroin or even a Tylenol for god sakes. Kratom saves lives, its saved my life ever since I stopped taking narcotics and my doctor prescribed anti depressants. An addiction specialist even prescribed me drugs that were more addicting than the opiates themselves. Yes, its called methadone and suboxone. My doctor was so willing to give this to me. I wasted 4 years of my life on this so called maintenance drug when kratom was right in front of me. A completely safe alternative used for my opiate cravings and addiction and helps with my pain whether it be mental or physical. I just kind of forget about being an addict and what pain I might have and lets me live a normal life.  I live in a fear of relapsing one day or maybe even dying and since I found this natural herb my life has changed into the most positive direction. I found and I keep a career as a fire sprinkler fitter. I bought a new car and house, things that you cant do for yourself on illicit drugs. When I supplement kratom I live in the moment for the day, it helps me focus on what's important in life and wants me to contribute. I have never felt so connected to family and friends while taking kratom. I don't think of going out to use or binging on alcohol, im so happy I can be able to use this as an alternative to everything else. Seriously Ive been addicted to everything that brings pleasure in life and this herb is a savior, It doesn't get me high, it actually teaches you and shows you life lessons. Since I found Kratom I have not used an opiate or another substance since. I use kratom daily, a white strain before work instead of coffee because coffee destroys my stomach, and being a heroin addict in America is dreadful, the life an addict lives is terminal and the opioid epidemic is happening right now. At night after work, I supplement a red strain tea instead of a beer. DEA, the answer is right in front of you, 18000 people died last year of opiate abuse and addiction, kratom will clean up the streets and help so many people in pain and anxiety and depression that millions of Americans live in daily, struggling to get through. There is a feeling of well-being and wanting to live life. Just like my other fellow Americans who drink coffee in the morning and smoke cigarettes and drink beer at night. Kratom is an alternative for people such as me because addiction is real and I don't want to take another opiate again in my life nor drink heavily like people do. This natural herb sounds too good to be true but the government is overlooking its potential and it seems like this is just to expand the war on drugs. Please do not make kratom schedule 1 or even a schedule. I don't need a doctor to tell me what to take and how much of something. I think pharmaceuticals are part of the devils work and are a greed pit. I couldn't believe when I heard the dea wanted to make this an emergency drug. What made them think that? And since they withdrew their immediate proposal nothing new happened. And the fact that you would have to teach officers what it looks like and how people act on it makes it already not an issue. METH, COKE, HEROIN those kill people, kratom could of saved those people already dead from abused illicit drugs. Too many friends of mine have died and if we would have known about kratom before I took it 7 years ago we would never be in this predicament of opiate addiction. My mom is also on disability and has tried every anti-depressant, anti-anxiety, and opiate on earth, nothing helps but kratom. It helps in the most organic way. You can go to work, take care of your kids, and go to school. The community of kratom is filled with the most beautiful people I've ever met in my life; please do not take this away from us. This herb helps all walks of life with so many conditions. If the DEA makes this natural herb illegal I will have no faith left in humanity and blood will be on the DEA and Governments hands. Think, it could be one of your family members or loved ones getting relief from it.

I was in a car accident 12 years ago and it tore a disk. Two years later after much suffering even while taking narcotic pain medication, I had a spinal fusion.  This basically resulted in me trading one type of debilitating pain for another.  I have no choice but to take a narcotic pain medication to live any kind of live. During this time of my life, I was a mom of two young children and an elementary level school teacher.  In order to make a living and in order to take care of my children, I had to continue taking the pain medication.  But my life was still very limited, but I still functioned. As I have gotten older, the pain meds have become less and less effective.  Now, please let me point out that I didn't have a full life. My life revolved around around my chronic pain.  I could only do things by taking medicine and allowing it to kick in and then do what I needed to do.  As my medication became less effective I was looking for other options and found kratom.  I now can do anything I need to do at just about any time of the day. I don't even take the narcotic medicines unless I am having a very bad pain day.  And all of this from an herbal product. I am telling you that taking Kratom is like taking aspirin and drinking a cup of coffee.  There is no high with this.  Unfortunately I think because people who have abused heroin take this,with much success, to get off of it, people seem to think it's a drug people are abusing.  You don't get high, and from what I understand, if you take too much, you will vomit. PI would also like to point out that alcohol causes many deaths and destroys maby lives, all while being a legal product that is only for getting intoxicated.  If you make Kratom a class 1 substance, many people who are now functioning members of society because of Kratom  will become people who can't work, can't parent their children, and some will even return to the illegal drugs they abused. As a child of a heroin addict whose mother died young from heroin addiction, I would do anything to help others avoid the life I lived because of this terrible drug.\nSincerely, \nBridget L Hall","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1075","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bridget Hall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would strongly suggest against banning kratom.

I feel confident in saying that banning kratom will cause a bigger problem with opiate addiction in America, which is already an epidemic. Kratom does not make anyone \"high\" or impaired like true opiates, it simply keeps cravings for them at bay. Please consider the ramifications of banning this plant. Banning a plant that has helped people get off of stronger substances will simply cause them to go back on them.

I strongly believe that Kratom should remain legal for several reasons. The first a foremost is that its relatively benign. I'm sure if you look hard enough almost anything can be abused. Kratom has a potential for abuse, but the potential is microscopic compared to alcohol and almost any prescription drug I can think of. \n\nMy father died of drug overdose in 2007. He was shooting roxicodone. The cycle of abuse, punishment and further abuse is horrific. I pray a compassionate method is adopted in our country for the users. They get portrayed as pathological liars and self centered sociopaths. In reality my dad suffered from child abuse and he was treating his pain.\n\n Kratom may have provided a more humane alternative. Please dont add another plant to this horrible war that can not be won. \n\nBill Terry","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16834","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"william terry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Sirs,\n\nI am a mid 40's IT Executive who has suffered from Migraine since I was 10 and IBS since my mid 20's.\nFor IBS, I lived a life of learning where all the bathrooms were at all of the public places I could possibly go.  I planned my life around that knowledge and FEARED going new places.  I tried many medicines and they usually made things worse or gave me other effects that were just as bad.  For my IBS, Kratom has been a Godsend.  I am almost completely cured of my issues, having only to deal with them a few times per year during extreme stress.  I have been able to travel the world for my job without fear and my career has advanced nicely.  I have represented my US manufacturing company from Vancouver to Peru and from Dubai to Paris and many points in between.  If I had not been that confident, I'm not sure if I would have garnered as much attention from my superiors allowing me to progress to a Directorship.\n\nFor Migraine, my doctors and neurologists have only 2 options, since I'm allergic to the main ingredient in most migraine medicines like Imitrex and since I have A-Fib I can't have caffeine. (which is also a key ingredient in most migraine meds)  \n1.Break through pain meds, like Percocet, or \n2. a 400mg/day anti-seizure medicine that MAY help migraines.  \n\nI don't want narcotics and I don't want to take anti-seizure medicines since I don't have a seizure disorder.\nA twice daily dose of Kratom has reduced the frequency of my migraines to once a month or less; and when I do get one, an additional dose with 2 Advil is enough to get me through the pain and still work if necessary.  With the increase in pain med abuse I see this as a win win for myself AND my doctors.  I have not had a script for pain meds in well over 2 years and I'm praying it stays that way.\n\nIf Kratom were to be banned, I would go back to having a far less active life, living in public restrooms and will have to go back to my doctor to ask for Percocet scripts again for migraine pain.  Every time I go to the doctor where my only purpose is to get a refill of pain meds I feel ashamed.  I know I shouldn't but it makes me feel like I'm not able to exist without making sure I have a couple of pills around in case I get hit with a migraine.  He writes me 12 pills at a time and limits me to 1 pill per week and I understand why, but I often need 2-3 per week.  I don't want to take that many!\n\nPlease let me make my own decisions about what natural products I use to make my life livable.  This isn't a manufactured or lab created substance.  I have researched this plant and I have decided that it is something I want to use in my life.  My decision is an informed one.  Please don't take that properly made and informed decision away from me with the stroke of a pen.\n\nI sincerely appreciate your position in ensuring the safety of the public.  I also appreciate the fact that you stopped the original emergency ban to hear from the public.  That showed a great respect for us and that you wish to make a more informed decision.  If you wish to place restrictions on it, such as needing to be 18, no one could argue.  Also, perhaps placing a ban on creating extracts or enhanced versions of it might be appropriate if they are misused somehow.  That would make sense.\nAfter using Kratom daily for 4+ years I have never gotten \"high\" from it nor even been impaired in any way so I'm not sure why a ban is needed.\n\nThank you for listening!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5716","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Walter Gould","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't schedule Kratom.

There is a real danger of chilling research in the arbitrary making of natural substances illegal and the criminality that it creates.  Kratom a member of the coffee family Rubicae, had not demonstrated any indication for a need to be controlled apart from any other supplement or herbal remedy.  The few cases brought forward as evidence are weak, incidental, coincidental, and would not stand under merit in court.  We have seen schedule 1 misused countless times to control plants that have proved to be opposite of the very definition of Schedule 1 in having no medical purpose.  It would make me question the DEA as to it's true motives as large companies make billions on opiates, while natural opium is illegal, not even schedule 1, while a non harmful and working treatment to the problem is considered to be banned.  I would ask in addition to the DEA what scientific authority it has to make these judgments where no or little research has been conducted to substantiate this position.  In addition on the other hand the Scientific community would need to rigorously test and research to make the same claim.  I do not want to see Kratom banned in the case that under some future circumstances I would want the option open for my personal use.  Also to note that scheduling this plant would not in the least cause me no to use it if needed.

With the recent legalization of cannabis in several more states, it seems that the tide of public opinion is turning, and it's good that there are forward-thinking people in the DEA who can recognize this. I'm asking that the DEA withdraw its proposed action of making kratoum a Schedule 1 substance. I hope that instead it can be regulated by the BATF in the same manner as alcohol, and also regulated as a herbal supplement by the FDA, in order to ensure the safety of consumers. Yes, kratoum can be mildly addictive and can be used for recreation, but so can many prescription drugs. Its side effects and addictive potential are far less than pharmaceutical painkillers, or our society's favorite recreational drug: alcohol. I don't use kratoum, I tried it and it caused a very bad nausea reaction in me--but I know that it greatly benefits others, especially those who are trying to quit opiates or who suffer from chronic pain. Each individual ultimately has the final say on what they want to put in their body, and should be informed of the consequences. I tried kratoum and got nausea from it, but that doesn't mean I want to stop others from using it if they benefit from it. I think every family in the US has been touched by the current epidemic of heroin and prescription painkiller addiction. Mine has been. Kratoum is a safe and cheap medicine that can help those people quit pills and heroin. Rehab can cost thousands of dollars, and in many cases, it is a for-profit business that operates on outdated treatment principles. I know one person who became addicted to pain pills from a doctor, and when those ran out he turned to heroin. His family paid for rehab but it didn't work. The only thing that worked for him was doing an at-home detox. With his family there to help him, he made it through some very difficult days of withdrawl and is now drug-free and in NA. That is exactly the kind of person that kratoum could help. I kept kratoum in my family medicine cabinet, in case of severe pain or injury. (I'm unable to afford health insurance, so a doctor's visit could mean thousands of dollars in medical bills.) With all the problems in our health care system, I think people should be allowed to use any treatment they see fit for themselves and their families, even if some people disagree with their choices. As for the economic impact of the proposed scheduling, I think that making this plant an illegal product would greatly benefit drug cartels and the pharmaceutical industry which is flooding our society with dangerous and addictive synthetic painkillers. Also, making it Schedule 1 would create difficulties in doing scientific research on it in the future. Ultimately, kratoum is a plant, not a crime. It's legal almost everywhere in the world---and the rest of the world follows the US in regard to drug policy. So please, let's keep this interesting and useful plant available on the market, and allow consumers to make their own informed decisions about whether or not to use it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16028","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Simone Hickman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \n\nMy name is Sam Shapiro, and I am a 24 year-old design student.

The vicious cycle and damage to my body was really taking a toll, I couldn't function without medication, I was really tired of depending on a pill but without them I was in so much pain on top of the symptoms of the withdraw. I was truly blessed to discover this amazing leaf! Since I began taking Kratom I am down to one medication and it is not a narcotic. Not only am I pain free, I'm no longer depressed, or dependent on medications. Kratom has changed my life i am able to function like a normal person, play with my children, roller skate, ride a bike, get out of bed every single morning without having to take medication first thing in the morning to avoid with drawls. I've regained my appetite before Kratom I was 98lbs and unable to eat because of the narcotics and depression since starting Kratom just four months ago I am back up to my normal weight of 116lbs. I'm focused and never in a fog my skin is clear and free from breaks outs and dry mouth/skin/hair due to the medications I was taking. I am in such a clear, happy state of mine no longer living day to day depending on an orange pill bottle. I was up in the morning and have my Kratom in milk with my breakfast and that is all. It doesn't impair my abilities to work, drive, or perform daily tasks. I wish anyone experiencing what I was going though has the opportunity to try Kratom it is truly a miracle!!  \nThank you for taking the time to listen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22587","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kaylin Ruquet","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Michael Worth, I am 49 years old, and prior to the accident that I am about to share with you, I was employed as a Motor Officer.\n\nIn February of 2014, I was involved in a very serious (work-related) motorcycle accident that left me disabled.  I received severe, life changing injuries to both of my arms and my pelvis.  And it didnt take long for the hospital to pump me full of enough Oxycontin and Oxycodone to leave me fully addicted.  But it didnt stop there.  I was on this stuff for nearly two years due to the severity of my injuries.  So when it was time to stop, I found myself addicted, which is really just another injury to add to the list.  \n\nThen I found Kratom.  Kratom didn't just help me break the addiction, it also gave me a sound alternative to prescription drugs for continuing my pain management.  And unlike the prescription options, Kratom has been completely free of the side-effects and addiction that is often associated with prescription medication.  I can quit it when I dont need it; and when I do need it, it not only relieves my pain, but it does so without any impairment so I can still drive to the places I need to go, like Physical Therapy.  \n\nI can't find a single, sound reason why anyone would want to make Kratom hard to come by, except for maybe the companies that sell competing products.  I have never experienced a \"high\" associated with using Kratom, so I can't imagine what the benefit would be to using Kratom when you don't have a legitimate need, and I don't really see any opportunity for abuse.\n\nIn short, Kratom is essential to my well-being, and that of others.  I didn't even realize that it was giving me peace from my PTSD until others mentioned it.  And that's really the magic of Kratom, it just works.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5391","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Worth","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom had been a big help in my life!

I came to use kratom because of my many health issues. Bulging herniated discs, sciatica, degenerative disc disorder, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and depression. The painkillers I was prescribed hardly worked and made me a horrible mean person. I was drinking every night just to be able to sleep. The pain I experience is unbearable. Since kratom, I am able to move around without as much pain. I also was able to quit drinking alcohol and taking pain medication. I am happier and have a positive attitude. Kratom is a much safer alternative to pharmaceutical painkillers and antidepressants. It has saved my life. I'm asking you to please keep kratom legal. Please don't make kratom a schedule 1 drug. It is a plant in the coffee family. Could you imagine if coffee was made to be a schedule 1 drug?

I am a 40 year old women with two small children who made it out of a tumultuous divorce alive thanks to kratom. There were many days i wanted to die from the pain of this divorce. There was not a single depression pill that could help this matter. I was introduced to kratom as a form of alleviation from pain, anxiety and emotional distress.  Kratom was the only thing that combated these emotions and saved my life. It was a mild herb, however the  effects were astronomical. I am still going through a divorce and now i am near the end. I can work now, function properly, even care for my two children keeping a stable mind. I am happier in my life and it gives me the drive to go on. Thank you for allowing the only substance on this earth to aid me with enough drive to go on and be happy enough to move forward without feeling the need to harm myself or anyone else. Its prevents anger and calms down my blood pressure when i have to fight for my life and need a clear head. It doesnt make me feel high or sedated during its process like other prescribed drugs. This is a god sent product that can only help the human species. Please dont ban this product or you are making this country a horroble place of survival. May i also mention i no longer feel trapped in my life with no resolution. I am happy amd so are my two children because my happiness is theres. Please dont take this away from us.

I was on long-term opiate prescriptions for a couple of years and found that they made me very irritable and sleepy - as well as a building tolerance that led to me upping the dosage.  I found kratom online and decided to give it a try to see if it could be a substitute.\n\nI found that it worked well enough that i discontinued using opiates.  Kratom has allowed me to work comfortably at my development job for 8 hours a day without having to max on ibuprofen.  It does not interfere with my mental function.  It has allowed me to be active with my family - going for hikes and spending the day at farmers markets, etc, with my children.  Opiates allowed me to do this, but made me so irritable and sleepy that i often did not want to participate with the family.\n\nIf kratom were banned, I would be forced to live with my pain, as I do not wish to return to opiates long term.  I would need to max out on ibuprofen to keep the pain at bay, which cannot be good for long term health.  I would miss out on activities with my family and be a lot less physically active in general.\n\nAs far as side effects, I have been using kratom for 5+ years and the only noticeable side effect is a little slowing of my digestion, easily fixed with more fiber in my diet, nothing else.  Opiates cannot claim that, I'm sure.  I've never had anything like an overdose, and I doubt that one could even overdose on kratom in leaf powder form.\n\nPlease don't make kratom illegal - it has helped keep my functional and active with my family.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1880","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tim Anderson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Erin Brutlag, I am 32 and a licensed physical therapist.

From ADHD I have a lot of anxiety and also have trouble uncontrollable outbursts.  Kratom has allowed me to alleviate these much like someone may feel Ginko helps them remember things.  Also I know others have reaped benefits in terms of treating pain.  Just yesterday I had a long time friend take Kratom for the first time for pain reduction.  He was previously taking Percocet for the pain.  He said after the first dose he was feeling much.  So there are benefits for Kratom that are equal to that of canabis but without any sort of a \"high\" that will impact your daily operations. There isn't really any sort of a physical feeling side effect\nMuch more than what you would get from a melatonin.  Please consider the benefits of this natural herb.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk.

However, if you are committed to ignore the paragraph above, the paragraph below might be an easier pill for you to swallow.\n\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it. If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars. Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement. Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down. Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids. Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose. The War on Drugs has had a catastrophic negative impact on the morals of law enforcement personnel as well as the peace and safety of the communities they \"serve.\" You need to restore that trust, and disbanding the DEA will be a significant step.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19680","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Helped a friend of mine who was addicted to opiates get clean.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11979","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anthony Arnzen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a safe alternative to prescription pain pills.

My story dates back to about 5 years ago when I got diagnosed with an incurable auto-immune disease called dermatomyositis. Dermatomyositis causes extreme fatigue and muscle weakness among many other things. \nI also am a veteran of the US army. After my time in the military, I became very anxious and depressed and all of that was increased by getting diagnosed with an auto-immune disease a couple years or so after getting out of the military.  The disease caused me muscles pain as almost every muscle in my body was inflamed, because of this I was prescribed hydrocodone. \nWhen things began to settle down, it was time to stop the hydrocodone. I stopped cold turkey not realizing the pain and agony Id be in for the next week. I had been on hydrocodone so long that when I stopped I began withdrawal symptoms that were hell. I didnt go to the doctor for help because i was embarrassed as to what just happened. Mentally I was not addicted, but physically I was and my body made sure to inform me of that.\nAfter a day or two of hell, I started looking for things to ease my symptoms. I somehow came across kratom. I did A LOT of research before trying it, saw that it was legal, no one has had any health problems and thought...why the hell not? I cannot begin to explain how much kratom saved me at the day and time.\nUpon taking kratom I noticed my anxiety was starting to ease more and more until finally I had felt like I was no longer anxious , I felt I was no longer depressed because kratom gave me the energy I needed to get through my day and get things done that I had previously not been able to do due to fatigue. It gives me an over well general feeling of well being (NOT a high) and its like a cup of coffee without the jitters.\nAgain, this was 3 (almost 4) years ago that I began kratom and have taken it ever since, everyday. I have had no health problems what so ever. My blood test always come back normal and I havent had any crazy side effects. Overall kratom has been tolerated to everyone I have told and changed their lives for the better.\nPlease dont ban kratom.

I first just want to say thank you for allowing us the opportunity to voice our concerns and opinions about this. I have struggled with anxiety and depression since about 12 years old. My parents tried to help by having me see countless doctors, counselors and other professionals. Also by putting me on different types of prescription medication for an ever changing diagnosis of ADD, OCD, anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder, just to name a few. Meds I took included Ritalin, adderal, Zoloft, lithium, Xanax, klonopin, and many other compounds and chemicals whose names i cannot currently pronounce or recall. Many doctors also prescribed multiple medications to be taken at the same time or in the same day. None of these treatments proved to be truly effective for my issue of what I now know as anxiety and depression, so I began to turn to drugs and alcohol. I used and abused many illegal drugs in this time and opiates of all kinds slowly became a drug of choice for me as well as marijuana and alcohol. I was quite unhealthily hooked to opiates for about four years and then began illegally purchasing suboxone in an effort to be free from opiates. I was on suboxone for about a year and was able to ween myself down to nothing and come off completely. I stayed away from all opiates for several years after that. I discovered kratom while living in Colorado and i believe it to be a gift from God. I'm completely off of all medications both legal and illegal, prescription and non prescription. I now orally ingest both kratom and cannabis and I feel great. I have been taking kratom and cannabis for about two years now and am very thankful and pleased with the results. I believe that God has provided all of us with medicines out of the earth for our blessing, benefit, and well being. Please do not make kratom illegal or a controlled substance. God has blessed us all with many plants and he has blessed me and helped me with it. Please keep it legal and widely available and easily accessible for everyone. Thank you for your time and sincere consideration.\nSincerely, Ryan James Tucker\nPeace Love and Unity","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22393","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Tucker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a thirteen year opiate user.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Kratom is very effective in easing social anxiety and mild depression. I feel that I can function better and be more productive with kratom. There have been no negative events resulting from my use of kratom that would be considered a burden on society, please check my personal record if needed. Since the announcement from the DEA I have attempted to transition to something more traditionally accepted such as kava but found I was unable to ingest it. Even 1tbs of water extract caused instant nausea and a numb tongue sensation. I would like to state that I am a productive member of society, I have a BS Degree, a full time job, NO felony or Misdemeanor criminal charges.I do have a few normal traffic infractions for speeding. Detailed/full document attached. TO DESCRIBE THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF KRATOM IS SOMEWHAT ABSTRACT: In general kratom reduces anxiety. In general terms of relaxation, and also in the specific case of social anxiety. After being exposed to kratom I am much more open to communicating with people than I ever have been in the past. The effect is immediate from use, but also cumulative and long lasting. It relaxes and helps discontinue nervous habits that are counter productive and serve no use except to perpetuate anxiety. I also believe it is effective in helping with mild depression.... There are/were days when I would simply wake up feeling resentful of the world. Before I started out my day, before anyone could smile at me and say hi or before anyone had a chance to slighted me. I felt that there was just nothing there to look forward to and inevitably someone was outside/today waiting to make my life \"worse than it already is\". On days like these I would simply make a cup of tea, and for the most part all that pessimistic thought pattern could be circumvented and I could proceed to have a normal day. For the longest time I didn't think the pain relieving claims were real. I don't have chronic pain, and I never felt numb or anything from drinking kratom. I shared some tea with a new friend I met. I asked the only known safety concern \"are you taking any MAOI drugs?\" because that is a known thing to not mix with. My friend polity drank the tea but then discarded most of it, apparently it wasn't the most pleasant taste. After a while I asked if he felt more relaxed or anything ... no effect. Eventually he started rotating his arms expressing that he had less pain. he later elaborated that he was on \"hydrocodone\" and asked me again what that teas stuff was. Maybe it can be helpful for some people in this use. I sincerely hope I have shown the vast positive effects of responsible kratom use Thanks for your time and consideration","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4248","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern \nKratom is a safe dietary supplement.

I have worked  as a registered nurse full-time for the last 12 years, and I have seen the unfortunate effects of long-term, chronic opioid use.\n\nI am 37 years old, and I am fortunate enough to be fairly healthy. I first discovered kratom  in January of this year after having my fibroids removed a couple of days before Christmas 2015. I had never taken Percocet before, and needless to say it  was effective in treating the postoperative pain at home while I was recovering. Unfortunately I ended up with a complication, a skin infection, called cellulitis. This obviously called for more pain medicine. However, I did not like the fact that I was taking more opiate than I wanted to . I wanted to go the natural route. That's when an Internet search led me to kratom. It was more than effective for my pain. It also made me feel relaxed. I subsequently began to take it for menstrual pain and cramps.\n\nNowadays, I drink a cup of kratom tea to relax after work. For me personally, I find this a better alternative than reaching for alcohol, which I have never cared for anyway. I have read countless stories over the last 10 months of those afflicted with drug addiction, and every other ailment known to mankind become a more productive member of society due to the effects of kratom in their life. My twin sister, whose doctor told her she has the back of it 80 year old, tried kratom for the first time and actually was pain-free for a whole day- something she said she rarely experiences with the NSAIDs and other narcotics she has been prescribed. I love that it is an all natural plant, nothing added to it and nothing taken away and it has the ability to provide pain relief, mood enhancement , opioid and ETOH withdrawal , increased energy, decreased anxiety, etc. I have not needed to take my restless leg syndrome medication in a few months. I cannot see any downside to kratom  other than having it put me to sleep at bedtime! The testimonials speak for themselves-now we need the science to back up the claims. Please refrain from making kratom a schedule 1 drug. I am writing to ask that it remain a legal, all-natural herbal supplement. There are so many people including myself that benefit from this wonderful herb and are trying to live our lives as good, law-abiding citizens.

Kratom saved my life. I have now been using Kratom daily, like coffee, for 10 years. I just had a blood test done at my local convenient care and it came back 100% normal AS I EXPECTED. Kratom is simply a mild, harmless stimulant like coffee.\n\nI have struggled with treatment-resistant depression since I was 10 years old. Throughout high school and college I considered suicide many times, self-mutilated, and tried just whatever drugs I could get a hold of. Acid, shrooms, pot. 12 years ago I was put on suicide watch at my college. I was told I just \"looked\" like a danger to myself. I worked my way through therapy, pills, the whole bit. None of it helped. \n\nA real wake-up call happened that year. A friend gave me some Prozac and suggested it helped him.  He neglected to mention that Prozac and alcohol don't mix. That night I nearly killed myself, and woke up the next day in a full bathtub with a butcher knife on the floor. I had no idea what happened, and suspect I'm only alive because I passed out before killing myself.\n\n2 years later I realized I was a full-blown alcoholic. I was managing to hold on to a well paying job with the degree I'd earned, but just barely. The depression was suffocating. The alcohol was no longer fun: my soul felt eroded. I felt dead inside. \n\nAs I hit rock-bottom, desperate, I joined a message board for people with chronic pain and depression, looking for any suggestions I hadn't tried. Someone told me to talk to a woman suffering from Mulitiple Sclerosis who'd had great success with an herb called Kratom. She turned out to be the first person I bought Kratom from: a chronic pain sufferer who found relief nowhere else. These are the adults you seek to harm by banning Kratom: real people who have found a safe alternative to DANGEROUS prescription medication which the DEA apparently sees as less of a problem than a harmless herbal alternative. \n\nWhen Kratom first arrived I tried it a few times but it basically sat in the cupboard because I actually couldn't tell if it was DOING anything. This is what you compare to heroin and crack? I passed it up for a bottle of Jim Beam because it was a BETTER HIGH. Seriously, I got a better \"high\" from coffee. Months later, in a pit, i tried Kratom again because people online kept insisting it helped, and I started to notice some things: I felt like I could breath again, stronger, more interested in my work, excited about life again.\n\nOver the next few months I weaned myself off of alcohol, and I slowly learned to smile again. Now, I haven't drank or used ANY illegal drug in almost 10 years. Instead, I've learned to depend on the gentle stimulation, and the anti-depressive effects Kratom has for me personally.\n\nPlease, consider other people's lives. I am happy and well adjusted now. I'm not hurting anyone else, and I'm not hurting myself as I proved through the blood test. A broad total ban to stop a few kids from getting ahold of it is not the solution. Banning Kratom hurts real people. The risk is negligible next to the real drug threats we face: prescription drug abuse, an opiate epidemic (which Kratom is helping to fight), alcoholism, tobacco deaths. Let's get our priorities straight instead of demonizing innocent people. \n\nI love my wife, I love my nephews, and I love my job. I am living the American Dream, and my life is better than I ever imagined it could be. I am a mild to moderate daily user. I am happy and well-adjusted. You want to take this away from me. Why? Why can't we show the world for once that America can be reasonable, thoughtful, and moderate.

The side effects of these drugs are life threatening, where as I dont have any side effects from kratom. We are just recently finding out about all the benefits of cannabis, and kratom has many benefits we need to research as well. Its obvious that the pharmaceutical industry will suffer a huge blow once the entire population finds out about kratom and most people are under the impression that this is the reason it is being pushed to become illegal suddenly.

I was on options at the time and wanted a natural alternative.  Unfortunately, my stomach was too sensitive for it and I couldn't continue taking it.  It did help my pain tremendously though.  I know many other people in the chronic pain community who have been helped by this plant.   In a c9mmunity with too many suicides, to take this away from them would be criminal.\nI wish I could take it as my stomach has been destroyed by NSAIDS and with the strict opioid laws I can't find help for my pain.  I'm currently ruining my liver because I'm taking copious amounts of Tylenol and all it does is help me so that I'm not constantly wanting to die.  But I can't get out of bed, my quality of life is horrible.\nDon't take this away from the people who need it, any risks of kratom which is very low, do not outweigh the risk of suicide from living with a chronic pain condition.\nI'd also like to say that the opiate restrictions, at least in Ohio, are completely unnecessary since we have systems in place to make sure the pills aren't being sold or abused, and more systems could be put in place to make this even less likely.  Doctors who know us should not have to fear losing their licenses, and people like me shouldn't have you choose between a life of extreme pain and suicide.\nThank you in advance for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12479","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Buffi Young","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Chasity Ray and I am a 43 year old mother of one who is very concerned about the possibility of kratom being banned.\n\nI have a congenital back defect that will only worsen with time.

I had first heard of Kratom on a TS message board, it had been recommended by a member and within a couple of years had become very popular with everyone in the group. Tourettes syndrome is a disorder comprised of various physical and vocal tics that are noticeable, distracting and completely out of the sufferer's control. Those with TS usually face extreme bullying even well into adulthood. We are treated as obnoxious and annoying and even in 2016 it is not well understood both medically and socially. In the years before I discovered kratom, i had tried many traditional forms of treatment and control for the tics ;medication, behavioral therapy/cognetive therapy, off-label treatments. I spent years feeling like a zombie and with very little improvement. Since discovering kratom, i have reclaimed my life. It is not a cute for TS, but definitely helps with the tics significantly, likely in the same way it has a subtle impact on those with anxiety disorders.  In the 5 years i have taken kratom, 5 times a day, i have never experienced any negative affects. It is very mild, like chamomile and St. Johns wort. The idea that it is \"highly addictive \" is honestly laughable. Again, i have taken it for 5 years, 5 times a day, and when it becomes inconvenient or I do not have the ability to take, I simply don't. I've taken whole weeks off without experiencing any negative affects that I would imagine withdrawal is like. The worst thing that happened is that I had a mild headache on day 3, about the same experience as caffeine withdrawal. I am a well educated business and property owner from a nice area, a serial volunteer in my community, a wife and mother. Keaton has helped me to continue to be all of those things, and I can only pray that the final decision on the legality of it comes from a place of logic and user experiences, not from a place of media-esque sensationalism and fear mongering.

I have been taking klonopin 2mgs 3 times per  day  and also addicted to Roxycontin 30mgsvand would take 2 or 3 per day, when I couldn't find these or ran out I would have to turn to heroin or any opioids I could find. After finding  Kratom in a Murphy oil gas station I could take 2 to 3 bottles a day and be perfectly fine without having to take  any opioids and only won 2 mg Klonopin per day .  The product I found looked just like a five hour energy shot and was called ultra enhanced gold. Also there was another shot call relaxapro.  After finding that these the effects work so well I started ordering them online and would order 100% pure Kratom leaves crushed up and purchased by the oz.   I found no uncomfortable come down or irritation from the substance and was very disappointed when I couldn't get it legally anymore and it was outlawed  and my state and or country .  I feel that this plant helps extremely with anxiety pain and especially would help or does help with withdrawal symptoms coming off of a strong opiates from hydrocodone to heroin.  I hope somebody reads this and can use it for the legalization of the plant for anyone who needs or wants it.

In fact, much of the hype and benefits of the plant come from the kratom industry rather than actual users. I do believe that the plant has therapeutic potential, but it is also addictive and should not be available to the public. My concern is that it will turn non opioid using people into drug addicts.

I have suffered from lower back pain and migraine/tension headaches for years and tried a variety of prescription medication including opioids, SSRI's, and barbiturates.  \n\nI work at a large law firm as a database administrator and am a father of two young children.  It was difficult for me to work and be a functional parent while on my normal prescription drugs (or while in the throes of having a migraine headache), so I started researching some natural and safe alternatives to my prescriptions.  This is when I discovered Kratom.  While I still rely on prescription medication when the pain is overwhelming, I can usually stave off full blown migraines by taking small amounts of Kratom when I notice my typical headache triggers coming into play.  While it doesn't totally alleviate the pain, it's enough to let me finish a day of work, be a fully functional parent, and maintain the pain without having to completely rely on doses of prescribed medication.\n\nHaving taken Kratom for almost two years, I believe there could be some level of regulation on the plant, but not prohibition.  I also believe it's important to do more research on the plant, as it could be a lifesaver for millions.  I consider it a very safe alternative to my prescribed medication.  To me, the feeling is the equivalent of a very mild dose of the Tramadol I've been prescribed, mixed with the uplifting qualities of a good cup of coffee.  With the quantities I take, it is certainly not dangerous, and I believe much less dangerous than my prescribed medication.  I feel better about putting a natural product into my body as opposed to manufactured chemicals.\n\nTaking Kratom responsibly should be left to the consumer, not the government.  I appreciate the concern the government has for Kratom consumers, but again, I believe it is unwarranted.  I believe the governmental focus should be on research and regulation, if there's going to be a focus at all.  \n\nThank you for taking the time to open up comments from the public, and not rushing into an unneeded ban.\n\nSincerely,\nDaniel","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18978","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,  My name is Tony. Im a 36yr old white male.  I hurt my back in 2009. My Dr put me on Norco 10s 3times a day and tramadol 50mg 4 times a day. After a few months my back seemed better. It wasnt bad enough for surgery or anything.  So I wanted to stop my meds. Didnt think it would be a problem. Boy was I wrong not taking them the 1st day I felt like dying terrible nausea ,diareah, cold sweats ect.. So went to dr.  He said in my line of work it probably best to just stay on the medicine and yes if I stop them ill will go through discomfort. I didnt agree totally but definitely did not want to feel the with drawals. I tried a few things to lean off. I even tried methadone. Hu that was even worse. I researched heavily and found kratom. I started taking it in 2014 after2days of withdrawals from methadone.  I took 5grams of kratom powder and in about 30min my nausea started to subside. After an hr I felt normal and could eat and carry on normal activities. So I took a 5gram dose 3times a day for a couple months.  Kratom was cheap filled the receptors or whatever in my body. I could eat sleep and live feeling great.  After a few months I stopped taking it. The 1st day I had some sniffles and muscle aches, coulda been from work. Anyhow 2nd day nothing felt fine,3rd no problem. After 2weeks of feeling normal and great it was just awsome. I am a welder and it's hard rough work. My body gets beat up. I drink a kratom tea in the eceninh after work. I swear by it. I havent had any negative side effects. Maybe its bitter tase....  I believe the so called negative stories and what people heard and seen has been misguided and twisted. All the research ive done into these cases of people being on kratom,,, theyve all were involved with other substaces or drigs other than kratom. Im sure they had kratom but it might not have worked for them to quit other stuff or substitut drugs. The crazy behavior or watever the case was I just cant and wont believe kratom was at fault.  It's time to hokd people accountable for their actions. Kratom is a great benificial herb and has helped me change my life and saved me from the legal highly educated doctor dope pushers.  It turns my stomach to think I can go get a script for opiates no problem but may have to jump through hoops to get a herb for medicinal use that has no scientific evidence of being harmful at least if taken responsible. Im sure I can take too much and it be bad just like caffiene, sugar ect.  Anyhow I cant help but think the motivation for banning kratom and making it illegal is coming from pharmaceutical companies. Im sure they are starting to loose some customers.  Im sure banning it will give law enforcement more jobs and job security. Ugh and to think all the street drugs at the local town corner ,school and clubs is so available I just dont understand why kratom is in the cross hairs or headlines..... I would hope everyone comes to there senses and keep it legal and regulate kratom.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\nAnthony Hoffmann","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17801","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anthony Hoffmann","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do tree work for a living which is very physical work, and Kratom helps me out on a daily basis.

I have suffered with chronic back pain for the better part of ten years. During that time I have been prescribed countless varieties of opiates. Most caused me to be lethargic with no ambition for daily life. I ended up settling with methadone as it didn't reduce me to a medicated zombie and therefore I was able to contribute to supporting my family. Although I still suffer with the pain, continuing with acquiring pain medication has become self degrading. With the crackdown on opiates and the false pretense of limiting the amount of medication prescribed will somehow reduce illicit use has caused their use to be detrimental to any life improvement opiates may have. The idea that limiting medication to legitimate chronic pain suffers will reduce illicit use is actually ridicules.  Someone suffering chronic pain is not going to sell a portion of there medication for a few dollars and then be condemned to suffer more. \n    The problem with stopping the methadone was not the pain I was forced to endure, it was the extreme withdrawal associated with stopping. Using Kratom for several weeks after stopping the methadone was a godsend for me. It reduced the withdrawal symptoms to a tolerable level in addition to providing pain relief. \n     I will continue to use the Kratom for pain control for when the pain is intolerable as long as it remains possible to acquire.  With all due respect, please reconsider the decision to place this herb in the illicit column.    \n\nThank you\nMark Angelo","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6297","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Angelo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to request that kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) and its components(mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine) NOT be placed, temporarily nor permanently, into Schedule 1.\nKratom is not an immanent hazard or immediate threat to public safety.  Legal substances such as acetaminophen cause many more deaths per year in our country.  Acetaminophen deaths are calculated (by CDC and FDA) to be between 300 and 980 individuals per year (Gerth and Miller, 2013).  Kratom was found to be associated with 15 deaths in two years (DEA, 2016).  I believe kratom was not implicated as the lone cause in all cases.\nKratom does not have a substantial potential for abuse.  I have never seen a case of kratom abuse in my community.  A search of medical literature using PubMed does not reveal an epidemic of abuse nor extreme cases of dependency.  One article describing kratom abuse states that the withdrawal was \"short and benign\" (McWhirter and Morris, 2010).  Scientific research also describes the therapeutic potential of compounds in this herb (Hassan et al., 2013).  \nAs kratom is an herb not a drug, it does not require a currently accepted medical use nor an accepted safety for use under medical supervision.  It is correct kratom be categorized as an herb.\nThe main effects of scheduling kratom would be hardship for citizens who use it and for businesses that provide jobs and tax revenue.  Scheduling would also prevent further research into kratom's medical benefits and potential. \n\nWorks Cited\nDEA Public Affairs. (2016).

My name is Alissa Gregorius. I am a 38-year-old mother of 5 and work in R&D/Product Development in the Nutraceutical industry. I am writing today to oppose the scheduling of Kratom in any drug class.  I feel that it is a safe herbal supplement that should not be scheduled. I first found out about Kratom in 2012. I had been on Suboxone for prescription pain pill addiction. I had been on prescription pain pills for chronic back pain and Fibromyalgia for 8 years. Along with that, I suffered from anxiety disorder and depression throughout my life, for which I was put on various medications that only seemed to make my symptoms worse. I eventually entered a Suboxone treatment program in 2010. The program worked well for me until I needed to relocate from North Carolina back to Georgia, so I began a medically supervised taper off Suboxone. I got to the last milligram and couldn't seem to break free from its hold on me. I was having to drive from GA back to NC once a month because the Suboxone programs in my area were not practical. In GA, they wanted me to go to the clinic daily, as opposed to going monthly in NC. I had children and a new job and couldn't go daily. So, I would make the drive to NC each month. \nI was lamenting to my assistant one day about my struggle to get off Suboxone and my monthly drives up to NC. She told me that someone she knew took an herbal supplement, called Kratom, to get off Suboxone and that she herself took it once a month whenever her menstrual cramps were bad. So, I began to research. I was very skeptical at first and did not believe something natural could help me get off such a strong medication, but I had to do something. I researched how much I needed to take for my Suboxone taper and I began.  I noticed that I didn't \"feel\" anything, just an uplifting feeling similar to when I drink coffee, but without the jittery side effects. After a week of taking Kratom, I realized that the last milligram of Suboxone I had saved had been forgotten about, so I disposed of it and continued to take the Kratom twice daily, 1 tsp in my coffee in the morning & 1 tsp in my juice in the evening. This worked well for me and I did not need to increase my dose at any time.\n A year later, I found out I was pregnant and chose to stop taking Kratom. I did not experience any withdrawal symptoms. What I did notice was that that my anxiety, depression, and pain was returning. I had a difficult pregnancy not taking any medications for pain, anxiety, or depression and no Kratom, but I made it. I had my baby in Jan/2015. My sister died 10 days after my baby was born & my depression got worse because of the grief coupled with the hormones. I continued to struggle with my chronic pain, anxiety, and depression and kept trying different medications prescribed by my Dr., but none of them were helping. I then remembered how Kratom had helped all my ailments previously, so I decided to give it a try again. \nIt has now been about a year since taking Kratom again. I take it regularly, but not daily. If I can't afford to buy Kratom one week, then I don't buy it. This is much different from my days of opiate addiction where I was compelled to take more and more pills at a faster frequency and lost everything trying to pay for the pills. For the first time in my life I feel free. I feel like I am my best self and am a highly functioning adult and a fully contributing member of society. \nMy excellent health and quality of life today is because of an herbal supplement that I take responsibly. Now the government is trying to ban something that has helped me and many others. If you're worried about abuse, why haven't I increased my dose, like I did with the pain pills? How do I go without it on the days I don't take it, unlike opiates? The answer is because it has a low potential for abuse. Sure, there are some people who will abuse anything, but you don't go banning other substances because some people don't know how to be responsible. How is alcohol still legal when it kills so many people and destroys health/lives? Why is nicotine legal when it also damages health and is HIGHLY addictive? But, yet you want to ban an herbal substance that saves lives instead of takes lives? \nIt saddens me to think of all the people whose lives will change for the worse, including my own, if Kratom is banned. I can't help but be saddened about the increase in suicides and opiate deaths that will occur if this ban goes into effect.  This plant needs to be left alone. People need to be educated on how to properly use it. Personal responsibility is key here. The typical person who takes Kratom is a law abiding middle aged, senior citizen, or veteran, so put an age limit, like alcohol or cigarettes to keep kids away, but do not ban.. There is too much at stake. Thank you for your time. Please hear our voices...education and responsibility is what needs to happen in this case, not prohibition.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4269","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alissa Gregorius","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There is nothing harmful about Kratom.

I am not a criminal, no criminal record, and i'm a tax payer. I have been to multiple rehab facilities totaling a 1/4 of a million dollars in cost and been on over 100 psychiatric medications. I discovered Kratom about a year back, and my life and been turned around. \n\nAfter discovering Kratom for my psychiatric issues and chronic pain I suffer, i was able to drop 4 different psychiatric medications that had an arsenal of side effects. I remember the first time i took this medication and felt the mental and physical relief, i remember crying. I thought, thank god Eric you made it this far, this medication will help you be normal and move forward in life. I've been using Kratom for over a year now, daily user, and my life hasn't been better. Great work relationships and especially with my family. My father looks at me proud for the first time in years. I need this medication and it would be a travesty if this medication is to become illegal. \n\nWe have an epidemic of opiate and opiod abuse in the US right now. Around 1/7 people take opiates or opiods in 2016, which is staggering. People are dying every 19 minutes now from opiate or opiod problems. Don't we want to put a dent in that? Much less from a cheap natural supplement with no CNS depression? Here in the US, a lot of miraculous changes have happened in this November alone, landslide election and the fall of the tyranny of elitist. The people are now being remembered in the US, the normal blue collar people like myself and my family. Don't let me perish because we want to bureaucratic and fast track a miracle drug because we don't know anything about it.

I have been disabled for around five years now due to my debilitating pain and the overwhelming depression that comes with it. I have been on every type of opiate you can name. They all  stop working for my pain after about 8 mths and the dosage has to be increased to a dangerous level to give me any kind of relief. While on opiates I am unable to drive and have horrible side effects such as aggression, paranoia, withdrawal and many more. Opiates have caused me to accidentally overdose and be rushed to the hospital multiple times. I finally just gave up on getting any relief from any pharmaceutical and came off of everything.\n After being off all medication I was in so much pain I could hardly get around my home, feed myself or groom myself. I was basically bed ridden. That's when I decided to try Kratom because I had nothing to loose. After 15 mins of trying 1 tsp of Kratom in my tea I felt immediate relief. My chronic eye pain and blurry vision seemed to almost disappear. Next I noticed the heavy fog of depression that almost made me suicidal lifted and I started to have some positive thoughts. Following that I realized my constant nerve pain down my right leg and in my pelvis was reduced to the point where I could move around a bit. Lastly, my mind felt less cluttered, my crippling anxiety let up a bit and I felt like being as productive as I could. After 5 years of being bed ridden from excruciating pain, severely depressed and dealing with horrible anxiety, I finally felt some relief!!! It wasn't a total fix. My pain is still there and it's still debilitating but it took the edge off. So for the DEA to say it has no medicinal use is totally bogus.\n\nNow as for the side effects let me tell you what I experienced (since I know side effects very well). If I have more than a tea spoon I may get a headache and feel jittery, as if I had more than 3 cups of coffee and once I got mildly nauseous. NO physical or mental withdrawal if I don't have it. NONE. Would you like me to list the side effects I have had from Percocet, oxycodone, methadone, Suboxone, Lyrica, fentanyl, morphine, tramadol, baclofen and the many more mediations I have been on to control my nerve damage? I will tell you they range from overdosing to debilitating migraines to suicidal thoughts. Please hear my desperate plea to you as to not take away the little relief I have. \n\nI understand that you want to get rid of Kratom because of Big Pharma. However please consider a few things first. \n\n#1 it is NOT a mind altering drug!!  It reduces pain and gives u a slight boost in energy. But it does not give you horrible thoughts or hallucinations. There is NO \"high\". It only makes u clear headed.\n\n#2 Drug companies should recommend using Kratom with their medications. Kratom I have found will reduce some bad side effects of the pharmaceuticals. Such as depression and foggy headedness and fatigue.\n\n#3 There is NO way you can overdose on Kratom and the DEA knows this. If I tried to overdose on Kratom I would throw it up within 20 mins. You know this, that's what makes me lose faith in the DEA. You are lying to people saying this is dangerous and people have died from it. Please  don't become part of the oligarchy system. Consider the suffering people first not the big cooperations. That's what the DEA is there for right? To keep us safe? Well Kratom will keep society much safer by helping people with chronic pain take less mind altering opiates.\n\n#4 Think about the veteran's with PTSD. My friend has a purple heart from the Iraq war and he says Kratom saved his life. It helps people who are so riddled with social anxiety to become a functional part of society again. \n\n#5 There are NO withdrawals!! In fact it helps people get off of addicting substances but then again you already know this.\n\n #6 READ THIS! I hate marijuana! It makes my pain WORSE and it has horrible mind altering effects on me. I can not drive a car or function while on marijuana. Kratom has none of the mind altering effects marijuana has! You feel exactly the same after Kratom but just with some pain, depression and fatigue relief. You also do not build up a tolerance which means to get pain relief you do not need to increase your dose overtime.\n\nThere are so many more points I can lay out but I fear you, big pharma and the FDA have already made up your minds. You will turn Kratom into a hard to get, expensive item, if you can not ban it altogether. I will be forced to go back on and play games with dangerous opiates just so I can get mild temporary relief. Please prove me wrong. Please show us Kratom users that you care about us and that you know it's a harmless herbal medicine. Show us you understand marijuana is a much more dangerous plant than Kratom.

I am 61 years old, and diagnosed with an Auto-immune disease. The type is yet to be determined. I had a bone-marrow biopsy yesterday. The symptoms are constant exhaustion, physical pain and a feeling of true sickness from within that leaves one with only one desire, and that is to stay in bed. Motivation does not exist. Everything hurts all the time. It's not possible to work. It's scary and it's bad. Without the availability of Kratom I would be In a constant state of physical pain and living on credit cards. Because I am able to access and use Kratom, I am able to go to the store, make doctors appointments, work, and continue earning money. Not as much as if I were not sick, but it's something. The physchologocal and physical rewards the come to me from the use of this simple leaf are miraculous and I would be lost without it. For those who have not tried this leaf: the effects are no where close to being \"high\". It simply has a way of dulling pain without intoxicatiom and adding a mood life that is similar to coffee. That's it. With regard to dependence, I do not find myself using more all the time. I have stopped a few times and the experience is kind of like stopping coffee.  Please do not ban this leaf.

Therefore, not only the future health outcomes for Americans, but my job and my well-being are threatened by the prospect of your decision.\n\nGiven that I live in a country which shares the United States' over-prescription of legal opioid painkillers, and that these intense drugs are both legal and well-researched, I find the proposed scheduling, and thus the effective banning of the kratom without any comparable body of scientific research or evidence of harm to be obscene, hypocriticial, ridiculous and depressing. You invite ridicule, if not anger for your incompetence.\n\nIndividuals in the United States and the western world are being confronted by two acute problems: the opioid crisis (driven by high unemployment and the lack of safe, legal and low-intensity opioid and opioid-like substances) and better options for the treatment of chronic pain (which 10-50% of all people suffer from some form thereof).\n\nIt seems to me that banning kratom, without sufficient research, or sufficient evidence of danger compared to the various pharmaceutical and recreational drugs we already use legally to reduce pain (i.e. prescription painkillers and alcohol) will be immensely harmful, counterproductive and wasteful on both the above fronts. Additionally, you will likely drive underground the importation and distribution of kratom, both marginalizing and oppressing those who find it a suitable means of pain relief or recreation, and wasting taxpayer money on the confiscation of the substance and incarceration of those involved in the economy. This destroys the possibility of legal, well-paying businesses that distribute kratom like the one I work for existing in your country, and a ridiculous war on psychoactive substances that are tamer than alcohol.\n\nI would strongly encourage you not to schedule the active ingredients of kratom, and thus to save yourself a world of crime, wasted money, and actual, literal pain.\n\nSincerely,\nMartin Law","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19106","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Martin Law","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please research this plant/checmical before placing it as a scheduled I drug. our policies make it almost impossible to reclassify once its placed there.

I vehemently oppose the DEA's action to place kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.\n\nI have suffered clinically diagnosed anxiety since childhood. I have abused drugs and alcohol in the past to fight the crippling physical symptoms of this anxiety. Though I do all the things I am supposed to do, take Zoloft, exercise, etc., these symptoms can still overwhelm me. The feeling is a combination of heart attack-like symptoms, racing heart, tight chest, and nausea that can last for eight hours a day, day after day. \n\nI started using kratom occasionally about two years ago in an effort to fight this pain. Over the last year, due to a variety of life events, my anxiety went through the roof. I began drinking hard liquor during the day, at work, while driving, and hiding it from my husband. It was the only way I could stop the physical terror and get through my day. My marriage and my health began to falter. \n\nI began to take kratom daily during this time. It was like a miracle. It gave me what I call a \"calm energy,\" like coffee without the jitters. I no longer needed to drink, and began to excel again at my job. My marriage survived, but barely. \n\nI have never gotten \"high\" from kratom, and I have much experience with that state. I get though the day, work hard, no side effects. I stop on weekends and have no withdrawal symptoms. \n\nWhy the DEA would want to ban an herb that helps tens of thousands of people with pain, anxiety, and addiction issues, with no research to support the ban, is beyond me. Unless there is a monetary advantage for the government, it is inexplicable and un-American. Do you want us all to go back to driving drunk and shooting heroin? \n\nSincerely\n\nLisa Janssen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17382","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lisa Janssen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I developed sciatica from dead lifting in the gym.

I will start with myself, I am disabled. I have depression, severe anxiety, ADHD, scoliosis and severe back pain, migraines, and frequent pain in my hips, knees, and hands. I am trying to recover my health in the hopes one day I can get off disability and provide for my family on my own. I am using kratom to aid in this goal. Normally my pain would leave me bedridden for at least half the days out of a week, By taking kratom, I am able to be out of bed almost every day.  Since taking it I have had no anxiety and very little depression, and my ADHD has been under control, with many days of clear and focused thought. I never thought I'd have the focus to even sit down and type something like this up! I was able to clean my house for my family for thanksgiving, and not crumble under social anxiety, we had a lovely holiday. \n\nThis stuff helps so much, and there's nothing dangerous about it. And I most certainly don't get high, or anything that would equate to any other scheduled drug. I've taken a bit too much of it before back when I first started using it, and I got a headache and nausea. That nausea was more than enough to keep me from taking any more. I have experienced no other side effects from taking this. I've been prescribed many things for my conditions, all with terrible side effects worse than the conditions themselves. I ultimately quit all of them because any relief that they mostly didn't actually provide wasn't worth the torture the side effects induced.\n\nMy fiance's story with prescriptions is similar. He has extremely severe ADD/ADHD. He was put through a gamut of prescriptions including many experimental ones as a kid. The side effects were horrible, and he was told the side effects would not get better, he would simply have to get used to them. Faced with having to chose between all the trouble his condition was getting him into in school and the side effects, he began to contemplate ending his life instead. No child should ever have a reason to contemplate suicide, especially when his condition could have been relieved with kratom and none of the side effects that were ruining his life. He now takes kratom with me, and he has been so relieved that he has broken down crying in joy. Kratom being scheduled would be devastating for him.\n\nKratom has changed both of our lives so much for the better, and I see such strong potential for it to help and even save the lives of others. I believe the benefits far outweigh the almost non existent risks. At most, regulate and throw a tax on it, but please do not ban it. If alcohol and cigarettes are legal and both proven lethal, banning kratom would be a joke.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7334","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-26T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brooke Williams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban kratom. \n\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it. \t\n\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose. \t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19594","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Inda","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement\nkratom.

I am 24 years old, with a mechanical engineering degree. I have suffered from chronic muscular and neuropathic pain for over two years now from an unknown cause after a surgery. After my pain developed, I was put through all of the traditional medicine regimens: painkillers, anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, nerve blocks, steroid injections, muscle relaxers, physical therapy, allergy analysis, complete bloodwork, MRI, Xrays, ect. I was on high strength narcotics, muscle relaxers and, anti-inflammatories for about 2 years as per my doctor recommendations. The damage that this regime has done to my body has severely impacted my life. I can no longer take any of these drugs due to the gastrointestinal discomfort I experience, not to mention what it does to my mental state. It is very difficult to be an engineer and focus while under the influence of those drugs. Over the past year I have phased out all prescription drugs from my life and I am on a completely herbal plan. I feel so much better I cannot describe it. I can take kratom and significantly reduce my pain with little to no negative side effects. I feel almost like myself again. I am able to go out into the world and take part in things I have extreme difficulty doing otherwise, such as driving, social events, and walks. Kratom kills my pain and makes me feel motivated to be active in my life. The combination of prescription medications before made me feel like I was a zombie, along with not effectively treating my pain. Another reason kratom should not be scheduled is that no matter how much I or anyone I know has ever taken, no one has been hurt from kratom. The worst thing that will happen is you throw up and then your fine. The drugs I was prescribed could have easily killed me or addicted me for the rest of my life. i could have accidently taken too much or the wrong combination of drugs and died. I cannot imagine not having this plant in my life to manage my pain, it is extremely distressing because I do not have any real alternatives that will fulfill the function with the same effect on my body as kratom.

At age 14 I was in a serious car accident that left my body mangled. The doctors gave me morphine and hydrocodone, until I was released from the hospital.  But my young brain went from months on morphine to one prescription pill a day. I found ways to get a hold of cocaine and oxycodone from my school mates. By 16 I was physiologically addicted to steadily increasing doses of methadone and had tried just about every pharmaceutical opioid prescribed in North America. During my 17th year of life I was using 800mg/day of Oxycontin (400mg 2x/day in the form of crushed and parachuted Oxycontin 80s) or 200-250mg/day of methadone. I ran a lucrative online business that allowed me to fund such a large habit. The oxycontin alone cost me at least $500 a day. \n\nShortly after I turned 18, after almost 3 years of constant opioid (ab)use, my family packed up and moved back to my home state of Pennsylvania. I ended up living in a shoddy Florida Best Western hotel room for a few weeks, spending days in an agonizing cold-turkey 250mg/day methadone withdrawal due to the impact that the sudden collapse of the stock market had on my business. Most definitely one of the worst periods of my life. Under pressure from my family I took a Greyhound bus to Pennsylvania and moved in with my father. I arrived there with 20 ten mg methadone pills in my pocket, no cash to my name, no connections, and an incomprehensible 200mg+/day methadone habit to support. The methadone I had lasted me two days. \n\nAfter a week of agony, spirit crushing insomnia and depression, I broke. Dressed in all black and sporting a pair of women's sunglasses, I rode a bicycle to a pharmacy with the intention of holding it up. I had a note that said 'i have a gun. give me all the oxycontin, morphine, methadone, and dilaudid and nobody gets hurt.' Luckily for me a wheelchair bound elderly woman was blocking my access to the pharmacy counter. I was approached by the store manager and told to leave after 10 minutes of conspicuously staking out the pharmacy area while waiting for the old woman to leave. Discouraged and on the verge of suicide, I bicycled my way back home. \n\nI frantically searched the internet for something that would end this madness. In a moment of elucidation, I remembered reading about things like ibogaine that could help people cure addictions, but the DEA has banned that without complete research.  So I stumbled upon an herb called 'kratom' that was being studied for its potential as an alternative to methadone for people addicted to opioids. I quickly found an online vendor who sold kratom extract and promptly made an order. \n\nThe kratom arrived the next day. I hastily tore apart the cardboard envelope like a small child would the wrapping on a Christmas present. I measured out 3 times the 'normal' dose, dumped the rancid tea smelling powder into a cup of water, stirred, and chugged. The mixture was very bitter and coarse, what one might expect drinking a mixture of sawdust and water to taste and feel like. After rinsing out my mouth I sat at a chair with my head down and waited. Within 30 minutes I felt 100 percent better. Such an overwhelming relief and serenity. I wasn't high but I was no longer desperately ill. Immediately I head upstairs to my room and took a long much needed nap. I awoke feeling like a new person. An answer to all my problems, this brown powder. \n\nShortly thereafter I was ordering new shipments of kratom extract every few days. The kratom never gave me an opiate high. It gave me back my ability to sleep and function. It served as a mood stabilizer, and kept me out of withdrawal. And most importantly, it stopped that next pill from going down my throat. It was a life saver. Because today I'm free of everything. Even the kratom.\n\nPlease allow research to continue on this herb. The DEA has a duty to get dangerous drugs off the street, but it neglects the most important part of ending drug abuse; rehabilitation of drug addicts. These solutions aren't in the laboratories at Big Pharma.  they're on the streets right alongside the drugs themselves. They're natural, and they work. Please do your part to build a better world.  Stop telling people that drug addiction is someone else's problem. Help us help ourselves.  \n\nIf every drug abuser is a criminal, and a dreg of society, then I guess I screwed up by telling you my story. And I guess my words hold no meaning to whomever finds themself having to scan this wall of text. But, if there is anyone out there willing to listen to a recovered addict, please take a step in the right direction. Make a commitment to abolish addiction by encouraging the study and legalization of known cures.  I was a young punk; methadone didn't scare me, it just fed my addiction.  But a plant helped me cure it.  Take a stand with us dregs of society.  Take a stand towards a better world.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9959","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Bauerschmidt II","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I feel like Kratom is less dangerous than any other substances\nLike heroine.

In 2011 I suffered a lower back injury while I was moving a dresser in my parents home. My Doctor sent me to physical therapy and prescribed opiate painkillers. After a 6 week round of physical therapy my back pain had not improved so I continued taking the pain medication my Doctor had prescribed. My physical therapist concluded that my back pain had failed to resolve itself because I suffer from scoliosis and one of my legs is 1 1/2\" shorter than the other one. This has the effect of pulling my back in 2 different directions. I continued taking the pain medication until 2014 when the narcotic laws changed and my doctor could no longer prescribe it. I spent the next year in chronic pain. I learned of Kratom when it was featured on the Dr. Phil Show and decided to order some. Immediately after starting a Kratom regimine by back pain was diminished and I realized that Kratom would be very therapeutic for reducing my pain level. Please do not proceed with your plan to schedule Kratom as a narcotic. Many people will suffer as a result of this. They will no longer be able to perform their daily tasks. The people who are taking this herb are not a bunch of drugged out hippies. We are responsible, fully functioning members of society who mostly range between 40-60 years of age. We do not want to lose our right to manage our pain through means other than prescription medication. Many of us have found Kratom to be a viable alternative to other prescriptions. Our lives have become more manageable as a result of Kratom. Thank You for taking the time to review my concern.

Fogal\nAge: 45\nProfession: Licensed Physical Therapist Assistant\n\nI am writing to state my opposition to the DEA putting Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.\n\nI have always been somewhat aware of the side of effects of the over-use of OTC pain medication (Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, Naproxen Sodium) but disregarded the warnings because of the all too prevalent \"It won't happen to me\" attitude.  Now my own father is in the early stages of kidney disease due to his over use of Ibuprofen.  This seemingly innocent & mundane drug is *not* as harmless as it seems.  My prescription migraine medication costs me $10 per pill, and that's *with* insurance.   Although Relpax is effective in relieving my migraine pain, the side effects are, at times, debilitating.\n\nI started using Kratom in the summer of 2016 after being introduced to it by my partner, Donny Thompson.  I am a migraine headache sufferer.  I also am prone to back aches brought on by the occasional lapse in using proper body mechanics in my line of work.\nI was eager to find an alternative to the  side effects, delayed relief, and, let's face it, the *cost* of both OTC & Prescription pain medication.  I was so pleased with the results.  My pain was relieved, and I experienced absolutely no side effects from using Kratom.  I was not nauseous or jittery.  I had no dizziness, I was not tired, nor was I anxious about the prospect of running out of my medication.  My insurance only allows me six (6) Relpax tablets every 30 days.  So if I were to require more than 6 doses of it, I was out of luck.  There is no such worry with Kratom.\n\nIn my opinion Kratom should remain available to anyone who wishes to use it for its pain relieving properties.   The Kratom vendors from whom I have ordered the product have shown themselves to be reliable, trustworthy, and ethical in every way.  The product I have purchased from them has been of the highest quality & has been so very helpful to both my partner & to me.  I use it in small amounts when I am having physical pain.  Even more important, when I feel a migraine headache coming on, the Kratom I use **relieves my pain.**\n\nPlease do not make Kratom a schedule 1 controlled substance.  It is so vital to the quality of life for so many of us.  It does not have the documented side effects or addictive properties that *all* opiates have & it is financially accessible.  And the Kratom community has proven itself to be a very, very well self-regulated one.\n\nThank you for your time & your attention to my comments.\n\nSincerely yours, \n\nAlicia J.

I had an extensive physical a few years ago and all my blood work came back fantastic. I turned to kratom for a mild means of controlling anxiety and stress. I work everyday, I have not taken vacation in 4 years. I am perfect proof that kratom (pure dried and ground mitragyna speciosa leaf) is not addictive in any destructive and compulsive way. In light of the notice of intent and the stark prospect of the DEA and FDA ever seeing the light, I started to drastically reduce my kratom use. After making the decision I cut my daily amount by half going from around 20g to 10g with only tiredness resulting. \n\nKratom is NOT lethal in any reasonably consumable amount, my attached scientific study confirms this. No lethal dose could be determined. The study's highest dose was 2000mg (2g) per kg of body weight... the study was performed on rats. To scale that to humans it would be 6.5 OUNCES for a 200lb man such as myself. MIND YOU THIS IS A STUDY PERFORMED WITH A STANDARDIZED EXTRACT... NOT LEAF MATERIAL.  \nhttp://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jps/article/view/15188/13461\n\nI believe it to be an inalienable right for man to consume naturally occurring plants. \n\nI have stressed about what life will be like without kratom since it has helped me so much. I have also  witnessed it helping others with MUCH more serious life issues, such as withdraw symptoms and chronic pain like Fibromyalgia etc... \n\nI am more concerned for them than myself. \n\nI am not a drug abuser.... I use an herb. Furthermore if proving a drug causes death is grounds for scheduling it then why with all the scientific studies proving smoking kills people they are still available at every store? \n\nI don't take issue with banning the possession of the pure alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine.... \nI only wish to keep the pure leaf material unregulated or added to GRAS similar to other supplements like Kava root etc... \nHowever its very unlikely any layman could extract the pure alkaloids so maybe we leave those to the scientists to study since there are many studies showing kratom's potential as a medical treatment for a host of ailments. \n\nThanks for your time. \n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11138","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cody Thompson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Donna Hall. ..I am 44 yrs old. ..I have been using kratom for 3-4 years...I suffer with spinal stenosis and pre menstrual symptoms. .I get extreme back aches..and pms symptoms that cause cramps,sore feet,extreme fatigue and bouts of depression. ..all these symptoms hold me back fro keeping up with my two kids and my house work. ..kratom helps in relieving these symptoms naturally with no side effects. .I can get up and get the things done that I need to do for the day...please keep this innocent plant legal. .it helps me so much!!!...I do appreciate your concern however this plant is extremely harmless. ..Thank you for taking the time to read my story. ...","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7654","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Donna Hall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 30something \"young professional.\" I work a high paced, high stress job where I have to constantly interact with clients.

On the other hand opiate narcotics obviously work better than over the counter pain relief, but they are dangerous and extremely addictive. Kratom is a safer more natural choice that diminishes body pain and or chronic pain.  People have been taking kratom around the world for millennia now with almost zero adverse effects. If kratom had been in this country before 1994 this would be a non issue and would be considered one of the best supplements for pain, anxiety, energy, sleep apnea, and many more.

I'd like to start by stating that I without a doubt oppose the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.  For me Kratom acts similar to a strong glass of green tea (energy boost/mild euphoria), yet also miraculously tames my chronic pain.  I started using kratom back in 2012 when my life seemed to hit rock bottom.  I've had multiple knee and shoulder surgeries which have led to some chronic arthritis issues.  From about 2010-2012 I was on the merry-go-round of alcohol, then prescription pain meds, then suboxone to get off the pain meds, then back to alcohol to get off the suboxone....and so on and so on.  A bad 4th of July night lead to me getting a DUI that forced me to reevaluate my life and stop everything.  The problem was the chronic pain would not subside even with round the clock Tylenol etc.  Then one day I found out about kratom and read and researched for weeks.  It seemed to good to be true, but the way I described it above is exactly how it has been for me going on 4+ years now.  The best part is unlike pain meds I don't have to continually jack up my dose.  I still get the same benefits from a tsp as I did when I started.  Kratom has also subsequently helped me rise out of my pain induced depression so I can feel alive everyday.  Even if it's not the cure it certainly manages pain better (and safer) than anything else currently available.

As I sit here writing this I have two friends od just thus week alone from heroin !(so sad) I have been a Kratom user for four years and I am scared to death if the ban goes threw. In 2008 I was In a skiing accident I thought doctors had my best interest in mind it took some time to realize I was wrong. I knew nothing about pain pills and how addictive they were I became physically dependent and very quickly my life spiraled downhill Into a nightmare to say the least! I have never personally took one pill that helped with multiple things. In fact if I were to go to a doctor and tell them everything I needed to be treated for I would either have to take at least ten medications or the doctor would not help and I would be forced to live a miserable life! Kratom has made such as difference for the ones who love me unconditionally and for myself. I have suffered from alot of things from about the age of 12 starting with mensteral craps so severally, also suffered from what I can tell to be restless leg syndrome  but it affects the whole right side of my body making it impossible to sleep, aswell I have irritable bowel syndrome it makes it very hard to leave the house for any amount of time. In the last eight or so years as my life spiraled downhill I have severe anxiety and depression, depression meds do not work for me I have tried at least 10 different ones and the side effects are unreal and the bad out weighs the good by far. I know Kratom has saved my life it help with every symptom I have and since Kratom my life is for once again spiraling UPWARD!

I was listening to a pod cast that Joe Rogan had on Chris Bell and he was talking about kratom and how it is natural and non addictive but also takes away pain. This is just what I need cause I am destroying my body with pain pills. I am going to educate myself on kratom and hope that it doesn't become illegal  cause this is a natural plant that can help help people like myself.\n  Thanks for listening","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11940","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Do not ban Kratom.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22078","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For once listen to science and people.

T. , 37, Computer Network Administrator \n\nI believe that Kratom is not deserving of any type of control or ban. It has been used for many years therapeutically and is part of humanities natural homeopathic heritage. Its long term usage through history, as well as the MANY studies (contrary to what the DEA is claiming, there are many studies.) about its effectiveness for certain purposes do not warrant control or banning, especially not within the scope of law. \n\nI started using Kratom several years ago on a whim to break free of a cycle of dependence on GHB. Not only have I found complete success in treating my own addiction, Kratom also gave me almost complete freedom from lower back pain and helps me to self treat my ADHD. I am able to concentrate and exist relatively pain free without having to depend on the difficult, expensive and time consuming healthcare system.\n\nKratom has given me a safe and effective way to take control of my life including management from pain, stress, anxiety, depression. Putting controls on this plant is tantamount to condemnation on reliance on third party sources for my own personal issues, and therefore a restriction on freedom to live my life as I choose, pain free, happy and functional.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7430","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 39 year father and husband.

Until recently (the last 5 years) I was in constant pain, depression and addiction to pain killers (Dr. prescribed addiction). As you can probably imagine, after 10 years of this constant struggle, I was pretty fed up. I decided enough was enough. My life was over and I saw no reason to continue it. Fortunately a friend in the medical industry suggested I try Kratom. \n\nI was one of those lucky millions who were put on OxyContin for long term, chronic pain. It was a drug constantly in my system for close to ten years. To be clear. I'm not positioning this statement in order to place blame on western medicine. I am very grateful for modern medicine and I am thankful for the many extra years it has given me. An injury such as mine 100 years ago, would have killed me. With that said, however, modern medicine wasn't helping me enough. At least not to the point where I had a full, happy and healthy life.\n\nWhen my friend suggested Kratom to me I was nervous because I was equating it to narcotic pain killers. Which I can confirm, it is nothing like. In any way, shape or form.  \n\nI would love to tell you my depression disappeared immediately after Kratom was introduced to me. Or that I stopped taking all narcotic pain killers. There are still days I'm depressed, because I know my limits are different than other people in their 20s. And there are days I still take prescription painkillers. However, with Kratom, I am able to get up in the morning. I can fulfill my responsibilities, take care of those around me go to work. Thus giving me the luxury to give back to society, via taxes and partially funding several charities. \n\nAlthough Kratom is not a drug and it's not an opioid, it has given me the ability to drop my narcotic intake from multiple times a day, to a few times per month. Addiction is no longer a fear of mine and I'm not afraid of leaving the house without my prescription pain killers. \n\nHere is some information I'm sure you already know, but I want to reiterate it. From thousands of years of use in Asia and decades in the West. No long term, negative side effects  have ever been found related to Kratom use alone. There has also never been a case of true addiction related to Kratom (when Kratom is the only substance in a persons body). This is both supported and proven with my own life and those around me. \n\nFor example, after 10 years of OxyContin (and its generics) I was thoroughly addicted. Keep in mind. I was not abusing it. I was simply addicted, as predicted by my doctors. Then comes Kratom. I decide to stop taking OxyContin day one and switch to Kratom. After a month of Kratom use and no narcotics, I wanted to test it's true tendencies for addiction. Move forward another week. Without Kratom, or anything else, I was fine. From personal experience, I can guarantee caffeine withdrawal is much, much worse :/\n\nIn summary, Kratom gives me and millions others, hope. It has lifted my mood and shown me there are answers other than prescription narcotics. As many universities, researchers and doctors have said, we MUST dedicate time, money and research to Kratom development. Schedule 1 classification stops research. It might not \"technically\" stop it, but the hurdles schedule 1 creates are far too big for almost anyone or institution to overcome. \n\nThe benefits far outweigh any legitimate or illegitimate negative consequences. We must not stand in the way of potential medical advances that could save lives today and in the future.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16319","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Dill","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I just felt I should say I see no problem with kratom.

There will never be a human for which the need of pain-killers does not exist. There will never be a person who is free from, at some point, the physical or emotional   requirement of relief. \n\nIf you make Kratom illegal, you are the reason that those without means are forced to satisfy that need by the most harmful means available to them. If no other means are available, YOU are the reason our society can not tell those individuals there is a healthy, fully-available path to relief.\n\nWe are SICK of nothing better to tell these people than to beg the medical establishment for a prescription they cannot afford. KEEP KRATOM LEGAL so we can turn them to a substance without the possibility of overdose, without the possibility of lifetime-dependence even with months or years of use. MAKE IT POSSIBLE for our society to keep them off the dangerous drugs for which all acknowledge there is a public need for some regulation. COMMON SENSE.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12758","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Robey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA:   I'm writing to add my voice to those who beseech you not to add kratom to your Shedule 1 list. For years now, since a divorce in 2008, I have suffered with debilitating depression that lays me out in a dark room completely lost and hopeless. A couple of years back, I stumbled across kratom on the internet. By this time I had been taking anti-depressants for four years without any help, just the undesirable side-effects.\n\nKratom literally restored my life to me.

I feel that Kratom should remain legal as it has been a huge benefactor in getting my life back. In 2012, following a hit and run accident that left me hospitalized and in need of physical therapy, I was placed on opiates for pain management. As a result of the accident, I live with chronic pain. While the pain medication prescribed helped at the time, they could only go so far, and as a result I was taken off of them with no understanding of how to ween myself from opiate addiction, or how to deal with the chronic pain from the trauma I suffered in the accident. After discovering Kratom, I have been able to get my life back. I have been able to manage my pain, while becoming a productive member of society, going back to school and obtaining my Degree, all while raising a family. If Kratom were to be placed in schedule 1 status, I know that it would greatly diminish my quality of life, and while I am only speaking for myself, but I am sure my family will be affected as a result. I cannot imagine how many others have encountered situations similar to mine, and share the same boat as me. \n\nPlease, consider the people that will be affected in your decision.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20837","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mercede Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Daniel VanDeKerkhove. \nI am a Federal Law Enforcement Officer (U.S. Customs and Border Protection). \nI also serve as an elected Trustee for the local municipality in which I live. \nI am married and am the proud father of a 2-year old son, with another on the way. \nI have never used, nor have any interest in the personal use of nor distribution of Kratom.\n\nNevertheless...\n\nI urge you to *NOT* add Kratom to the list of Schedule I Drug.\n\nPlacing Kratom on the list of Schedule I Drugs would be an enormous disservice to the American People, and would go against all rational analysis of the myriad of facts, stats, and patient testimonials that clearly show just how harmless [and yet positively life-changing] this herb truly is to so many of our citizens.  \n\nKratom has been used for thousands of years to treat a multitude of different illnesses, ailments, and conditions including: Chronic Pain, Depression, Anxiety, Opiate Dependence, Fatigue, Stress, and even Diabetes. \nIt's reported by patients, doctors, and researchers alike to be More Effective and come with Far Less-Plentiful And Less-Severe Side Effects than many much more costly prescription drugs, and is virtually non-addictive...(*which is why the pharmaceutical companies are pushing hard to ban it, plain and simple*). \n\nPlease cut through the hype that lobbyists are trying to sell to you - think logically about the side effects which they are blowing out of proportion, and see that they are the Exact Same Side Effects that people get from COFFEE (agitated temper, achy muscles, listlessness, tremors. Sound familiar?)... Interesting to note that Kratom and coffee plants are actually in the same [Rubiaceae] family within the plant kingdom.\nThe only \"kratom-related\" deaths (less than 20, in a 2-year span) were actually instances in which *Other Dangerous Illegal Substances* [such as cocaine] were also present...a genuinely dishonest stretch to imply that kratom was anything more than a side-note in those cases!\n\nThrough personal relationships I have made in my [small-town] community, I can personally attest to the accounts of two upstanding citizens I know who use Kratom when-needed to treat chronic pain, stress, and anxiety. They credit it with turning their lives around in ways prescription drugs never could, with none of the side effects. \nThe one I know most closely is a well-respected father-of-two who is an active and cherished member in the community, who is recently recovering from a long-fought battle with cancer. He was In Tears when he heard that the DEA was going to schedule Kratom. He truly doesn't know what he'll do to treat his pain if the DEA bans it; he's tried everything else - and spent far more money doing so - with no success! Taking away kratom would literally turn his and his-family's lives upside down, all over again.\n\nCategorizing Kratom as a Schedule I Drug would be on-par with the absurdity of likewise placing cannabis on that same list. As you're aware, 28 states [and our capital city of Washington D.C.] have legalized cannabis. This means that a majority of the states in our Union have now recognized the legitimacy of medicinal cannabis, and/or have gone farther in recognizing that the herb is indeed harmless enough that its recreational use should be protected by law. Millions of Americans agree - from doctors to plumbers, teachers to celebrities - cannabis saves lives, and improves the lives of many more. \nAnd So Does Kratom. \n\nBut now the DEA - pushed by Big-Monied Pharmaceutical Companies who cannot patent and thus lock-in profits on this natural herb - is considering the placement of Kratom on the same list of Schedule I Drugs as cannabis. The American People and the great States of This Union have already rejected the DEA's demonization of cannabis, and are firmly aware of the agenda now pushing for the same erroneous labeling of Kratom. \n\nSuch an act would be a shock to the conscious of Americans everywhere, and would lead to an outrage and distrust of the DEA by the American People; it truly would undermine the very efforts of law enforcement who work day and night to  remove *Actual* dangerous drugs from our streets, as their authority would be viewed as illegitimate, and they would be seen as nothing more than henchmen of Big Pharma [...further crippling public relations between law enforcement and the public who they serve]. \nPlease don't create that sort of environment for our Police.\n\nClassifying Kratom as a Schedule I drug would be a giant step backwards for the health and wellness of the citizens of this Great Nation, and would immeasurably hinder legitimate law enforcement efforts everywhere. Please do not let big-monied interests block access to this affordable and legitimate health supplement that millions of Americans rely on. \n\nThank You,\nDaniel VanDeKerkhove","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5232","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel VanDeKerkhove","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There are very clear medical benefits to this plant.

I was hopelessly addicted to the drug that was supposed to get me off opioids, suboxone, for approximately 2 years when I first heard about kratom. I decided I had nothing to lose so I gave it a shot. It was and is a miracle for me. I was able to ween myself off of suboxone due to taking kratom. I found that kratom reduced my opioid withdrawal symptoms to a manageable level. Within 2 months of starting kratom I was completely off of opioids. Now I take kratom for my spinal pain and I want you to know that It does not impair me or get me \"high\" in any way.

I'm also highly sensitive to pills and have horrible drug reactions so it is not an option for me. \n\nI still struggle with the muscle/joint cramping and a doctor had told me it was most likely restless leg syndrome yet no cure was recommended other than management by prescriptions that were hard on the liver. I've taken kratom for 5 years with ZERO liver problems.\n\nFor all the years I've been using kratom, it has not interfered with my ability to be a wife, mother or business owner. In fact, it has HELPED me get my life back. This plant has helped millions for centuries. It is NOT a drug but a healing plant with medicinal properties. If kratom is taken away from me, I will suffer physically and emotionally and so will my family. \n\nPlease keep kratom legal. The impact of making it illegal will be devastating to me and my family.

After a work-related accident and numerous back surgeries left me with debilitating pain, I was forced into the nightmare of addiction to prescription pain medications.  I am certain that the doctors meant no harm and, for a while, the medications were effective.  However, over time the effectiveness of the drugs diminished and, like many, I was forced to higher and higher dosages which eventually made my quality of life miserable.  After nearly a decade in that hopeless cycle I found an alternative that allows me to function normally and maintain employment without the harsh effects of prescription pain medications.  That alternative, for me, was kratom.  It has been nothing short of life-saving for me as I am free from the effects of prescription narcotics with a very manageable pain level.  I can't imagine, for the life of me why, despite overwhelming scientific evidence and first hand testimony of a multitude of Americans in support of kratom's safety and efficacy, the DEA is trying to classify this TRADITIONAL TEA LEAF as a Schedule 1 drug.  This ruling would effectively turn myself and many other Americans using this plant into felons overnight costing taxpayers millions while obliterating current federal research on the plant.  Overwhelming evidence, thousands of years of use, and my own experience leads me to believe that kratom is a safe alternative to prescription opiates with important medicinal uses and has changed the lives of so many Americans including myself.  I fear this action by the DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic by effectively casting them back into the current opioid and heroin epidemic.  Please keep in mind that, according to published reports, there is absolutely no evidence that kratom poses a danger to personal or public safety when used responsibly.  I fear that this re-scheduling effort will force me back into an addiction and life that will be devastating to myself and my family.  Trust me.  I do not wish that feeling of hopelessness and despair on anyone.  Especially those who suffer from legitimate pain issues and have no other recourse but to resume the addiction nightmare.  I would also be very interested to know how much influence the big drug companies have on this decision.  I am sorry for the length of this comment but I feel that my, and my family's, situation will become desperate.  Again, please reconsider this course of action.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it!

Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...  It uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.  http://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...

U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.  http://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

One month of heroin use is far more dangerous and addictive than Kratom. To move it into the same bracket would undermine it's potential. With it placed less restrictively more studies could be done on it. Making a heroin substitute hard to find will make many users consider going back. The decision to criminalize Kratom could destroy lives.

It has done pretty well for the pain.  Taken in moderation it is a fairly safe drug which does not cause intoxication.  I have read claims that it is addictive but I have done without for periods of 4 or 5 days with no significant problems.\n\nI have read that kratom can cause hallucinations, but for me taking more than a moderate amount causes headaches.  Contrast that with alcohol which seems to invite abuse upon taking a few drinks.  I have no experience with heroin which is another addictive drug.  From what I have read heroin sounds far more addictive and dangerous than kratom.\n\nIn summary I have not had hallucinations nor intoxication from kratom.  I have read that others have and I assume this is true.  I know from personal experience that alcohol, a legal drug, can cause severe intoxication and it is responsible for more deaths than all illicit drugs combined.  As with alcohol, I do not believe that abuse by some people should imply that I should be denied the use of kratom.  There are responsible kratom users and responsible alcohol users.  I have more trouble being responsible with alcohol.  I don't know if there are responsible heroin users or not.  My guess is no and of the 3 drugs, I consider kratom the safest and heroin the most dangerous.  Alcohol kills more because it it used by so many people.\n\nMy favorite comparison drug to kratom is coffee.  Neither drug intoxicates me and both tend to cause headaches if I take too much.  I consider them equally safe for me.  I can't say much about taking large quantities of kratom since I haven't done so.  I haven't been around other kratom users, so I personally know nothing of the number of people who abuse kratom.  Still I don't think their actions should impinge on my freedom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14892","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ray Seyfarth","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"hi,i'm 52 and now have metal in my back,my last pain/back doctor dropped me because i won't take the meds how they want me to,i take them when i really need them,not every3-4 hours,i will not be addicted to them again,so they look at me like i'm a drug addict because i only take them when i have to and big pharma is not making money off of me,so i had to find something else that worked,and that was kratom,it helps my pain and depression,and i don't walk around in a fog,please don't take kratom away from us people who really need it  just to live each day,now i just blew another disc in my back and don't know what i will do if i can't take kratom for the pain,i don't get high from it,you can't o.d. on it,if you take to much it makes you throw up,much like drinking to much,i have no withdraws from it and i only take it when i need to,please don't ban kratom\n\nsharon e peden","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4166","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"sharon peden","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Laura Nichols and I am a 47 year old manager of a quilt shop who uses Kratom. I began using Kratom two years ago as an alternative to taking the Ativan I had been prescribed by my doctor for significant anxiety and panic attacks. I was concerned about the possibility of getting addicted to the Ativan and was looking for something more natural. Kratom worked beautifully without interfering with my day-to-day routine. It had the bonus of helping my neck pain to the point that I no longer have to take prescription medications for that either.\n\nAs I said, I've used Kratom as that alternative for two years now, and I've never had any kind of problems with it, certainly not the kind of addiction problems there are with sedatives and pain medicines. Sometimes I will go three or four weeks needing to take Kratom daily, but then I might go a week without needing to take it. The only withdrawal effects I've had to deal with were a slight aching in my shins and being a little jittery for one evening. \n\nI do not believe Kratom is dangerous, and absolutely not dangerous enough to put it in the same category as heroin and cocaine. It's not even as dangerous as alcohol. Using Kratom is no worse than drinking coffee every day. I have, in fact, had worse withdrawal effects from stopping coffee than I have from stopping Kratom use.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12042","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laura Nichols","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't schedule Kratom.

I am a 29 year old female from Miamisburg Ohio.  I have had fourteen surgeries, with twelve of them in the last seven years.  I found Kratom four years ago when I walked away from the pain clinic after a pretty serious allergic reaction from Exhalgo (extended release Diludid).   Kratom has really given me my life back and let me do things with my seven and eight year old boys.   I am able to take them to the theme park once a week.  The last month of this season I began having the kids ride my mobility scooter I use at the park and I walked the park (because of back and knee problems I cannot safely ride).   I have mostly been off work for the last seven years, minus the occasional short term contract.   In October I began working at Arbys in hopes to get some job experience to get back in the field I received a Bachelor degree in 2014, Health Informatics.  My time was cut short when my CT scan showed my cage from my l4/5 fusion had worked its way 27mm into my spinal canal.  Two surgeries later I am off work for another year (doctor said good chance be closer to two years).  I was working up to the day of my back surgery for this issue.\nBecause Kratom controls the pain without giving me the munchies or fluid retention like some of the medications I was on such as Neurotin, I have also lost 200lbs.   I have gone from 350+ lb to 150lb.   I do not stop from the time I get up and get the kids to school until I go to bed about 1:30 am.   I am able to be that mom that sends birthday treats, take the kids to sports practices/games, and clean my home.  \nI only take two pharmaceutical medications now.  Relefen (anti-inflammatory), and baclofen or Flexeril(muscle relaxers).  I utilize Kratom the most but have made this into a healthy lifestyle.  I have cut back (and many days out) soda.  I limit my intake of junk food.  I drink half my body weight a day in water and I walk a lot more than I have been able the last seven years.  \nWhat would banning Kratom mean to me you may ask?   Well, I would no longer be able to have fun with my kids as I will go back to being back in bed all the time with extreme pain and no energy. There would be no more amusement park, no more baking treats for birthday, no more taking or even watching sports my kids play.  In no way am I saying Kratom is a magical cure, what I am saying is that it makes my chronic pain manageable.  I have bounced back from my last couple surgeries much faster than using just pharmaceutical pain medications.  Within three weeks of my last two procedures I had walked away from the pain meds and was back on my herbs.   My doctor was speechless how well I was doing.   We know one medication does not help all patients.  Along that line I have found my body responds much better to natural supplements than synthetic pharmaceuticals.\nKratom is a natural plant, a member of the coffee family.  It in no way makes me high, in fact my thinking is much more clear than any pharmaceutical out there, narcotic or not.   It is not a danger to the public, nor is it even comparable to opiates such as morphine.   Instead of just being in a fog and not caring about the pain it drops the level down to something I can handle.   On the rare occasion I use too much Kratom I simply vomit (my body and the plants way of saying hey idiot too much).\nI do not want to go back to relying on my husband and family for everything.  I enjoy the independence I have because my pain is finally tolerable.   My kids have even said they dont want pre-Kratom mommy back, she is no fun and we dont get to do anything.  This plant is far from an immediate danger to the public.   .   \nTaking Kratom away from those who respect it and utilize it responsibly is not fair to chronic pain patients who dont want narcotic pain medications that put them in the fog all the time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5882","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jenn Eury","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There is no need to make this a Schedule I drug.

Kratom is more comparable to coffee than a addictive drug such as opiates. Although Kratom does have pain relief for many users it does not put the user in a \"zombiified\" state. Kratom gives a boost of energy with pain relief. If the dea is thoroughly studying and breaking down the components of this herbal medicine, then the results should be pretty straight forward.

Kratom has been a Godsend for me. My entire family and friends tell me all the time how much better I seem to them. Physically and mentally. I am always lucid now. I found out three months after my back surgery that I didn't need that back surgery, and I'm not sure if you're aware of this but the hospital Fort Worth Osteopathic was finally shut down because of too many lawsuits. My problem was not my back, it is a deteriorating disease called bilateral sacrioilitis. It can't hurt major organs in my body as well because my immune system is always week because my body is telling it that something is wrong. In other words I do believe that I may be dead by now if it wasn't for kratom. My liver function has greatly improved. I do not understand why anyone would want to schedule this a schedule 1 drug along with LSD and heroin. Please do not schedule this drug is a schedule 1. You have no idea what that is going to do too many people. And that's only one aspect that it tremendously helps  in my case which is chronic pain. I do not have any bad reactions to kratom.

I deal with very sick people, but I also deal with the many drug seekers who utilize emergency services to obtain their drug of choice, and others who come to see me when they have overdosed.  I see patients every week who are addicted to drugs, and even more patients who come in due to acute and chronic alcohol related conditions.  What I am not seeing is anyone coming to the emergency department because of Kratom.  \n\nEmergency scheduling of a substance is used when a substance is an immediate threat to public health and public safety; therefore, I cannot recommend that Kratom be placed into schedule one, because I do not feel that Kratom is a threat to public health or public safety.  Placing Kratom into schedule one will close the door on research, and may mean that Kratom stays locked into schedule one forever.  There are some pretty big claims being thrown around by the Kratom community that the plant can help with a laundry list of ailments including pain, anxiety, and even opioid withdrawal/addiction.  The only way these claims can be validated or disproved is by the scientific community preforming research on the plant, and this cannot happen when the plant is schedule one.  More research such as the article that just came out in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association needs to be done. (Link to article is here: http://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2588524)\n\nTo summarize, I do not feel like Kratom is an immediate threat to public health or safety.  I am against placing Kratom into schedule one status.  I would like more research to be done on Kratom to help assess how the plant can be used, and what the benefits and risks of using the plant are.  I do feel that Kratom could benefit from being regulated as an herbal supplement until more research is conducted due to the fact that Kratom seems to be relatively benign when compared to alcohol, or even other substances that are on the market.\n\nRegards,\n\nVeteran\nMilitary Emergency Healthcare\nNursing Student\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13580","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a great alternative to pharmaceutical drugs that are not good for you and very addicting, its great for relieving pain without taking an opiate that just keeps you in a drug haze and doest fix the problem.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9126","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"zack amos","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please carefully consider all available data, and you will find that Kratom is not harming anyone, and many people can benefit from its use.

I've been using kratom for several years, with no bothersome side effects and no increase in tolerance. When I run out of kratom, my pain returns but withdrawals DO NOT. If I lost access to kratom I would need to return to opioids, and I fear the addiction that could follow. Kratom is safe, effective, and non-addictive. Please keep it accessible.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9596","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mercedes O'Callaghan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Best alternative to opiates.

I worked in Emergency Medicine, Psychiatric Care, Home Health and Pediatrics. I saw situations where substances people ingested or inhaled created scary situations for themselves and for us who tried to help them.\n     I have not personally used kratom. I have a number of physical situations for which it is reputedly helpful. I am a member of the American Herbalists Guild, and as such take very seriously the possible dangers of natural and created pharmaceuticals.\n     It is my humble and earnest request that before this very useful plant is placed into a category where obtaining it becomes illegal, it be studied further.\n     It also seems to stimulate the elements who wish to harm us by concentrating aspects of pharmaceuticals (i.e. coca = cocaine) to push production and importation of the harmful elements. People who are in pain of various kinds are easy prey for both street drugs, and from standard pharmaceuticals given irresponsibly. \n     Herbal medicine is much more likely to be used gently. Please consider some other way of finding out more about this substance before regulating it so that those of us who might wish to use it become criminals in our attempts to deal with our pain.\nRespectfully,\nApril Minkler","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9133","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"April Minkler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"}],"totalNumRecords":23226}
