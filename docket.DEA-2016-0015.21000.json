The chemical that gives the plant its main effects is the chemical \"mitragynine\"\n\nMitragynine is what is known as an opioid, it acts upon opioid receptors in the brain, however, I must note that mitragynine is what is known as an atypical opioid, and that it is not an opiate. Opiates, by definition, are chemicals that are derived from and have the same basic carbon backbone structure as morphine. So all opiates are opioids, but all opioids are not opiates.\n\nIt also needs to be noted that I personally have an affinity for all opioids, have tried many different opioids, so therefore even though my experience is anecdotal and provides zero statistical data, it also means that I'm in a position to accurately describe the subtle differences in mitragynine and other opioids. However, it must also be remembered that if opioids are my drug of  choice, it is because my brain at sometime in the past, changed due to neuroplasticity in such a way to have a high affinity for opioids, which gives my experience a bit of bias. \n\nThe main, core reasons I had for using kratom was for mood enhancement, I also enjoyed things better when I would take kratom, such as watching movies or playing videogames. Kratom made work a lot more tolerable.\n\nThe first time I heard about kratom was back in 2008, however, I did not try it until 2013. The first time I tried it I hadn't used any opioid in a long time, to me the effects felt like taking around 30mg of oxycodone. \n\nTolerance to kratom develops rapidly and for me seemed to level out at around a maximum of 60g a day, after that there was a euphoric ceiling effect, unlike substances such as heroin or oxycodone, which have no euphoric ceiling effect.\n\nI have currently been using kratom almost everyday for around a year. I already have anxiety issues and depression issues, and I most certainly used kratom to deal with them, because it worked. But there is a huge issue of diminishing returns. For me, once I developed a tolerance to kratom, I also became physically addicted, it felt like I could not get through the day without kratom, currently I have come to realize that a lot of the physical withdrawal from kratom is psychosomatic, the physical withdrawal from kratom is nothing compared to heroin or methadone withdrawal, but it is there. The psychological withdrawal is just as bad if not even a little worse with kratom than with other opioids like lortab or percocet. My theory is because kratom is illegal, when you do start feeling withdrawal it's easy to convince oneself that it is ok to go to the smoke shop and get some kratom, it's accessible, but it is also NOT CHEAP. \n\nAnother thing to remember is that mitragynine not only acts on mu opioid receptors like oxycodone and morphine, but it also acts on delta and kappa opioid receptors, this has its own problems that are very complex.\n\nNow I know there was a lot of public outcry about the ban of kratom that was to happen on September 30th and this is why it was postponed, but I was disappointed when the ban didn't happen. I have been trying to free myself of this substance for months now and my thought was, \"Now I won't be able to obtain it and withdrawal is going to be a lot easier!\". The ban did not go through and I still use kratom, albeit less than I have in the past. I do however realize that I should be able to stop without it being illegal if I have enough willpower, but then we'd need to get in to how addictive drugs work in the first place and this paper would be a huge wall of text. \n\nI think the scheduling system that the DEA uses for substances is counter intuitive and allows for substances to be wrongly classified. I do not think that kratom is a schedule 1 substance, just like I don't think cannabis and by extension THC is a schedule 1 substance. I don't even think diacytlmorphine (heroin) is a schedule 1 substance, it has medical use and is used in Europe.\n\nI think the fact that the above mentioned chemicals are schedule 1 yet methamphetamine and cocaine remain schedule 2 is ridiculous.\n\nThe point of this letter is to let you know that kratom is addictive, it is an opioid and I myself continue to struggle with it like someone may struggle with caffeine or nicotine addiction. The DEA in general needs a new classification system for substances, especially since now over half the country will soon have access to recreational marijuana.\n\nThis letter was written in haste, I did not know this site was here and the deadline existed until today. I realize my letter bounces around a lot and reads choppy, I would love if you would contact me so I could give my experience in better detail.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18395","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Edward Allen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a retired pediatrician and a patient who has had chronic pain.

I can't grasp why there is any motion whatsoever to schedule Kratom.  At all.\n\nI was turned on to Kratom when I was quitting my short lived heroin addiction.  Two weeks into it and I was unable to taper off successfully the way I had with my years of codeine and morphine abuse.  Suboxone was calling my name and it did not sound like a great option.\n\nKratom assumed heroin's duties for a week and I was able to taper down from it over another week.  I could have quit earlier, but Kratom solved almost all of my debilitating conditions in as close to a miraculous fashion as anyone could ever pray for.  So, I wasn't in a hurry to stop using it.\n\nAfter I hit baseline sobriety for two weeks I went back to using Kratom to treat my crippling, torture induced depression, anxiety, migraines and PTSD.  \n\nMy motivations for living returned almost over night.  Memory became easier to recall, social abilities resurfaced and I regained the ability to sleep!\n\nNo one who hasn't lost the ability to sleep can understand just how horrific it is to go three days at a time on one, sometimes two, hours of sleep.  I had damned good reasons to turn to opioids, because medicinal science had nothing to offer me in this age of opioid terror.  No doctor ever offered me opioids and asking for them is a sure fire way of getting black listed.  I went most of my life without any relief of any kind.\n\nMigraines used to happen frequently every week.  Usually three times every single week I would be subjected to blindness, extreme and painful nausea, and more intense, unrelenting agony than I could stand.  Even with an extraordinary tolerance for pain developed over my first fourteen years of life being physically and mentally tortured by three immediate family members from my earliest memory onward, I was reduced to uncontrollable sobbing and screaming at the climax of every one of these migraines.  There aren't words that can describe six plus hours of concentrated hell.  \n\nAnd then I found Kratom.  Years of opioid abuse was my only option for dealing with my loss of sleep, frequent unbearable migraines, and chronic suicidal depression; all of which was steadily devouring my life.\n\nNo longer.\n\nKratom gave me back my freedom and it offers the same to myriad victims of trauma and addiction.  When I take too much of it?  I feel a bit nauseous.  When I can't get a fix?  I get mild hot/cold flashes and find sleep to be difficult.  The only real price that comes with Kratom is it tastes so unutterably foul!  \n\nWithdrawal is barely even an annoyance; more like quitting coffee or a mild smoking habit.\n\nBut if I use it effectively, including tapering off at the end of my supply?  I can go for weeks without it and have no need for more.  It resolves the toxic stress build up which drives my ailments in a way nothing else known to medical science can.  Without any price to pay worth balking at in the slightest.  \n\nAnd I can sleep all on my own now!  Kratom fixes the problem for a long duration and could very plausibly lead to my resolving these issues permanently!\n\nNo doctor has ever had a fraction of the success that I've had on my own with any of my ailments.  And, when I bring up Kratom with them?  Not one of them has any idea what it even is!  Useless to the last, whether they're my MD or any of the counsellors and therapists I've been passed off to from one to the next.\n\nKratom is the least harmful and the most beneficial medicine in this world for my array of illnesses.  It's so much more benign than any benzo, anti-anxioltic or opioid; even cannabis has more detrimental effects and that's about as inoffensive a medicine as they come!\n\nTo think something as incredibly innocuous, useful and difficult to abuse as Kratom deserves ANY scheduling at all is insanity!  Much less schedule fucking ONE!  \n\nHeroin, fentanyl, meth, sure!  But Kratom?  Did you not learn your lesson after scheduling cannabis?  How many people have to not die over a century for you to back the fuck off and act like human beings?  Far more people have died from being sentenced to life in prison for Cannabis possession than from people using cannabis recreationally!  YOU PEOPLE ARE THE POISON, NOT THE DRUG!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8195","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 52 year old husband and father of two and own my own Kosher catering business.

From a personal viewpoint, it has given my son his life back. For 10 years, he battled anxiety, depression, and eventually addiction. During that time, he was seen by multiple physicians and evaluated at two of our most repected institutions. He was placed on multiple medications, eventually underwent ECT, and yet continued to struggle. He is now sober over 1 year after completing a comprehensive rehabilitation program. He is now happy, fully employed, engaged in life, and has hope for the future. Without question, Kratom has played a major role in this transformation. It doesn't make him high, loopy, forgetful, or anything but normal. I believe this offers a solution to many individuals with refractory anxiety/depression as well as those with chronic pain and addiction issues. Prescription alternatives are arguably less safe and for many people, also less effective. Maintaining its availability offers a reasonable and affordable alternative to these people. It is important to note that comprehensive mental health, addiction, and recovery services are largely out of reach to many including those with insurance as many operate on a cash basis and require upfront payments. Oversight and regulation are appropriate. Making it illegal will prove counterproductive if not dangerous. Compassion and common sense should allow for a middle ground and transitional framework. I am available at any time to discuss this issue.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17989","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Murray Holcomb","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, as they occur naturally in the leaves of Mitragyna speciosa (kratom), are useful in the treatment of opioid dependency.\n\nKratom is used by countless addicts across the United States as a replacement for the opioids on which they would otherwise remain dependent. In many cases, they will then discontinue their use of kratom as well; it then becomes a \"reverse gateway\" back to sobriety.\n\nIn other cases, its use is continued long-term. This is still a very positive outcome. Kratom is safer than any true opioid, while acting just strongly enough on the opioid receptors to keep withdrawal symptoms at bay. There has never been a recorded death due to overdose on kratom alone; the same cannot be said of methadone, which is used extensively as a legal replacement therapy for opioid addiction.\n\nIt makes no sense to schedule kratom, and in so doing, take this tool away from people who seek to reduce their suffering. The predictable outcome of kratom prohibition will be an increase in the already high rate of addiction to prescription narcotic pain relievers, heroin, and other dangerous drugs.\n\nScience and history show that drug addiction is a health problem most effectively addressed through systems of social support and appropriate medical care. Criminalizing addicts' behavior--especially when that behavior is likely to improve their condition--is contrary to the goals of public safety and public health.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6072","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This plant has saved my life, I am a carpenter and in the last 5 years my business has been suffering do to my chronic pain.

I am also a mother to an amazing little boy,  an animal lover and rescuer, and an active member of my community's symphony and theater programs. \n    I have always struggled with clinical depression and anxiety. I see a therapist and also take Zoloft. Around two years ago, I was having an especially difficult time coping. I had recently gotten divorced, and I was letting my mental illness get the better of me. A friend of mine reached out to me, and introduced me to kratom as a natural and safe stress reliever. From that point on, my life was changed for the better. I still rely on my doctors for treatment, and I know that kratom is not a cure or medication, but it helps me overcome the especially difficult days I experience living with a mental illness. I know that a tablespoon of kratom will give me the boost I need, while allowing me to maintain mental clarity and sharpness. I know that instead of being stuck inside, crippled with sadness and anxious thoughts, I can use kratom and have the energy to come to school and make a difference, or go outside and play catch with my son. \n   As a citizen of our Great Nation, I believe that I should be free to decide for myself which supplements I choose to use. A scheduling of kratom would not only decrease my quality of life, but would rip me of my personal freedom; freedom that we hold so dear, and that those before me fought so hard to achieve. \n    I thank tou sincerely for opening up this comment period, and taking the time to listen to our stories. As a member of the kratom community, and as someone whose life has been so positively impacted by this plant, it means more than you know that our voices are being heard.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16532","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ruby Brenner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"About four years ago I was at my wits end.

I have known him for 4 years and he has always taken narcotics, whether by a legal prescription or not. He states he takes narcotics for pain but now has changed to kratom. Ironically it was right around the time his doctor stopped prescribing hydrocodone. His pain is due to back pain and arthritis. He has done very little to treat the cause of pain but continued taking narcotics and now kratom. He stated he had a problem with overusing narcotics multiple times in the past and has stolen narcotic medication from multiple family members. I'm convinced he is still an addict but is deceiving himself that he has overcome narcotic addiction because he now takes kratom. He has spent about $2,000.00 in 2 and a half months on this drug and is putting our family in debt over it. He refuses to go to a rehab/recovery program for narcotic addiction help even when our marriage is on the edge of divorce because of his addiction. He has told me he uses it twice a day. Based on my research, it should be consumed only as needed due to the potential for addiction. I believe this could possibly be a good method to manage pain but needs to be respected like an as needed narcotic. This needs to be controlled.

I do not use it. Have never tried it. I have seen stories on my local TV stations and local news web sites about it. People who use this are not using it to get high. They have had some sort of serious injury and despite trying opioids or other big pharma meds, have not been able to get relief. Then they research & find out that this is an alternative medicine that has ability to provide relief for their pain. This makes them productive tax payers. Part of society. Why go after Kratom ? Why not go after big pharma ? They produce opioids & the doctors are the drug dealers, along with every corner pharmacy. More people have problems with opioids. Then they may take up heroin because the opioid \"high\" that accompanies the pain relief is addictive, and they find heroin on the street cheaper.\n\nGo after the opioids, and the synthetic thc. Synthetic thc is only out there because of the draconian stance you take against medical cannabis.  Tobacco, Alcohol, and legal pills from your family doctor kill way more people than real cannabis. You can't OD on real cannabis. It has ability to kill cancer cells, among many other medical uses. Government patent 6630507 says it has medical properties.   https://sites.google.com/site/6630507/  Nixon was a twisted president who hated hippies, and the counter culture. He ignored research at the time that proved cannabis was safe when he decided to make it schedule 1. Harry Anslinger  hated blacks, and jazz musicians.

They are everywhere. The cold pill laws did not shut them down, only strengthened the middle class gangs that run the labs, and provided more money for the dirty cops that help protect these labs. But consider taking part of your federal funding, and forfeiting %50 of it to provide funding for getting people who are addicted to meth, and opioids good quality treatment. Locking them up does nothing to the addiction process. They will come out of prison and resume the behavior they went in with.  Education and lack of opportunity is missing in the equation of the drug war.  So the drug war does nothing but fund private prisons, and ruin lives, for the most part.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9055","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n                        My name is Marcus Huckleberry Israel.

It started when I was 12 years old and broke my arm in a BMX accident, and was prescribed extremely high milligram Vicodin by my doctor at Mission Hospital. Taking it as needed for pain, I ended up developing a dependence on it. For years I abused opiates, through most of highschool in fact. I eventually reached a point where most of the people I surrounded myself with had started to use heroin, and I ended up getting into the habit of using that once or twice a week over the course of several months I had several of my close friends die from OD or were murdered over it, and thats when I realized I had to quit. I have been completely clean for 6 months now, due solely to the use of kratom. It gets rid of cravings, withdrawal symptoms, aches, pains, headaches, allows your muscles to relax, allows your MIND to relax, and calms you down. It makes me not want to drink alcohol, or consume toxic substances in general.

I've seen several doctors and have gone into debt in order to have MRI and CT scans. These scans show that my pain is real. However, doctors kept giving me the brush off, making me feel as though these men and women who swear to \"do no harm\", do not in fact even care if I suffered daily.  I was to the point where I strongly considered suicide. What else was there for me to do? Living life in chronic pain is not a life I want. \n\nSo I decided if nobody was going to help me, I'd do everything possible to help myself and thus began my search for natural alternatives, leading me to Kratom. I did my homework, I researched this plant (like anyone should) and decided to try it. From the very first time I used Kratom, I had amazing pain relief. Not only that but the deep depression I had sunk into was slowly but surely lifting off my shoulders and I felt happy to be alive again. \n\nWaking up every morning was now a good thing, instead of me wanting to cry because I had to somehow survive another day in severe pain. This plant is natural. It's a God-given supplement that has helped thousands of people. People, who like myself, were hanging by a thread and were close to ending their lives.

As noted by AHPA and others, there is no precedent for the DEA to use its emergency authority in this manner for a naturally occurring substance such as a plant.  As documented elsewhere (Yearsley, McGuffin and Young) the serious adverse health effects including deaths that have been in some cases potentially attributed to kratom are more likely due to adulteration and/or concomitant use of hazardous and toxic substances.\n\nSchedule I classification would also be highly counterproductive in terms of gaining additional scientific knowledge about kratom and its potential uses, as well any potential safety concerns, in that such a legal classification would overly restrict further scientific research into not only its safety but also its therapeutic value.\n\nThe AHG urges the DEA to permanently set aside the potential classification of kratom as a Schedule I drug as inappropriate, given all we know of its uses and safety based on both science and tradition.  We believe that it is vital that plants with a long tradition of therapeutic use such as kratom remain accessible to the public.\n\nThank you for your time and attention,\nJillian Bar-av","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8447","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jillian Bar-av","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nSincerely,\nChristy Erwin\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20165","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christy Erwin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA,\nI'm writing to you today to please dismiss the ban on Kratom. I was introduced to Kratom in 2012 after dealing with pain, anxiety, and depression for quite some time. I used to be a roofer and was hurt in 2008 after falling off a roof. I shattered my clavicle and hurt my back after falling over a story onto the ground, resulting in a career change due to the permanent pain in my shoulder and back.  Kratom has been my only one true cure to all of my ailments. They ease the pain in my back/shoulder, help with my anxiety, and keep me from spiraling into deep depression from my life changing accident. Kratom has given me a new lease on life, something I though I would never would regain. Kratom makes my daily life productive and sustains my positive outlook in life. If Kratom was banned I would experience day-to-day back and shoulder pain, which would make me depressed and drive my anxiety through the roof, literally. Banning Kratom would overall kill my life, which my family and kids don't deserve. Being a father and husband requires mental and physical dedication that I couldn't deliver after my injury, and kratom has given me that second chance. It's a natural herb that should be available to anybody seeking a natural cure. I have never overdosed, nor have felt any negative side effects from ingesting Kratom. In fact, it's impossible. So please, consider my life, and many others whom have received a second lease on life due to Kratom. Do not schedule a harmless miracle herb that has helped thousands of people deserving a second chance. \nThank you for your time and patience.\n\nSincerely,\nTJS.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14990","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Theo Simon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.

At the time I was working a heavy labor job, and realized how beneficial kratom was, related to increased ability to be more productive. I found that it has comparable qualities of OTC NSIADs, which provided relief for pains from hard work. Kratom is less harsh on the body then other pain relievers I've used, and overall it had been beneficial in that regard. \n\nI can say that i have extensive experience with kratom and aware of its effects on my body, that no one else can tell me otherwise. I've combined it numerous other substances and high doses for long periods of time, and I find it to be safe.\n\nI belief kratom supports productivity and well being for those who use it. Its no different than drinking a morning cup of coffee and taking a ibuprofen... and of course when it comes to consumption of anything, one learns moderation and discipline over time.

I struggle with some debilitating health issues, including Fibro, CFIDS, Degenerative Disc Disease, TMJ, migraines, C-PTSD, and anxiety.\nSeveral years ago, after much research, I decided to try Kratom. This plant medicine has treated my issues like no other med. I've gotten off SSRIs, all pain meds and experienced such an overall stabilization of my health that, for the first time in 15 years, I am considering the possibility of coming off of disability. I want to be productive! I want to help people. Kratom is not a synthetic marijuana, not an opiod,  has no recreational use, and It has helped countless people kick heroin, opioid, methadone and suboxone addiction. It's allowed people to get off SSRIs and benzodiazepines. It gives people hope. I have been suicidal from pain on more than one occasion and if I didn't have this hope of pain management and I had to face the rest of my life in the amount of pain I am in currently (when not taking Kratom), I would be hard pressed to find hope on a daily basis. For the record, I use a minimal amount a day, 3-5 teaspoons, just enough to take the edge off my pain and anxiety so I can function, be there for my family and pursue physical therapy and enploymenf. I am not cloudy headed like I was on opioids, benzos, or even MMJ.

I've had trouble sleeping for as long as I can remember. I was on Ambein, Xanax for years, and they also had me on Zoloft  and Lexapro for a little while thinking that my sleeping problems were due to depression or anxiety. I stopped taking those two after just a short time because of the danger that comes with them. The Xanax made me feel very drained in the morning, and after I stopped taking it, I had terrible withdrawal. The Ambein worked well for me, but every night my parents had to take my car keys, my phone, and block off the doors in the house incase I tried to go outside when on it. \nI finally got off of all of the drugs, and for a while was doing ok. Sleeping..somewhat better. At the start of 2015 my mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. Lungs, uterus, pelvis, and eventually her brain. It tore my family apart, and of course my sleeping problems were back. I was at a point in life where I just lost all hope. I started doing some research on what I could get that would help me get some rest. Something that did not need a doctors note to get. I found a bunch of people talking about Kratom. I spent about 3 weeks reading about it. I wanted to make sure I wasn't getting something that could have negative affects. I finally ordered some online, and I kept it to myself. I didn't want people to think I was taking some sort of drug.\nFast forward to November of last year. The cancer had spread to my mother's brain. She held on for a bit longer, just in time to spend the holidays with us for the last time. We lost her in January of this year.\nI really do not know if I would have made it through this without Kratom. Kratom helped me cope with the pain of my mothers death. It helped me sleep. It helps me get out of bed every morning. I didn't have to take any sort of perscription medicines. Kratom saved my life.\nI always thought that the only thing that could make me feel happy, or help me sleep was something made in a lab. I never smoked weed. Weed is illegal and that is not something that I ever mess with. But Kratom actually worked. It still works to this day. It's been just over a year that I started using Kratom. I have been sleeping alot better, doing great at work, and my overall life has been much better then it would have without it. I have seen first hand what type of damage opiods, benzos, and other perscription drugs, can do. I have not once ever felt any sort of sickness that was brought on by Kratom. It has done nothing but good for me. I hope that it continues to be available for myself, and everyone else who uses it. We all have our reasons for using Kratom. Some use it because it helped them get off bad drugs. Some use it as an alternative to pain killers. Some use it to help with alcohol withdrawal. Whatever the reasons, I hope it continues to be here for people who use chosen to make their lives better. The drugs that are killing people are the ones that are handed to them via a doctors' note. This is no secret to anyone. For everyone who is still fighting their own demons, I hope they will still get the chance to discover Kratom so it can save their lives as well.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17645","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Yeager","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be made illegal!

I work full time as a manager of a dog grooming salon. I have been grooming for 13 years. It is an extremely physically demanding job and leaves most groomers with many debilitating chronic problems. I have been suffering from Fibromyalgia, shoulder impingement, rotator cuff tendinitis and carpal tunnel for the past year. I have seen many specialists and tried many treatments. I went through months of intensive physical therapy, cortisone injections, yoga, etc. The pain has only gotten worse. It was to the point that I could not work and taking care of my own two children became almost impossible. I went from an active runner to barely able to walk a few blocks. I had anti-depressants thrown at me despite knowing that i have an adverse and dangerous reaction to them because my doctor didn't know what else to do. I had almost lost all hope until I discovered Kratom. A woman in one of my fibromyalgia support groups suggested I try it. Doctors have become afraid to prescribe pain medications so I had been left on my own, in pain with no solutions. When I did have pain medications, the side effects were awful. So I went to my local Kratom dispensary and spent a long time talking to the gentleman working there. He listened to my story more intently than my doctors and helped me choose which Kratom would be most beneficial for me. A week later, my husband went back in to personally thank the gentleman for giving him his wife back. I can make it through my grueling work days with almost no pain. I am outside in my garden. I am going on hikes with my children. My depression has been lifted and for the first time in a long time I feel human again. Kratom is not a drug. I don't feel \"high\". I don't take it and commit crimes or neglect my children or get into car accidents. But scheduling Kratom is effectively saying that it does cause these problems. How can you possibly compare a green coffee plant to heroin? It is completely senseless. If that is the case then I suppose that coffee and tea should be banned as well since they also have mild effects of boosting energy or relaxing the body. Banning this life-saving plant will have effects of disastrous proportions for those of us who depend on it to manage our pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety. Since I began taking Kratom, my depression is gone, my pain is at a minumum, my fatigue is nonexistent and I feel that life is worth living once again. It has saved me as a working person, as a mother, as a wife and as a chronic pain patient. I am off all the addictive, destructive medications I was prescribed. Lyrica, one of the drugs I was prescribed, can cause psychosis and is so addictive that the detoxification process can be life threatening. Same with the anti-depressants being shoved down our throats. Here we have a cure for pain, depression and fatigue that has no negative side effects and you want to classify it along with heroin? It is senseless and careless and completely undoes everything the DEA fights for. Imagine if people have access to this plant and can get off heroin? Can you imagine how many lives will be saved? How many families will be saved from destruction? We can change people from addicts back to mothers, fathers, brothers and friends! Please do not turn your back on us! As a fibromyalgia patient, Kratom has been the most effective and safe treatment I have done. I am begging you, my husband is begging you, my kids are begging you, please do not take this away from us.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4218","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joanna Dwyer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been a life saver for me.

My sleep is not restful and I suffer from insomnia very often.\n I started using Kratom about 8 months ago, after searching support forums that help Fibromyalgia patients like me. There were positive comments from others suffering from conditions that cause chronic pain and fatigue, and sleep issues too. \n So, I decided to try this, because I like the fact that Kratom is considered a regulated DIETARY ingredient, a plant that naturally growing on our planet.  I tried a strain that helps with sleep/relaxation and it worked immediately for me! I also have tried the strain that helps with pain and that also helps to ease my pain. I choose natural forms of medicine because that is my philosophy about healthcare. Kratom is not addicting either, I can take it when I feel the need, or go for days without it. \n I believe this plant should be something patients can choose to use as part of their healthcare regiment, just as medical marijuana is legal in many states at this time. Kratom does not cause a \"high\", fuzzy thinking, or problems with coordination, it simply works on our brains as an opiate medication does, without making us feel out of it or \"loopy.\"\n It also has other positive benefits, like boosting our immune systems, helping those addicted to Opiates wean off more easily too.

Is your interest in banning Kratom at all related to ensuring the DEA can cite additional reasons for its continued, perhaps even increased existence?\n\nI mention those last two questions because I have heard numerous people cite them as actual reasons driving the DEA' s desire to ban Kratom.\n\nHas the DEA taken up their concerns over Kratom with officials in other nations where banning Kratom is out of the question and asked those officials for their reasoning regarding their decision to keep Kratom legal?  Off the top, our nearest neighbor nation to the north, Canada, does not see Kratom as a public threat.  \n\nWhy would the United States see it any differently...unless, of course, the real reason behind the DEA' s consideration of banning Kratom is indeed driven more by special interest groups with their own agendas than by factual studies of Kratom and its safety THAT DO NOT use some alleged Kratom \"danger\" as an excuse to hide the true public medicinal culprits, i.e., for example, the opiate problem in the U.S. and mistakenly giving audience to individuals desire to ban Kratom for religious or profit loss reasons.\n\nKratom is NOT a gateway drug, leading citizens to move from Kratom to stronger substances like the opiates.  Actually, quite the contrary is true in that people use Kratom to end their addicting relationships with opiates.  Proof of this is readily found across the Internet by reading blogs and drug message boards.  If the DEA has not taken time to study this for itself, I suggest it do so before making a decision to ban Kratom and thereby cause more harm to the public than good.\n\nThank you for hearing me and the thousands of others, many vets, out on this important issue.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14903","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"D Lindstrom","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"PLEASE DO NOT place Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule 1; citizens with legitimate medical needs are seeking relief from pain without resorting to addictive opiates such as oxycontin (which is a proven gateway drug to other opiates such as HEROIN).

I have no side effects; no high, I can think, I can function and the pain is in control.  I take it when I need it; no withdrawal or negative effects.   I suspect the pharmaceutical companies are responsible for the negative information since they don't want the competition cutting into their profits.   Please allow Kratom research to continue. \n I saw that there were 15 deaths related to Kratom, but approximately 75-124 people die a year from peanuts in the US.   (see http://health.howstuffworks.com/diseases-conditions/allergies/food-allergy/peanut/how-many-people-die-each-year-from-peanut-allergies.htm)\nHave mercy on those of us in pain.   PLEASE do not ban Kratom and take away my quality of life.   I have had no side effects at all on Kratom, only relief.\n\nBelow are a few of my experiences with prescribed, legal drugs. \n\n   -I was in a serious car accident when I was young.   After a week in the hospital, the doctor continued Motrin with codeine for an extended period of time.   I did not want to take an addictive drug so I stopped taking it.  I laid on ice packs so I could get up and walk for an hour or so.   Over-the-counter drugs did nothing.    With the help of a chiropractor, I was finally able to walk again without the need to freeze my back.   \n    The problem is as you age, these injured areas develop arthritis so I hurt every day.   I took Aleve when I had an active day planned, but it doesn't really work and the stomach issues related to NSAIDs are a major concern.   \n\n   -When I injured my hands, they swelled to a point I could not turn a door knob or hold a fork.  The fall also reinjured my back.  My doctor gave me anti-depressants to help with the pain.  The anti-depressants made me into a drooling fool; I could not keep a thought in my head for more than 2 seconds.  I was on the verge of losing my job.  The doctor told me to keep taking them, I would get use to them.  Unfortunately, I drove off the road on my way home from the appointment and could have killed myself and others.    The antidepressants are considered legal and safe.\n\n   -I had an infection and was given Levaquin for an antibiotic.  Before I finished the prescription the pain in my joints became unbearable.   I could not get out of a chair or move around without using a walker.    A nurse admitted to me that she had the same experience on Levaquin although this was not a disclosed side effect for the drug.   I stopped the Levaquin and it took more than 6 months before the side effects subsided.  My joints have never been the same.    Levaquin is considered safe and legal.\n\nAgain, have mercy on those of us in pain.   PLEASE do not ban Kratom and take away my quality of life.   I have had no side effects at all on Kratom, only relief. \n\nThank you for listening. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20570","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing I regards to the scheduling of kratom. To place kratom under the same scheduling as heroin and other dangerous drugs is utterly rediculous. I have several back and joint issues and live everyday in severe pain.  This pain literally knocks me down to the point where I cannot function. I take several medications two of those which are opioids. These medications help somewhat but not without the risk of addiction and I take nowhere near the amount it would take to make me pain free and a productive member of society. A few months ago I was introduced to krstom. With skepticism I tried it. Within 20 minutes of trying kratom I found I was up moving around pain free doing things I could not do before without a struggle even with pain medication. I have even been able to go days without pain medication. Now with the dea's abuse of power even though it is not scheduled yet I am having a hard time being able to get kratom. Today is the first day since I was introduced to kratom that I have been knocked back down by the pain. Kratom is not dangerous in anyway I get no high I do not crave it is absolute insanity to schedule this and say its as bad as heroin. I cannot even begin to think how anyone could even think that. What kratom did for me is give me my life back it let me play with my kids it helped me do things I couldn't do before such as go to work and come home and flea house instead of drop on the couch in extreme pain while my kids look after me. Im afraid what will happen if this is scheduled and urge you to reconsider.

The side effects were to overwhelming for me so my mother kept trying new ones that my doctor would recommend. After the age of 33 I gave up and i didn't think there was anything that would honestly help me get out of bed to do my dishes,go shopping,or have any kind of normal relationship or meaningful life. I had given up all hope until my neighbor who was suffering from MS told me about Kratom.I gave it a try and my family said that they could see small positive changes in my personality and that i was actually wanting to go back to school. I went on to get my associates degree in wildlife and preservation. I have taken kratom everyday since then.I am now married with a high paying job and actually look forward to waking up every morning.Kratom has helped me so so much .

I truly see this plant as having a positive effect for those dealing with pain and being addicted to opiate pain relief and having few legal options to pursue. I can see medical benefits from this plant and I think keeping this plant off of the schedule 1, can allow the rest of this nation and world, to seek healthy options to pain relief and addiction. As the global example for social actions and humanitarian ventures, the United States of America should look into this plant as a potential medical progression and allow for all logical options of medical treatment in addition to opiate treatments currently distributed with severe and deadly health effects, to be explored with the same vigor and tenacity for healing the FDA once showed opiate pain relief medications. To put it bluntly... if an opiate drug derived from the poppy seed of a plant can be studied and moved from schedule III up to schedule II.. I believe kratom deserves the same right as a plant and potential medication to follow the same path as opiates.

I have cyclothymia, fibromyalgia, arthritis and suffer with mild anxiety. My life for what seems an eternity has been living in a pain filled, dark cloud. My days had slowly become ones of sitting on my couch with a blank stare secretly wishing to die. I have not been able to take antidepressants used to treat fibromyalgia or for cyclothymia (which is a lesser form of bipolar). They have the opposite effect on me, I become suicidal. \nI heard about kratom on the news. I researched everything I could find on it and talked with my doctor about it. I could not find one reason not to try it. I have been using it for almost a year now and my life has turned around...the first thing I noticed was an immediate change in my depression, it disappeared, totally. As I used it I noticed my pain was diminished to a point that I can actually live without wanting to die. I no longer have anxiety, at least no more than a normal person. \nIf the DEA makes kratom illegal I fear what my life will become again! I cannot go back to living in that dark cloud again! As an individual I feel I have the right to choose a harmless plant to treat my symptoms as opposed to the severe side effect producing medication that big pharmaceutical companies offer. \nI know a lot of the country feels that \"big pharma\" companies dictate trying to keep natural plants away from the American people. If the DEA makes kratom illegal or even tries to regulate it through doctors, they will be proving us right and we as the people are fed up with it! It is NOT a party drug, if you accidentally take even a slightly larger dose than what you usually take it will make you nauseous and you will throw it up. You cannot overdose on it. People that have died with kratom in their system ALL had other hard drugs in their system, they were hard drug users. We the people are asking you to do the right thing and leave kratom alone. I plan on protesting like no bodies business if it is made illegal! And I will have to become a criminal for the first time in my life because I refuse to go back to my life as it was before after finally finding relief!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6061","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Candi Johnson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me and my family.

I am a teacher by profession, and taught until 2011 but currently home school my eldest child. \n\nI was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, PCOS, and endometriosis in 2007. I also struggle with depression and anxiety as well as PTSD. I also struggle with aspergers syndrome which can compound the symptoms of these ailments. \n\nIn 2011 I began staying home full time with my then 2 year old. I was then on Cymbalta, trazadone, darvocet, ambien, and xanax. My days were filled with struggling to survive and stay awake to take care of my child. I completely went off all medications in 2013 because I took an ambien to sleep after not sleeping for 4 days straight. It knocked me out so bad that I was unresponsive to my toddler who was apparently screaming at the top of his lungs when his dad got home from work. His dad told me that he had to place a mirror in front of my face to see if I was breathing and stayed awake all night to keep an eye on me. I have zero recollection of this. I slowly weaned off cymbalta but quit the other stuff. The struggle to function was not worth the loss my son was experiencing. \n\nI discovered kratom in April of this year when a friend told me about it. I did some reading, and decided to try it. I was unmedicated at the time I tried it (and still am). Kratom has allowed me to be a mom again. It helps me to feel energized in the morning so I can take care of my now 2 boys. It helps alleviate the pain & fatigue that I feel on a constant basis. \n\nTaking kratom away from me would mean taking away my boys functioning mother and my husband's capable wife. Taking kratom from those that use it means taking capable people from society. It would mean addicts falling off the wagon in our drug ridden society, it would mean that those who suffer from constant pain would have to fully rely on prescription drugs and have to be in pain management because of the narcotics prescribed.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8620","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Angela Turner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a registered republican and a non-drug user.

Prior to working in the private sector, I was a police officer and an enlisted member of the United States Army Reserve.\n\nI am writing these comments to express my strong opposition of the DEA's proposed ban on the alkaloids found within the holistic natural supplement called Kratom.  Not only do I believe this proposed ban to be overreach of the DEA's powers, I believe it is unwarranted and reckless. \n\nI began using Kratom is 2012 when I was introduced to it by a holistic health practitioner who was assisting me in my physical therapy and recovery from a severe motorcycle accident in 2011.  After 14-months of being in a wheelchair and coping with a 27-pin external fixator, I needed to find a natural remedy to help me transition from dangerous prescribed pain medications, and their associated debilitating side-effects.\n\nSince using kratom in 2012, I was able to stop the use of all prescribed pain medications.  I was able to complete my 24-month physical therapy program, and find the energy and drive to learn to walk and run again. Moreover, I did not experience the dangerous side-effects that I regularly experienced with prescribed pain medications, such as drowsiness, constipation, nausea, itching, fatigue, confusion, weight gain or fatigue.  Kratom gave me a sense of well-being, while working effectively to give me the energy that I needed to work through my physical therapy program.\n\nThat said, never once have I been 'high' or 'intoxicated' from kratom.  It has never caused me unpleasant, uncontrollable, euphoric, or dangerous side-effects.  As a daily user of kratom, I am proud at the fact that I can easily stop my kratom use at anytime, and not experience the profound withdrawals that are seen within many other natural and prescribed substances.  In fact, I am so confident in it's safety, I openly shared it with my 68-year old cancer patient mother, who has taken kratom for the last year to naturally help alleviate the fatigue and discomfort associated with radiation and chemotherapy treatments.\n\nTo close, kratom has been legally consumed and utilized by people in the United States for several decades. In comparison to other over-the-counter drugs (i.e. Tylenol, caffeine, etc.) or natural supplements (i.e. iron, St. Johns Wart, energy drinks, etc.), it has an amazingly safe track record.  I implore the United States DEA, to view kratom as the safe and natural holistic supplement that it is, and cease any and all efforts to list the alkaloids within kratom as scheduled drugs within the United States.\n\nPlease don't take another natural supplement that has so many lifelong benefits away from the people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6699","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Keoni Lima","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 32 year old male who has seen the benefits in the use of kratom first hand. 3 yrs and 4 months ago I was actively addicted to heroin.

For the past 12 years I have been happily employed in the Grocery Industry. I am writing in regards to the dietary supplement known as Kratom. I have always been a supporter of the DEA and our government regulations, however after being made aware of their recent intent to ban this product I feel the need to comment against their decision. While I do appreciate and commend our governments support and protection from potentially harmful substances, I do not agree that Kratom is one of them. I am a strong believer that this natural plant has many different capabilities to ensure many Americans with a better quality of life. Although reports show various different outcomes from consumers I can only speak for myself. I have suffered from depression and social anxiety as long as I can remember. Along with those unfortunate ailments insomnia was often included in my daily life. I finally sought out the help of a family friend who happens to be a physician to see if there was anything natural that he knew of that may help. He suggested valerian root and another dietary supplement called Kratom. Since taking his advice my life has changed drastically for the better. I can now sleep peacefully and have on overall better experience in my daily and professional life due to the lack of anxiety. However, as my doctor mentioned and I personally agree that this supplement is by no means a replacement to medication, the results speak for themselves. I believe with applied research instead of an instant ban the DEA and the rest of our nation will have a better understanding of this matter. I urge everyone who reads this to take the time to consider the benefits of Kratom rather than poorly reported information.

Some people take it as a healthy alternative to opiates. Typically, opiates make people feel really good but there are a lot of harmful side effects for opiates. People can die from taking too many opiates at once and people can suffer withdrawal effects when they quit opiates. Withdrawal effects occur after people have used opiates continuously for an extended time and withdrawal effects cause people to be extremely depressed and throw up and have diarrhea and have a fever. Also, opiates can cause terrible constipation. \n\nKratom does not make people feel nearly as good as opiates, but kratom appears to make people feel slightly better then normal. The affects of kratom are pretty minor. They appear to make you feel a little better then normal but not much. No one has ever overdosed from kratom. \n\nI think kratom should remain legal as a potential alternative to people who are hooked on opiates.  I don't think there are any negative side affects from kratom. \n\nI think there needs to be more research done on kratom. \n\nSincerely,\n\nPatrick MacDonald","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13123","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Patrick MacDonald","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a working adult and daily user of kratom, and I do not support the DEA and FDA's intent to classify kratom as a schedule 1 substance.\n\nI have suffered from depression and anxiety for much of my life, in adulthood and childhood. I have had great success in using an SSRI in alleviating these symptoms. Unlike many that I know, kratom has not been as key a help in relieving these issues of mine as has the SSRI. However, it has still been very helpful in allowing me to be happy and productive. Additionally, it is helpful in alleviating the negative side effects I can experience with my SSRI. \n\nMy perspective is different from others, in that kratom is not as essential for my well-being as prescribed medication.

Whether that person suffers from anxiety/depression, addiction or chronic pain, it has been an incredible aid. As reported by Forbes, many doctors have concern that a DEA scheduling will seriously harm their ability to research and understand kratom. \n\nPlease act in the interest of public good and keep kratom available.

I've been in my current career for about 9 years now. Before that, I was a heroin addict.\n\nI had tried many times through the course of my years of active addiction to get clean. I was on a methadone program and I was also on a few suboxone programs. I maintained a few brief periods of being clean, but I would always relapse after a time.\n\nI had heard about Kratom from a friend who had also (previously) struggled with heroin addiction. I was skeptical at first, but I decided to give it a shot as nothing else had worked.\n\nSince that moment 10 years ago, I was able to stop using dangerous street drugs and begin to actually rebuild my life. Kratom was absolutely essential in getting me to where I am today. \n\nSomeday, I will also stop using Kratom. But that time is not now. I need Kratom to help me get to that place. To help me continue to become a successful and productive member of society. To continue rebuilding a life I love and am proud of.\n\nPlease consider what classifying Kratom as a schedule 1 substance will do. I believe that it will put many people, like myself, in a very difficult situation.\n\nThank you for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16104","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Swasey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There is no reasonable argument why the plant mitragyna spp (kratom) should be made illegal.

It really helped my depression and anxiety, helped relieve pain while working, actually helped have a better quality of life and time spent with family. I haven't taken it in months, really haven't needed it lately,  noticed no withdrawal to speak of, no worse than not having my morning coffee.  I think it's ridiculous the dea is considering making it schedule 1, even if you don't take into account the thousands of people this herb helps. With jails already full of non violent canabis users, accounting for more arrests than all violent crimes combined, do we really need another reason to take non violent people's freedom away over personal choices? \n\nProhibition is the cause of black markets and crime, if scheduled the dea will create another black market, the people who have used kratom to kick harmful opiates like herion and prescription drugs will have no choice but to turn back to these harmful drugs, crime and overdoses will ensue.  The dea needs to respect adult citizen's right to sovereignty over their own body, if you don't have freedom over your own body how can you claim any freedoms at all? I think I know what's best for me instead of a stranger telling me what I can and can't put into my own body. \n\nScheduling a helpful low risk natural plant like  kratom will further cause the American people to loose trust in the dea. It was mentioned that further testing needs to be done. It has been used for thousands of years, how much more do you need?  What you will be doing by scheduling it is creating a black market, then fighting the black market, are you going for job security or what? Alcohol is a horrible drug responsible for so much death and crime, why don't you schedule it? Probably because it was tried and didn't work, people are going to do what they want to do regardless. If you can't even keep drugs out of prisons how are you going to keep them out of the country. The war on drugs is a war on addicts and a failure, don't add another embarrassment to the list.  Instead spend the money that would be spent on enforcing and incarcerating non violent people on treatment and education. \n\nPrison is for thieves, murders, rapist and other violent people. If you take away someone's freedom over a plant, a personal choice that hurts no one you are the criminals.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0913","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ND Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I will get straight to the point.

Kratom has made it possible for me to once again enjoy social gatherings with friends and family. I can go to the grocery store, do laundry and clean my home without suffering agonizing, debilitating pain. I finally feel human again! \n\nOver the past ten years, I have endured the same series of ineffective, painful epidural injections and nerve ablations at 3 different pain clinics. I had been on prescription pain medication, including oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine and muscle relaxers, for 10 years. I have tried all of the so-called alternatives - physical therapy, exercise, a back brace and a tens unit. I can no longer use anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) because they make my blood pressure dangerously high. There are no other acceptable alternatives left for me. \n\nI am a 59 year old woman.

I cannot for the life of me understand why the DEA and the FDA would take such drastic measures against a natural supplement like kratom. \n\nI am not a scientist or a medical professional so the only proof I can offer that kratom does have medicinal value and does not pose an imminent health risk to society is to share my own experiences with it.

It's not a sugar high or caffeine buzz or any drug that effects your mind.  Rather, it is a medicinal supplement that should be allowed to be offered to the people.

I can not go back to struggling day in and day out with this chronic pain, living my life in bed. I have a 16 year old son and even he has seen such a big change in me since kratom as well as my husband and my family. They are all so proud of me for over coming so many struggels I had before I discovered kratom. At one point I was so depressed and could not take the pain anymore and I attempted suicide.

I found out for the first time around the same time my wife has been using Kratom for two years.\nI am one of the fortunate individuals I do not suffer from depression, chronic pain or any other ailments that Kratom is recommended and used for.\nI tried Kratom because of the high stress level in my job.  I am 63 years old and as you get older it gets harder and harder to complete task that that seems not to be an issue years ago.  \nAlong with the stress came elevated blood pressure.  My blood pressure was fine up to two years ago and I have been in the category of pre hyper tension. \nI used Kratom twice a day at work and I noticed that what seemed to be a major deal in prior instances was handled with a positive attitude and with confidence.  Since using Kratom I have been motived to exercise and have lost 10 pounds.  Less stress and weight lost have lowered my blood pressure and I'm able to deal with any challenges that come up at work.

As a nursing student and a Supplemental Instructor for the last two years with my university for Anatomy & Physiology II, I can say with credibility that there has not been a single documented death due purely to Kratom. The 15 deaths that the DEA cited were all cases in which another chemical and/or \"drug\" was used. In contrast, there were 62,254 calls to the poison control center regarding accidental ingestion of laundry pods between 2013 and 2014 (www.today.com/health/never-seen-anything-more-children-harmed-ingesting-laundry-pods-t88036). I cannot reiterate enough how unwise this proposed scheduling legislation is. We are frequently told, in the healthcare field, to stop prescribing opiates and to get our patients off of opiate agonists as soon as possible. Kratom is suddenly making that possible for millions of people. It needs to remain legal, for research purposes, and mod importantly, to save the lives of thousands who have gotten off of their opiate addictions.\n\nSincerely,\nChristopher R.

Banning kratom just proves that you don't fight to keep the American people safe but only to keep the big pharmaceutical companies safe. I implore you to not ban kratom. Doing so would only cause a larger divide in our country and lead to even more distrust in our government.

I always had trouble sleeping and ambian and other sleep aides didnt work and I am concerned with addictiveness so I have stayed away from them. I tried Kartom and it helped me fall asleep and stay asleep until morning and always helps when needed. I have also had shingles 2 times in the past 3 years. I was prescribed  Narco to help with the pain and help with sleep.It helped with the pain and sleep for the first few nights then it just made me sick. I used Kratom and it relieved the horrible persistent pain. It also helped my sleep through the night without the pain. Shingles stays in your system and can cause pain long after the rash has gone. Again Kratom knocks it out quickly and until it goes subsides again.\n\nProblems with Kratom - Everything has some side effect. Kratom causes some inflammation and dehydration. However drink plenty of water. Also, again it helped me break drinking diet sodas because I craved water and got used to drinking water. Now I drink plenty of water always.\n\nAbuse - People can abuse Kratom.  However people abuse alcohol, over the counter drugs such as aspirin and Ibuprofen, caffeine, energy drinks, and even coffee. \n\nI am thankful that the plant is available and breaks boundaries of new products. Kratom is nautural and is very effective with not only breaking addiction to other drugs but also chronic conditions like pain and insomnia. \n\nI hope that you will leave it available to everyone here and not ban it.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22378","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John P","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\nMy name is Michael and I am a 45 year old male, residing in Colorado, USA.\nI was lucky enough to earn a Football scholarship to the University of North Texas.\nSubsequently, I tore a rotator in my right shoulder.\nI do not like to take pain killers as it would affect my daily life and job.\nI researched and found Kratom some years ago and it actually eases the pain I usually experience in my shoulder.\nIt is not a gateway drug and I do not abuse it.\nIt would be devastating to me if I could no longer purchase Kratom so I am requesting that Kratom NOT be classified as an illegal drug.\nIn Colorado, recreational marijuana is legal but I will not partake as it would be a conflict with my work and job.\n\nVR \n\nMichael DeWitt\n11/30/2016\nMdewitt@gmx.com","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23151","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael DeWitt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my name is Strider Dennis. I am a 39 year old San Diego resident. I work in the mortgage industry. Most of my day is spent talking to and helping veterans of our armed forces. I pour through data all day long and if I see a veteran who qualifies to save some money through one government program or another I contact them and walk them through the process of obtaining a lower rate and payment. It should be noted I do not earn commission for this. I am an hourly employee but the feeling I get from helping out people like my father who chose to serve their country, is in many ways more rewarding than any monetary prize. I mention this for two primary reasons as it relates to Kratom. First because the DEA has a very large percentage of former military personnel in it's employ. Second because I often perform this job which requires sharp verbal skills, typing, math and the ability to actively listen with genuine care and concern( just to name a few) after having taken a proper dose of Kratom. \n\nI wish that anecdote was all that was necessary to stop Kratom from being wrongfully classified as a Schedule 1 narcotic. Doesn't stop or impair you from performing complex tasks for long periods of time? Doesn't cut you off emotionally? Doesn't keep you from expressing yourself thoughtfully? Doesn't cause you to miss time at work or ignore your family? Doesn't do any of the things commonly associated with harmful narcotics? Case closed. I wish that was the world we lived in. I hope it one day can be. Until that day comes I will continue to tell my Kratom story.\n\nI first took pain killers in the form of oxycodone commonly known as Percocet prescribed to me by a physician to treat a knee injury I suffered while training for and running The Rock and Roll half marathon here in San Diego. The first time I took Xanax was when I lost my father to Liver cancer and developed chronic anxiety and depression as a result. This was also prescribed to me by a physician. For the record I do not demonize the physician for prescribing either of these. I was in physical and emotional pain and at the time these took care of both issues and allowed me to function and carry on with my life. I did however become chemically dependent on both. At first both drugs worked well and improved my overall quality of life but over time they became more debilitating than helpful. I became perpetually slow, groggy, lethargic and out of shape. And that was when I was on them!!! When I tried to kick the habit I went through the oft told tale of withdrawal. It was at this time that a friend who had been through a similar experience told me about kratom. With my life becoming increasingly unmanageable and desperate for a solution I decided to give kratom a try. The results for me have been nothing short of miraculously life changing. Not only did kratom soothe my withdrawals but it remedied the other maladies I had previously suffered  minus the narcotic side effects. It soothes my pain with out leaving me groggy. It calms  my chronic anxiety without causing me to fall asleep. It even eases my depression. And all of this while giving me healthy natural energy with no crash. I can honestly say my quality of life has greatly improved as a direct result of responsibly taking Kratom. I respectfully request that the DEA not turn me and millions like me into criminals for choosing to take something that benefits my life in so many positive ways. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my story. Hopefully our voices united will be heard and justice will be done.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21204","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"strider dennis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Greetings,\n\nConcerning the DEA's classification of Kratom, I would humbly beg you to consider the ramifications of making this substance a schedule 1 drug.  There are real people I know of who've become dependent on opioids.  One in particular, a high school friend, started out from prescriptions drugs prescribed for a back surgery he had when he was 26.  My friend moved on to the next thing until they found themselves as an addict - which I suspect they were taking herion.  All the classic signs were there.  I live in the mid-west and have seen what the heroin epidemic is doing to our communities.  If there is a chance we can fight fire with lesser fire, why not take it?\n\nMy friend began treating their addiction with Kratom to an amazing effect.  I now have my friend back, and I truly believe I have Kratom to thank for that.  If this substance can provide a natural therapy for addict users, shouldn't it stay away from a Schedule 1 classification so we AT LEAST can study the substance?  That seems like a reasonable approach to me.\n\nIf the substance proves as scary as you say after a period of studying it then fine.  However, I do not understand the rush to classify something that we all as a society know so little about.  Do the work, then schedule it appropriately.  At least wait for the FDA to give a recommendation.

Ever since graduating school and assuming a full-time position (an \"upright\" one, at that), I've dealt with a significant amount of back pain--significant not in its severity, but in its unrelenting presence--as well as the fatigue and stress that come with any job where your entire day is spent on your feet, often with the phone pressed between your shoulder and your ear. After several failed attempts to find something \"wrong\" with me (X-rays, MRI, ultrasound, etc.), I was starting to consider seeing a pain management specialist (and there are several in the vicinity of my work, so I was familiar with the types of treatment they offer). Still, I was hesitant, because without an official diagnosis, and an unwillingness to \"play up\" my pain level on command, I doubted they'd take me seriously. Plus, I got to see the cycle of dependency on a daily basis--patients who started out with a broken arm or some surgical procedure being prescribed short-term opioids, which gradually turns into long-term use, until they're referred to pain management where regular, around-the-clock opioids become a staple of the patient's regimen indefinitely (unless they're weaned off with an expensive prescription of suboxone, which often turns into an indefinite treatment itself). Luckily, it was right around this time that I discovered kratom. I was extremely skeptical that it would do anything, but within 30 minutes or so of consuming it for the first time, there was a mild but noticeable lift in my mood and energy, which then seemed to make the nagging pain more tolerable. After an initial period of finding the right level for me, I was able to take it at work, and get reliable relief that was just enough to enable me to smile and be engaged with our patients, even at the end of a 12 hour shift. The effects are about as noticeable as a strong cup of coffee (maybe two), but instead of being solely a nervous, jittery buzz, it provides a balanced sense of clarity and well-being. I've been taking kratom for nearly four years now, and have not had to escalate my usage to achieve the same effects. I've discussed it with my primary care physician, and he is thrilled that I've found something natural that alleviates my discomfort without putting me at the unnecessary risk associated with prescription pain killers. If a kratom ban were to go into effect, my quality of life would be significantly reduced without access to this safe, beneficial herb. Beyond that, I fear the quality of my care towards others would likewise be diminished--it's hard to be a truly good listener and problem-solver when all you can think about is how badly you want to sit down. With tobacco-related health care costs in the billions and ~480,000 deaths annually, I cannot understand why *this* harmless plant would be seen as posing an \"imminent threat\" to public safety. Additionally, considering the scope and severity of the current heroin/opioid epidemic, in my professional opinion it would be significantly *more* harmful to make a safe, natural alternative unavailable. I urge the decision-makers to look at the science, look at the data (not just in isolation, but as part of the bigger picture), and ask yourselves where the imminent threats to public safety TRULY lie. Thank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12278","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Hutton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am dismayed at the severe action taken to remove kratom from the market.

It also emphasized the extensive amount of anecdotal evidence and current scientific research that indicates kratom may be safer and less addictive than current treatments for pain and opioid withdrawal.\n\n\"There's no question kratom compounds have complex and potential useful pharmacologic activities and they produce chemically different actions from opioids,\" said author Walter Prozialeck, chairman of the Department of Pharmacology at Midwestern University Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine. \"Kratom doesn't produce an intense euphoria and, even at very high doses, it doesn't depress respiration, which could make it safer for users.\"\n\nRelated Stories\nIdentifying foods that trigger IBS: an interview with Dr Bill Chey\nU-M investigators awarded $7.5 million NIH grant to expand chronic pain research\nMany back pain patients taking opioids get limited relief and worry about side effects, study finds\nKratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is indigenous to Southeast Asia, where the plant was used for centuries to relieve fatigue, pain, cough and diarrhea and aid in opioid withdrawal.

The DEA is scheduled to decide whether to place kratom on its list of Schedule 1 drugs, a classification for compounds thought to have no known medical benefit.

Many people do not realize that people with bipolar are more likely than the general population to experience certain types of chronic, physical pain. Fatigue, headaches, and insomnia are just a few of the side affects of mental illness, and when I say fatigue, I dont mean the groggy feeling a coffee will fix in the morning. When I say fatigue, I mean feeling tired down to the bone, tired to the point where it is difficult to even think about leaving the house. Migraines become a daily battle that lead me into a cycle of isolation and depression and begin to infringe on my personal and professional life. Insomnia also begins to slowly take a toll after weeks on end. Chronic pain is difficult to deal with even when a person is otherwise healthy. Adding pain to a debilitating illness like bipolar disorder can make even the best of us feel hopeless. \n\nI was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 16 and spent the next few years playing the game of which doctor? What medication? At what dosage? There were so many side affects and the time that it took to find the  doses that worked led me to a place of static dissonance that no amount of exercise, therapy or mindfulness could defeat.  I felt completely out of touch with my own mind and the sense of control over my life diminished significantly as the medications began to take their toll. I slowly began to lose hope and spiraled into a 5 year long depression using drugs and alcohol as a way to cope with my deteriorating mental state. You see, people with mood disorders tend to experience the world loudly. This is a kind of exaggerated perception that exists on both of the positive and negative emotional and mental poles.  During a manic episode, life is more colorful and vivid, I become utterly in awe of a sunset, or a beautiful tree, everyday benign things become larger than life.  Even the good and stable things in my life can become distorted. When I see the man I am going to marry, I am overwhelmed with emotion. Everything is all at once too much, too loud. And when depression strikes, the loudness is just them same. A small setback becomes a complete catastrophe in my mind. Something as minor as being cut off while driving can enrage me to no end and stick with me more than it should.\n\nOnce I began supplementing Kratom tea into my daily routine of running, yoga and meditation, I immediately noticed minimizing effects of cognitive dissonance, the absence of panic attacks and the impact of lowering my depressive obsession. With Kratom, I slowly began to turn around to more frequent and longer sustained times of calmness, clarity and pain relief regardless of any difficult situation. Being able to think clearly for the first time in over a decade allowed me the extra psychological and physical space to go to work and function as a happy, healthy individual. To me, Kratom became a supporting element of self discipline that built resolve and a more solid sense of accomplishment. \n\nI am a daughter and soon to be wife. My family depends on my being well to take care of them and do my part. I can absolutely live my life while still battling this disorder, but, to put it bluntly, it will be MUCH harder. Yes, there are others with bipolar who are in much more pain than I who face it every single day, even now. But, the utter unfairness of being robbed of a benign, harmless plant with so many positive and effective properties is inhumane and unnecessary. I will survive and I will manage but it will be in pain and with much distress. To be forced back into the guessing game of figuring out which medication may help this week, or perhaps something new with a whole host of ill side effects that may not work at all is daunting. Medications that I cannot afford, doctors visits that I cannot afford. All of which make me feel as though Im back at square one. \n\nAllowing the DEA to place Kratom as a Schedule 1 drug is extreme, unfounded, and overreaching. Scheduling it this way will prevent science from studying its effects in a medical setting. I can admit that Kratom should in fact be studied. The side effects and health risks should be understood. But how can we allow the DEA to place a blanket ban on something that is clearly so helpful to thousands of people? Those of us with bipolar have the same human and democratic rights as those without. We deserve options that work, and that help us keep it together. Life is harder for us than it is for others. We have to struggle to just achieve a baseline. How can you say that something that so obviously works is an evil? We are human beings who simply want our lives back, and this overreach of federal power feels like a boot stepping down on helpless ants. Uncaring, unaware, unsympathetic.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21255","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brittany Jordan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is John and I live in Queens, New York; I am 54 years old.

I have a academic background in biology. I used kratom (not \"abused\" it) for necessary pain relief, avoiding dangerous pharmaceutical opioids, and I subsequently discontinued use. It was effective, and I presented no withdrawal symptoms afterwards. Before trying it, I read all available literature on the subject, including case studies, laboratory analysis & testing, applied animal testing, historical accounts, the autopsy reports of kratom mixed into unconscionably-dangerous pharmacological cocktails, and I canvassed experienced user opinions. My conclusion was and is that kratom does present a danger dramatically less than that of coffee, or no significant danger at all. I understand the regulatory reaction to something uncommonly understood from outside the pharmaceutical industry, and perhaps a ban may be the only tool the DEA has, however, the benefits of kratom and mitragynine require further study and even promotion, and not a ban. Please, allow the FDA to help verify the quality of kratom in the market, preventing dangerous adulterants. Ban dangerous synthetic drug mixtures that might happen to include some kratom (eg. \"Krypton\"), and not kratom itself. Read books like \"Kratom and other Mitragynines: Chemistry and Pharmacology\" (Robert Raffa). Most importantly, ask anyone who has needed it. If kratom is banned, its potential side-effect of mild constipation may be averted, but a great deal of pain will be caused, including deaths from prescription & illicit painkillers, things I could have suffered. Perhaps more dangerously, people will no longer believe that the DEA intends to protect them, and may disregard its guidance and authority. Please, research and reconsider before creating an imminent hazard to public safety with a ban on kratom or mitragynine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22788","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeremy Kane","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a person who deals with dehabilitatin pain and Kratom has made it possible for me to live my life again without risk of dangerous opiates and addiction.

It should either remain as it has been, available to consumers and researchers laissez-faire, or regulated as beverage tea is, or as an OTC supplement. Abundantly clear after  objective analysis is that kratom is a safe and beneficial herb that offers far more good than harm, and that the relatively few who abuse the herb  number a small fraction of the many who receive great benefit.    In short, the real situation is not even remotely a \"public health emergency\". If anything public health is winning (finally!) by a knowing acceptance of kratom, as more and more people find their way out of the dangerous and debilitating opiate epidemic, and let's not forget productivity-ending chronic pain and anxiety syndromes. People know this.\nSo, with all due respect, if the Agencies that determine policy want to put a final nail in the coffin of their credibility in this particular arena, banning kratom is a great way to do it. The DEA in particular has been doubling down on it's \"marijuana\" propaganda in the many years overwhelming evidence has shown it to be just that (counterfactual propaganda), and We The People know it.  Very little public support for the War On Drugs remains, and banning kratom is an obvious expansion of the same failed policies. The Public is saying: \"Wait..let me get this straight...you want EXPAND misguided policies?\" Searching for a reason for the obvious cognitive dissonance, We The People see a money motive, and we are not likely wrong. Lobbies. Can't live with 'em, can't...well, never say never.\n\nHere's the truth: people are born of nature, and nature is the premiere apothecary. There was a great article by Dr Andrew Weil featured in the Huffington Post recently that makes the case: Why Plants Are (Usually) Better Than Drugs. The article outlines  rational reasons why this is true, to date. Dr Weil's assertion: \" the fact is, the natural, whole plant often has both benefits and safety that put the isolated compounds to shame.\" The reason is found in knowledge of systems: a complex of compounds  will engage a more dynamic equilibrium of homeostatic mechanisms than will compound isolates. That dynamism yields therapeutic sophistication. \n\nThousands of testimonials give empirical weight to the premise: herbs work far better in many cases than drugs. For example, people very often use the word \"godsend\" when describing the difference kratom has made for them, after describing how miserably drugs failed them in their pursuit of well-being.   \n\nSo, Dr. Weil's article touches on the rational, scientific case for a far more laissez-faire approach to herbs. There is also the case that invokes our philosophy of Rights:  personal liberty, cognitive liberty, and  religious liberty. \n\nPersonal liberty is the general pursuit of happiness Right. If I harm no one in it, I have the right to pursue well-being as I see fit. Cognitive liberty is the right to determine my own consciousness in my own way. No one, martini in hand, has the moral high ground to wag a finger, let alone ban, my use of a plant to alter my own consciousness. And finally, religious liberty:   more and more Americans identify as \"spiritual but not religious\". Yet legal precedence allows religious exemption to prohibited substance penalties only to historically validated traditions, such as Native American Church -\"Peyotism\", and even then it has been a hard-fought battle. The point is, many Americans and people the world over believe that herbs are \"wise\" medicines from a Creator and/or Nature, and so greatly prefer them   to invented or isolated compounds (and as Dr Weil's article suggests, it is not an irrational preference). Yet they will  have a hard time getting the Courts to protect that sincere spiritual lifestyle preference under religious freedom; does it make sense that that should that be the case?\n My position:\nWe need to Make Liberty Great Again. No more bans. Ban banning.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16568","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Ryser","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern:\n\nI'm writing to offer my  experiences with Kratom products.  I first tried Kratom a couple years ago while I was suffering from moderate to severe right shoulder pain that had persisted for months.  I self-treated with OTC NSAIDs and immobilization,  I also visited an Orthopedic provider who offered me Rx NSAIDs, opiates and expensive injections.  I chose to stick with OTC relief rather than risk an addiction to hydrocodone.  \n\nShortly after my trip to the physician, a gas station attendant told me about a 2 oz drink that some said helped their pain.  Well, I tried it.  It did help, but it was not like taking a 'REAL' opiate.  I'd taken an opiate twice -- Once for a chronic cough in syrup form, and once in pill form for a kidney stone. There was no comparison in potency, analgesic effect, euphoria or side effects.  Because it was somewhat effective, I bought quite a lot.  I even tried it in pill form and tea.  I used it daily for several months while my pain persisted.\n\nWhile I was using Kratom, I monitored myself.   I was nervous from bad press here in Alabama where it has since been banned.  I am a Medical Technologist turned healthcare IT professional, and have the ability to check my blood work and vitals any time I wish.  My blood chemistry tests, including liver function and cholesterol, and blood counts were unchanged from my normals, and my blood pressure was not affected.   \n\nWithdrawal did exist, but it was very mild.  I skipped several days of treatment during the months I used Kratom, and I did notice I would be cranky almost like I hadn't had enough coffee on the days I didn't use any. It wasn't nearly as bad as skipping my morning coffee though.   If you're a coffee drinker and have skipped your daily dose, you know the pain!  It took me days of awful withdrawal symptoms to kick my two cup per day coffee habit after my college days.  I'm back on that wagon in full force now though.  The withdrawal symptoms I had when I stopped Kratom lasted a single day, and it was simply that I felt a little thick-headed and mildly cranky.\n\nBased on my experience with the product, I think it's proper to continue treating it like other herbal supplements.  I realize my experience is only one anecdote, but the nearly non-existent withdrawal and unchanged medical assessments make me feel like the concern about this product is overblown.   I understand the concern because it's thought to bind with opiate receptors, but, again, there is no comparison to Rx opiates.  I can compare it to Valerian root for sleep.  Valerian is thought to act on GABA receptors like Benzos or sedative hypnotics, but there is really no comparison.  \n\nI can't help but wonder what would happen if coffee or tea had been a recent market in the U.S.   Of course, this is not the case, but hypothetically, you guys would be quite concerned about the dependence, irregular heart beats and deaths that occur from caffeine consumption if these products were somewhat new here.  I'd bet statistically, caffeine's adverse side effects  have a higher representation per user in emergency rooms than Kratom's.  How many cases of palpitations, tachycardia and angina in emergency rooms could be avoided if people cut or avoid  their caffeine consumption?  \n\n Thank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6222","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Hayes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've used kratom for 4 years to combat pain in my lower back .

Every death in the US that has the word 'kratom' attached to it, has been polydrug use, with prescription drugs being the most likely cause. Kratom just happened to be in their body along with several harmful drugs.\n  Kratom is not very potent, its not dangerous at all, its not a synthetic bathsalt. Its not a gateway drug, in fact its the opposite, its the only thing out there that offers a gateway OUT of addiction, with none of the negative effects of normal prescriptions like methadone and suboxone.\n\n  The reason this matters, its not inherently wrong to catch a mild buzz. Alcohol causes people to be in a stupor, can kill from alcohol poisoning alone, not to mention the deaths caused by drinking and driving. Take all this, and take alcohols addictive potential, and we have to understand that we let poisons get consumed in society for the sole purpose of giving one a buzz. Also, when alcohol did get banned, it actually took a Constitutional Amendment to ban alcohol, because, it is very much so UnConstitutional to ban a substance, since when a substance is consumed, in ones own home, in a safe manner, there is no victim, no accuser to face in court. We have now lots of statutes and regulations that get exploited to ban substances, but at least when alcohol was banned, they took the Constitution into account, and actually Amended it. Banning kratom would be the epitome of UnConstitutional, and an over-reach of Governmental Powers over the People.\n\n But kratom is not even like alcohol. The buzz one can get from kratom is very very limited, the comparison to coffee is no exaggeration. The buzz is about as potent as coffee, and the addictive potential is also similar to that of coffee. This has been supported by evidence in a lab. The sheer danger is also on par with coffee, perhaps even less, since its known that someone can definitely die from caffeine. No one, and its not believed to be possible, has died from kratom alone.\n\n  Fancy rehabs clinics are already using kratom for rehabilitating anything from heroin addiction to alcoholism, and coming from a state that is heavy with prescription opiate abuse, I've seen many first hand accounts of people kicking oxycodone habits as well as alcoholism with kratom. Make no mistake though, the media uses these facts to make kratom seem comparable to prescription drugs, heres the difference, if one is not ready to quit taking real drugs/alcohol, then kratom will be of no use to these people. You have to be willing to completely quit, and only then, can kratom be used as a tool to help. Sort of like nicotine gum (or even vaping) with people that want to quit smoking, if one doesn't want to quit, the gum will be of no use.\n\n  The reason this is important, is because when kratom is compared to methadone and suboxone, theres yet another glaring reality. Methadone and suboxone are both more addictive, and more dangerous than kratom, and their not banned.\nThe potential for kratom to get people off of real opiates has also been known for a very long time. In fact, Thailand banned kratom about 50-60 years ago, the reason was, it was cutting into the opium tax profits. People are able to use kratom, and lead a normal life, unlike with opiates. Traditionally in SE Asia, the mothers of daughters would want their 'soon to be' son in laws to actually BE kratom users, because compared to alcohol and opium, it shows they were more likely to hold down a job. How many drugs are known for making people hold a job? Kratom is so mild, that when someone is 'on kratom', is the same as being sober, or using coffee to stay awake.\n\n  Banning kratom would be a huge, UnConstitutional mistake, and from what Ive seen, many of the states that have banned it, have very bad opiate problems, and when kratom got banned, the people went back to the dangerous opiates, and in a lot of cases, heroin, because of how much cheaper it is on the streets compared to rx'd opiates. This implies that kratom could very well be cutting into the profits of big pharma, which implies an ulterior motive for banning kratom. At the very least theres a theme of ignorance to kratom, while banning it. The media loves an intriguing story, and talking about a new 'drug', from SE Asia, that even 'heroin addicts are using', brings in more viewers. Whether liberal, or conservative, the media is not known for honesty and integrity.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22960","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"ANONYMOUS","postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\nOf course I have my own experiences with kratom and none being negative.

I get to work more while taking kratom because I get less frequent migraines.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9576","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thomas ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has given me my life back. I used alcohol and antidepressants and pain medications for my arthritis until I found this wonderful plant. I can't imagine why the DEA wants to take such a wonderful solution away from people. I've been a housewife for over a decade but now thanks largely to Kratom, my children are in preschool and I have rejoined the labor force. I am not only a much better mother but I am now the proud co-owner  of a restaurant. Kratom is not addictive; I quit smoking 10 years ago and I know what addiction is. Since I've been taking Kratom I've gone from morbidly obese to a normal BMI as I am feeling so much better; I can exercise again! It's like coffee, which is addictive.  I think it is appalling that anyone other than a pharmaceutical company would want to ban Kratom. It is not a drug. I am part of a good church going family and my husband is in law enforcement.

I don't take pain medication because it makes my brain slow down, hate the way that feels. \n\nMy son told me about Kratom about a year ago, and it has changed my life. I finally have something natural I can take when my back is out that doesn't impact my thinking! I used to just suffer through it and would have to cancel appointments for a couple of days, trying to do everything from my bed, laptop and phone. I truly hate pain medication, only taking as a last resort so I could move, but feeling mentally slowed down. Not a winning combination. \n\nNow I have Kratom, which I can take on those days, and it doesn't impact my thinking! I can do what I need to do to help my people without having to slow down that much. I take a hot bath with Epsom salts and a glass of Kratom and water (2.5g) and I'm able to be me. It keeps the muscles in my lower back from seizing up, and I naturally get back in alignment without downtime and drugs. \n\nMy old injury was tearing connective tissue in the Sacrum area 20 yrs ago when I was a mailman. \n\nI also do yoga to keep my core muscles strong, but sometimes it still acts up. \n\nMy doctor prescribed a muscle relaxer and periodic pain medication. I hate them. \n\nI believe you guys are likely fighting against the prescription medication lobbyists, because why would they be okay with a natural substance that solves problems such as mine? There's a lot of money there. But I'm sure they tell Congress that this is somehow bad and an addictive substance. The reverse is true, as far as I can tell. I DON'T ever want to be one of those people. \n\nIf our elected officials truly have a goal of helping people stay away from addiction, they will support you and the effort to keep this plant away from regulation or illegalization. \n\nI have read blog sites where people who do have pain medication addictions have used Kratom to get clean. There are millions of Americans who suffered significant injuries, were put on pain medication, couldn't afford it, and moved to street drugs like heroin. I am grateful to say I've never done that. I've heard it's the hardest substance to break the habit. I'm a cigarette smoker (again, unfortunately) and that is a horrible habit to break. I can't imagine worse than that. So my heart goes out to those people because it's got to be a living hell.\n\nSo my point is this: Kratom is a natural and non - addictive substance. I drink it when I can't move, and don't think about it in between. I can think and function as myself, and keep saving the world for my clients. \n\nAs I mentioned, I did call my two WA Senators, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, asked their aides to thank them for their service on my behalf, and told them my story as it relates to this issue. Maybe it's worth remarking that I'm not even a member of their political party. But I do totally appreciate that they work hard on my behalf, even if we don't always agree. I tend to be more of an Individual Liberties and Fiscal Conservative kind of person. That's okay. We're all different, and they work hard, I have no doubt at all. \n\nI'm 50 years old. The world tells me I look 30. My body has moments it feels maybe 70 (don't know, not there yet.) But it gets bad when it gets bad. I appreciate that I can take Kratom at those times. I can continue my life without feeling like I'm taking a substance. It's a good thing. \n\nBest,\n\nKristin\nKristin Cook, Realtor\n425.319.6723\nKC Sound Solutions Realty\nKeller Williams NWRE\nWA #113525\n\"Our goal is your success!\"\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15461","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kristin Cook","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nThank you for setting up this website for citizens to voice their comments on the emergency scheduling of Kratom as a Schedule I substance. \n\nI would like to say that I have used Kratom responsibly after learning about it online as an anti-depressant and anti-anxiety solution. I was previously prescribed 100 milligrams of Zoloft taken daily, and after taking 2-3 grams of Kratom (typically 4-6 capsules) per day, and reducing my Zoloft prescription under the supervision of my physician I have successfully weaned myself off of Zoloft.\n\nBecause of this, I feel better physically, mentally, and am no longer reliant on a pharmaceutical substance in order to function. \n\nAdditionally, I believe it would be a major mistake to ban Kratom in the face of the most appalling opiate epidemic this nation has ever seen, and strongly believe that it would cost lives. While opiate addiction was not something I myself faced, it is something I wanted to specifically highlight as I have personally lost people I cared about to opiate addiction.\n\nLastly, I would like to voice my concerns about the evidence being used that deaths have allegedly occurred due to Kratom abuse. As I'm sure the DEA is aware, 14/15 of those cases involved poly-drug intoxication, many involving the combination of Xanax and prescription pain-killers or opiates. While I have not personally overdosed on either of those pharmaceuticals, I know friends that were hospitalized or killed from overdosing one of those substances alone, without being combined with something else. In my experience, the consequence of taking too much Kratom is nausea and limited vomiting comparable to a hangover from alcohol, a legal and far more detrimental substance.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my comment, and I hope you make the right decision in choosing not to ban Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11722","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Austin Hock","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, although I don't personally know anyone using Kratom, I think it is deplorable that an agency said to \"protect the public\" is now banning plants that have been used for 2000 years to treat illness.

It's because of money and power you'd rather give to pharmaceutical companies instead of helping the public.\n\nShame on you, all of you, as public servants should serve what is in the best interest of people who are suffering from addiction.

I imagine my comment, if read, will be echoing the same sentiments as many others belonging to a long list of kratom users. I'm sure I don't need to rehash all the numerous arguments in favor of kratom's legality, nor do I need to remind you of the plant's negative potential. I can only assume that the reader of this comment will be far too aware that kratom is \"not a drug,\" or \"totally natural, man.\" Instead, it is my intention to shed light on what may be a less than usual argument and illustrate what is, in my opinion, the real problem. \n\nI in fact, have never used kratom; neither recreationally nor therapeutically. I am however a friend to enough heroin and pill addicts to fill up at least one hand. I am a boyfriend to a girl who lost her brother to a legal prescription opiate addiction. I have born witness to more drug related tragedies than I care to recount. And most importantly, I am not even close to being unique. Indeed, today's America is now one where the minority are those that haven't been affected --either directly or indirectly-- by opiate addiction. \n\nNow, to clarify, I do not live on the wrong side of the tracks. I am far from underprivledged, and I have a loving home with excellent parents. In high school I was an honors student, varsity wrestling, student paper editing, straight A getting, model student. I didn't have a bad group of friends. I didn't loiter in alleyways or street corners. I never so much as got a detention. \n\nYet, not even a kid with as perfect an upbringing as mine could stay completely away from the affect of legal and illegal opiates. Before I was out of high school I had been offered percocet, vicodin, and oxycotin among other things. I didn't take those drugs, but the decision to say no was one that I was forced to make far too often. Moreover, had I been someone will less support, self esteem, or better things to do, I may have given in. The fact is that if a young man like myself, who has everything in the world going for him, can come that close to making a life altering mistake, it can truly happen to anyone. Furthermore, as I have seen first hand in the lives of friends and loved ones, the talons of addiction are sharp and unrelenting. Once they have a hold of you they won't let go until you are either knocking on death's door or have already past the threshold. \n\nSo the questions I would pose to policy makers are simple. Firstly, who are you protecting? What other cheap, readily available forms of opiate addiction management exist.

It's like the equivalent of making coffee a schedule 1 drug.\n\nI have been using kratom for nearly 3 years.  I drink 4-6 cups of kratom tea every day, about the same amount of coffee I drink.  Like coffee, it helps me focus and gives me an often much-needed boost of energy.  Unlike coffee, it also helps ease my social anxiety.  Without it, I don't think I would have been able to return to college, at which I am currently studying pharmacology.\n\nThere must be hundreds if not thousands of herbal supplements as well as OTC medicines that are more dangerous than kratom, so I don't understand the proposed scheduling of a natural substance that has been used safely for thousands of years.\n\nI can only speak for myself, but kratom is less addictive than coffee, it does not get you \"high\" and I don't think it has any abuse potential at all.\n\nThe EXTREMELY small number of deaths associated with kratom all included a combination of drugs. This cannot be used to justify any danger of kratom, and only speaks to the irresponsibility of those that recklessly combined drugs with kratom.  This, and many other excellent points indicating the ridiculousness of the proposed scheduling of kratom are summed up nicely in the Hogan Lovells letter to the DEA:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwMPT92bOJKdZWM2bzlLeU5DdDg/view\n\nIn conclusion, kratom has greatly increased  my quality of life, and has helped me get back on track to becoming a productive member of society.  And not just me, but it has proved to be, for various reasons, a great benefit to thousands of people in the US alone. I cannot even conceive of the fact that I could become a felon for drinking an herbal tea.  It's no secret that the \"War on Drugs\" has been an absolute failure, and adding a natural substance that is safer than caffeine to the category of controlled substances that includes heroin and LSD is laughable, and another step in the wrong direction. The proposal to make kratom a schedule 1 drug defies common sense, logic, and scientific evidence.\n\nSo I implore you, please do not make kratom a scheduled substance. If you do so, you will ruin the lives of thousands of good American citizens.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15597","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nathaniel Colbert","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have a damaged Maculea in my eye I am in chronic pain as well as always stressed with being a provider and a father.

I am a 39 year old construction worker, husband and father of 3 honor students. I have degenerative disk disease in my L spine and C spine. All disks in my C spine are herniated and 1 disk in my L spine is herniated. I have stenosis and arthritis in my neck and get terrible nerve pain. About 2 years ago I was getting steroid injection in my back taking several rx medications and OTC medication.  Severely bloody stool was a daily occurrence and my pain was hardly being managed. Medical bills were piling up with very little result and I was missing a lot of work because of back pain. I was feeling very hopeless and felt like a burden on my family.  \n\nI began to consider medical marijuana. As I researched this alternative, I realized I could lose my job even with a prescription, because it is still a federally scheduled substance. I began scouring the Internet, looking for herbal pain relievers. I tried a few with little to no result. I had read about Kratom and did lots of research. I finally ordered some after communicating with an online vendor.  After receiving my order, I realized how helpful it was in managing my pain. I was able to discontinue all my other medications and just supplement with Kratom and my daily vitamins. \n\nI still have pain, Kratom won't cure my ailments. However, it does help with the pain. I also have found that I no longer have the stomach bleeding that I believe the NSAIDs were causing. I only go to the Dr. for my annual physical, with good results. I haven't missed work due to pain. \n\nI have not noticed any negative side effects from Kratom. This herb has done a lot of good for many people, including myself. Kratom has been safely used in Asia for thousands of years. All these people aren't trying to keep some horrid intoxicating drug legal. You don't need to make criminals out of good honest people. If Kratom is banned many will turn back to hard drugs, some will OD and die, all because an herb that helped them improve their quality of life was taken away.

I am a firm believer that herbal medications or supplements are much healthier to use, compared to narcotics or schedule 1 type drugs. Compared to the overwhelming overdoses and deaths related to pain medications, and other narcotics(heroin, crack, methamphetamines etc.) I have yet to see or hear of ANYONE dying from the use of kratom.  However, I decided to try kratom for pain relief as well as help with anxiety, and depression, and I am happy to say that kratom came through for me AND I have experienced NO negative side effects whatsoever. I would like to say also that kratom does NOT cause one to rob/kill someone to get their next \"fix\" as the \nREAL schedule I drugs do, nor does it ruin one's life.  I cannot understand why kratom is even considered to be an illegal drug, nor should it even be in that category. It is a natural, non-habit forming , and safe product with positive benefits. In conclusion, I believe it is  a mistake to make kratom a schedule 1 drug. It is NOT a drug, it is an HERBAL. I researched kratom before using it, and I found many positive reviews about it, not to mention that it has helped others on hard drugs detox safely. How can a schedule 1 drug be this helpful?  Kratom helps, NOT hurts. I now use it to ease my arthritis pain, and yes, it does help.

I began using Kratom roughly a year ago after being addicted to opiates. I have severe arthritis (and little to no cartilage in both knees) and occasional back troubles stemming from the arthritis. 10 years ago, I lived outside of the United States (my husband is from the UK, we have sense moved back to the USA). During that time abroad, I gave birth to my son. I did not drive though walked everywhere - to the grocery store, to the shops, to bring my child to school.  Month after month, the arthritis and the damage to my knees became extensive and mobility became excruciating. Codeine IS available in England in low, over-the-counter 8mg doses(combined with acetaminophen or ibuprofen). What started as occasional and as needed, one or two every day or two, over the course of those 3 years, became up to 24 pills every day. Otherwise, the tremendous pain I was in, barely able to make it to the end of our street, would reduce me to tears. I ended up homeschooling my son for a year, because I just couldn't walk anymore.  We had made the decision at that point to move back to the United States. I brought with me a fairly large supply that I hoped to wean myself from slowly...  which I did...  but the withdrawals were severe, the sickness was horrendous, and my pain levels shot through the roof. I turned back to opiates, in any way I could find them. That method was poppy pods and the tea made from them. It was my only alternative and steady source. My consumption was staggering - just to get to a level where I could function in anyway.  I was, at my worst,  using almost a measuring cup full of ground pod in the tea - every day. I was hooked again and this time it was far worse. I tried quitting numerous times, but the sickness from the withdrawals always made me stumble and go back to the poppy tea. I was desperate. I was ashamed, I was fearful. I was disgusted with myself.  Two years ago I finally had surgery to help alleviate some of the more serious health concerns that I had been living with. I needed to get my life back. I had a husband, a son.  I needed to be able to be there for them.  I read an article about Kratom years ago, but I always passed it off as a gimmick.  But enough was enough.  About a year and a half ago, I gave in and ordered a small amount from a local herbal store (online) and gave it a try. I had begun tapering off the opiates about a week prior and was feeling horrible - stomach cramps, loose bowels, muscle spasm, headaches, nausea...  The Kratom arrived, I tried a teaspoon in warm water. It was disgusting. Completely disgusting tasting....  but after about 20 minutes, I began to notice that the muscle pain (from the opiate withdrawal) started to subside. The stomach cramps lessened.  Interesting. I took another teaspoon the next day. Choked it down. DID NOT TAKE MY USUAL OPIATE DOSE....  barely any withdrawal symptoms. I was amazed. I quit the opiates cold turkey at that point.  Continued washing that disgusting kratom down, roughly a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half daily.  Withdrawals were practically nothing. Within a week I had stopped opiates, felt little to no sickness, and noticed that my knee joints felt pretty good.  I did NOT experience any kind of 'high'...  more of an energy as one would feel after a few cups of coffee.  I doubt anyone, because of the taste, would flock to kratom for any kind of a high...  it really does taste bad. But it did the job. got me off the opiates within a week and I was thankful that I had tried it.  Now,  18 months or so later, I am still opiate free.  My health has significantly improved. I no longer need walking aids and my mobility is getting better every day.  I still take about a teaspoon of kratom a few times a week, as needed.  Thankfully, I don't need more -because after all this time, I still have not gotten used to that taste.  yuck.  But I am grateful for the freedom it has given me the fact that it is a LEGAL supplement.  My fear is that if this avenue was denied me at my lowest point - where I'd be right now.  And for the millions of people that struggle every day with similar addictions could be denied the same relief as I have found.  Every day, so many people are struggling with addiction, suffering with severe pain, dealing with so many issues - but simple, basic, NATURAL relief is being denied them.  The ban on Kratom will just extinguish another small ray of hope that me and others like me have found. This is not a supplement used for some kind of 'high'. It isn't one that is killing huge numbers of people (such as the death toll from heroin or other opiates, alcohol and the like).  It is a supplement that has given those who have found it, their quality of life back again.

This plant has changed my life to where I don't have to take opiate pain killers anymore. I used to have to take Pharmaceuticals pain medication to get me through the day. These medications led me to having to take more and more just to get out of bed in the morning. Eventually they lead me creating a unhealthy life style that wrecked my chances of maintaining a normal life. My family couldn't handle me anymore and friends wanted nothing to do with me. I haven't had any opiate pain killers now in over 4 years and I thank Kratom for helping me handle my pain issues that used to cause constant relapse. Now I have a healthy way of dealing with my pain that allows me to go to work everyday, pay my bills, have a loving family, be there for others that might be in need. Ive never thought of pawning anything to pay for kratom, Ive never committed a crime in the hopes to acquire kratom. This plant has made me turn into a normal, decent human being again. I'm not sure how I would be able to handle it being illegal. Over the counter pain medications destroy your liver. The prescription pain medication destroys your life. This would be a horrendous blow to the already horrifying opiate problem this country is going through. Please do not make me a criminal right when my life is starting to become something again.

Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19051","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cheryl Fergeson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n   I have suffered for 16 years with severe spinal pine, sciatica, neck pain, radiating pain in my hands. I have ruptured several disks. I have had seven surgeries on my spine. I was addicted to opiate painkillers for 8 years. I finally had enough. I stopped taking opiates 8 years ago. I was in agony. I suffered for with no relief until a year ago I discovered Kratom. Kratom has given my life back. It greatly reduces my pain to a manageable level. I take 2 teaspoonfuls when my pain is unbearable and gives me many hours of relief, usually the rest if the day. I do not have to take it everyday and I feel no addiction to it whatsoever. If I run out my pain returns but I have no withdrawl symptoms at all. I honestly believe we should have the right to use unadulterated herbs and natural remedies to treat our ailments. This is after all a free country and I hope that you can help it to remain that way. I could understand a ban on so called \"enhanced\" Kratom, or Kratom treated with other chemicals. Natural Kratom leaf and ground powder poses no health or addiction Fisk in anyone that I have ever seen or heard of. I agree that if other chemicals or extracts are added to Kratom, there may be some risk I am unfamiliar with as I do not use it that way. I cannot imagine that people get high on natural Kratom leaf.

Also, I'd like to thank the AKA for making such an easily accessible platform for all of us. I want to do this in a very short but sincere manner. Firstly, how kratom has changed my life. Previous to taking kratom, I was a bad opiate addict. Started off taking pills such as, hydrocodone, oxycodone, oxycontin. As it would be with anything, my tolerance raised, and for me, the price was just too much. Naturally I switched to something cheaper, heroin. After I tried heroin it progressed rapidly.  Within a month I was full-blown addicted. The consequence of that addiction, cost me two years of my life in jail and rehabs, plus fines and probation that I'm still dealing with to this day. Kratom has helped me not only stay sober, but it has helped me stay off anti-anxiety, and depression medicine.  Which I had been on since the age of 12. I've maintained my relationships with family, friends, but most importantly, my daughter. When I learned of the \"emergency scheduling\" it was as if the world had been ripped out from under me. All that I could think of is me possibly relapsing and going back to the hell I had been in before. You see, I feel as though my story, and thousands other like me, fear that they will have to go back to that life. I for one will do anything in my power to prevent this. Kratom is nothing but a plant. It creates no real high, only elevates the mood, like drinking a cup of coffee, or going on a run. There is 100% nothing harmful about this plant. The real problem is the opiates that are being prescribed to us but the millions. This is the real evil, not kratom. Please, please, please. Do not schedule this harmless plant. Please find it within your hearts to see past the misinformed articles, and rhetoric you will find. Study this plant, and you will find so many wonderful things about it. It's helped me and thousands of others like me. Thanks for listening.\n\nSincerely, \n\nJames Tyler Willingham","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9367","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Willingham","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Brian, I am 38 a responsible father, son, and husband. I am a highly skilled technician in the industrial field. I have never been addicted to any Drug nor have I ever used illegal recreational drugs, I also do not drink.\n\nI do not believe the actions taken here have been a responsible response to what was called a threat to society. kratom has been lumped into the recreational drug arena in which it does not belong. Kratom has not become a wide spread recreational drug because it does not produce the psychoactive effects recreational drug users are looking for. It does however provide chronic pain sufferers as well as several other illness/injury sufferers relief from the pain in what ever form they suffer.\n\nI was in an accident in which I received an injury to my spinal cord causing permanent damage to the pain nerve extending down my right arm and into my fingers. The pain is constant and unbearable. I am unable to sleep ant night and unable to function during the day. I have decided to not use opiate based pain medication due to the addictive properties of those drugs I have used Lyrica with no beneficial results, and Gabapentin gave me horrible side effects.So I have chosen to take a holistic approach and kratom is what I have found to help reduce the pain to a more manageable level. I have never felt or had any negative affects from kratom. I have also stopped using kratom and during that time period I never experienced any negative affects. I believe this to plant to be a useful tool in holistic approach to illness and injury.\n\nI am asking you to please reconsider the decision to place kratom on a schedule 1 ban. By doing so I will not be able to use kratom relive my chronic pain and will have to resort to an opiate based pain reliever. As I have stated before Lyrica and Gabapentin did not work or worse caused symptoms worse then the pain. I understand the difficulties and your position with the drug abuse is currently occurring in the United States but I also expect my government to make research-based decisions. \n\nThank you very much for your time, I would also like to thank you for reconsidering the ban and giving the rest of us enough time find an alternative for our chronic pain issues.

My daughter died unexpectedly the beginning of the year and I now have custody of my 18 year old special needs granddaughter.  I teach yoga part time, and work at a local college part time.  I suffer from familial scoliosis, the curvature of the spine that runs in the family.  I was unaware I had this condition until one day after teaching a fitness class, I collapsed to the floor in unspeakable pain.  Went to the chiropractor and he gave me the news and referred me to a medical doctor for pain medication.  I opted to use ibuprofen instead, which worked for a few years, until my condition got worse and I was unable to work or sit for long periods of time.  I also was doing physical therapy and yoga to strengthen my back, but unless I did surgery to correct the curvature, this would get worse.  Unable to afford the surgery, I decided to try the pain medications, hydrocodeine.   I also was using alcohol to help relieve my pain.  This was awful!  Expensive and addicting, constipating me and rendering me useless to society.  My sister, who also have back issues, told me about Kratom.  She told me it was the best thing that ever happened to her and I should try it.  After extensive research, I tried it and what a blessing!  Affordable, non-addictive (if I run out, its no biggie, just place another order).  When I wake up in the morning, i look like the letter S, my back is so twisted, and within 15 minutes of injesting Kratom with orange juice, I can walk easily, teach a yoga class, hike with my granddaughter!

In 2009 my mother died from breast cancer after a long, drawn-out battle and in 2011 my Fiance and girlfriend of 7 years died suddenly of an opiate overdose. I was extremely depressed and found myself drinking more and more alcohol each day for the  temporary comfort it provided me. It came to the point where I was drinking everyday and became addicted. I tried to quit drinking and would go through the physical withdrawals of shaking, sweating and pains. This made it impossible to go to work without drinking. In my opinion alcohol is one of the worst drugs to be addicted to because of how easily obtainable and how prevalent it is in everyday life. It greatly affects your mood, personality and judgement. It makes holding a steady job and excelling almost impossible. Everyday I would go through the ranges of being hung over and in pain in the morning, to needing a few drinks to feel \"normal\" then passing out from having drank too much. It was a horrible way to live. I tried quitting many times, almost daily. I could stand the physical withdrawals but the increased depression and anxiety that came along with it was crippling. I went to support groups, family members and then the internet for help. Thats when I found Kratom.\n\nI read in a discussion group online that Kratom has helped many opiate addicts and alcoholics overcome their addictions. When I first tried Kratom I was shocked at how pleasant it was. It elevates your mood giving you a sense of well being without doing so in an overpowering manner. It doesn't affect your judgement or motor skills in a negative way, allowing you to perform all your daily functions normally only with the benefits of an elevated mood. I was able to quit drinking through the use of Kratom practically immediately. My elevated mood left me with no need or desire to drink, allowing me to simply stop. In my experience, it is impossible to overdose on Kratom. If you do happen to take too much, you simply get an upset stomach which leads to the evacuation of the excess kratom. Even when taking \"too much\" kratom you are still in complete control of your judgement and motor skills, you simply have a stomach ache. I was even able to quit taking all the antidepressants prescribed to me because the kratom alleviated my depression more than any of the prescriptions ever did. The potential for addiction to kratom seems to be on par of that of a substance such as coffee. When I stopped taking kratom after taking it daily for months I experienced very minor negative effects. I mainly missed the elevation in mood along with very minor cold like symptoms. It was very easy to continue functioning properly even when going through kratom withdraw. When compared to the withdraw of other substances such as opiates, alcohol and benzos there is no comparison.\n\nThe potential benefits of kratom for people suffering from drug addiction, constant pain, depression and so much more are almost limitless. In the midst of the largest opium epidemic the world has ever seen a ban on kratom not only seems unintelligent but downright criminal. I'm afraid that the pharmaceutical companies will use their power and funding to influence the DEAs ruling on kratom because of its ability to cut into their profits. These companies put their profits over the lives and well-being of millions and millions of people. Please do the right thing and keep kratom legal and available to those who need it and allow the proper scientific testing to be performed.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10794","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin Mitzak","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I was diagnosed with several digestive disorders, and neurological Lyme disease in October of 2015.

Just look at before and after opiate related death statistics in states that recently banned kratom. \n5) Florida researched kratom and decided to place NO RESTRICTIONS because they actually did some research on what kratom is and how it is used and who is benefiting from it.\n6) Kratom does not cause respiratory suppression unlike opiates and helps people safely transition off of opiates such as heroin. \n7) Kratom Is NOT Spice or Bath Salts even though some marketing has sold it as a \"legal high\". You cannot get high off of kratom. \n8) The \"evidence\" presented by the DEA that suggests kratom is dangerous actually shows that kratom is safe\n9) The drug war and mass incarceration is absolutely OUT Of CONTROL and the majority of Americans agree with this.\n10) Kratom Is sold by hard working small businesses and scheduling kratom would have a devastating effect on these businesses and leave an impact when times are already hard enough to make an honest living. \n\nKratom is NOT a drug. It's a plant with many benefits that is changing people's lives. I've seen this many times first hand. And if the federal government does want to classify it as a drug then tell me what other drug actually turns people's lives around and makes them a productive member of society again.

I started using Kratom roughly 5 years ago to help me stay focused at work in the late afternoons. It has proven excellent for this  similar to a cup of coffee, but without the jitteriness. I have also found, over this time, that it is very helpful during periods where I would normally be wracked with seasonal allergies (spring and fall). I find I have been very productive at work while taking kratom, and during this time, the company has placed me on several high profile projects. I usually have a single cup of kratom tea, typically in the late afternoon. Occasionally, I will drink two cups per day, if my day is particularly demanding.\n\nMy last physical showed that I am in excellent health - no problems noted. I exercise almost daily and I have not had any issues outside of what I would expect due to my age. There are also many times during the year where I find I do not need kratom, and during those times, I have never noticed any ill effects from stopping.\n\nI have read that some people are using kratom to get an opioid-like high, but this doesnt make sense. It just doesnt have that effect  I would think that anyone taking kratom for the \"high\" would be disappointed! I guess that this is why it hasnt been a social or law enforcement problem in the United States, like (for example) prescription pain medications, despite what appear to be a very significant number of users.\n\nYou can imagine my surprise when I found out that the DEA intended to schedule something thats been such a helpful addition to my life! I am concerned that I would not maintain the same alertness at work, and my seasonal allergies would be back full-force, if kratom were taken away completely. I would therefore ask that you not schedule this substance, but keep it accessible to those of us that find it useful.

Making this plant and its constituents schedule I, effectively makes it impossible for legitimate researchers to discover and develop valuable medicines from Kratom that could benefit the lives of millions.  This is not a sensible approach to regulating this plant.\n\nCurrent peer reviewed studies on Kratom and its constituents have shown that Kratom has no acute toxicity, displays powerful antioxidant and antibacterial properties, assists with drug and alcohol withdrawal symptoms, contains several oxindole alkaloids which have exhibited potent immunomodulation properties, and even contains constituents that have exhibited anti-cancer properties.   A brief search in any scholarly database will present hundreds of peer reviewed studies and clinical trials that can attest to the medical potential of this plant.\n\nAlthough I am not a user of this plant myself, I come from a community that has been hit by the opiate crisis and have lost friends to this horrible epidemic.  Kratom is helping people free themselves from the scourge of opiate addiction and it is criminal to take this valuable tool away from them.\n\nIn summary, the current proposed legislation places the medicinal herb Kratom and its constituents in the Schedule I category which is reserved for highly dangerous, addictive drugs that have NO medical value.  The medical literature has proven Kratom and its constituents to be quite the contrary; a useful, safe, medicinal plant that has been used for thousands of years without incident.  Kratom does not present a significant threat to human health or safety, when compared to legal substances such as alcohol, tobacco, Rx medications, Tylenol, or even coffee.  \n\nThank you for your consideration\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6806","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To start out with I am not a hippie, naturalist, environmentalist, or herbal tea drinking mystic.

I have been using kratom for two years and I believe it is not a Schedule 1 drug.  \n\nI first learned about it from a boyfriend two years ago who, before I met him, used heroin.  After extensive research on the plant, I decided to try it because I had never really liked drinking or any other drug.  I first tried marijuana at the age of 24 and didn't really like that either.  \n\nI lived with that boyfriend for over a year and saw first hand how it kept him from going back to what I understand as one of the most dangerous and addictive drugs out there.  But this isn't his story, this is mine and it's not as dramatic. \n\nI have been able to use kratom without getting addicted to it.  I believe people can get addicted to anything really, it depends on the person to control themselves.  On non-workdays though I barely even think about kratom because I just don't feel the desire to use it.  For me, I just like taking it to make work go faster and more pleasant.  It gives me energy, it makes me even more peppy and sociable (great for developing rapport with clients and helping them).  I take kratom on work days twice a day and I can't measure how much I take, but I can explain it as a little lump at the tip of a teaspoon as how much I take each time.  (My ex-boyfriend did use more, a lot more and I could never use that much because it can cause nausea.  I am also a lightweight with pretty much everything I take.)\n\nKratom has helped me because it instills a positive feeling that helps with depressing times, it helps me with my occasional neck pain, it helps recreationally a little bit to relax, and is overall just not harmful to me.  It's in my personal opinion that more research is done on it to fully understand if there are harmful long term effects or anything dangerous like that, though it seems unlikely to me that there are.  I also believe it shouldn't be used by anyone under 18 but I don't think anyone under 18 should do anything like that because their brains are still developing.  \n\nAbout me: I work full time and have been promoted three times already in the short year I've worked at my company.  I have a car I pay monthly for, fairly good credit, I learn and play Taiko drums (Japanese drumming) and perform with them, and I am a singer in a rock band.  \n\nI appreciate your time in reading this.  If you like rock music and want to verify I am who I say I am, check out Dead Light Shines in a few months.  We're rehearsing right now and will announce me soon as their new singer.  \n\nHappy Holidays!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18576","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyla Pavelski","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please!

I was prescribed Zoloft by a family physician, and quickly learned that the anti-depressant was only harming me. I suffered from all the negative side effects (increased anxiety and panic attacks, rapid and extreme weight loss, extreme fatigue, nausea and vomiting) and after a few months had to stop taking it because my weight was dangerously low, as well as my mental health. I learned to somewhat cope with my mental disorders and was able to live a rather normal college life. However, at the age of 25, I could no longer cope and had to seek professional help again. Against my will and my medical history, the doctor prescribed Zoloft and once again I was sicker than ever, barely managing to get to work or out of my house as my anxiety reached the levels of agoraphobia. I battled with panic attacks, severe anxiety and depression for about 9 months until I finally leveled out and was able to function somewhat normally again. At the age of 30, I found myself in an abusive relationship in which my significant other tried to kill me. This left me traumatized and unable to cope with anything. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. I had horrible night terrors and sweats, my anxiety was unbearable, and I was so depressed I became suicidal. I knew the prescribed medication was not an option since it had only made things worse for me in the past, and I was already at rock bottom. I started seeing a therapist, but it wasn't enough, I needed more help. A friend introduced me to Kratom, he had been taking it for a few years for social anxiety. I was scared to try it because of my past experiences, but honestly, Kratom saved my life. I didn't get high, I didn't get sick, but I was able to get out of bed, which was the first step to start getting my life back together. Kratom took the edge off of my panic attacks and anxiety so that I could breathe and start to cope with them. It helped me stay calm and be able to face my trauma and heal. It pushed away the suicidal thoughts and helped me see hope. It took away the physical pain my depression had caused, and soon I was able to go back to work, go out with my friends, take care of my dog, and even enjoy life! Kratom is a gentle yet effective way to reduce anxiety, whereas the synthetic chemicals in prescription drugs are ironically very powerful and harmful, often given to people who are already sensitive and they get very sick! Please do not take away Kratom, it's a much safer medicine for people with anxiety than the harmful addicting prescription drugs that made me suffer even more. I took Kratom daily for almost 2 years and have since reduced my consumption to only when my anxiety spikes and haven't experienced any withdrawal symptoms.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3615","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marie Bushbaum","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi Im Crystal & I found kratom around 5 months ago.

I am a proprietor of a large walk in herb store in Texas. We handle over 500 different bulk herbs. When we started this in 2000, we did not carry kratom. We began to carry it about 8 years ago due requests from customers and one of our workers that knew about it. Kratom is our largest volume herb and has been helping us grow.\n\nKratom is the most popular herb we sell and I attribute this to the fact is the most useful of the herbs we carry. Its benefits are many, reduced body and head pain, which gives an affect similar to pain reducing coffee. It makes the user feel like going to work and getting things done. It has virtually no effect on motor skills. It is an awesome aid for those wanting to get off of heroin or other opiates or even pysch meds. I have seen many use kratom to successfully get off of these substances with very little ill side effects. In fact the side effects are almost none compared to methadone or other popular opiate withdrawal drugs.\n\nThe benefits of kratom are many the, ill effects are practically none. It is weakly addictive like coffee but it not that hard to get off of, I have done it several times. \n\nThe main issue to me is that Kratom is a God Given herb and our rights to these herbs is attempting to be squashed by government agencies who are claiming to do us a favor by restricting our access. Let me be very clear, your squashing our access rights to a God given herb is the primary issue to me. This herb is blessed on the very first page of the Bible and no agency ever has the right to restrict access to these herbs. Each and every time it is a crime when an agency does this. With marijuana becoming illegal, it has become a way to pack prisons full of people that have hurt no man. I would contest the primary crime committed was charging these people with a crime in the first place. The millions of lives affected and wasted in a cage cause a group of men want to penalize them and make money off of their social security accounts by throwing them in a cage. That is human trafficking and I do not believe that using a ground tree leaf will ever amount to committing a crime and I will aid in any effort to stop criminalizing using a whole herb. What you are proposing is just so incredibly bad, is of rotten ethics and is essentially evil in its self aggrandizement for the pharmaceutical companies, henceforth known as Pharm-A-Corpse. \n\nClearly the effort to criminalize is a method to restrict an herb that is cutting heavily into pharm-a-corpse profits. These companies do not have the right to restrict our rights to any herb cause it impacts their profits. Simply the Pharm-A-Corpse products are inferior to kratom and that is really the problem, so their are trying to pay the DEA to make it illegal. This is so clearly a case of pay for play, it is obvious to most people that is what is going on. I believe that alone would be reason to abolish the FDA and the DEA, neither agency seems to do what it was meant to do. Drug importation is up and the primary importers seem to use government agency's to import it. Kratom is the very best addiction withdrawal aid and can allow an addict to withdrawal safely without a lifetime of methadone addiction. \n\nTheir are zero known deaths caused by kratom and our only complaints we ever get are from the taker getting nausea, usually we end up finding out they are a new user or they took more than usual. This is a form of self regulation, if you take too much kratom you will get nausea and maybe vomit if it is too much. Thus it is self regulating. Kratom is a very safe herb and to restrict its sale in any way is a crime against all citizens of the uSA and Indonesia as it will hurt those fine people that are harvesting this wonderful herb and making a better living for themselves and their family.\n\nThe benefits for kratom are great and the herb is god given and no man has a legitimate right to restrict this wonderful useful and safe herb for any reason, least of all a bunch of greedy pharm-a-corpse companies that want to make the use and possession of this god given herb a felony. Get real, making any restriction on Kratom would be the real crime and thousands or millions jailed because they desire pain relief from a tree life. The entire idea of what you want to do is ludicrous. Get real and do the right thing and throw this whole idea in the trash where it belongs. The people want and demand free trade and this is a perfect example.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22686","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Schanzle","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Is this comment section a joke?

Mine is a personal story, not based upon large scientific studies, but rather on my own experiences with the supplement.\n\nFirst, I should say that I am a 62 year old grandmother, not a \"kid\" looking for the next cool designer drug.  I suffer from several chronically painful conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis resulting in (among other things) bone spurs on my cervical spine, and fibromyalgia.  I have undergone a total knee replacement of my right knee. \n\nUntil I discovered kratom, my only choices consisted of moving up to opiate painkillers, or continuing to try and get through my days in unrelenting pain. While researching options for pain control, I came across a reference to kratom, and turned my reading in that direction.  Honestly, it sounded too good to be true and I've been around long enough to know that when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.  Pain relief from a natural source without horrid side effects and without the nearly inevitable addiction?  Sure.  Go ahead and pull my other leg while you're at it.  \n\nHowever, as more and more offerings by conventional and holistic medicine (physical therapy, meditation, etc.) proved ineffective, I kept circling back to kratom.  I finally decided to try it out, anticipating (as has been my experience with certain other herbal supplements) absolutely no effect. \n\nI have never been more wrong. Just two teaspoons of powder per day, mixed with water, banishes my pain, allows me to move my head freely, allows my hands to have the flexibility needed to spin yarn and knit, allows me to walk and/or to ride my stationary bike to strengthen my knee, and vanquishes the fatigue that chronic pain causes.  I don't know if the lack of fatigue is the natural result of not being in pain, or if it is an effect of the kratom itself, but I don't really care, either.  \n\nUnlike opiates, I do not detect CNS symptoms (feeling 'high', intense sleepiness, etc.).  It does not make me itch all over, and does not make me constipated. There do not appear to be any bad interactions with the other prescription drugs I take for high blood pressure and high cholesterol, as my checkups have shown no change for the worse in my blood test results or blood pressure.  \n\nI see this as no different from using turmeric or ginger, rather than prescription drugs, to reduce inflammation.  Please do not force me to choose between opiate use or nearly debilitating pain when there is a dietary supplement available to do the job.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5790","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I discovered Kratom from a friend in about 2011. At the time my anxiety and social anxiety was taking over my life. I was drinking too much alcohol in order to hang out with friends. I could barely go to a shopping mall without having a panic attack. I started noticing when I was drinking some Kratom tea after doing tons of research on the correct doses (I am also a hypochondriac)  that I could go out to bars/social events/etc without even drinking and have a good time. I was meeting more people and having a great social life all the sudden. I also completely stopped drinking! Since Kratom has changed my life for the better I have met my lovely wife due to not having horrible social anxiety and feeling the need to drink every time I go out. I have started running marathons and ultra marathons and am in the best shape of my life. I also have went to the University of Pittsburgh and obtained my Masters Degree. I have recommended kratom to my good friend who is a veteran. His life was falling apart from PTSD which caused him to divorce his wife and he was on a spiral. It has vastly helped him in only a short couple of months. I feel that is has a lot of potential to help a lot of vets with PTSD. I also know people that Kratom has saved them from being hooked on a cycle pharmaceuticals and even using Kratom to change their life by getting off horrible opiate addictions. If I only knew about Kratom before my sister in law overdosed and died from heroin!\nLong story short Kratom, which is in the coffee family and less addictive than coffee, if used properly by adults ( I have quit for months during tougher financial times) has changed so many lives for the better, definitely mine. I also have had yearly checkups and I told my doctor about it. My blood pressure and my cholesterol have gone down since I have stopped drinking. I worry that a ban will cause people to go back to drinking, opiate addiction, and negatively impact many lives in many ways.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18345","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathan Mori","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I work as a server and personal trainer.

I've found it difficult to take pain killers. They cause me to mentally slow down. But without them I can't do simple tasks that others take for granted. I can't hold my son for more than 30 seconds without my back giving way. I can't give him a bath because bending over causes spasms. Worse, I've moved a few times over the last two years. Each time requiring a new doctor. Each time I have to play a game where the doctor tries to prescribe something new. Almost always it's ineffective or worse has terrible side effects that just don't make it worth it.\n\nKratom was a godsend. It provided the relief without the mental cloudiness. I didn't feel stoned, I felt happy -- both because it does enhance the mood and that I could finally do things again.\n\nI hope that the DEA truly wants to do good in our country. I agree there are drugs out there that destroy our way of life. Kratom is not one of them. It's nothing like what the DEA has claimed. It's nothing like what the media vilify it with. This fearmongering and blatant bias is going to destroy such a beautiful plant that has done nothing but helped so many people. \n\nIt's a shame -- that the uninformed can look at this plant and see it as if it's some hard drug that's similar to a junkie in an ally shooting up. It is the no where even close. It's nothing more than a tea that helps relieve pain and boosts the mood. The opiate-related properties help people trying to clean themselves up from real drugs reduces the withdrawals. It doesn't give you a heroin high -- it just makes the receptors happy enough to keep them from getting sick. I've known family who have had issues with drugs in the past that used Kratom to get themselves clean.  \n\nDo the right thing. Leave this out of the DEA's realm of regulation. Putting any classifications on it does exactly opposite of what it's positives are. It's a way to treat something cleanly and easily without having to jump through regulation after regulation. Their are plenty of other things to worry about. This isn't one of them.\n\nI fear this is dropping on deaf ears. After fighting for my country to support freedom I've yet again seen it all for nothing. Just another loss. It breaks my heart. I hurt every moment of every day because of it and all I see in return is a slap in the face.

After they stopped prescribing me I was forced to buy oxycontin to fuel my addiction for about 2 years. Our town Pinckney, MI was flooded with oxycontin. I was doing 160mg a day at times. I stole money from my parents and used all my lifes savings. I got arrested for possession of oxycontin when I was 17. Got a felony and went to jail and many years of probation. The oxy ran out so I started driving to Detroit to get heroin. I was an IV user of heroin from 18-23 years old. I then went to a methadone clinic. Worst decision of my life. Methadone is way harder to get off of than heroin. I was there for 3 years and my dose was up to 120mg a day. I woke up every morning puking up stomach vile for 20 minutes. I was useless. I did nothing productive during this time. NOTHING. In my 3 years there I saw ZERO people successfully get off of methadone out of 500 people. I wasn't going to be one of those people that just stayed on that debilitating drug my whole life. Something inside of me clicked and told myself I'm better than this. I wanted more for myself and wanted to stop being a burden for the people that loved me. I told the doctor that I wanted to start weaning myself off. He didn't want me to get off, he said I needed to be on it longer. I knew he just wanted the money and did not give a shit about any of us. So I started weaning myself off. I told him I was doing this and he eventually caved. I was slowly tapering off. After months of doing this it was finally time to get completely off. When you come off of methadone it takes 30 days or longer of horrible withdrawals. Luckily I had Kratom to help me with these withdrawals. I let myself get sick a little bit before I took my first dose of kratom to make sure all the opiates were out of my system. After my first dose of Kratom I started feeling better. I had very minimum withdrawals. I was so surprised. This plant that is more like the coffee plant that opium is absolute miracle plant for people trying to get off heroin or any prescription pill. Without Kratom I could still be one of those people going to methadone clinic daily doing absolutely nothing with there lives or maybe even dead by now. After a couple weeks of being on Kratom I decided to move into the mountains in Colorado. Best decision of my life. I'm going on my 6th year here and my 6th year completely clean from heroin, thanks to Kratom. I've had the same job for 6 years making pretty good money for someone my age. I've become myself again and I like who I am. When I heard that the FDA was banning Kratom I was very sad. Sad because if it does become illegal so many people who are addicted to opiates won't be able to help themselves with this \"disease.\"  If the FDA makes Kratom illegal I will now no the government DOES NOT care about their citizens at all. Do one thing right, please.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1464","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin Fitzgerald","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This us a good,  safe, natural product, which helps millions of people.

Several years ago, I experienced a serious injury to my thoracic spine, which required multiple nerve blocks and opioid pain medication. I found that the 40mg oxycodone that I was prescribed daily left me unable to think clearly enough to fully fulfill my obligations to my clients.

I was most concerned, however, to find that I could not simply stop talking the medicine without experiencing flu-like symptoms. \n\nAt a time where I could not impair my cognitive function, but could not afford feeling ill, I discovered kratom. Kratom allowed me to maintain a clear head, avoid the cessation symptoms, and feel comfortable enough to work with the aid of OTC NSAIDS. \n\nI still deal with pain on a daily basis, but I was able to avoid the dependency that so many have experienced.

I found out about Kratom while I was in a 6 month rehab program for an addiction issue that I had with pharmaceutical opiates. I completed my program, and was able to put these issues behind me. However, a couple months after I was still struggling with my clinical depression and social anxiety disorders. These were the same issues that had led me to addiction in the first place. I was able to purchase some Kratom from a local botanicals shop, and the all natural, harmless plant has helped immensely to lower my anxiety and depression, while building up my energy and mood. It has been 3 years, and I have never gone back to self medicating with old harmful habits. Through working my recovery program and using kratom as a supplement, I have turned my life around completely, and I have never been more productive, motivated, and confident in my entire 41 years on this planet. Though, I still have my ups and downs, kratom has helped to keep me on a righteous path without any negative side effects, whatsoever. This plant is a gift from God that can do so much good for so many people. It literally frightens me to think, not only of myself, but for millions of others, that if this safe natural resource is taken away, the impact will be devastating. So I am asking, pleading with you, to reevaluate this decision, and allow kratom to remain the natural supplement that it is. I am all for putting an age restriction on it, but it needs to remain easily available, for responsible adults that benefit immensely from its natural relief, including, vets, elderly, and chronic pain sufferers. Thank you for taking the time to read my comment. God bless you, and all the people that are struggling, in one way or another.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2945","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William McAlaine jr","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI am against the ban on kratom. I do not believe it should be a controlled substance.\n\nI will highlight kratom's medicinal value, as well as consider it's abuse potential.\n\nI have suffered from chronic pain in my back and hips since September 2014. My pain is bad enough to prevent me from enjoying all of the activities I once did. However, the underlying cause is not severe enough to warrant surgery at my young age. While I am not currently using kratom, I did use it for a short time  about a month. It had a mild positive effect on pain, and fewer negative effects when compared to pharmaceutical opioids. In fact, the only negative effect I experienced was temporary nausea when I first consumed it, which was from ingesting the leaves with the tea instead of filtering them out. With multiple cups of kratom tea, I was never mentally impaired.\n\nI stopped using kratom because managing pain through a prescription is more affordable and convenient at this time. However, it is good to know I have a natural option should I need it. Unfortunately, scientific study has not been exhaustive, and scheduling will make that even more unlikely. So far, evidence suggest that \"kratom, kratom extracts, and molecules isolated from kratom can alleviate various forms of pain in animal models.\" [1] Combined with a multitude of anecdotal evidence, it would be foolish to say that kratom is of no medicinal value. Mild pain relief is still pain relief. \n\nNow for an observation regarding abuse potential:\n\nI work for a helpline that takes calls of people suffering from substance abuse issues. A common scenario that I hear is that a person has become dependent on a dangerous substance, such a heroin, because a safe alternative to pain relief is not made available. Perhaps if an herbal supplement like kratom was readily available, and more people knew about it, a percentage of lives would be saved from the physical, psychological, and legal heartache caused by dangerous drugs. Will some people abuse it? Yes. Some people abuse alcohol, but prohibition often hurts more than it helps. \n\nIn closing I ask that the DEA will allow the American people to make informed decisions as adults when it comes to things that can do more good than harm, while you focus efforts on the substances that are doing more harm than good. Let kratom be an unscheduled herbal supplement. \n\n\n[1] Prozialeck WC, Jivan JK, Andurkar SV. Pharmacology of Kratom: An Emerging Botanical Agent With Stimulant, Analgesic and Opioid-Like Effects.

Both these conditions cause extreme acute pain that cannot be cured and has been described by doctors as \"worse than cancer pain.\" \n\nMany EDS patients in similar conditions are prescribed high opioid dosages.  However, my spouse has a negative reaction to opioids that causes them to become extremely angry and aggressive.  When she was on Oxycontin briefly, our daughter said  \"Dama has changed--she's not the same person anymore.\"   Even though I'm her sole care-taker, I briefly considered ending the relationship rather than risk it becoming abusive for myself or our kid.\n\nInstead, my spouse swore never to take opioids again, even though the doctors haven't been able to find any other medication that successfully blocks pain from this condition (we went through almost all the opioid family drugs). She became entirely bedbound, and would often spend all day in the dark, frequently weeping.  She could hardly have a place in our child's life.  \n\nThen my research turned up kratom, and we decided to start with a low dose and slowly work our way up.  The change is miraculous. Kratom was more effective than the opioids and instead of having a negative impact it was mood elevating and helped her be cheerful even in the face of continued pain (nothing that leaves you conscious will really stop this level of pain).  On Kratom, my spouse has been able to transition to using a wheelchair and even occasionally walking.\n\nWhen the ban seemed imminent, my spouse and I had a very serious conversation about quality of life. She says that without kratom, she will likely chose suicide -- and to be honest, I support her in that.\n\nBut I can say with no hesitation that if kratom is banned, we would try to find a way to continue using it. I don't want my child to lose her parent, any more than I want my spouse to live in agonizing pain and distress.  Blocking kratom may cost my family a life -- or maybe it will just turn us into criminals who have to rely on dangerous street sources! How is either outcome preferable to keeping it safe and legal?\n\nI would welcome regulation that required kratom to pass basic certification for purity and percentages, or that required buyers to be sent information about safe usage.  But I beg you not to prioritize the desire to police recreational users at the cost of killing disabled users.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5438","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nMy name is Matt Adams and I'm a 30-year old working professional in the sports industry.

I have used Kratom to help in managing symptoms of severe depression and anxiety. I had previously been self medicating with Opiates to somewhat control these disorders. I was slowly killing myself, mentally and physically. I then found myself spiraling downward because of these opiates, what once I thought helped me was now ruining me. I quit my jobs because they became too difficult to complete. I am a mother and found myself not being able to provide for or play with my children. Since making a switch off opiates, I am now getting help for my disorders. Kratom has not healed my mental issues but it has allowed me to comfortably start creating the life I want to live. I use kratom as a supplement to a healthier lifestyle. I am now working and playing with my children. I am eating right and working toward goals. I was able to work up the courage and energy to get help through counseling. I do not believe I would have been able to do this if it weren't for this plant coming in my life at the right time.

If this plant is banned people are going to die. Look at Alabama. Overdoses increased rapidly after the statewide kratom ban. You are in the middle of an epidemic previously unseen in this country.

There have been NO confirmed deaths related to the consumption of kratom alone and there is also no verified documentation supporting ill effects of this plant. This plant which is NOT an opiate, as claimed by the DEA, and is impossible to overdose on. This plant has helped hundreds of thousands of people overcome addiction to narcotic painkillers and illicit drugs such as herion. Scheduling this natural plant as a schedule 1 drug is completely unwarranted and will solely result in countless individuals turning to illicit drugs in order to cope with pain and addiction. As a scientist, i have conducted countless research projects and have concluded that kratom presents numerous medical benefits. Scheduling kratom as an illicit drug with \"no medical value\" will do nothing accept increase crime and further worsen the opiate epidemic that is responsible for the deaths of thousands of people each year. Kratom has done wonders for my pain management and has given me my life back. Without kratom, i will be forced to turn back to pharmaceutical drugs that will again spiral my life out of control. I beg you, with all of my heart, to keep kratom an unscheduled drug in order to maintain the fight against the opiate epidemic in America. Any other decision will come with great regret and cost the lives of millions of people across the globe.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8008","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Cranias","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used Kratom, to get me off of addictive opiates. I have very bad back issues, and about 15 years ago, I was taking so many pain meds, that I could hardly function. I was able to use Kratom, to ween me off those horrible drugs.  Now, Instead of buick a horrible drug addict. I use Kratom instead. I know longer have all the horrible side effects, that the pain pills, made me suffer through. Those pain pills, would often make unable to be sexual with my wife. Which caused us alot of marital problems. Know, I only use Kratom, to help with my pain. I also find, it took my need to take psych drugs. So I was able to get off of all of that too. In short, Kratom makes me a good person. It keeps me from being a drug addict, or junkie. And, It also allows me to live a pretty much drug free life, and it gets rid of the pain, far better that the pills the doctors gave me. So, I ask that the powers that be, please keep kratom legal. Please dont take our healthy medicines away. Please put the peoples interests, above those of Big Pharma, or any big business interests. Please allow us the freedom, to use herbs, to treat our health problems. Please allow us to be free, to decide for ourselves. Because making Kratom Illegal, will result in hundreds, if not thousands of over dose deaths. People like me, will have to go back on these dangerous drugs, that hardly work even close to as well, as Kratom does. Please allow us to be free to decide, what we want to put into our own bodies.

I get to points I just don't even trust Dr's anymore,  they're not helping me. I feel they are just running tests that causes me many times to be threatened by homelessness just to pay. So I have chosen to take my life back. I've changed diets and am using many natural alternatives,  but now I'm up against you, the DEA and also the FDA saying natural things are unsafe or should not be used to have a healthy life. I was so much worse taking pills, one to treat something,  another to treat side effects and I felt horrible. You cannot even trust foods anymore with so many chemicals added. I feel good way more than not and living healthier should be praised. Natural is the future. If you ban kratomwhat is next? I'm scared to mention anything else I use because that might be next! Kratom keeps me active, mentally focused and feeling good. I am productive.\nI support keeping kratom legal and available for myself and THOUSANDS of people to choose for themselves to use. It is a much healthier alternative than pills that require more pills to treat. We want to stand for ourselves.  Kratom is so much less harmful than many things. It is not some recreational drug people are not using it to alter their mind, it is serenity and piece of mind for many to not die from medication that is KNOWN to not be safe and cause deaths. Kratom is so much safer that anything over the counter even.\nPlease, do not schedule kratom or take it away it is saving so many more lives than any you can show as deaths. Many kratom users are responsible people who now want to live,  not just street junkies. You admit Dr's created addicts, yet you want Dr's to either stop cold turkey treating or give them even more addictive alternatives....... kratom is that answer.

I have tried multiple prescriptions and therapies to no lasting avail. Narcotics only made me a zombie and I could not take the dose needed and continue to function in society. I have also suffered from a stroke as a result of vasculitis, which has caused residual neurological and muscular issues. I have PCOS, endometriosis, painful fibroids, am anemic and fibromyalgia.\n\nI was tired, could hardly move and very miserable. I am an ambitious person. I want to be independent, I did not want to take all the medications that doctors wanted to prescribe me and just give up and stay at home on disability payments. So I researched my options and decided to try Kratom. I use about a teaspoon in my tea every morning. It helps my pain, helps me stay alert and function. I can work efficiently at my job (more than full time), pursue my career, and take care of my daughter with special needs and my daughter with Lupus. I do not have time to be tired, or have brain fog. I need to live my life. I have goals and people that depend on me.

I cannot help that there are people that will use Kratom, alcohol or even aerosol cleaners in combination with other drugs to get high. I should not be punished for other peoples poor choices.

After rolling my vehicle 6 times and being ejected, I suffered over 8 spinal fractures/breaks, a broken sacrum, and nerve damage that haunts me till this day.  At 22 years old, you normally don't find yourself having to take hardcore addictive narcotics just to function like a normal young man.  After 5 years of battling the on and off cycle that can so easily proceed a major injury with prescription opiates, I found kratom.\n\n  There is a clear-cut cognitive dissonance in this wonderful, beautiful, but sometimes backwards country of ours.  We're so quick to ban or schedule the subtlest of medicines out of fear and lack of education, meanwhile every other commercial on TV is either for alcohol or a pharmaceutical drug.\n\n  Kratom has MASSIVELY altered my life, for the positive.  It is used as a SUBSTITUTE for synthetic pharmaceutical opiates (which have torn apart my family, as well as thousands of others), and with the proper education and mindset, I have come to be able to manage my debilitating pain while also not shouldering the burden of withdrawal and abuse of opiates.\n\nPLEASE, if only one part of this statement is read, PLEASE let it be the following:\n\n  Yes, kratom (in my experience) can become habit-forming.  But so can coffee, sugar, and hundreds of other substances that we don't even consider to be drugs when they kill thousands every year.  Scheduling this PLANT will hinder our great nation's ability to study, regulate, and properly import or dispense this natural and SAFE plant to the thousands of people within our borders who suffer daily from debilitating pain.  The horror stories that come with every new drug are not to be clung to by the uneducated out of fear, but are to be seen for what they usually are, anomalies that have sprung forth out of the lack of education of new drugs.\n\n  The very companies that are lobbying to have this PLANT banned or scheduled are not acting out of loving concern for their fellow neighbors and loved ones, but are acting swiftly with only profit on their minds.  As of now, kratom is clearly cutting into the profits of one of the world's largest industries, and IT SHOULD.  This country has had its fill of watching their family members and lovers fall off of the deep end and spiral out of control from the over-abundance of Oxycodone and Hydrocodone that has flooded our houses and streets over the last 12 years.  Kratom has surfaced in America for a reason, and just like medical marijuana, it isn't going to go away if banned.  Cracking down on this PLANT will only ruin more lives, the very lives of people who are already suffering.\n\n  If given the chance, the scientific research on Kratom will quickly show the American public all they need to know about this natural and safe alternative to the status-quo of pain relief:\n\n1. Kratom works on the opiate receptors in our brains, relieving pain and sometimes giving pleasure.\n\n2. Just like any substance that can be used, IT CAN BE ABUSED as well.\n\n3. With proper testing, regulation, and education, the market will drive quality and effectiveness of this PLANT upwards, resulting in the highest quality Kratom and a vastly more educated consumer base.\n\n4. The very companies and conglomerates that are lobbying today to ban this threat to their own product can engage in this movement and PROFIT til the cows come home.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18177","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Anding","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have a terrible injury to my neck. I have 2 degenerated disks in my neck, c6/c7. I have tried everything from physical therapy, injections and medications. Unfortunately I got addicted to my medication and it was a long, hard struggle to get off of the pills. I don't wish that on my worst enemy. I was introduced to kratom January 2016. Omg, the pain relief was awesome. I wish I found it sooner. I always had a problem trying to get some sort of pain relief without the high of pills, but not anymore. I'm more focused and full of energy than ever. I am the great mom I once was before the medication spiral. Kratom does not get you high, just gives you pain relief so you can get on with everyday life while keeping the cravings for that high at bay. I never felt better and I'm so thankful to be off of all pharmaceutical medications. This stuff is a god-send. Please don't make me give this up and go back to those zombie pills and the addiction rollar coaster!! Do your research and see why we are fighting so hard for our beloved plant! Oh one more thing, the people I have met in our social media groups are so wonderful. These people have overcome so much with the help of this plant. People are recovering from hard core drug addictions trying to get clean and succeeding! This is a great thing! Children are getting their parents back, parents are getting their children back, etc...   The only people hurting are the pharmaceutical companys' wallets! Shame on them. We are not robots or puppets, we are everyday people trying to make our lives better with the help of this miraculous plant!

I am a 40 year old working professional and take Kratom daily as a dietary supplement to aid in relieving pain.  I have a rare genetic disorder called Ehlers Danlos Sydrome along with several co-morbids.  I have degenerative Disc Desiree and multi level bulging discs with arthritis and endplate deformities.  I have also had several surgeries and a failing total knee replacement due to EDS. \n\n I have worked off and on during my adulthood and have had to take several years off due to the chronic pain and fatigue along with surgeries from my condition .  The past 4 years I have been consistently taking OxyContin, tramadol, gabapentin and klonopin to help deal with this condition so I can try to function and work.  With the opioid addiction crisis I chose to look for alternatives to aid with my symptoms and provide me the ability to continue to work.  I came across Kratom 6 months ago and did a lot of research and sought out those that have taken Kratom as a supplement for a significant amount of time.  I then decided to try it for myself to see if it would assist with my issues.  \n\nI have discussed taking Kratom with my Dr. and she is on board with me taking it.  With her guidance I have lowered my opiod intake and cut out the OxyContin and klonopin completely.  I am enjoying the relief of my symptoms without the fuzzy head that opioids left me with.  \n\nMy employer has complimented my job performance since I started to take Kratom and he has noticed my increased productivity due to having a clear mind.  I am able to do more around the house when I get home from work, that I was unable to do when on the opioids. \n\n I do believe Kratom needs some regulation alomg the lines of other dietary supplements on the market.  I do not believe that it should be scheduled and made illegal along with cocaine, heroin and meth.  Kratom is not a substance that is harmful anymore than coffee or sugar.   Please allow the research to openly continue so millions of people currently suffering can learn Kratom to aid with their issues.  \n\nSincerely\n\nKristen Blankenship","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3944","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kristen Blankenship","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It should never have been the domain of government to decided what a free man or woman can and cannot put into their own bodies,  by making this decision to create a war on inanimate objects you are creating a war on users and addicts.

I live in Henrico County, just outside of Richmond Virginia.  I work as a manager at an Italian restaurant.  I completely 100% oppose the DEA's intention to schedule Kratom (mitrogynene speciosa) as a schedule 1 drug, or any schedule for that matter.  My reasons are as follows.  \n\nI first heard about Kratom from a close friend of mine who had a history of opiate addiction.  She explained to me that while it targets the same receptors in the brain as opiates such as heroin, oxycodone, morphine, etc., it was much safer and less habit forming.  \n\nA couple months later another friend who had spent years on pain pills because of a motor vehicle accident which broke both his legs had broken the heroin habit he developed after years of pain pill abuse by using Kratom.  He gave me some to try.  I was very hesitant to put anything unknown in my body after hearing so many horror stories about things like spice and bath salts.  I began at this point to do my own research and discovered that not only was Kratom useful to people with chronic pain and opiate addiction, but it also seemed to have benefits in the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and anxiety, such as myself.  I have recreationally used marijuana for years because it helped my anxiety and depression, so I was excited to hear of a legal plant whose use wouldn't affect my livelihood or my freedom.\n\nOnce I finally tried I was amazed at how much it helped lessen my anxiety and depression.  I also have adult ADHD and have been medicated for that almost my whole life.  The kratom helps my focus and attention as well. The biggest and most surprising result was that it somehow suppressed any urge I had to drink alcohol, and alcoholism is a battle ive been losing for most of my adult life and even in my teenage years.  These are my personal reasons for wanting kratom to remain legal or at the very least regulated for consenting adults.  \n\nThere are countless people however who use this plant for relief debilitating health conditions such as krohns disease, fibromyalga, and many many more.  These peoples lives would be drastically affected if kratom became illegal.  Also veterans who served our country and were diagnosed with PTSD take it too.  These people don't deserve to have their lives pulled out from under them simply over a plant.  A plant its impossible to overdose on.  While there are claims that people have died from taking it, it is my understanding that those people also had other more dangerous drugs in their bodies.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel that there are enough people in jail that shouldn't be.  The war on drugs has been lost long ago and to continue to add things like kratom to scheduling will do nothing but exacerbate the prison problem in this country and probably cause a rise in opiate abuse, something which has already reached epidemic numbers.  Please keep this safe nutritional supplement legal and help us in  this war against opiate use and overdose.  Far too many have been lost in this battle already.\n\nThank you for your time\nSincerely,\nVictoria Donovan-Hutchins","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15714","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Victoria Donovan Hutchins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am deeply thankful you are taking the time to hear from the public on this important matter, which will impact millions of people in the United States. Your consideration is much appreciated.\n\nI am a 39-year-old, responsible, happily married, classical musician, and mother-of-two who has been safely and moderately using kratom for the past two years to treat my lifelong struggles with anxiety and depression. I discovered this wonderful plant following many failed attempts to treat my mood disorders via pharmaceuticals prescribed by my psychiatrist. Kratom is the only thing that has consistently worked for me after twenty-five years of trying standard methods. In the two years I have been using kratom on a daily basis, I have experienced no increase in tolerance to its mood-improving benefits and have experienced no negative side-effects. Kratom does not produce a high (and I know what a high feels like, as I was prescribed Adderall at one point for attention-deficit issues). In my experience, kratom is safer and more beneficial than any prescription medicine; it produces a gentle (more gentle than coffee) increase in energy and mental focus and improves feelings of well-being while not causing any unwanted effects. Another miraculous aspect of kratom is that it does not lose its effectiveness over time as with prescription drugs and other substances; preventing tolerance is made possible by rotating strains of kratom, each of which has slightly differing alkaloids. My tolerance has actually lowered over the past two years from 4 grams a day to only 2 grams while enjoying the same results. There is no drug on earth that works as beneficially, as consistently over time and as harmlessly; thankfully kratom is not a drug. \n\nMy husband (who was at first skeptical) and my children have been thrilled with the help kratom has afforded me, so kratom has indirectly had an immensely positive impact on my family, and even my friends and coworkers. Please do not categorize this plant as an illegal, recreational drug;  to do so would endanger millions of Americans who rely on the health benefits that Kratom alone can provide.\n\nI appreciate your intention to ensure public safety.

I had a compression fracture in my thoracic spine and a degenerative disc in my lumbar region. I have been in pain every day since then. Simple tasks like doing housework and caring for the hygeine of my special needs child causes back pain and pinching in my sciatic region. I drink 2-3 cups of kratom tea per day to take the edge off of the pain. I don't want to drink this tea indefinitely, but I want it to help me during the process of rehabilitating my back and building muscle. \n\n  I find kratom to be a natural alternative to prescription pain relievers. It is less addictive with fewer side effects than prescription pain relievers have. It doesn't upset my stomach the way prescription pain relievers have in the past. I have never been addicted to prescription pain pills, but I know after being on them for 2 weeks after knee surgery I could feel the discomfort of missing a dose. I do feel a slight discomfort on wanting to consume kratom at least once per day, but I don't think it's as severe as prescription drugs as far as addiction is concerned because I have been drinking this tea every day for 8 months rather than the trouble I had after 2 weeks with the prescription meds.I don't think it would be hard to stop taking kratom. It would probably be equivilent to quitting coffee; simply uncomfortable for a bit.\n\n   I don't think kratom should be a class 1 drug. I don't know a lot about the classes, but this powdered leaf is more mild than pain pills, but relieves pain that advil doesn't and without the stomach upset. I've hurt my stomach before after surgery on my knee taking advil at it's prescribed dose and frequency. If the supreme court is worried about this leaf since it does produce a state of euphoria the best course of action would be to regulate it's access to minors. The euporia is similar to consuming large amounts of caffeine or similar, but more mild than pain pills and shouldn't be restricted from adults. I have read kratom helps people with opiate addictions to beat their addiction because it's chemical properties bind to opioid receptors in the brain, but it is not an opiate itself. That sounds promising.\n\nSincerely,\nLourie Paulk","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15593","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lourie Paulk","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern\n\nPlease consider doing more research before adding Kratom to the controlled substance regulations.

Before I found Kratom, I had to go to the ER on many occasions to be prescribed narcotics. The pain from Crohn's disease is excruciating, and debilitating, to the point where I cannot leave my bed, and my wife has to help me to the ER or a clinic, where I can receive opiates, normally Tramadol. I cannot function the way I need to in order to be successful with opiates, and they make me zone out and unfocused. Since finding Kratom I have not had one major Crohn's flare-up, and have been able to function.\nKratom has given me a life I had previously only dreamed of. I have since learned web development, and started 2 businesses of my own, both of which produce income taxes for the IRS. I am so busy with one of my businesses, that I may have to hire someone in the next couple of years to help me.\nKratom not only helps me with Crohn's disease, but also with back pains. I have been a laborer for almost 20 years, working in restaurants and as a dog bather. I have had to do a lot of heavy lifting, and it has taken a toll on my lower and upper back. Though Kratom does not completely take away the pain, it helps me to function and takes the edge off the pain. \nThough many smoke shops are trying to tout Kratom as a 'legal high', I do not believe it gets one 'high'. There is a limit to how much Kratom you can ingest before it makes you feel sick to your stomach. I have never felt high from Kratom, and consider myself an experienced user. I believe Kratom should be regulated, and taken out of smoke shops where it has gained a bad name. When I was searching for something to help me with my pain, I was not searching for something to get me high. I found two reputable vendors online who do not package it in a way that would appeal to children or someone looking to get high. Kratom is very safe. People who are looking to abuse drugs will be disappointed with Kratom. Unfortunately these people will not use Kratom to help themselves, I assume. They will find something to take them out of the reality they do not want to face. Kratom does not take one out of reality. It is very subtle, and I suggest for anyone who wants it banned to try it for themselves so they can understand firsthand how safe it is. They will quickly come to realize how silly it is to ban this natural product.\nWhen I first heard the news of the ban, I tapered myself off Kratom quickly, and discontinued use. I would say it was easier to quit than caffeine, and much easier to quit than nicotine. It was worlds easier to quit than alcohol. I had a decade-long problem with alcohol. I used alcohol to cope with hard times I fell upon in 2005, and I became dependent on it, getting drunk every night. It was a major challenge for me to quit, and Kratom helped me to stop abusing alcohol, though it took much will of my own. I couldn't sleep, and had to use melatonin and chamomile tea every night. Now I may have one alcoholic beverage per month, and I feel much better. I quit my habit in October of 2014, about a year after finding Kratom. My point is that Kratom was not what saved me--I am the one who saved myself, but because I was no longer in pain all the time with the help of Kratom, I was able to 'see the light' and help myself. When you are in constant pain all the time, it is hard to think rationally.\nI really appreciate your time. I am sure you are so busy that you will not have time to read my story, but I hope you can at least glance over it.\nRespectfully,\n-Collin Stubblefield","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0408","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Collin Stubblefield","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 41 year old female insurance professional who is a recovering addict fr heroin.

That was about two years ago and I never turned back. It helped me overcome some ailments and live a more normal life. It didn't make me feel depressed and it didn't make me feel high,  just made me feel normal. Normal is what I've wanted for so long so this plant means so much to me. To this day I've completely gotten my life back and then some more,  I owe it all to kratom. Even my mom has said \" you're a better you than you ever been since taking kratom.\" It's too true and I thank God for finding this plant. Please reconsider this ban, this will affect a lot of people's lives in a negative way and it scares me that I might go back to where I was two years ago. I know Florida decided on not to ban it after their research showed a low risk and wasn't a danger to public health. I have a lot of confidence that the FDA will find the same results, this plant has so much good than bad. I mean everything has a negative to it, even food or too much sun exposure, that's just reality. This situation is way bigger than just me and on Aug. 31st, I thought oh wow, this is going to be bad for me and some other people but that's it. Well I was way wrong, there's so many veterans, single moms, and ex addicts that got their life back with help from this plant. It's very moving and I hope you'll feel it too.

I became a Reiki Master and became knowledgeable with herbal remedies, which became a part of my daily routine. \nInformation regarding Kratom was shared by a friend/client of mine who was facing a battle with lymphoma. She too was using herbal remedies for pain management, kratom being one of them. She had much success with kratom and cured herself with natural remedies.  \nI was diagnosed with arthritis in my left hip many months ago. Instead of using opiates to help relief the pain, I began using kratom. I had alot of positive success with kratom without any side effects. I prefer to use kratom over any opiates or other pharmaceutical medications. After sharing my decision with not only my primary care physician and orthopedic doctors, they noted my file with \"continue herbal remedies\". \nDue to my success of pain management with kratom, my son who was diagnosed bipolar type I, OCD, ODD, ADHD, and social anxiety asked if there was something to help him. He began taking white tabatha kratom via capsules, which was recommended. He stated during his interview with a represented/nurse/social worker of his insurance company, since he began kratom, he has felt alot better. He knows there is no \"cure\" for his mental health issues but kratom has helped him considerably.People use Kratom for many reasons ranging from treating depression, anxiety, fatigue, chronic pain, migraines, etc. Kratom has many uses for many different ailments. Many people who use Kratom used to use more severe pharmaceutical drugs to treat their ill-nesses, but having experienced far too many side effects now use Kratom. Kratom has also been used by many people as a cure for addiction to various drugs, even including hardcore illegal drugs. including heroin.\n\n All types of people use Kratom. Kratom is used by both upper and lower class, educated and uneducated, conservatives and liberals, all races and ethnicity and all ages. Kratom is not some teen-craze but is most commonly used by adults, a lot like Coffee. The same types of people who drink coffee also eat Kratom. \n\nKratom has a long history of being utilized in many Asian countries for thousand of centuries.  One of the earliest mentions of Kratom was by Pieter Korthals in the early 19th century, a Dutch Botanist who described its flowers as reminding him somewhat of a Bishops mitre. Thus, he named this tree Mitragyna. In the time of Korthals, Kratom was a historically used remedy in Thailand. It was used as a cure all for various physical and mental ailments. The ancient history of Kratom is unknown, and sources describing its use prior to European Colonization are scarce. Regardless, there is little doubt that this tree had been used by the indigenous populations of Southeast Asia for millennia. Typically, Kratom is used by laborers or farmers who would use the leaves on the tree for energy while working, as Coffee drinkers use coffee in the morning or as a pick me up.\n\nIn reality, you dont get \"high\" from kratom anymore than you get high from Coffee. If anyone claims that Kratom makes you \"high\" then they must also claim that Coffee makes you \"high\" by the same logic. Kratom is compared to coffee in many ways. Kratom comes from the coffee family; however instead of the beans being powdered and used the leaf is powdered with Kratom. Kratom is also similar to coffee in the mildness of its effects. Kratom produces calming effects, but also stimulating effects at the same time. The strength of these effects is exactly the same as Coffee is and at exactly the same amount. Though, one could argue that Coffee is much stronger since coffee must be diluted and mixed with water before used.\n\nThere must be a working together of individuals in order to prevent the ban on this most heavenly herb remedy which has helped so many individuals, including myself and my son. I DO NOT want to go on opiates or other pharmaceutical medications especially those I could possibly become addictive to, which would ruin my life, as they have my body!  \n\nLet's keep Kratom FREE!!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5512","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cindy Slavens","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Eric Itow and I am 29yrs old. I have a great career doing outside sales for an engineering firm that specializes in hydraulics and pneumatics.  My goal is that the DEA drops any and all attempts to regulate alkaloids mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine and Kratom. I have safely consumed the plant since March 2014 and it has turned my life around. Please read below as to how it has changed my life, how I started, and why it should not be regulated. I believe in this so much as I will be willing to testify against Congress to show how it has changed my life.\n\nI am a Soldier. I spent 6 years with the Minnesota National Guard and have the privilege to deploy to Afghanistan from Aug 2011 to May of 2012 I had requested to be selected for this deployment. After spending nearly 2 years away from my family and friends I came home. (Basic & AIT Sept 21st, 2010- June 23rd, 2011 and Afghanistan August 18th, 2011-May 1st, 2012). in 4 years I had achieved the rank of Sergeant and distinguished myself in my unit as one of the most experienced and discipline operators in my unit. My contract ended June 7th, 2016 with 12 awards including 2 ARCOM, AAM, and good conduct ribbon. I almost have every appointment order my unit has to offer including ADSO, Training NCO, Aircraft Commander, and Team Leader. I love being a soldier, I miss it every day. I have plans to volunteer my time to my unit to help them with other activities. Because of health issues, I had to pass on re-signing for another contract with the Minnesota Army National Guard giving up a $26,000 bonus.\n\nNovember 12, 2011 Jalalabad Afghanistan I was involved in an accident that had injured my back. It was debilitating enough to warrant me to request that I be sent to doctor on base. At that time I was a private 5 months out of training. I was blessed with great leadership and trusted the leadership of 3rd Brigade 25th Infantry Division. The Acting Platoon Sargent, SSG Butts, told me to not go to the doctor in fear it that would take me off flight status and non-mission capable. I will always place the mission first is a lone from the Soldiers Creed. We memorized that and in one voice yelled it every morning in Basic Training and I believe it; even to this day. SSG Butts told me that when the time comes that he would take care of me. I listened to him and through much pain continued doing my job, at times with a full combat load of 60lb vest on.\n\nFast forward one year and I am at home. I went to the VA and did a Post Deployment Health Risk Assessment (PDHRA) and was waiting the ruling on everything I have claimed was wrong with me while in Afghanistan. It was a thick letter; I flipped to the section where I claimed my back injury. DENIED& due to insufficient evidence. Because I never went in to see the doctor I didnt have a paper trail to support my claim. SSG Butts never followed up with me and I was out of options. They were reluctant to even give me a claim for high blood pressure and I have tracked my blood pressure before, during, and after my deployment.\n\nBy this time it was the 3rd year of me contract and I had been able to work through the pain. Up to that point I had never failed a Physical Fitness Test (PT Test). Summer of 2013 my back pain started bothering me more and I ended up failing my PT test by mere seconds. I was so disappointed I pulled my self together to then pass the test the following month. That would be the first and last test I failed in my Army Career.\n\nThe last two years of my contract were very difficult because if continuing issues with back, neck, and ribcage issues. I had gone into the VA Emergency Room multiple times because of chest pains, back pains, and neck pains. To this day I am battling them with ridiculous requirements to visit the VA multiple times a week requiring me to miss up to 3 hours a work a day. This is to accommodate the physicians hours of last appointment of 2 or 3pm with a 1 hour drive to the Minneapolis VA. They want to put me on pain killers and I said NO. I do not want to be prescribed narcotics. Instead I am on Etodolac and Naproxen that may cause ulcers in my stomach.\n\nI finally said that is enough. In the Army we find a solution, we dont wait for someone to hand us a fix in a bottle. I was telling my best friend about my back pain and he mentioned Kratom. It was my birthday, March 2014, and he bought me a sample. It was a sigh of relief. I have since learned how to take it, hot much to take, and how frequently to take it. The side effects are minor, bloating, flatulence, and decreased appetite. I take it every day without a buildup of tolerance, I dont crave it if I have a day that I am pain free, and it is long lasting.\n\nToday I have a successful career making enough money to live on my own, in a house I bought with a cute dog and a big garage. Kratom allows me to fulfil my life as I want and I am able to.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2736","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Itow","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Who the fuck do you people think you are.

M.speciosa has minor withdrawl symptoms similar to a very mild cold or mild flu lasting 1 to 2 days. At the other end of the spectrum we have the narcotics hydrocodone and oxycodone which produce withdrawl symptoms so debilitating that the patient is unable to function for days or sometimes weeks without another dose of large magnitude.\nIn Florida the drug hydrocodone was recently elevated from a class 3 to a class 2\nbecause of its high rate of abuse and ,imho,its addictogenic characteristic.\nPeople can overdose on hydrocodone,once addicted the patient has lost the ability to choose. I applaud the lawmakers in Florida for rescheduling the narcotic hydrocodone, It was a step in the right direction.\nOn the other hand my experience with m.speciosa has been positive. It is not a synthetic drug as it grows on trees of the coffee family. In its organic purified form the potential for benefits, imho,far outweigh the potential negative consequences. I have only studied m.speciosa for 2 years thus the long term ramifications of its continued use is unknown to me. I am not aware of anyone overdosing or becoming addicted ,in the classical sense,to this drug. Personally I drink coffee every day, I enjoy the morning cup of \"joe\" every day. Am I addicted to caffeine?  Maybe a little bit because on days that I can not get to Starbucks the girls at my office think I'm a more grumpy.\nThe most positive aspect of obtaining m.speciosa legally in shops or over the Internet is,imho,the striking ability of this herb to effectively and rapidly allow the opiate addict to completely detox himself from whatever opiate is the cause. I have seen addicts who are trying to get clean use m.speciosa in place of methadone to successfully detox themselves. Don't get me wrong here, I'm not advocating m.speciosa as a panacea for ridding the world of opiate addiction.\nHowever, I feel strongly that the efficacy of this herbal remedy,in its organically purified form has tremendous upside potential. I am fairly certain that with the right education and exposure this herb could possibly save the average opiate addict from years of a miserable existence. M.speciosa has been around for thousands of years, why is it that the Western world is just now learning about its uses? \nFinally I believe that there is still much to be learned regarding this and many related herbal medicaments. I do not believe that classifying this to a class 1 narcotic would benefit anyone except maybe the manufactures of oxycodone,hydrocodone, and possibly farmers in Afghanistan. \nI hope this helps to shed some light on the current situation.

I have read numerous accounts of individuals being able to stop the hard core drugs and eventually not even take anything as they used Kratom during withdrawal. I personally have used it when I did not want to take any pain medication during painful times.

So since I can no longer take pain pills for my pain, my only choice is kratom. Kratom is nothing like opiates for me. Opiates totally changed my personality and when I was high, I was a different person. With kratom though, I'm still me, but just a little bit happier and less painful me. Marijuana is becoming legal all over the states now, so I don't understand how a plant like kratom, that doesn't even come close to getting you high like weed or other schedule one drugs, can be considered dangerous. There have been no deaths directly from kratom and no horrible overdoses. It has literally saved so many people from opiates and if it is taken away I see opiates becoming ever worse than it is now. People deserve alternative medicine outside of the pharmaceutical industry. Kratom is a plant thaT's leaves are literally just dried up and ground into powder. It can't get anymore natural than that. It is a plant put on this earth for a reason and no one should be able to take that right away from anyone.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5933","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nathan Ellison","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to express my opposition to a possible Kratom ban. \nBanning Kratom would be a deleterious event for society as I've witnessed the benefits this plant has had for those suffering with chronic pain and addiction to heroin/prescription opiates. I speak with perhaps a somewhat higher level of understanding on the matter than most. I'm a medical provider who was trained at Cornell Medical College. I've practiced medicine in the ER as well as other capacities as an Air Force officer. I've had the unique experience of working in a methadone clinic treating heroin addiction. I've studied kratom in depth for years. My knowledge on this plant exceeds the capacity of this forum, but I wish to stress my belief that the FDA/DEA has greatly exaggerated the threat this plant poses. Furthermore, it has been suggested that a Kratom ban is rooted in the interests of pharmaceutical firms seeking to capitalize on the alkaloids found in this plant, namely mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. Word on the street and in news outlets is that a drug is coming to market with the same active alkaloids as found in Kratom and for this reason the FDA (likely under influence from those who stand to benefit financially) intends to advocate for a ban which will likely only result in a mass migration of former heroin and other opiate abusers back to their previous drugs of abuse. I make this claim rather confidently as I'm \"in the trenches\" treating patients and have whitness the scope and severity of America's pill addiction. I've met patients who have struggled for years to beat their opioid addictions. Many have required pharmacotherapy under the direction of a clinician. Sadly, many have failed to beat addiction despite specialist intervention and have resorted to drug-seeking tactics at the ER to \"score\" a script for opiates. This trend has resulted in clinicians fighting back with increasingly judicious prescriptive tendencies. As a result we are seeing a surge in heroin use, which has become more easily obtainable to the addict than prescription drugs. \nInterestingly, I have seen people overcome opiate addiction, after all else has failed, with the use of Kratom. I've also witnessed the benefits Kratom provided to people suffering from chronic pain and other illnesses. But, above all, I wish to stress the benign nature of this plant, its paucity of adverse effects and it's lack of ability to cause consumer harm. \nBy far the most common cause of death from opiates results from respiratory depression. Kratom however does not cause respiratory depression nor death. Kratom's alkaloids had been known to act on opioid receptors. However, two studies published recently by researchers at Columbia University and Memorial Sloan-Kettering have indicated the action of opioid receptor activation in Kratom entails a pathway involving a G-protein pathway rather than the pathway involving a protein called beta-arrestin-2 (as in traditional opiates). This alternative pathway is what accounts for Kratom's lack of respiratory depression and adverse effects. This very important distinction must be understood by the DEA as it deliberates regarding Kratom. \nThe DEA states they're \"aware\" of 15 deaths related to Kratom. However I have been unable to find any proof that any deaths have ever been attributed to Kratom - it's as if this claim has been made anecdotally. In fact, in at least 14 of the deaths, other drugs/illegal substances where found on toxicology reports. Also, many of the other reported dangers of Kratom as per the FDA/DEA are either grossly exaggerated or simply false.  Dr David Kroll, a pharmacologist and medical writer, has stated that it is \"going overboard\" to classify Kratom as a dangerous drug. \"Kratom being lumped in with other opioids is both unfair and unscientific,\" he says. \"It glosses over the subtleties of how the main chemical in kratom actually works.\"\n I want to again mention that records indicate in 14 of the \"Kratom deaths\" other drugs/substances were present. It is unfair and deceitful of the DEA to justify a ban on Kratom based on these cases when association clearly did not equal causation.\nI have yet to encountered a patient who overdosed on Kratom. I have however encountered patients who overdosed on legal drugs such as alcohol, Tylenol, caffeine, dextromethorphan (DXM) and benzos. Interestingly, kava, a legal herb sold at Walmart, is known to activate benzo receptors like Xanax and should perhaps be banned before Kratom. Additionally, DXM is legal yet often abused for its effects similar to PCP and ketamine and has also been shown to activate opioid receptors at high doses. \nSimply put, kratom, has a long history of safe use and does not represent a danger to public health. I believe a Kratom ban will only result in a rise in heroin and prescription drug abuse. \nFor more information on the safety of Kratom please reference the link below. \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670991/\n\nThank you!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14928","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Seth Kasunick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nIm a mild mannered middle class family man with no history of drugs, crime or addiction.  In my mid 30s now and a few accidents and sports injuries have left me in some real chronic pain. I had gotten so good at dealing with it by the time i was 30, that I didnt realize how much pain I was in.  An acute injury left me in a doctors care, with a Rx for pain meds. For the first time I found myself needing them.   The flood of relief I felt not being in pain the first time was astonishing, but I hated the swimmy headed feeling I got with them.   By the time my rx was done I started to feel the pull of the pills to keep taking them.  Terrified of this notion, hating the swimmy head, and having seen many people drawn into that life I opted to stop taking them.  The pain came back, and I was back to square one. Still being an active guy, I of course have tried many remedies, exercise, therapy, yoga, NSAIDs, stretching, Heat/cold therapy, float decompression. Most things had an impact, but it wasnt much and never lasted long. I was still able to function but my quality of life was seriously suffering. I found Kratom while researching alternative pain relief methods. I read everything I could find on it, from medical opinions, to reviews. All in all I couldnt see any evidence of any health risks, and no adverse presence of mind detriment.  I tried it, and it was a HUGE help. I was able to lower my daily pain to a manageable level and return my quality of life to where it should be. my energy level went up, I lost weight, i was more energetic at work. My relationship with my wife and kids began to get better. I didnt realize how much the constant pain was affecting me.  Ive never had a bad experience with Kratom.  Psychological effects similar to a strong cup of coffee, no physical withdraw symptoms, and no side effects that ive noticed. \nPlease consider the impact, banning Kratom will have on people like me. Its worth studying and making a distinction from harmful recreational drugs.  thank you for reading my story.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14700","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern:\n\nI am a 36 year old, stay at home mother of two and I oppose the DEA's proposal to make the plant, kratom, a schedule 1 substance.\nI was introduced to kratom over a year ago.

I started using kratom almost 3 years ago. It was first introduced to me by a new acquaintance who had previously experienced difficulty with the mental aspect of staying off illegal drugs after spending some time in an in-patient rehab. He had said that he started using it and he no longer craved the street drugs that had brought him to rehab. As a long time drug addict to pain medicine I was interested in finding a way off of the pills so I did some extensive research online about the benefits, history, dosing guidelines, etc. and after talking to many people experienced with using kratom I found a health food store that carry's it and began to experiment with determining whether it was right for me. I have found the same relief from pain that I was getting from using codeine and since completely tapering myself off of the pharmaceutical opiates I have been able to repair most of the physical damage that elicit drugs have done to my body. I also remain free from legal problems and save money now that I use kratom. There is such a close comparison with the natural stimulating properties of the kratom leaf and that of the properties found in ground coffee beans, it only makes sense that the plant should remain unregulated and legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13310","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Baldwin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"No band on Kratom...

I could not go for more than a few hours before needing more medication. I searched for treatment in the civilian community and with the Department of Veterans Affairs but none was available.

Initial scientific trials related to these active ingredients in kratom indicate a strong potential for positive medical uses in pain treatment and in combating addiction to prescription pain killers and heroin. Pain treatment and pain killer addiction are serious national health issues and we should be using scientific research to examine all possible options, not preemptively shutting down research into what could be a highly valuable tool in combating these public health issues. \n\nA schedule I listing would make the necessary research to determine the potential benefits of kratom extremely difficult and would likely results in years or decades of delay in determining how kratom can be put to safe medical use.  In general I would challenge the DEA to defend the extremely harsh limits that schedule I places on scientific research, if we are talking about substance that pose such an extreme threat to public health then Schedule I listing should be design to maximize research on any such substances to determine how addiction and other negative impacts can best be prevented / treated.  As it stand Schedule I listing essentially forbids needed scientific research.   \n\nThe DEA's rationale for the now withdrawn emergency scheduling appears to rest on a small number of deaths where kratom was used in conjunction with other drugs.  These case warrant a serious a full investigation to determine if kratom or the other substance was responsible, not a reactionary banning of kratom while the scientific data is unavailable to make a reasoned judgement on the risks and benefits of kratom.  \n\nIn the future the DEA needs to use a far more robust and reasoned decision process before considering the emergency scheduling of any substance. This decision process should be expanded to include the potential negative impacts on tax paying Americans, in the case of kratom thousands of US citizens have worked to create legitimate businesses that employ many people and provide tax revenue.  The DEA's sudden action greatly damage the investments and hard work of these citizens.  \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4649","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Peter Journeay-Kaler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA, \n Please don't place kratom under the Schedule One classification. In my personal experience,  it has truly aided me in keeping me away from opiates, alcohol and illicit drugs. I have consumed it off and on for 5 years without incident; no respritory issues, no new habit, nothing. I do not take it daily. It is not addictive. If it were addictive, I would steer clear of it. It has helped me to recapture my energy, presence and motivation to live a happier and more fulfilling life. I have read many reports that pharmaceutical companies have been eyeing mitragygnine, the active constituent in kratom for patenting and possibly creating a synthetic version. If it were not safe, then why would  they do this? Please don't create a bigger  epidemic by removing a viable option in the war against opiate addiction. Think of kratom, the unadultered, organic, natural leaf form as an ally and an invaluable tool in the fight against this opiate epidemic, not an enemy and certainly not a cause of it. There are so many more dangerous things that the public is allowed by law to consume; not the least of which are alcohol and tobacco. Kratom has been around as long or longer than both of those and it simply hasn't the deadly track record that they both have. I'm not going to get into statistics because I am quite sure that plenty of other comments in the thousands of public comments you are receiving have that covered, but I will tell you from the bottom of my heart..kratom IS safe. Please, really think about what you are doing here. You have tremendous power to help people shape their lives for the better. You have a great responsibility to protect the people from the truly dangerous substances. Kratom is just NOT one of those substances that poses any danger. Thank you so much for your time.

I am 39 years old, married, a homeowner, and a professional User Experience Designer.\n\nI understand that there is a drug problem in America. I believe kratom is a natural supplement which is not part of this problem. I believe the effort to prohibit kratom is well-intended but misguided.\n\nI suffer from general anxiety, social anxiety, and Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). I have tried prescription drugs. The side-effects were terrible. They made me emotionally cold, which put a strain on my marriage. Once I realized they were doing much more harm than good, I had to ween myself off of them, as they were physically addictive. \n\nFor the past 10 years, I also had grown dependent on drinking alcohol every night, usually 3 or 4 drinks. This was a quiet dependency, as it didnt affect my professional or personal life, but it was unhealthy long-term. I had, however, accepted that this was just how my life would go. Alcohol would always be there because there wasnt a healthy alternative, and it was better than prescription meds.\n\nA little over a year ago, a friend recommended I try kratom for my anxiety. I was very pleased with the effects and decided to start taking it daily. By taking kratom doses two times a day I found I stayed ahead of my anxiety and depression.\n\nAfter a couple months of this routine, the most amazing thing happened. I realized I didnt care about alcohol anymore. The desire to drink in the evenings was completely gone. Now I dont crave alcohol and I'm indifferent about it when I have it. I thought this was nothing short of a miracle. Later, reading others' testimonials about their experiences with kratom, I learned that this is commonplace. This is one of kratom's understood properties.\n\nI am very concerned that if the kratom ban goes into effect, my anxiety and depression will return without any reasonable relief, and my cravings for alcohol will come back. When a person is thirsty, they drink.\n\nResearch is part of my job. My co-workers and I study how people use websites and adjust accordingly. If one person tells us to change something, we listen, but we only act if their suggestion seems like an obvious improvement. Otherwise, it's considered anecdotal, and we have to decide if it's worth proving with real numbers. If thousands of people get online and tell us the same thing, it stops being anecdotal. We consider that a strong message that we're not doing something we should.\n\nThank you for listening to the thousands of voices that are defending our right to consume kratom so far. This plant is a miracle for me personally. Based on my personal experiences, I believe it can be the DEA's biggest aid in a fight against the nasty drugs out there that are ruining people's lives. I believe now is the time to study it. Learn everything good and everything bad through objective scientific process. If the thousands of testimonials that have reacted to the initial intended ban are telling the truth, there's a good chance there isn't much bad to it at all, and a lot of good.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2741","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Riensche","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After doing research and listening to people talk about their experiences on kratom this should not be a schedule 1 drug.

I do not consider myself an alcoholic and do not have any history of drug addiction or problems with drugs. I am a law abiding citizen and never in trouble with the law. I don't even speed :) Anyhow, in an effort to lose weight and obtain an overall healthier lifestyle, I decided to try Kratom as I had heard it was all natural/organic and could help me unwind after work in the same way as my wine did. I started making a Kratom tea after work instead of my usual wine and over the course of about a month, with this change alone, I dropped 20lbs in weight (wine has a lot  calories!) and feel more alert and refreshed during the day. I feel this change is due to my stopping drinking with no effort whatsoever thanks to the Kratom tea I replaced the wine with. I cannot understand HOW this natural plant/leaf could be placed on the same level as dangerous street drugs. This is NOT a mind altering substance.  On the one occasion that I took too much I got a severe headache and felt a little sick to my stomach. Kratom, to me is simply a better/more healthy way to relax when needed. I feel it is on the same level as coffee which people take to wake up in the morning. Kratom should remain legal and researched further if deemed necessary. It is not an addictive or dangerous drug. Alcohol, cigarettes, and caffeine are far more harmful. I cannot believe this is even being considered as being classified as a hardcore drug.

I was just about to give up and I learned about kratom, did my research and decided to try it making a tea.  I am the biggest skeptic of all when it come time for supplements, but the kratom actually worked, and I discovered that not only did it help control my pain issues, but it helped with anxiety, PTSD, blood pressure and all around just made me feel like doing things that I never took enjoyment in before.. For instance.. I was taking so many rx medications before I couldn't even get in the floor and play with my children. I was able to now. It was a complete gamechanger, and completely natural. I was able to stop all my medications with all the bad side effects.. I have a clearer head now, I am living, not existing, and my family has me back, my kids have their mama back.. I believe with all my heart that God put this plant here to help heal me. Now for some reason, the DEA claims to be looking out for public health, and by banning kratom they will basically be hurting public health..  Kratom saved my life, and you need to understand that it is not an opiate, and that its not synthetic (like most rx medications) so this must be some real big misunderstanding on the DEA's part, unless they profit from banning it somehow... Don't you think its time to leave safe plants alone and start going after the drugs that are really harming people, you know?? The ones you see all those commercials for on TV all the time?? And maybe look into meth and the big herion epidemic we have in our country? Now that's something worth looking into, not kratom.  I would really think its over-reaching on the DEA's part and unresponsible to ban kratom. Once that happens then you will see overdoses go up, then you will wish you didn't ban kratom.. It really does save lives! So keep my story in mind when you make your decision, and I will be praying that you do the right thing..

He was in his 30's, not sure how he got addicted to heroin but I know he had a long term opiate use/abuse going on. Near the time he OD'd, he was looking for pain pills so he could try to taper off heroin without major withdrawal symptoms. I have to wonder if Kratom would have been a suitable method for weening out of the grips of opioid addiction. It would be great if more research was done on it, but also- why take it off the market when it has the potential to help these at risk people?

Last spring my granddaughter suggested I try kratom for pain relief. I have had 2 back surgeries and many injections for chronic pain and still have had to rely on pain medications such as Hydrocodone. Since using Kratom I have halved my use of pain medications. I use a small dosage and within 30 minutes of ingestion I feel a slight lift such as in a cup of coffee and my pain subsides to a manageable level. It is impossible to overdose on Kratom because anytime I have taken more than usual I become violently nauseated so I am careful about dosage. I do not believe it to be addictive because when I don't have Kratom I do not suffer any ill effects. I do prefer to use it because it helps me to cope with my pain. I am a full time caregiver for my husband who has dementia so it is important to remain alert and clear thinking. With Kratom I can do this. Kratom is not a \"party drug\" as there is no feeling of being \"high\". It is a helpful herb which should not be classified with harmful drugs such as heroin. In my opinion banning Kratom could lead to more opioid addiction and unlawful behavior. It has been a God send to me.\nSincerely,\nSybil E.

It has helped me greatly improve my health, and have a fresh start on life, with no negative side effects. My other option would have been to continue on narcotic pain relievers, which had put a huge damper on my life, and affected it in a huge negative way. Kratom is in no way the same or equal to hydrocodone, both can have life changing results, but the difference is a negative and positive. Also, unlike narcotic opiods, kratom is not addictive! It is much much easier to cut down on or stop taking kratom, unlike narcotic opiods that have SEVERE withdrawls.  Please leave kratom the way it is, there is a huge community out here leading better and improved lives because of kratom. Please do not criminalize kratom, there is absolutely no reason kratom should be scheduled. I am well aware of the small amount of issues and unfortunate deaths that have involved kratom.  Alot of these are the result of narcotic drug interactions and/or very high consumption levels. Too much of anything can be bad, and it's obvious that kratom should not be labelled dangerous here. Please listen to the community of people who have had a very positive life change, by switching from narcotic opiods, or starting on  kratom for the MANY benefits it has!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1845","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'll start off with how kratom has affected me personally. It makes me a lot more willing to do things that I don't want to, and just a lot more productive in general. I don't like caffeine (which is what the majority of the working population uses to force themselves to work), and kratom works a lot better for me. The main effects I get are increased sociability, reduction of minor various aches/pains, mood lift, and slight feelings of warmth. I usually dose around 1.5 grams.\n\nA lot of people don't realize that they don't need large doses to feel effects, and they take too much and get nauseous and have bad experiences. I just don't think a lot of people have the proper knowledge of kratom before they use it.\n\nThe real danger from kratom is the lack of regulation - NOT the usage of the plant itself. Of the tiny number of deaths that you all (the DEA) love to cite, a lot are from a batch of kratom laced with o-desmethyltramadol. Things like this would be avoided if kratom was regulated for quality instead of being sold as a product that isn't intended for human consumption.\n\nI know it's a common theory that \"if we make a substance illegal, less people will use it and less people will die from it\", but, unless you want to ignore all of the harm that the war on drugs itself has caused, we all VERY WELL know that this isn't the case. If kratom becomes illegal, a small portion of users will turn to obtaining kratom illegally, and what they do get will be even less regulated and more likely to be altered in dangerous ways.\n\nOn the other hand, for those that stop using kratom in a hypothetical circumstance where kratom does become illegal, many will lose either their quality of life or their life itself. The thing is, kratom is an extremely safe alternative to not only alcohol, heroin, and other illegal drugs, it is likely far safer than prescription opioids. Kratom is currently keeping thousands of people off of alcohol and other deadly drugs, and has helped people off of suboxone and methadone, which they otherwise would have been slaves to. If we're not taking the money the DEA makes from pharmaceutical companies into account, it is an extremely good thing for the public to not need prescription opioids. Regulations on opioids keep increasing, yet more people are dying from prescription opioids each year. How does that work?\n\nPrescription kratom is NOT the answer. Making pills from specific alkaloids of the leaf takes away a lot of the safety profile of kratom, since it would involve isolating the strong opioids, whereas, with the pure kratom leaf, it isn't even possible for a person in normal conditions to consume enough kratom to overdose. Selling kratom in any form as a prescription takes away many people's access to it due to the fact that doctors would not be willing to prescribe it in a lot of cases, and its price would increase A LOT as a prescription medication (if only pharmaceutical companies can sell it, they can drive up its price all they want).\n\nIf you are going to ban anything, it could arguably be beneficial to ban kratom \"shots\" and other energy shots which consist of all sorts of plants in unknown amounts. They can be a lot more dangerous than pure kratom leaf. With the pure leaf, it's easy to know what to expect. With kratom extracted and mixed in with other legal supplements, it's far more difficult to know how potent a product will be.\n\nPlease, take the people into consideration for once here. People need kratom a lot more than the pharmaceutical companies need more money.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3261","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using Kratom for a few years now and have had no negative side effects.

I was retired out of an 11  year career in law enforcement. Because I damaged the L4-L5 disk and facets, i have a permenant injury that causes me substantial pain. \nThis past summer I was unable to find a doctor who would take my workers compensation case - which is already resolved but grants me lifetime medical treatment. I have been prescribed a low grade narcotic (hydrocodone) the past two years. Despite my pain levels, I make a one month supply last almost two months as I hate taking prescription medication - especially narcotic.\n\nSince I was forced to go 6 months without any pain medication that actually relieved my pain, I began a desperate search for holistic alternatives. I found Kratom.\n\nTo this day, i prefer a cup of Kratom tea over any prescription medication ever recommended or prescribed to me. It is not mind altering, so much as it is more mood altering without altered consciousness. It also alleviates pain symptoms without any side effects. I have found this to be a miracle herb. \n\nFrom what I have read, the only associated illness/death relating to Kratom has been due to narcotic cocktails, including illegal and prescription drugs. None are associated with just Kratom. This has been a healthy, non-addictive, natural solution to narcotic pain treatment. It has many benefits, including helping quell social anxieties that I have had for many years; and raising motivation levels despite my pain and disability.\n\nThe only reason the federal government wants to make this herb illegal is because it ACTIALLY WORKS - and far better than what pharmaceuticals produce. \n\nThe question is: Are you truly working for the people and keeping your OATH? Or are you in the political pockets of big pharma - and making a selfish decision to keep this harmless miracle herb out of the hands of those of us who are so grateful for it as a treatment option?\n\nJaxon Pastore","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16815","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jaxon Pastore","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The Kratom plant has made my life much better, helping with everything from my everyday anxieties to relieving a lot of the pain in my two herniated discs without making me feel dependent on the plant itself as I was with any other option presented to me by my doctors.

More than 15 years ago I had my first shoulder surgery and was given prescription opiate medication to help with the pain. Over the next 15 years that followed I required another 3 shoulder surgeries as my shoulders continued to deteriorate whether it be from genetic conditions, being a baseball pitcher for 10 years, playing competitive volleyball for 5 years, or from some of the falls I took from being an active snow-boarder. \n\nIn any case the shoulder experts in the field all told me the only way for me to alleviate my pain is to have full replacement surgery in both both shoulders. With a very active career which involves weekly travel, there was never a good time to remove myself from work to take off all the time needed to go through these surgeries and the recovery time they require. So I continued taking the prescribed opiate pain medication. I did this for nearly 10 years and as my body's tolerance for the medication increased I needed to increase the medication dosage just to be able to tolerate the daily constant pain I was in. The quality of my life was suffering even while taking the medication that was supposed to help me manage my pain.\n\nThen a friend told me about a tropical tree in the coffee family and native to parts of southeast Asia. Commonly known as Kratom, I had never heard of this natural plant before but after hearing how it helped my friend with her chronic back pain I decided to do more research. I researched the plant diligently and made the decision to try it. Now in my case, I was taking pain medication for the last 10 years and my dosage was up to 80 mg per day of Oxycodone but I decided that to truly test the pain reducing characteristics of Kratom, I would also need to stop taking Oxycodone. \n\nIn November of 2015 I began taking Kratom, 3 times per day, and using what is considered a moderate recommended dosage. At the same time I also chose to reduce my opiate medication drastically with the hope and goal of completely eliminating having to take the medication for my chronic pain. What I can tell you is that within 45 days I was able to go from taking 20mg of Oxycodone 4-times per day to COMPLETELY eliminate taking this dangerous medication at all. \n\nThis is REALLY important: I accomplished TWO very key things by taking Kratom both of which are incredible. The characteristics of this natural plant enabled me to transition OFF OPIATE MEDICATION after taking it daily for ten years. I made sure to talk to my physician first who offered suggestions on how to safely reduce taking pain medication and a plan to do so over a two-month period which would reduce my bodys negative reaction to taking synthetic opiates for so many years. I was able to accomplish this when thousands of people around the U.S. struggle painfully to stop taking their legal opiate pain prescriptions. Taking the natural plant Kratom as a supplement to my diet was the single-most important component enabling me to accomplish this. \n\nThe second thing taking Kratom did for me was to reduce the amount of pain I feel every minute of every day. Am I pain-free? No, I am not. I still have two shoulders that will require a full surgical replacement but I am NOW living a life where I can tolerate my level of pain and where I can go through my work day without constantly feeling and experiencing the sharp degree of pain Ive lived with for many, many years, while on a legal pain management program. Taking Kratom enabled me to STOP taking 80mg of Oxycodone each day and to manage my chronic pain with a natural plant known as Kratom. \n\nI would like to see Kratom remain legal as it is today. Changing the legal status of this plant would cause me to make a decision to either acquire it illegally and become a criminal in the eyes of the law or to begin taking Opiate medication again. Yes, I understand that I need to have shoulder surgery but WHEN to have that surgery should be up to me. I find it so hard to imagine a group of educated and rational law-makers will make this irrational decision again to illegalize Kratom. If this occurs, it is THAT decision that becomes the catalyst for hundreds and thousands of good hard-working law-abiding Americans instantly becoming criminals as they continue to seek taking the natural supplement called Kratom to help them with their chronic pain management. If the decision is made to make Kratom illegal, the lawmakers should also plan to raise taxes to build more prisons for all the new criminals being processed by our nations criminal justice system.

I am writing today to state that I firmly oppose the DEA putting kratom on the Schedule 1 controlled substance list. While I personally do not use kratom, I have many friends who do. I also have numerous friends who have passed away this year. The ones who passed away were addicted to heroin and had fatal overdoses due to the cutting in of the drug fetanyl. All those friends had tried to get help at one point or another and were not able to have success. However, many of my friends who do use kratom are now living lives free of heroin. They have no urge to go back. What they do have urges to do is go back to school and work, become productive members of society once again. I also have friends who use this plant to manage pain, rather than the addictive and deadly opiates the doctors prescribe to them. Isn't a safer form of medication for our friends and family what we want? I strongly believe a knee jerk scheduling of kratom is not what we need. What is needed is research and understanding of this plant, too many are currently using it to mend their issues in what very much seems to be a very safe and productive way. I hope you take this into consideration while you are deciding on the future of kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15480","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mike G","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been a Licensed Clinical Addiction Specialist in New York and North Carolina for the past 23 years.

I did not like the idea of taking prescription pills on a regular basis as i'm very well aware of the side effects and dependency issues.  I was thrilled when I found Kratom as it is a natural growing plant with a lot of the same benefits as pain killers with out the nasty side effects.

I am confident that if you continue to do due diligence into the matter you will come to the conclusion that the plant is safe and a wonderful alternative to the nasty prescription pills that flood today's market and cause a lot of the problems in society today.

I oppose the DEAs attempt at scheduling kratom (and/or it's alkaloids) as a drug.\nI want to quickly share my experience using \"kratom\" leaf to alleviate the symptoms of Ulcerative Colitis. As someone with Ulcerative Colitis I struggle with my digestive system daily. It even got so bad a couple of years ago that I almost lost my job over it. Then I found kratom. I've been using kratom ever since as an anti-diarrheal tea to help me be able to do a full day's work, and not spend the whole day in the bathroom. I first found out about kratom when I read that kratom had been used to treat chronic diarrhea for over 1000 years in southeast Asia and I can tell you that it works for me where all other options have come up short. I make good lifestyle choices to lessen the symptoms of my incurable bowel disease, but without kratom my quality of life would be much worse. If the DEA makes kratom (or it's alkaloids) a schedule 1 drug then I will be one of thousands of Americans who currently rely on this plant material that will be forced in to an immediate personal health crisis. To be frank, pooping my pants makes me feel intense shame & sadness while completely ruining my day. The DEA making kratom illegal would cause me to feel that shame & sadness much more often.\nKratom has also helped tremendously with my Psoriatic Arthritis. Psoriatic Arthritis has no cure and causes inflammation & pain in all the body's joints at the same time. So Psoriatic Arthritis essentially causes debilitating pain across my entire body. It is a degenerative disease, so the pain will only get more debilitating the longer that I live. I've suffered with these 2 incurable medical problems for years, looking for beneficial medical treatments the whole time, and I have never found anything that works better than kratom.\nIn the 2+ years that I have been using kratom I have never found kratom to be addicting nor have I ever experienced any negative side effects. Kratom is a leaf (not a drug), and should be treated by the government as a leaf (not a drug).","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5516","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cory Lane","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI take kratom for pain and to elevate my mood.

Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it. If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars. Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement. Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down. Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids. Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose. Drug abuse carries its own penalty. Do not create criminals of law abiding citizens or remove our liberty and responsibility to make our own decisions.

In my studies I have found many plants that are dangerous to use medicinally, yet are perfectly legal and easy to get. Conversely, I have read about many plants that are perfectly safe yet severely regulated. I believe it would be a crime to put the plant Kratom into this latter category.  I say crime, because I know a couple friends (fellow veterans), and I've heard of many others, that use Kratom to alleviate many different kinds of symptoms. I also believe that Kratom has a seat at the table of solutions for the heroine epidemic. I have a younger sister that became addicted to opiates and subsequently heroine. I blame her addiction on her doctor after seeing the masses of teenagers and young adults they have helped the pharmaceutical companies enslave with their drugs. As an informed citizen, I believe any action to criminalize Kratom is an action against its current users and and is criminal in itself. It's ridiculous to criminalize plants when there are so many other horrible drugs to keep out of use.

I decided I did not want to take these highly addictive drugs with horrendous side effect. 5 years after my diagnosis, I stopped using Opiates and called it quits. I found out about Kratom from other people with my condition and it has been a miracle for me and has vastly improved my life. I can fully function at work and in all other aspects of my life while taking Kratom. \n\nPlease do no put Kratom on the Schedule 1 Drug list. This would have serious dire consequences for me and millions of others.  \n\nPlease consider these comments before making your decision. \n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17951","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\nI am Zachary I.

My sales territory is half the state of Oregon and I'm in a hotel 4 nights per week while on the road servicing customers.  I've struggled with drinking since graduated college and starting my career.  It got to the point were I was drinking a pint of whiskey every night.\n\nI heard about Kratom on a podcast about 6 months ago and tried it a couple days later.  After a week of using Kratom I was able to cut off my drinking.  For the past 6 months I have consumed Kratom 5 to 6 days per week.  In the past 6 months I have drank only 4 times, which consisted of a couple beers, not the previous whiskey indulgence.  \n\nKratom has given me interesting results.  Thus far I have not experienced any negative results.  I would be curious to know what the effects are of long term use (i.e. 3 to 5 years or longer).  Kratom has lifted my mood and somehow removed the need or urge to drink.  My job performance has greatly improved and I feel much more balanced.  The drinking would give me short term relief (for the night).  Kratom seems to provide similar relief while allowing me to stay focused and effective.  I have also noticed that there seems to be no addictive repercussions while using Kratom.  I occasionally still have the urge to drink at the end of the day.  I force myself to have a glass of Kratom tea and the urge to drink quickly goes away.  I normally drink one glass of Kratom in the afternoon and have no urge to consume any more Kratom.\n\nI think it's very important the Kratom remains legal and available.  It would be important to conduct long term usage studies.  Again, in the last 6 months I have not noticed any negative side effects.  There is no doubt in my mind that Kratom is a far safer alternative to alcohol.  And from what I've heard people are using Kratom to replace much worse alternatives like pain pills and hard drugs.\n\nI really appreciate the DEA taking the time to read public comments like this and pray that Kratom will remain legal and available to those that are really benefiting from it's use.\n\nThank you,\nWayne","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12658","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Wayne ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Im a 72-year-old mostly retired Philosophy professor. I found out about kratom by accident in a boutique while on vacation in Sedona, AZ in June 2016. I saw a packet of it in a display case. I had never heard of it and asked the sales clerk what it was. I was told that it was a legal, mild opiate-type botanical that had interesting psychoactive action, having both stimulant and depressant or sedative effects. Intrigued, I bought a small packet, tried it, and liked it. I then read a lot about it, bought some more on line, found a reasonable dosage size, and have been using it ever since.\n\nI do not use kratom to achieve any particular medical benefit, but its analgesic and stress-relieving effects are clearly evident in my experience. My personal use of kratom is analogous to moderate and responsible use of alcohol. I ingest 5-6 grams of kratom once a day about three times a week, typically Friday-Sunday evenings. I find its effects to be pleasurable in the form of a smooth sense of relaxation, calm, being stress-free. I feel this as a kind of blissful full body experience that lasts 3-5 hours, and with no hangover or negative aftereffects. The only side effects I have experienced are a mild loss of balance and one occasion of vomiting after taking too much. The former side effect is fairly easy to compensate for with simple attention, and the latter is instructive in learning ones proper personal dose. I notice no cognitive decline when under kratoms influence, and apparently others see no evidence of cognitive decline in me either. Interestingly, as a former moderate drinker of alcohol, my wine consumption has been reduced by about 95% since I started taking kratom. And unlike with alcohol, there is no noticeable immediate toxicity from kratom in my experience with it.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that kratom can be harmful if abused by taking too much, too often, and/or compounding with other substances, especially other opioids or alcohol. However, the vast majority of those who use kratom appear to do so responsibly. Therefore, that responsible majority should not be prohibited from acquiring kratom because a few harm themselves by improper and irresponsible abuse of it. Most current evidence suggests that kratom has beneficial and harmless effects when used reasonably and responsibly. So until there is definitive scientific evidence that kratoms harm to individuals or society outweighs its benefits, kratoms alkaloids should not be classified as Schedule 1 drugs, thereby prohibiting its acquisition by responsible adults. Moreover, the Federal Government needs to respect individual rights and personal liberties and shy away from engaging in state paternalism. Such governmental paternalistic actions in the past have shown again and again that they dont work, create unregulated criminal black markets, and end up causing more harm and expense than the substances being prohibited.\n\nThank you for your attention to my thoughts on this matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18468","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tom Flint","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 31 year old female and I suffer from Interstitial Cystitis (diagnosed by a urologist after 10 years of going undiagnosed), and I am in severe pain daily.

I recently found Kratom and amazed at how much relief it gives me without the side effects. It allows me to live almost pain free, work, and be a mother and a wife.

I have psoriatic arthritis and fibromyalgia.  My pain is in my whole body and continual.  I have been using kratom for over two years every day.  The side effects are not minimal.  They are non-existent.  I do not experience the euphoria, breathing difficulty, drowsiness, mental impairment and \"cravings\" that I had to deal with when having to take opiates for pain control because nothing else worked.  Kratom has lessened my suffering more and better than any medication or injection or procedure.  In my twenty years of my search for relief from chronic pain, kratom is the best hope I have ever known for living a productive life despite my disabilities.  It would be a travesty to outlaw something showing this much promise in helping people like me who live with severe chronic pain and also to help people with addictions to be able to get off of opiates and heroin.

I have never had any negative reactions to kratom nor have I developed a dependency for kratom.  I realize that Kratom started getting bad publicity when the money hungry companies started marketing kratom in the same kind of fashion that they were marketing the synthetic marijuana known as \"k-2\" or \"spice\", selling it it shiny foil packaging and trying to convey that Kratom was some kind of party drug that could get you high. However,  this is not the case and far from the reality of what kratom does and is. Please do not be misled by the stigma that has came to follow kratom. Alcohol, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, even energy drinks kill and harm more people in 1 day than has or will ever come from using Kratom.  The reports that say there were 15 to 16 deaths caused by kratom were not entirely factual. It's comparable to someone dying of a heroin overdose and making the report that there was coffee in their system and it could have been the cause of death. Those reports were entirely misleading. Though it cannot be proved and will be painted as a conspiracy theory, I know that the main driving force behind the proposed ban is coming from Big Pharma and I am positive if there was ever an investigation to validate or disprove this accusation it would would be validated. Kratom has been used for thousands of years and is completely natural just like tea or coffee and it is completely effecient and effective and without the countless side effects you can get from pharmaceuticals. Why would it even be proposed to make this plant illegal? It does not make you trip and it does not get you high. It puts you in a good mood and gives you drive and energy, just like that 1st cup of coffee in the morning except 4 times as efficient and without the caffeine crash but has incredible pain relieving properties that does not come with coffee.  I am certain that if there is a true, unbiased and uncorrupted study done on Kratom than all of these accusations that make kratom seem like a dangerous, highly addictive party drug will be disproved and dismissed.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3236","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"DAKOTA Bobbitt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have investigated this and found that it seems like we have a great natural plant that may help some opiate or meth addicts that need something to help them reclaim their lives and refrain from using their drugs of choice.  From what I have read, there seems to be a rush to illegalize something that might be cost effective, effective, and EASILY available to people that need it while being completely legal.  If it comes to schedualing it then it will only cost more, plus I forsee the pharmaceutical industry dominating the conversation trying to extract certain compounds for what they think is a comperable effect(most likely not comperable in price) that doesnt do the same job the plant does(see marijuana).  to me this leaf sounds comparable to coffee with added benefits.  So why dont you treat it like that.  Let it be a natural herb like everything we think now as a herb condusive to health, except for of course marijuana, for some reason this particular herb is kept on schedual one to keep poor, racial, and independant thinkers in prison, and keep the opiate pharmaceutical industry in the business of keeping addicts addicted more effectively.  Im sure oxycontin sales wpuld go down if everyone was allowed to procure their pain medication from growing cannibus in their backyard.  If you put it on schedule one, then it can't be researched for positive results.  You'll just put up roadblocks that you can't study a drug of abuse for positive medicle purposes.  I think the american people are more interested in kratom as an answer than as something people can abuse.  If I were you, make standards on the leaf similar to asprin, even thou I suspect asprin to more toxic than kratom.  Also as a former person addicted to opiates this feels like the drug companies wining that kratom is taking away from their sales.  I also know a few former addicts using kratom and have had no side effects as well they are able to pay for it on a less than ten dollar an hour sallery.

It's very mild compared to opiates but works just enough to make life livable again. I'm able to go to my kids ballgames and actually not be in agonizing pain. I can lift and play with my 7 month old,  and run around with our 4 year old. Please reconsider this ban. I know that I'm only one person, but the ban will dramatically reduce my quality of life, and in turn, my familys.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1631","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Melissa Flynn","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is helping people recover from opioid addiction.

However, in this case, I feel like I need to before it is too late. I only hope and pray my story helps in the cause of keeping Kratom a legal and available product. I work in a professional environment at a large insurance company, and have been with the same company for 30+ years now.. I am 56 years old and a good, law abiding citizen. Other than a speeding ticket or small accident in the vehicle, I have never done anything unlawful in my life. I began using Kratom about 3-4 years ago. I actually heard of it on the news and decided to research it. Upon doing so, I found that it has been around and used for centuries to relieve pain, help with depression, sleep and relaxation. I lost my husband 4-1/2 yrs ago and went into a deep depression. I also have had an MRI and was found to have arthritis in my lower back, which causes a great deal of pain, especially when I have to bend to get something done. I was prescribed misc meds for depression and my pain. Some of them made me feel very jittery and others a bit melancholy, and some didn't sit too well on my stomach. I am also Diabetic and take an insulin shot each night., and have some nerve pain because if it. The first time I tried Kratom, it was such an amazing experience. I did not feel the pain in my back so much and I felt much more focused. I believe the relief from the pain alone made me feel more energetic, but I felt like I had finally found something I could take that didn't harm me or cause side effects. I also found that it is true what I had read, that it can be a bit stimulating taken in smaller doses yet helpful with sleep if taken in a little higher doses. Again though, the relief of the pain in and of itself is stimulating. To be able to do things physically and not feel the hurt so much ...it helps me tremendously in dealing with the pain I experience just to clean my house. It also provides a bit of  mental clarity. It's definitely much easier to be focused when not feeling pain. Taking this off the market as a natural product is not only wrong, but I feel it's a bit of an insult too. I have finally found something legal that has been helpful, and along comes big brother (government) trying to put out yet another regulation for a product that has been around and used for centuries, and without any real evidence of it causing any harm. Rather, the evidence seems clear that it does not cause harm. It is not addictive and seems everything I've read and experienced more so point to the fact that it helps many like myself. Adults who are of sound mind who should be able to retain the right to purchase and use Kratom, legally. This is why I am insulted. I (or others like me) should not be told we can't take something we find helpful, that doesn't harem us. It isn't right that the government step in and just take it away. I quit taking almost all meds they had me on as I feel Kratom has helped much more and the only  bad side effect is the taste. I have had no stomach issues at all taking Kratom. I feel so relieved to find something that is a natural leaf product that I can take and avoid all the other medications. It is extremely rare that I may have an alcoholic drink, but if they take Kratom away, I feel like I'm being driven to find something else to help me and the only choice the government allows is alcohol. Now that's a drug that kills. Leave Kratom alone and take that away ....I'd be fine with that. I wonder, does the person making this decision drink? Anyone involved in making this decision drink? Why is it ok for someone to drink a deadly drug,  \"alcohol\", legally, yet I can't use a natural leaf product legally? Kratom is obviously much less harmful than alcohol so please ...I beg of you, DO NOT take away the one I prefer. I do not feel Kratom should be made illegal at all. In my own personal experience, it is harmless. It is a product that allows a person like myself, an older, law-abiding professional adult of sound mind, a better, natural and alternative choice to help with pain, depression and just over all relief from life's every day stresses. It is not something that causes any harm and, if if taken away, I, for one, will feel my constitutional rights are being violated once more via the impositions of unnecessary regulations by our government.

I was looking for something that could help with mental issues such as anxiety and depression. I have both of these and kratom has been my go to for keeping this at bay. I enjoy waking up and taking a little bit of this herb to jumpstart my day as a replacement for coffee as well. I feel better. I don't have any pain and I have some sort of arthritis in my neck. It's such a sad state when you have to outlaw things that really work and promote ones that cause so many side effects. Kratom to date doesn't cause as much as damage as it does healing. Compared to prescription opioids and anti-depressants, you find more improvement in these things from a lot of people. I have a neighbor whom died from fentanyl that caused respiratory depression that kratom does not cause no matter what findings you can find. I have taken upwards of an ounce of kratom leaf in a day and nothing bad happened at all. In fact, I felt even better because it boosts your immune system. To date you found a whopping 15 deaths and how many of those also had other substances in the person's body at the time of death? \n   When tobacco and alcohol have killed and still take the lives of many people each year. This plant doesn't even carry the same risks that marijuana does. When taken responsibly, I can get more done than I can on cannabis. I think we need to look into this more and keep it around for those suffering from opioid addiction as it does help you. My neighbor who died lived with his mom who I still talk to. She takes kratom as well now after I turned her onto it. It helps her take less medications and she has so many things wrong from bone fractures to overall pain over the years. I am asking you and demanding you in a positive way to keep this plant in the hands of the people. The ones that truly have the right to consume these types of things. That more good has come from it then bad and a lot of negative reactions will occur if it is taken off the market. I do think it needs to be regulated around children, but in no way will it harm anyone. Pill bottles are so close to children's reach, yet a plant has to automatically be banned. This will do more damage in the short term as well as long term. Hear us out. This is the least of anyone's worries. Nobody is trying to get high. I treat this with respect as much as anything I take including any food. We need these plants and herbs in our lives. I appreciate your work as an agency, but this will be a very bad move. Keep kratom available and do something for the people that deserve to feel less affliction in their lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1342","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Phil Hulse","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please consider researching Kratom further.

I am 19 years old and an undergraduate sophomore with a science major. Thank you for taking the time to hear me out. There needs to be more research done on kratom. Benefits are real for some people with serious conditions. Some veterans would suffer on other painkillers that pose a worse addiction potential and worse side effects. The DEA has no sense in the use of illogical statistics like the number of poison control center calls. As you should know, Tylenol is responsible for a far greater amount of poison control center calls, and hundreds deaths from overdose. Acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, accounts for 100,000 calls per year to poison control centers, not even close to the 660 that kratom received in five years. Kratom does not seem to be responsible for one single death in which it was the sole substance used. I believe it would be a mistake to schedule kratom the same as heroin because it DOES have medicinal value worth investigating. Obviously research on Kratom will have a far greater barrier to jump if it becomes a schedule 1 drug.\nIt makes me and thousands of other Americans worried about corruption between large pharmaceutical companies and The Drug Enforcement Administration because kratom is a naturally occurring substance, thus cannot be patented, thus cannot make as large of a profit due to competition. When was the last time we cut restrictions on freedoms in this Land of the Free? The liberty for someone to medicate themselves should be available. All I see now is more anti-science, uncalled for acts of authoritarianism. Also, why would you want to imprison American veterans that use kratom to ease them through their day? Many of these self-medicated people are mothers and fathers to children that need them to care of them. I would be appalled at the irresponsibility of a government to think of power and punishment before its people's well-being.\nI am a student studying Engineering Physics at John Carroll University. My first encounter with kratom was a year ago. My state (Ohio) rightly allows kratom to be sold to adults only. I have used kratom less than a dozen times and never more than once every two weeks. I consider my use of kratom responsible. I learned that it is the best herbal remedy for lowering my anxiety. I did not witness any potential for addiction. However, I did get a little drowsy. I also take Benadryl (for allergies) and that also makes me drowsy so I am used to the feeling. Both still accomplish what they are intended to accomplish. The benefits outweigh the drawbacks. It should also be noted that kratom is not an opioid or a narcotic or any drug that gets you \"high.\" The only purposes I have used kratom for are first dates, job interviews, and in a new settings with new people when my anxiety is at its highest. Kratom really did aid me in easing up to perform better during those incidents.\nUnfortunately, my state seems to be one of the worst for opioid addiction and resulting overdoses. I have known many family members of friends and neighbors of friends. Kratom have been shown to act as a means to for opioid addicts to ween off dangerous opioid addictions. It sounds like this is well worth not making this medicine a schedule 1 controlled substance simply for the sake of the livelihood of Americans with substance abuse disorder, a major modern issue. It is sad to hear the words \"opioid epidemic\" and in the face of the tragedy, hear of the ban of something that can solve the horrifying problem that tears families in pieces. If kratom could save just 1 opioid addict from addiction in all of the United States, wouldn't it be worth keeping around, realizing that there is no confirmed data on one single death from kratom alone? It seems logical to me to give these people a chance.\nI am an American. You are an American. That addict down the street is an American. It is our responsibility to help them, not imprison them for trying to save their own lives. Kratom is not produced in meth labs. It grows from the Earth. People have to care for it and cultivate it in order to use it for whatever benefit. Benefits include a remedy for pain, depression, addiction, insomnia, stress and in my case, anxiety. The research concerning kratom's medicinal value is too vital to simply ignore. I have no power to help these people. All I can offer is this comment. Please consider the facts before making a decision. This entire essay came from memory except for the statistics which were the only items added after writing. I am in the middle of studying for finals and I have done my research on kratom months ago.

I a have a bachelors degree, I am employed full time and I know that this plant is not a danger to anyone. There have been no deaths linked to Kratom or more specifically Mitragyna speciosa. While I don't have any issues part or present with Opiod addiction I can attest to the fact that it helps me perform better in my daily life, it isn't something that you can abuse and I have never head of a \"bad\" or \"harmful\" Kratom experience and I speak to people about Kratom everyday. I assume this ban has to do with big pharma wanting to control and monopolize something that actually works but it would be a real shame if the American people who rely on Kratom were denied the right to use a harmless plant.

Once an active member of our extended family, the local community, our church, and working as a public relations specialist for local school districts, she's seen her interactions in the world shrink as her body continually fails her. \n\nFrustratingly, on top of her disabilities, she has the additional burden of being allergic to a broad range of painkillers and related medicines that might be used to treat her symptoms. She's been left without any effective pain treatments that do not leave her breaking out in rashes. The only alternative physicians have offered to prevent these breakouts is to prescribe simultaneous antihistamine treatments that over-sedate her, leaving her unable to drive and function out of the home. Because of this, she has chosen to live in pain rather than be held back, staying somewhat active while quietly suffering. A woman of faith, she believes that she must not give up despite her troubles. \n\nThrough the constant pain, my wife uses all of her efforts to stay healthy, exercise daily, and follow through with complicated physical therapy regimens to maintain her ability to function somewhat independently. Recently through her own research she learned of Kratom, and began careful personal trials to see if she would be allergic to it (she has a broad range of food allergies as well). Despite the awful taste, she has consistently received an observable reduction in pain, elevated energy levels, and she's been able to reduce her intake of two opiate pain medicines. \n\nShe's taken 5 teaspoons of Kratom daily for the last six weeks, and on the NRS-11 Pain Scale, she has seen temporary relief (lasts 3-4 hours) of up to two points (from a 5 or 6 down to a 4 or 3). This Thanksgiving, we were able to invite family to our home for dinner for the first time in seven years. In previous years we had to decline because of the persistence of her pain and the unpredictability of her energy to participate.\n\nAs a 56 year-old public school teacher, I've seen firsthand the dramatic effects of opiate and heroin use even in suburban and rural communities. I understand that our government feels an urgency to do something to push back against this epidemic. Regardless, Mitragynine is not an opiate and is clearly difficult to abuse by its nature. Mitragynine has proven to be of benefit to a large number of people both here and abroad, much like my wife has found. Its my belief any that dramatic restrictions or reclassification could hinder research and irreparably harm many who find it effective. Instead of punishing those who find real and current benefits from Kratom like my beloved wife has, perhaps other actions would benefit our population as a whole. I believe that Kratom should continue to be legal for supplemental and alternative treatment use by those who receive benefit from it, and I highly encourage further clinical research into its potential benefits. If Kratoms legality is rescinded with a Schedule 1 assignment, this treatment would ultimately be removed from my wifes efforts to manage her chronic pain.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17664","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Scott","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":2,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"See attached file(s)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3248","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"12D - Thai Civil Society Harm Reduction Coalition","postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Pascal Tanguay","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I first learned about kratom after suffering for many years with chronic back pain and having becomedependent onprescription pain medications for relief.

Since my last pregnancy, in which I carried twins, I have experienced chronic pain that seems to go on without end. For well over a year I suffered in silence, preferring the pain to narcotic pain killers. About 4 months ago, I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. When I told my husband, an Afghanistan Veteran, he introduced me to Kratom, which he had been taking for several years. After trying this plant, I found that it helped me immensely, giving me a sense of well-being and I found that I was able to do more without being taken over by the pain. It made me feel good and my energy and motivation levels increased. I was able to play with my kids more, get more done around the house and feel better and more alive! I still have rheumatoid arthritis and I still have pain, but this plant has helped me in so many ways, wherein the pain no longer controls me. I am a better Mom and a better person. This plant has so much potential and has already helped many people, including my entire family; my husband and I are able to be the best version of ourselves, which is what our children need. Please do not take action to block peoples' access to Kratom. In the few months since my introduction to Kratom, I have met many other good Americans who take Kratom.

He has a curved spine which causes him any level of pain from dull persistent ache to shooting, debilitating stabs under the shoulder blade. This condition is untreatable except with use of opioid prescription pain management. This constant pain and consequent use of hydrocodone slowly turned him into an addict before age 17. He overdosed twice and attempted suicide once as an opiate addict. He had been abandoned by all friends and family in his life. With nowhere to go, he lived for various lengths of time in his truck with no home to speak of.\n\nIt was his eventual suicide attempt, subsequent hospitalization, and abandonment by his family that provided the impetus for him to seek a better way. He found out about the substance we've all come here to try to save - Mitragyna speciosa -- \"kratom\". Kratom not only allowed him to ween himself off opioid painkillers after seven years of daily use, it allowed him to hold a job consistently for the first time in his life. Quitting opiates left him with constant back pain that would grow so unmanageable that he would be unable to leave his bed or move at all. Kratom got him up and back to work after falling through the cracks of society for nearly his entire adult life. Kratom saved my husband's life. I owe the greatest gift I have in this world to this substance. Had it been a Schedule I drug when my husband was trying to taper his opiate use, he would never have pursued the option. He likely would have died an opiate addict like half a million other Americans from 2000 to 2014.\n\nMy husband hasn't touched a prescription pain killer in three years now. He has never been treated for addiction. He has never had the traditional rehabilitation experience. He saved himself with two 3 gram doses of kratom every day. This dose was enough to stop him from seeking opiate relief for his pain and withdrawals and does not impair his cognitive ability or attention. He has now at 24 held a full time job longer than a year for the first time in his life. We met just months after kratom allowed him to move his life past opiate addiction and a likely imminent early death. He is a strong, dedicated man, and the love of my life. I would never have been allowed the privilege of sharing my life with him had kratom been illegal, because my husband would almost certainly have succumb to addiction.\n\nNow I will share my own side of this story. I am 21 years old and have struggled with severe major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder since age 15. I haven't had health insurance in many years -- not since I was 11 and my father was put out of work by a disabling injury. Treatment for my mental health has come entirely from a series of charity organizations and crisis stabilization units. From the health department I was tossed back and forth between several Catholic clinics and sliding scale facilities attempting to find a single place that would give an uninsured minor psychiatric care. After several referrals to sliding scale psychiatric facilities became dead ends (most will not treat anyone under 18), a physician's assistant agreed to start me on bupropion XL. After desperately seeking treatment for nearly a year, I was given relief. For a few days I was reminded how bright life could feel. And, just as it has been with every psychoactive medication I've been prescribed since, the relief died away as quickly as it had come. Over the following years I was put on almost every SSRI, SNRI, tetracyclic, and anticonvulsant on the market. When all of these options had finally failed to make even a dent in my symptoms, I failed out of two colleges, suddenly lost sight in my left eye, was told I'd likely be diagnosed with MS in the next 5 years, and found myself in the ER unable to mitigate my panic attacks any longer. From there I was placed under involuntary psychiatric hold - a \"1013\" here in Georgia - and transported to a crisis stabilization unit for a mandatory three days. \n\n(My comment continues in the attached document)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22403","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Emma Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for considering folk'' comments ok kratom.

Before finding kratom I received many different treatments for my back pain and I only got temporary relief followed by worsening pain. When it became so bad I was willing to do anything I accepted opioid medication treatment. The medications were effective but only for short amounts of time when I would require an increase in dosage. Over time I developed a dependency on narcotic pain medicine which left me with  a reduced quality of life and physical side effects. I came across an article on kratom and decided to try it. What a change it made in my life. I was able to stop the narcotic medications. I was free of the debilitating side effects of lethargy, chronic constipation and chemical dependency that the pain meds caused. I used the same amount of kratom tea each day and not only received better pain relief than from the medications but I got my old life back and felt normal enough to resume activities that I had stopped doing due to lethargy, grogginess and a severe lack of motivation caused by opiates. I also was able to reduce medication for anxiety disorders. The kratom plant gave me my life back. The cost is reasonable, the amount does not need to be increased over time to get the desired pain relief, and I feel much healthier since I don't experience the devastating side effects of narcotic pain medications.

All of the people with these issues have way more reason to fight for kratom than I do.  However,  I am here to defend myself as well as defend them.  \n\nI'm 46 as of tomorrow.  I've been married 19 years and have a beautiful 16 year old daughter.  I work as a department manager at a well known retailer.  I have been with this company for 4 years. I am a seamstress as well.  \n\nI will first mention that I have had a previous dependence on opiates after an accident 14 years ago where I fell onto my head into the street. It caused a pinched nerve in my lower back that caused my left hand to lose all strength.  I couldn't pick up a pen to write my name.  I had severe lower back/ hip pain and unbearable headaches.  I'm certain that it slightly affected my memory and ability to focus.  I really never felt the same after that.  I would like to note I never took any drugs. Never even smoked marijuana in high school/college. I was never around it and never had the desire to try. \n\nSix months after my accident I began having severe pain in my lower back. 2 years of pain management and several increases in vicoden/muscle relaxers later I was tired of the cycle and decided to stop taking the medication but I found myself unable to stop. 3 years later I found out about suboxone and spent nearly 3 years on it.  After my doctor retired and not wanting to go 6 months on a waiting list, I quit the suboxone in an uncomfortable 2 weeks withdrawal period.  I haven't touched any medication since then. \n\nHere I am 5  years later.   I had been on antidepressants for 20 years and have had severe allergies all my life. I've taken every allergy medicine there is. Twice a year they get bad enough that I have to be put on steroids and antibiotics. I was resorting to benadryl when it got bad enough but I would usually sleep for hours getting nothing done.  Or I was a zombie. I have taken it at work out of desperation but I'm certainly not at the top of my game when I have to take it. \n My coworkers can attest how bad it gets so they give me repreive. I have had to leave work and go to urgent care because of it. \n\nRight before the ban (approximately 5 months ago) while researching herbal remedies for anxiety and allergies I came across kratom. I did my homework and thought this could kill 2 birds with one stone. I found a local smoke shop(not a head shop to be clear) that was very well received in my community. I decided to try some before I actually purchased online.  \n\nSince that day,  I have not taken a single allergy pill. Not one!  No Claritin, no Xyrtec, no Benadryl....no neti pot, no steroids and no antibiotics.  I wake up and mix 1 Tsp with 10 oz orange juice. Not even a tingle or itch in my nose!  That alone would have sold me. But I also have  stopped taking my 60 MG a day Cymbalta.   I'm clear and focused and I believe it is because I'm no longer on the antidepressants.  I feel no panic attacks anymore which could get pretty severe.  The brain fog after my accident 14 years ago is gone. I feel like I did 20 years ago.  One tsp every morning and one before bed.  That has been my routine for 5 months.  I know how opiates work.  After some time, the initial dose isn't enough and you have to increase it.  And I know from experience, this happens very quickly.  I have had no desire to increase the amount of kratom I am taking.  Kratom has done nothing except improve my life.\n\nMy mother has acute arthritis in her back, scoliosis and  rhumatiod arthritis. There is no surgery for this.  She has always been tiny but Im watching her shrivel.  She now leans severely to one side and has lost so much weight. The doctors don't know how to help her so they give her medicine.  22 Medications to be exact.  She sees four different specialists and her medication is monitored closely but it has gotten so bad! She takes 3 pain medications but it makes her so tired that she cannot sTay awake. So they give her adderol to wake her up. She has side effects from these 4 medications so they put her on 3 more to alleviate those side effects.  And so on.  I am watching my mom deteriorate.  Not because of her physical ailments, but because of all the medication!  At this point with the possibility of kratom being banned, I cannot introduce this to her.  Strangely enough, she had mentioned reading about an herbal supplement that really sounded like kratom but she couldn't remember the name.   If it were to even reduce her medication in half, I know my mom could have better quality of life.   However, with this uncertainty, if it were to help just to reduce her medications, I could not watch her go back to deteriorating again.  \n\nI hope my testimony helps shed light on the kind of people who are benefitting in a positive way from kratom.  Please consider my story when making your decisions.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17780","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dawn Taitt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This substance, carefully managed, has worked wonders for me in two ways.  First, it helped me avoid a more serious dependence on opioid painkillers after a long-in-healing serious accident, and second, helped treat the pain that caused me to risk dependence when doctors consistently prescribed opioids, despite my concern that I was developing a tolerance.\n\nTo my knowledge, no deaths have been attributed to the presence exclusively of these compounds in the systems of any decedents, but obviously, more research is needed to explore the almost universal acclaim and intense preference, in terms of effectiveness and personal sense of risk, for kratom over opioids, according to the people who have used both to treat the very real issue of chronic pain.  These are people who are seeking to avoid addiction, not people seeking a high, so perhaps their voices merit your more studied and less spasmodic attention.  Methadone and buprenorphine sometimes help, but merely replacing more dangerous opioids with less dangerous opioids does not actually free the patient of opioid dependence, increasing significantly the risk of relapse (compared to the small number of people who get entirely opioid free, including a notable number of people who attribute their rare achievement in part to krartom).\n\nSo far, we have only ancecdotal information about kratom, but we know all too well and with grim detail the intense dangers of opioids and heroin, of the incredible medical and social scourge they are spreading across the country.  That scourge begins in many cases with ongoing, legitimate prescriptions, graduallly but inevitably building tolerance, and intentions no more devious than not to be in constant pain and to participate meaningfully in a productive and engaged life.  The data are both shocking and sobering; in the 30 minutes it took me to write this message, 20 more Americans have visited ER's for opioid overdose (CDC, 2016)--who knows how many more have died outside of the ER's, which many addicts (and their friends, when addicts overdose) are afraid to visit for fear of legal reprisals.    \n\nThus, not to investigate a potentially much safer and more effective alternative is, essentially, to endorse the continuation of that scourge, to which no policy measure so far introduced has proven effective, least of all those involving more intense enforcement and police actions.  That the DEA would be the agent of worsening this problem by thoughtlessly forestalling a potential solution is not only short-sighted and bitterly ironic; it's also detestable and tragic.\n\nSo, It is up to the DEA, now, to decide how many more addicts' deaths it is wiling to tacitly endore by prevenitng responsible research and regulation of kratom.  Think carefully this time, but recognize that as you do, people are dying.  Doesn't the government of the people, for whose protection the DEA exists, owe these highly endangered citizens every possible chance not to slide back into active addiction?  \n \nRegulate this product, keep an eye on it, and do all you can to support serious medical research.  \n\nSincerely,.\n\nESC","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22768","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In reference to Docket No. DEA-442W\nI am a 48 year old Operations Manager for a major corporation.

Furthermore making it illegal without doing the proper research is criminal (especially when pharmaceutical companies are currently trying to recreate the enzymes contained in Kratom).  If it retains no medicinal use, why are they trying to isolate these enzymes.  This is no different than the unjust scheduling of marijuana in spite of its documented medicinal uses.  If members of the DEA and the prison system are looking for job security, go after the doctors that have cause an opioid epidemic that kill a person every 19 minutes due to accidental overdose. The United States people deserve better that this draconian practice of locking people in cages for recreational or medicinal use of natural plants that provide overall better well being.

The same should be applied to plant based medicine.  How can this be banned when tobacco and alcohol (which have zero medicinal benefit) are legal nearly everywhere in the USA.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15083","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jon Street","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a manager of a hardware store.

I am employed in the education field as a tutor and substitute teacher. Right now in fact, Im taking time out of my post-graduate academic responsibilities because I feel it is so important to express my strong support for the medicinal herb kratom (Mitragyna Specosia) and its continued legality and unscheduled status. I am absolutely against any regulation of kratom, especially any ultra-restrictive Schedule 1 designation which would make criminals out of responsible, law-abiding adults and prevent further scientific research into the promising benefits of this herb. There are hundreds of thousands of Americans that, like myself, have depended on this plant for years to safely and effectively heal our bodies and our minds of the physical and emotional pain that we are dealing with.  When I worked with this herb for the first time in December 2009, I had done my own research prior to deciding to purchase a small amount. My primary consideration for looking into this herb was the failure of conventional anti-depressants to alleviate the anxiety and depression that I was feeling at the time, and even still deal with now (to a much lesser degree). Also I am 65, and have persistent back pain from years of lifting weights, and I desired a natural analgesic. I respected the power of the plant and began with small dosages until I had an idea of how it would affect mewhich it did in the most positive and beneficial ways. This herb has helped me immensely in dealing with social anxiety and panic attacks; where once I had problems in social situations and going out in public, I now put myself out there like never before. As a result, my confidence and self-image have improved significantly over the years, but I continue to work at it. I am the one challenging and improving myself each day, but kratom is the tool that helps me do this by bringing on a positive mindset and reducing the impact that stress and negative emotions have on me. Physically, if I am not in the best shape of my life, I am close to it. Without this plant I wouldnt be able to do the daily weight training I do now, and I have changed my diet for the better since using kratom. I have seen a range of benefits to my mental and bodily health from using this plant; it has worked holistically to improve my life in so many ways. \nWe assume that adults have the right to decide what, if anything, they ingest or put in their own bodies, even if those choices come with risks to the individual or society, as in smoking or drinking. This holds true in the case of kratom use as well, especially since this benign and salubrious herb does not even begin to compare with the addictive potential and social costs that are associated with tobacco and alcohol, respectively. If our society continues to allow adults to use alcohol and tobacco despite the significant negative impacts of their usage, there should be no question as to why they cannot also responsibly use a safe medicinal herb without the possibility of legal repercussions.  And yet, kratom is not in any way a threat to individual or personal health, certainly not like the two substances mentioned above.\nThe anecdotal and empirical evidence available proves completely contrary the notion that this herbwhich has been used safely by people in Southeast Asia for thousands of years is in any way an imminent danger to public health, as was claimed when the temporary ban was announced in late August 2016. That initial decision had as its main rationale a handful of fatalities associated with kratom use, but there is no actual proof that kratom caused any of the deaths in these cases. With all due respect to those who died, nearly every alleged kratom overdose fatality has occurred with the concomitant use of one or more pharmaceuticals/ drugs, rendering questionable the assertion that this plant had been responsible (Vradi et al., 2016). The fact is that kratom leaf in its natural form has not caused a single death over the millennia of its use in Southeast Asia, probably because its principal alkaloid, mitragynine, has significantly less potential to induce respiration depression than does morphine (Vradi et al., 2016). Kratom leaf has a highly complex phytochemistry, containing over 25 different alkaloids, and is also a good source of antioxidant catechinsincluding epicatechinwhich are associated with a wide range of physiological benefits (Duke, 1992). This plant should be thought of as a benign medicinal herb, not a dangerous drug. \nDrug policy decisions should be formulated on the basis of compassion and respect for human dignity; enforcing a draconian ban on a safe and effective botanical product and turning responsible users from all walks of life into criminals is an action that makes absolutely no sense from a moral, medical, or societal perspective. Thank you for providing the opportunity to express my views on this issue.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20354","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jameson Kuczenski","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used Kratom on and off for a few years.

Kratom saved me. I firmly believe that had I not discovered kratom, I would have sought stronger opiates and would now be dead of \"heroin\" (i.e. Chinese fentanyl analogues) overdose. Kratom not only helps me stay away from drugs; it helps me feel more able to cope with the stresses of my life and work.

One faction says you should be on Methadone for the rest of your life.  It is often likened to diabetics needing insulin.

I first started taking kratom about two and a half years ago. I've worked on farms every summer from age 11-14 years old. From 14 and 15 years old, I laid tile and did other interior work during the summer that required heavy lifting. Ever since then I've had back problems. I've seen a physical therapist and went to multiple doctors first around 16 years old. My back pain has seemed to worsen over the years but I haven't required surgery (so far). Now I'm working in a factory 48-75 hours a week. To keep being able to go to work without almost unbearable pain, I take kratom. Kratom has allowed me to work without almost unbearable pain, without having to take dangerous and addictive drugs. I have a girlfriend with 3 kids and I am the sole source of income in our house. To be able to provide for My family I have to work a job with long hours and many of those hours are spent on my feet on hard concrete floors. Kratom helps me do this 4-6 days a week. Making kratom illegal would push me to have to use very addictive pain killers and maybe even push for surgery at my young age. Please show compassion to all the people like me and keep kratom legal.\n\nThank you for reading,\nSterling Bridge","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4444","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sterling Bridge","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\n\nMy name is Nick Favara.

Please do not ban kratom. Perhaps it should be regulated as a supplement ,although I regard kratom along the likes of chamomile tea or oregano oil. An herb that quite bluntly has completely changed the quality of my life. I suffer from chronic pain due to two bulging discs in my neck that tends to pinch a major nerve. I revamped my diet and attended physical therapy regularly but was in almost constant pain. This made it very difficult to care for my child as well as the two children in my care. The pain management specialist told me they didn't give pain medication to stay at home moms yet offered me no alternatives other than \"just dealing\" with it. I was starting to become depressed ,irritable and frustrated because there didn't seem to be any solutions available. I learned about kratom from a pain management website and tried it as a last resort. I didn't want to obtain illegal prescription medication but I was desperate for relief. When I tried it ,it felt like a miracle. My pain went from a daily level 8 to about a 2 which is amazing. I don't feel \"high\" or not myself I am just able to live my life without feeling like a bear with it's paw stuck in a trap. I still attend physical therapy and maintain a strict diet. I just take my kratom when I take my other vitamins and supplements. It has completely changed the quality of my life as well as my children's. Mother Earth or God or whatever higher power there is gave us this plant for a reason. It helps thousands if not millions of people all over the world. It doesn't cure but it definitely alleviates the suffering of so many. It would be a shame if this was taken from them (and me) with no other options but to return to a life of misery or risk being a criminal .

Please allow more research on this drug, marijuana, and other drugs that could allow people to wean themselves off these harmful pharmaceuticals.

It ruined many aspects of my life, and the lives of those around me. Finally, after half a decade of being a slave to opioids, I managed to kick my addiction. It took moving all the way across the country to escape the environment and social group that was enabling my addiction, but I broke free of that addiction. \n\nSince then I have experienced chronic pain on a daily basis, and was in deep despair that I would have to suffer endlessly because I was unwilling to go back on opiate painkillers. I did research online and heard about Kratom. I went to a local shop, bought a small amount of Kratom powder, and took the recommended dose for my weight. Amazingly, it worked. Remaining vigilant for symptoms of physical or mental dependence on Kratom, I used it when my pain was unmanageable with over the counter pharmaceuticals such as ibuprofen or tylenol. \n\nSince discovering Kratom I have found relief for my chronic pain and it has kept me from being tempted to return to a destructive and abusive pattern of opiate painkiller use. Kratom has allowed me to take my life back and become a more productive and healthy member of society. I have a wife, a career, and enjoy hobbies such as hiking, swimming, and playing guitar: all of these things would not have been possible in the midst of an opiate addiction. \n\nOn a more scientific level, I have experienced very little side effects associated with my use of Kratom, particularly compared to opiate use. Unlike opioid based painkillers Kratom has not caused me severe constipation, does not make me drowsy, does not interfere with sexual function, does not cause wild fluctuations in mood, and does not bother me to not take it every day. It has about the same addictiveness to me as a cup of coffee: sometimes you want it in the morning, but if you don't get it then you quickly move on and it is not constantly on your mind. \n\nAs with any substance with an active ingredient, it is common sense to dose appropriately, just as you wouldn't take 50 tablets of ibuprofen for a headache. I would very much welcome a regulated way to purchase Kratom so that I know what I am getting, much in the same way marijuana and alcohol are regulated in my state (Oregon). I believe it is in the best interest of society to allow the sale of Kratom to continue, particularly with the scourge of opiate addiction killing so many people each and every day. Kratom has undoubtedly saved many lives, providing former opiate addicts a safe alternative to relapsing back into potentially fatal opiate abuse. \n\nThe war on drugs has villified the desperate and the suffering for long enough; allowing responsible and regulated Kratom use for adults is a good step towards alleviating some of the epidemic of opiate addiction and contributes to a healthier and more productive society.

I stopped the Lyrica and started taking the Kratom in April of 2015 and the burning stopped after 10 minutes and I felt more alert.  One night my arthritis was hurting so bad in my hands I took some kratom (I never use more than teaspoon per dose) and within 5-10 minutes the pain was gone.  I stopped taking the Lyrica and the tramadol and notified my doctors.  The next time I went to see my Neurologist, I told him about Kratom and how it had been helping me and he told me that he was happy that it was helping.  I had cut my dose from 3 times a day to twice and I rarely get the burning sensation and my Neurologist had told me that by taking the kratom the progression has pretty much slowed down.

It\nhas been my experience that when young adults, under the influence of the\nlatest designer drug, begin presenting to our emergency departments with\nincreasing frequency, an expedited updating of our drug legislation is in\norder in the interest of public health.\n\nWhile the relatively recent emergency scheduling of synthetic cathinones\n(\"bathsalts\") and synthetic cannabinoids (\"spice\"), left me nodding my\nhead in agreement with the policy decision, the proposed emergency\nscheduling of kratom has conversely left me scratching my head.  Unlike\nthe aforementioned controlled substance analogues, which are synthesized\nby illicit labs in an attempt to circumvent existing drug laws, kratom is\na natural leaf, which has been quietly consumed by people around the world\nsince the dawn of civilization.\n\nIn my work, I encounter overdoses of all types on an almost daily basis.\nOver many thousands of patient encounters, I have yet to record a single\npatient encounter that was the result of an overdose or adverse reaction\nto kratom. The experiences of my colleagues, with whom I have discussed\nthis issue, mirror my own.\n\nWhile I am not a primary care physician, and thus do not have long-term\nrelationships with my patients, I have also met a handful of patients who\nhave used kratom, and felt compelled to discuss this with me.  These\npatients seemed to genuinely feel that kratom was an asset in their lives.\n Some patients were using the plant to assuage chronic pain, while others\nwere using it as a means to avoid using \"harder\" substances such as heroin\nand alcohol.  Given the current nationwide epidemic of opiate abuse and\naddiction, I feel this latter point is especially important.\n\nSince the intended emergency scheduling announced at the end of August, a\nsignificant number of patients have come forward, and  it has become\napparent to me that there is a significant number of diverse individuals,\nranging from wounded vets with PTSD, to the elderly with chronic arthritis\npain, who are quietly using kratom as a means to alleviate their symptoms.\n It has also become clear that these people are legitimately afraid that\nthe government will step into their lives, seeming out of the blue, and\nleave them suffering.\n\nOn a personal note, I have both friends and family that use kratom for\ndifferent reasons, and this is what initially directed my attention to\nthis issue.  Speaking from the perspective of a friend and family member,\nit has been experience that they have used, and continue to use, the plant\nresponsibility.  The proposed scheduling in August has caused them quite a\nbit of consternation, which as ultimately compelled me to speak out\nregarding my personal and professional experiences with kratom.\n\nGiven the long history of human use of this plant, and the large number of\nAmericans who feel it helps make their lives manageable, I feel FDA\nregulation of plain kratom leaf as a dietary supplement with an age\nrestriction may be a reasonable path for the plant to take at this\njuncture.  This would  allow the many individuals who derive benefit from\nkratom to continue to use it without fear of criminal penalty, while an\nongoing and more comprehensive safety monitoring protocol can be\ninstituted.  Furthermore, proper regulation could possibly encompass\nkeeping kratom from being inappropriately sold in gas stations and smoke\nshops as a \"legal high,' where it is often sold as a concentrated alkaloid\nextract that may even be combined with other unknown ingredients.\n\nAs both a concerned citizen and a physician, I would like to see our\nfederal agencies step in to help the individual citizen consumer, with a\nfocus on harm-reduction, industry regulation, product safety, and\neducation--without resorting to draconian drug policy and criminalization\nof vulnerable populations.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration;\n\nCalifornia Emergency Physician\n\n**Due to the privacy concerns of patients, friends and family, I have\nelected to post this comment in semi-anonymous fashion.

I'm 29 years old, have a BSN, and work as an emergency room nurse.I have been using kratom (ground whole leaf) for the past 3 years. It has been such a blessing in many ways that I will try to explain. In 2013 I had a lumbar disk herniation with significant nerve impingement. Controlled pain medicine was never an option because of my job but I did see a pain management specialist for cortisone injections and chiropractic treatments. I felt very out of place there being so young and otherwise healthy and being drug tested randomly at some visits. The clinic required weekly visits which ultimately I wasn't able to keep up due to being a travel RN. I researched exercises I could do myself and natural alternatives to Motrin and Tylenol, which didn't seem to be helping. I found kratom, and decided to give it a try. It helped me immensely. With it I was able to keep my pain from impacting my life and was able to again get good sleep. I also immediately noticed other benefits. Before ever taking kratom, even before the pain, I would often feel fatigued. On days I took kratom I felt energized, like from coffee in a way but not in a hyper or jittery way. Also I am somewhat of a quiet introverted person, sometimes moody, and often very reserved. Since taking kratom, I have been much more outgoing. I feel more energized, positive, and social. Because of this, I have been able to strengthen existing relationships, create new ones, be a better nurse, and an all around better happier person. I still take it before bed if I am having pain but mostly use it in the mornings, instead of coffee I make kratom tea. I have not noticed any side effects and have taken it almost every day except for a few trips where I have flown and didn't want to risk getting delayed at security with a bag of brownish powdery material. On those days without it I had some trouble sleeping and my mood and energy levels were noticeably worse than I have become accustomed to.  Kratom has made and continues to make my life so much better everyday. I hope to continue using it as a supplement indefinitely unless it is found to be detrimental to health. To my knowledge there is no such data to support that concern. While taking too much of anything will make someone sick the DEAs numbers dont support that this is actually happening or that it has any real danger. DEA cites 660 poison control calls since 2010, this is an extremely low number.  Ive linked the most recent poison control annual report that i could find (2014). It is a fact that out of about 2.5 million exposures per year, kratom calls to poison control have made up approximately 0.005% over the past 5 years (660 out of 12.5 million = 0.000053).  This does not constitute a public health crisis. As a nurse, I see the devastating effects of the opiate epidemic daily. How many lives have been lost to opiates? The DEA cites 15 deaths related to kratom, besides being an extremely low number it is disputed by the American Kratom Association that in each case there were other drugs present in the toxicology. Poison control data attributes only 1 death to kratom since 2010. I beleive this proposed ban is a knee jerk reaction to the mischaracterization of kratom as an opiate. The opiate epidemic is real, the kratom epidemic is not, the irony is that kratom may be part of the solution to opiate overuse and addiction. How many people have used kratom instead of a prescription or street opiate? This has to equal a huge net positive to public health and how do you study or account for people like me, people that may never need to be exposed to prescription pain meds because a natural supplement is sufficient.  Please do not outlaw or vilify this herbal substance that can be so beneficial.\nSincerely,\nAlexander Caplan\npoison control report: https://aapcc.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/annual_reports/2014_AAPCC_NPDS_Annual_Report.pdf","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11004","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alexander Caplan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please consider doing more research on this plant before you create an underground market.

I have never used kratom for pain but I have used pharmaceutical pain killers.  The VA had me taking 5 Oxycontin during the day and 2-4 Vicodin at night in addition to 9 Gabapentin daily.  I was so sedated that I could barely function, still in pain and the side effects were very bad.  Opioid medications are not a viable long term pain management strategy for several reasons.\n\nThe effectiveness diminishes with use so dosage must continually be increased to remain somewhat effective.  Opioids also cause more sensitivity to pain, making the dosage increases even more frequent.  The sedative effects cause danger while driving and with other activities.  Conditions such as sleep apnea, the reason I had to take Vicodin in the evenings, can become life threatening with opioid use.  In addition to the physical and mental side effects of these dangerous drugs, there are also the monetary effects.  Several years ago, I had to pay well over $300 for a 30 day supply of Fentanyl patches that never helped the pain except on the very rare instances when it made me so weak that I could hardly stand.\n\nI don't know how effective kratom might be for long term pain management but I do know that cannabis is much more effective for me than using Vicodin for breakthrough pain.  And cannabis has no harmful side effects other than intoxication.  And as I understand it, kratom doesn't even have that side effect.  Opioid pain meds are only good for short term pain treatment and the profit of the pharmaceutical industry.  And if the government cares for the well being of its citizens, it will not make criminals of kratom users.  There will almost certainly be a large increase in the number of deaths due to self medication with illicit drugs if kratom becomes unavailable legally.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15276","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steve Vandever","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern:\nIm sufferring from UCTD,inflammatory arthritis and chronic migraines my life is full of pain.

Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22798","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brett Wells","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I feel there is no reason on Earth to make this herb illegal. \nThere are may other issues to concentrate on. \nKeep Kratom Legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5862","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have personally used kratom products in a tea form to relieve myself from backpain .\nplz keep it legal so I can get a natural product for pain relief","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19444","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"rishit karia","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using Kratom since I was 12 years old medicinally.

It would be illogical to make Kratom illegal, when two of the requirements for classifying a substance as Schedule 1 are that:  a.) the substance must be highly dangerous and b.) it must have no medicinal value.  Kratom cannot be directly linked to any deaths, as the few individuals who have died with Kratom in their systems, also had dangerous substances in their systems (such as Heroin).  Also, there have been more poison control reports for laundry detergent pods in the last seven months than there have been for Kratom in the last five years.  We currently do not know much regarding Kratom's potential medicinal value, but making it Schedule 1 would halt any research on Kratom, making us unable to learn of any potential medical benefits.  Making Kratom illegal, when dangerous substances such as cigarettes and alcohol remain legal, is downright hypocritical, and makes one question if money is the motivating factor in making these decisions. \n\n2.  The Center for Regulatory Effectiveness states that banning Kratom would be a violation of the US-Canada Regulatory Cooperation Council Agreement, since Kratom is classified as a permitted \"National Health Product\" in Canada.\n\n3.  Banning Kratom could lead to higher rates of drug abuse and overdoses.  Alabama banned Kratom on May 10, 2016.  In the month following the ban, the number of overdoses in Birmingham, Alabama doubled. \n\n4.  A large number of people using Kratom are disabled.  Imprisoning these individuals, who have medical needs such as wheelchairs, walkers, etc., would be very expensive and inconvenient.\n\n5.  Banning Kratom could cause the public to lose faith in our government and their decision-making process regarding substance scheduling.  There is a huge community of individuals who have taken Kratom without any ill-effects.  These individuals have spoken out against the potential ban and have shared their stories.  Following through with this ban would send a message to the public that our government isn't really listening, and isn't really looking out for our best interests.

The DEA knew the streets were being flooded with Oxycontin, knew which doctors were doing it, & didn't try to stop or slow it down until years after the abuse and overdose rates were skyrocketing. Now a lot of those people are seeking treatment due to an almost complete reversal where it's too hard for even disabled people to acquire narcotic pain medicines which is effecting both those with debilitating conditions and those who became addicted through use/abuse that was practically promoted on a large scale. Those seeking professional treatment invariably find themselves with the options of Methadone or Suboxone, finding themselves trading one addiction for another. \n\nKratom offers a way to get away from the narcotic pharmaceutical pills or medicines that are often known to do everything from cause permanent addiction, or destroy people's; livers, kidneys, or their entire digestive track. So many people have died of cancer they might not have acquired had it not been for a debilitating injury and having few options but taking large amounts of, or high potency narcotic pain pills. It offers them a way to potentially ween themselves off all of that and eventually Kratom too if it were just an addiction. \n\nIt's just wrong to outlaw something giving the pharmaceutical companies a monopoly. Cannabis has been outlawed it's one of the oldest medicines known to man, and it's all about protecting industries from Pharmaceuticals to the Prison System. What makes it worse, the DEA keeps agents on the street; smoking cannabis, using narcotic pain pills, and probably even using methamphetamine though I've never heard of that last one personally, and my information comes directly from law enforcement officers. And really it's not those with money who get in trouble for breaking these arbitrary protectionist laws, it's those who can't afford the lawyer, who can't afford the fines, and who can be easily sucked into a system to basically be used as pawns to generate profit from the tax-payers and keep certain industries in control of their monopolies. Of course it has the \"bonus\" of keeping poor marginalized people poor and marginalized because once they get much of a record at all they can forget anything but being a wage-slave. \n\nIf the DEA cared about the drug use and abuse rates they'd consider all options, they'd be looking at other countries, they'd see that Portugal decriminalized all drugs a long time ago and the use/abuse rates have done nothing but plummet. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/05/why-hardly-anyone-dies-from-a-drug-overdose-in-portugal/ \n\nWe need to keep in mind it was Prohibition of alcohol was what really created Al Capone, it's prohibition that allows for these cartels and drug gangs to destroy lives and communities. It's prohibition that keeps drugs; \"romantic\", trendy, a sort of \"forbidden fruit\" and if we'll remember the original forbidden fruit got consumed too and that was God directly prohibiting that fruit, people who personally knew and spoke to God wouldn't listen to him but they're going to listen to the government or DEA? \n\nI'm just a concerned citizen who has been directly effected and impacted by drugs and the policies surrounding them. I eventually want to have children and I don't want \"Scarface\" to be a popular poster in their teenage bedrooms. Don't want them thinking; cannabis, kratom, pills, heroin, meth, cocaine, or any other illicit substance is \"cool\", don't want to hear \"Gangster Rap\" blasting from their bedrooms where's they're \"rapping\" about drugs, being drug kingpins, or how they use drugs to help sexually assault young women. And I strongly feel there is only 1 way to end this scourge, and it won't be an Iron Fist, outlawing nature, or destroying more lives based on the claim someone's drug use is \"destroying their life\". It will be by destroying the outrageously inflated price, the romanticism, the \"forbidden fruit\" aspect, and overall \"Drug War\" insanity. \n\nBut if you guys do decide to go ahead and continue draconian polices, could you go ahead and outlaw Sugar, seriously, MRI Brain Scans shows it lights up the same brain regions as cocaine and other stimulants. Outlaw giving children Amphetamine Sulfate and similar for ADD and such too, isn't that just priming them for later drug abuse? But do please sleep well with your job security, knowing you'd be contributing to a \"free country\" that's barely a shadow of what it's supposed to be in terms of freedom, due in part to your policies. \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2573","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My husband is in the military and currently on deployment.

Broken bones, concussions, sprains were a daily thing. Now that I've grown older I am paying for all that with pretty much constant pain. \n\nI started using Kratom at the advice of friend from across the country. He was also a extreme sport person and has the same deal, chronic pain. He told me about a fantastic alternative to the hell that is opiate use, Kratom. I've been using it for over 2 years now and the difference in my quality of life is amazing. The pain is mitigated better than any amount of opiates I've been on. The side effects  are minimal to none and if I happen to had a day or week where my body is playing nice, I just don't take it and there are no withdrawal symptoms. It is truly a life saver.\n\nPlacing Kratom as a schedule 1 drug is a huge mistake. There is no reason to put a plant that's related to coffee next to cocaine. It won't change the people that want to be junkies, they will, no matter what. History proved with prohibition that it won't work an will just create a larger, more powerful criminal element. Placing kratom on the same list will repeat the mistakes of history. \n\nAs I stated before, the people that insist on being a burden to society by being intoxicated constantly will still be there, forever. I have an alcoholic sister and it's ruined her life, yet that is legal. Maybe it's lime to switch the focus of the \"war\" to the people that need help and not the tools they use to continue down that dark road. \n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16007","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom allows me to live a normal and  happy life, finally free of an opioid addiction.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15448","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anthony Koeninger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep this legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6708","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Basham","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi my name is Marilyn and i wanted to talk about what an impact kratom has had on me and my family and friends.

I hold a Bachelors of Science in Nutrition and a Masters degree. \nI believe Kratom should stay legal.\nI live with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD and chronic pain. I am not a victim. I am an active advocate for my health. I attend psychotherapy sessions regularly, check ups with my health provider team and research treatments for depression and chronic pain. I learned I had \"early ovarian decline\" at age 37. By replacing estrogen and testosterone, I was able to alleviate some of my mood disorder symptoms, but not all. \nOver the past 19 years, my mental health care practitioner and I have tried numerous medications for the MDD (at least six+ different combinations), including Adderall as an off-label for treatment-resistant depression. \nIn 1999 I began to experience intense pain on the right side of my neck and down my arm. I sought out conservative treatment with chiropractic, acupuncture, and physiotherapy. In December of 2015, I underwent a two level cervical spinal fusion and in August of 2016 a Lateral Epicondylectomy and Repair of my right forearm. I have degenerative disc disease and a herniated disc in my lumbar spine - confirmed by multiple MRI's and consequently chronic pain in this area. Over the course of the last three years, I have taken Norco, Percocet, Naproxen and ibuprofen for the pain and post op recoveries. I have been taking Norco daily for at least three years.\nI realized, despite my vigilance with taking Norco, I had a developed a dependency on it. The low back pain is something I have on a daily basis. I have been open and honest with my providers about my prescriptions. I do not doctor shop. I have an excellent relationship with my primary care doctor and my orthopedic specialist.\nIn April of 2016, I tried to take my life because of the despair of chronic pain and the unrelenting depression. After seeing my therapist, I believe the combination of the dysphoria from the Norco and my MDD contributed to this overwhelming state of mind.\nIn September 2016 I learned about Kratom. I began consuming it as a tea in October. In one day I was able to discontinue my use of Norco immediately. The joy I felt after my first day, then a week of not taking Norco was honestly indescribable. The happiness of sharing this with my health care providers was also an incredible feeling.\nI notice that the small amount of tea I drink one time a day also helps alleviate my symptoms of depression. I discontinued my prescription of Adderall. I still continue to take a lower dose of my antidepressant. I still continue to see my therapist and health care practitioners.\nMost importantly, I do not feel \"the need\" to drink Kratom tea daily or more than once a day. I do not get/feel \"high.\" I do not feel \"impaired,\" nor do I feel any dependence or \"addiction.\" In fact, I do not drink Kratom tea daily. I could not say this about Norco, Percocet or even Adderall.\nI am so grateful that something like Kratom tea alleviates my pain and my depression. Because of this, I feel focused, balanced, motivated and most of the time, pain-free. I feel Im a better stepmother, spouse, and employee because I am not in the constant pain and depression cycle. I have lost many, many days (honestly at my age, possibly years) of productivity in work and life due to depression and pain.\nI continue to practice healthy lifestyle choices - I exercise regularly and avoid substances which can worsen depression/anxiety and aggravate pain. Drinking kratom tea has freed me from the daily need of painkillers and the pain-depression cycle. Kratom tea has been a gift of freedom. Having a chronic painful condition can limit your choices - that is why I believe Kratom should stay legal - as it allows a person to manage their health (in my case, pain and MDD) in a healthy way. From this letter, I hope you can see an individual who is educated and dedicated to their health. An individual who has been a compliant patient; who uses the least invasive methods of treatment first, who communicates with her health care providers. A person who believes there are many paths to well-being and is an active participant in staying healthy. I do not condemn prescription medications, nor do I condemn Kratom. I believe keeping Kratom legal is the right step in allowing individuals to choose their method of health and their option for choice. In an age where pharmaceutical companies have enormous financial stakes in this country, please keep Kratom legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20451","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Betsy Bougie","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I find this herb to be very beneficial in pain management as I am a construction worker.

I am a 31 year old wife, mother, Christian and professional as well as a person who is in recovery from Alcohol and prescription pill abuse.  I have been clean and sober for nearly four years.  After the birth of my son a year ago, I noticed my body seemed to be hurting all over with not much relief.  I pushed through it as I've done for the past four years.  I then ruptured a disc in my lower back and because I was in recovery, I opted not to take narcotic pain relievers.  I suffered in pain for months and considered surgery until a friend who is also a wife, mother and small business owner told me about Kratom.  She suffers from a serious  chronic pain disease and said she had been taking Kratom for about 6 months and it was the only thing that helped relieve her pain and not cause her to be foggy like the prescriptions she had taken.  She had a sample in her purse and she let me have it.  Because I am a cautious person and did not want to jeopardize my sobriety, I did my research on what Kratom is and what type of effects it might have.  After a few days of reading up on Kratom, I took my first dose.  I did not feel an overwhelming feeling like some of my previous narcotic medications.  I simply felt a sense of wellbeing and calm with moderate pain relief.  I did not feel sleepy nor foggy.  I have since sampled different types of Kratom and have found the strains that work best for me. I have since been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease which was the cause of my all over body pain.  Kratom allows me to take care of my family as well as continue to work.  \n I even got my husband to try it.  He is a disabled Army veteran who is vehemently opposed to all prescription medications and chooses natural therapies for pain and anxiety relief.  He takes small doses throughout the day which gives him the energy to get out and work without being in crippling pain with every step.  He has not walked with his cane since he's started taking it.  \nKratom is a natural herb much like the herbs I get from my local vitamin shop that improves our quality of life.  Please do not ban Kratom because I fear it would have a negative result for the multitude of people who have benefited from it to get off serious drugs.

Such a classification would put kratom -- a plant consumed safely in the U.S for decades and world-wide for millennia, and one that helps millions of people -- on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. Such an action would be entirely inappropriate. The proposed DEA scheduling would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown the primary alkaloids in kratom to be beneficial without causing respiratory depression; the main cause of death (from suicide) from opiate overdose.\n\nKratom is a regulated dietary ingredient. Kratom is not a drug. Kratom is not addictive. \n\nOne of my dear friends, a 74 year-old wonderful woman who suffers from fibromyalgia and the crippling effects of a car accident, has gratefully used kratom daily for the last two years and has therefore been able to get out of bed and live a normal life interacting with her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren with no sign of addiction or side effects. If the DEA's intent goes through, this special and harmless woman will be denied access to the blessing of kratom and her life will be turned upside down into one of agony and despair. Using prescription opiates is not a viable option because they are addictive and can cause harmful side effects. Such an outcome is unacceptable for this loving and good person.\n\nThe public overwhelmingly supports the use of kratom and knows first-hand that this safe plant has no harmful side effects and that it is not addictive. Prohibiting kratom would worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.    \nThe Center for Regulatory Effectiveness published a persuasive letter that they sent to the DEA criticizing the proposed ban. The following link leads to a site which contains a link to the CRE letter. The site also contains more than 900+ comments, mostly from people who safely use kratom and who oppose the ban: \n\nhttp://www.thecre.com/forum8/?p=294&mc_cid=dff3cffa44&mc_eid=912840a662\n\nBanning kratom would expand the war on drugs for NO good reason. Kratom has been safely used by millions of people in the United States and evidence supports kratom's potential as a safe pain reliever and opioid replacement. Please use common sense as well as your concern for the well-being of U.S. citizens and terminate the ill-advised, misinformed intent to schedule the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as schedule 1 controlled substances.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\t\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20230","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard McIntyre","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for giving me the ability to give input on this action.

Kratom, with potential to relieve withdrawal experiences from opioids, is on the shelves of head shops. It is not regulated by the FDA/DEA/ETC, and therefore provides no profitable opportunity for those playing this deceptive game 'above' the lay citizens' heads. \n  At this point in our history we need to honor the voice of the people and allow access to ANYTHING that someone could grow in a pot on their patio. Corporate interest has been served long enough, and without the ignorance of what this type of tyranny can lead to as we look at our species' VERY recent history we are responsible to create for our future generations rather than destroy. Restriction, and any war on personal freedoms, implies limitation. Limitation leads to atrophy. Atrophy leads to decay.\n  We are rapidly decaying as a nation. One step in the right direction is ending the war on drugs. Then we look at the corporate criminals who knowingly drug the population to the point of death through addiction, and begin implementing transparency in our governing bodies. Restricting the population further, and blocking access to a natural supplement shown to ease chronic pain with few known side-effects, is not offering liberty and a pursuit of happiness. \n  I trust there are still those willing to be voices of truth in this lifetime, even at the expense of upsetting the powers-that-be. I trust there are those individuals placed within these corrupt systems with enough courage to be a stand for a population left to whither in the name of profit.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22053","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mikela Bowers","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In refrence to Docket No DEA-442W\n\nTo whom it concerns, \n\nMy name is Jessica Dennis & I live in the wonderful state of Arkansas. I would like to share with you my Kratom story with the DEA & its regulators in hopes of reversing their mind set on this helpful plant. A little bit about me. I am a female in my mid 30's, I am a mother of two beautiful children , I am also a supervisor in a top Fortune 500 company. I am college educated & have over 11 years experience in the finical services industry. I am a responsible kratom user and have been for using kratom safely for about 6 years. I have never been in any legal trouble, never arrested, not even a speeding ticket on my record. In the 6 years I have used this wonderful plant, I have never gotten sick from it, overdosed after consuming it, nearly died,after using it or gone to the E.R. after using kratom. I do not abuse it & I only buy pure Kratom from online verifiable vendors who publish the authenticity of their products. \n\nI fully believe in the power of this plant. Before kratom I went from Dr. to Dr. in hopes they would prescribe me the perfect medicine for my mild depression & anxiety. Every few months I was at the pharmacy with a new expensive prescription.  I would wait the recommended time to allow my body adjust, and sadly each time was a disappointment . I still never felt like myself, I still felt like a zombie and unable to be their for my family 100%. I got sick and tired of being sick and tired, so one day as I lay sobbing on my bed preying for help, I went online and started searching for natural substances for depression. I came across Kratom and ordered my first supply and have never looked back. Kratom helped me feel like me again with no side effects or high cost prescriptions & Drs. visits. I was able to work , I was able to be 100% engaged with my family and friends, & I was able to wake up each morning happy , ready to take on a new day. Kratom is a safe, low cost, effective plant for millions of people battling aliments ranging from depression, anxiety, pain, skin disorders and addiction. \n\nKratom, sadly has taken a hit for some stories in the media. Kratom has been safely used by its indigenous people for thousands of years. There is not one report (that I could find) showing kratom to be a direct result of death in a user. The reports and stories online are one filled with misinformation, those stories stating that Kratom is a result in ones death are false, those deaths were a direct result of dangerous drugs that were ingested by the user. I do agree that Kratom should have regulations around the purchase of Kratom. The responsible kratom users and the DEA want the same thing, to keep dangerous kratom out of the public. I know a lot of the reason Kratom has a bad name is from companies who mix substances in their kratom or vendors who market their kratom as a \"legal high\" or vendors who simply don't care and are trying to sell whatever they can to make money. My biggest suggestion would to stop allowing kratom to be sold in head shops (online only) & to make age restrictions on this product, in fact over 1/2 of responsible kratom consumers are over the age of 21. Lastly, creating a website or link that when the kratom community sees an irresponsible vendor or brand on the market, we can report it and they be investigate then shut down. The DEA & the Katom Community can work together to get bad companies off the market. Please do not punish the entire responsible kratom community for the irresponsible vendors. More people die from alcohol, tobacco & energy drinks then anything, but those products are still legal and sold.\n\nIn my closing statement, I would like ask the DEA to understand when evaluating the benefits vs the negative side effects , that the benefits outweigh the side effects 100 to 1. Kratom does help millions of Americans with chronic conditions, Kratom is safe, Kratom is affordable, Kratom has never cause a death, Kratom is not addictive, & Kratom deserves to stay available and legal to the millions of people including myself.  Thank you for taking the time to let me share my story.\n\nSincerely, \n\nJessica Dennis","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2437","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jessica Dennis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"   We have enough drugs that are illegal, We don't need anymore, we need less.

It is related to the coffee plant, and does not get the user high in any way, shape, or form.  Many have implied that the DEA is being given a directive from the FDA in order for pharmaceutical companies can run and patent drugs containing the active ingredient Mitragynine.  It helps for pain, but not in the fashion of narcotic based Hydrocodone pill.  It's more like taking an aspirin that can subdue some intense pain.  I have a pinched sciatic nerve in my back, and I take some Kratom capsules in the morning.  About noon time I can feel them start to wear off.  Every doctor that I have been to has told me that I WOULD be taking pain pills for the rest of my life.  Today, I am glad to say that is not the case.  I have seen world reports that people are addicted and stealing due to Kratom, but can assure you those reports are completely unfounded.  As soon as a member of the panel licks some Kratom, you will completely understand that it is not taken recreationally.  The first question that most persons ask is \"how in the world do you all take this stuff, it tastes disgusting!\"  To say that someone likes to swallow giant chunks of rock salt would be more appropriate.  Although some states have jumped on a bandwagon to ban this dangerous substance, it is a bill sponsored and passed without any research or logic.  If someone to ingest a large amount of kratom, they may start to feel sick.  If I were to ingest a large amount of rock salt, the sick feeling would be there just as well.  I have read of many persons that switch from strong opiates to Kratom, and then stop taking Kratom without any type of withdrawals.  As a service to the citizens of the United States, please do not make this herb illegal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15267","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kurt Lacher","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This has changed my life.

My hands burn, ache, throb and become numb several times a day, despite maintaining an ergonomic desk setup.\n\nI've never taken prescription pain medication and was using ibuprofen to try to manage the pain.  It wasn't helping and made the decision to talk to my doctor.  I explained that I'd quit drinking and because of that, did not want to take pain medication. Prescription pain medication is incredibly addictive and even more so for people who have quit drinking (or any other addictive substance). My doctor told me about kratom and explained the benefits. Most importantly, it is a highly effective pain reliever with very few side effects. Kratom has the side benefit of helping me maintain an active and alcohol free lifestyle due to the mild mood elevating and mild stimulating effects of the leaf. The effects are akin to coffee or tea.  There is no 'high' to speak of.  The plant is in the coffee family, and it is exactly as addictive as coffee. It however does not cause the same nervousness or stomach upset that I've felt when drinking too much coffee, and I've suffered no withdrawals when not taking it.  I never have kratom on the weekend, because I don't need it unless I'm working.  I also forget to take it some days, and realize later when my hands are aching that I haven't had any kratom.  That is the full extent of the addictive effects.\n\nIt is definitely not a street drug.  Kratom is a leaf on a tree that grows in Southeast Asia.  There is no additive, it is simply ground into a powder, making it simpler to ingest in pill form or mixed with a liquid.  The kratom dosage that I started taking in March of 2012 is the same amount that I take today - 1 tsp twice a day mixed into grapefruit juice. \n\nKratom allows me to do my job pain free, and focus on the things that matter. It truly has changed my life, so I'm asking you to please vote against SB540.\n\nIf you have questions about kratom, please visit www.americankratom.org. Your jobs are incredibly helpful and meaningful, and I appreciate your time and service to the state.\n\nRespectfully,\nJulia Barlow","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18317","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Julia Barlow","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban kratom.

I have had Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for my entire adult life.  I have been to many doctors over the years trying to find a solution to my symptoms.  My day to day life is very difficult.  I have 3 kids so I am very busy.  A few years ago I found a great Rheumatologist in Florida.  My life seemed much easier with the treatment I was given and I was happy.  That all ended when my husband got out of the military and I lost my health insurance.  Since then I have not been able to get insurance because of the cost so I have not had any treatment for a few years.  I went back to being miserable every day and some days I was bed ridden.  After doing some research online to find ways to improve my symptoms I came across Kratom.  I researched everything I could about it and came to the conclusion that I would try it because I had nothing to lose.  Kratom has changed my life in so many ways.  I am able to function and be the mother I need to be.  Kratom has almost completely taken my pain away and even gives me a little energy.  I might have more energy just because The pain is almost gone, But that's fine with me.  One of the things that I love about Kratom is that it doesn't make me feel sleepy or weird like some pain medication does.  It like I am normal again and I haven't felt this way since I was a teenager.  I also don't feel sick if I skip a day or run out which is something that medications can do.  My kids and my husband have seen a big difference in how I feel and my level of activity now and they are super excited about that as am I.  If Kratom becomes illegal my life will go back to being almost unbearable and not only will I suffer, but more importantly my family will suffer.  Kratom has been the only thing that helps me since I lost my medical insurance.  It is completely safe and has no side effects.  It is a wonderful natural supplement that has changed so many lives for the better.  I have not heard of one person being affected negatively by Kratom and if there are people out there that have had issues with it I am sure it is very few people compared to the amount of people it has helped.  Making Kratom illegal will not only affect the people who depend on it, but it will also affect their family.  I hope my story has helped people to understand just how important and amazing this plant is and how it can help people who suffer with unbearable conditions.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17658","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Annette Brush","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA I saw joe rogan podcast with Chris bell and I think people should have the freedom to choose their  own way of dealing with health issues.

The scheduling system should have scientific merit, given its inception: something this agency has ignored for over 30 years. Attempting to emergency schedule a plant that has caused very little physical harm over decades of use, with clear medicinal benefits as purported by users, simply brings us back to the draconian beginning of the scheduling system.\n\nAs scientific evidence mounts for the use of cannabis along with therapeutic use of many of the schedule 1 psychedelic substances, a rash decision to classify another plant as schedule 1 is shortsighted and further induces distrust in the government and this agency. As information disseminates, it becomes apparent that the scheduling of drugs such as these had entirely ulterior political and racial motivations. Criminalizing drug possession, use, abuse and addiction has become another \"entrepreneurial\" route for corporations in the private prison system to abuse human rights in exchange for profit margins while the black market thrives on high prices and violence across the country and the world.\n\nIt is time to step up and do your part by paying attention to science, not hysteria, and leave kratom entirely alone. There are hundreds of species of plants that are extremely toxic and dangerous with psychoactive effects that are perfectly legal to grow and own, yet kratom is self-moderating in its own consumption making it almost impossible to have a strong adverse reaction to unless mixed with other illicit substances. Kratom has helped so many people ween off stronger prescription drugs, those legally obtained from our good samaritan pharmaceutical companies. Kratom has helped many ween themselves off street opiates, such as heroin, effectively HELPING your mission to rid our streets of drugs. Kratom, along with cannabis I might add, has also helped those with chronic pain avoid falling into the depths of prescription opiate addiction.  Kratom is not perfect and no drug is, everything has side effects, but Kratom is far from a bane of society. \n\nKeeping kratom legal will do exactly what this agency is designed to do: keeping people away from the drugs that truly tear families and communities apart. Driving kratom underground will simply perpetuate the never-ending war on drugs that only gets worse and never better.\n\nBe on the right side of history and learn that American values are predicated on making decisions for ourselves that only affect ourselves.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16677","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyle Kotex","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 28 year old mother who suffers from chronic debilitating pain.

I'm a twenty year old college student, currently studying biology. I first heard about kratom about six months ago. I bought some from a local herb shop, and began taking it with breakfast about every other morning. After about a week, I noticed some very subtle, yet day changing effects. At first, I noticed that I wasn't so stressed all the time. I would measure out about two grams, gulp it down with water, and start the day with a good mood. Secondly, I injured my left knee in a football game in high school. After recovering naturally, along with physical therapy, most days, I don't feel much pain anymore, but every now and then, while running or playing sports, I'll land on that knee in a bad way, and all of that pain comes rushing back. But fortunately for me, the most recent time this happened, I discovered that taking kratom greatly reduces this pain. I  tried prescription medicine for pain, when the injury first occurred, and I didn't like the way it made me feel. It sapped my energy, making me feel tired and lethargic. However, I know that kratom has been a great help, as a detox,  to many people who have abused painkillers, or suffered from addiction to them. \n        Kratom has been a great natural remedy for me for the last six months. I've never had to increase the amount I take at a time (about two grams), I've never felt the need to take it more than once in a day, and I've never felt like It's addicting. It has helped me so much, and I have read dozens of stories written by other people that have been helped by it, some say even saved by it. Thank you for taking the time to read my comment, and on behalf of everyone who has discovered the beneficial and healthful properties of this plant, we ask you to please reconsider prohibiting kratom.

I do know multiple people who do though. To me, kratom seems no different then someone drinking coffee, alcohol, or smoking cigarettes, or marijuana. It's helping people with pain and helping them ween off of opioids. The prescription drug problem in this country is outrageous and I believe kratom and marijuana helps people get off their addictions of prescription drugs, which are designed to make people who take them become addicted to them. The deaths from prescription drugs are so many that you would think that our country's government would want to do the research and do something to help. All they care about is making money off of these pills instead of the health of the people in this country. Kratom has no proof of causing death or becoming addictive.

I have lived in chronic pain since age 5. My pain started in my feet and quickly spread up my body. By the time I was a teenager, I suffered from severe foot pain, abdominal pain, back issues and migraines. I was sent to doctor after doctor with no relief. At the age of 20 I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and treated with a medication that made me pass out. Soon after, I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, degenerative disc disease, and lupus. I spent years on every medication imaginable including opioid pain meds. I got very little relief and in 2010 I was placed on permanent disability. This past year I started researching alternative treatments and found kratom. It has not cured my issues by any means but it has helped me immensely. I have been able to return to work part time, play with my granddaughter and have a social life that I was always in too much pain to have before. I have never had any issues with kratom. Research is the key.

This would put the herbal supplement, Kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. This  would be a travesty, that would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown Kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.  Many veterans use Kratom to battle PTSD, depression and alleviate chronic pain from battle injuries.\n\nIm a 57-year-old development engineer in Ohio; I am employed at medical device company that designs and manufactures MRI devices.  I have used Kratom for a back injury (herniated pulposus nucleus \"slipped/bulged disc) that I had surgery for over 10 years ago while working as a research engineer at the university that I received my engineering degrees from. Two discs were damaged at the time; surgery repaired one. Afterwards, I was fine for a few years. Now, I occasionally, get severe sciatica pain (referred pain in the leg from a spinal injury) and I found that Kratom could be used without the horrible side effects that I remember when I was prescribed opiates for my injury years ago. \n\nKratom allows me to function and do my job as an engineer on days when my pain would otherwise keep me home in bed.  It does not make me high or detract from my mental processes like opiates had when I took them as prescribed. If the US Congress does not take steps to stop the DEA's ban, then many productive citizens of the United States will suffer or risk becoming criminals. Kratom is a safe herbal dietary supplement that is an  alternative to pharmaceutical drugs. Kratom has changed my life. \n\nPlease do not use flawed data and make a flawed decision. Patent filings and scholarly papers have shown the components of Kratom are medically useful. The deaths attributed to Kratom are a result of polydrug abuse. It makes no more sense than to ban coffee since its often found in a drunk drivers system. I fear, if taken, this action by the DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of opiate abuse.\n\nI know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21470","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Allen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Charli. I am 36 years old and a current student. I dont use Kratom myself, but it has changed my life none the less. My wife injured her back several years ago. This ended her career as an EMT just as it started. She moved on to a less strenuous job as a photographer with the aid of Narcotic Opiate Pain Killers from her doctors. This quickly led to addiction. One or two days in gaps between prescriptions caused by her insurance put her through the excruciating ordeal of withdraw. All in front of our children, in front of me. She was not some pleasure seeker, not some junkie looking for a fix, or whatever other stereotypes of opiate addicts that may exist, she was a mother trying to support her family and be an active part of her childrens lives. \nThe side-effects of the opiates, and the torturous withdraws, were changing her behaviors and all of our lives. The emotional pain I endured watching my most loved one suffer like that was indescribable. Eventually she found Kratom. She has been able to get completely off of the opiates, and return to work with little to no pain, and no more withdraws from opiates. Her Kratom Tea has changed all of our lives, and returned my wife to herself, and her family. It has even had the added side effect of helping her with her intestinal problem symptoms which had hospitalized her once. \nBeyond my own person experiences, and the experiences of other users of Kratom, the idea of American freedom is rooted in the freedom to make our own choices as long as they dont hurt others. Kratom is a harmless plant with an extremely long history of use. If it were a danger, surely that would be a plain fact by now. Making Kratom, or its alkaloids, a schedule 1 drug is not only pointless, but will cause harm to those using it.\nI would like to share a few quotes with you as well. In the 1972 report commissioned by President Nixon titled, Marihuana, A Signal of Misunderstanding, The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, the following word seem to apply to Kratom also, On the basis of this evaluation we believe that the criminal law is too harsh a tool to apply to personal possession even in the effort to discourage use. It implies an overwhelming indictment of the behavior which we believe is not appropriate. The actual and potential harm of use of the drug is not great enough to justify intrusion by the criminal law into private behavior, a step which our society takes only 'with the greatest reluctance. I am certain that Kratom is no more harmful than Marijuana, and potentially less harmful than Alcohol. As stated in the 1915 Kentucky Supreme Court decision in the case of Commonwealth v. Campbell, It is not within the competency of government to invade the privacy of the citizen's life and to regulate his conduct in matters in which alone is concerned, or to prohibit him any liberty the exercise which will not directly injure society.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20874","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Charles Calabrese","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 42 year old mother, I have a masters degree, I teach yoga and I have been using kratom for back and knee pain for close to 6 years.

The DEA has shown over and over again that its purpose for existing is to strip the entire country of our rights and freedoms and to enslave us all to private prisons and big drug companies. Kratom is a perfect example, here is another harmless plant that has been used for thousands of years but since it potentially harms the profits of large corporations like Merk and Pfizer the DEA is now going to make it illegal. The DEA needs to stop acting like a Clinton and actually care for the people of its own country verses only serving the greedy interests of the pharmaceutical industry.

I was diagnosed with two herniated discs.  In my L4 and L5 respectively.  I attempted to live life normally, and avoid surgery, however the pain worsened and I could not walk by age 29.  An MRI revealed 7mm herniation and I needed surgery.  My primary doctor prescribed pain medications, which I loathed.  They didn't help, and I didn't like the way they made me feel.  A coworker mentioned \"Kratom\".  I never heard of it, and there was relatively no information to be found online.  I had nothing to lose, and I tried it.   \nI have had 2 major surgeries on my back, and I live with constant pain, but Kratom has given me the ability to live my life.  It doesn't take away my pain completely, but it leaves my cognitive and able to do my job and be a father.  Whereas narcotic pain medications do not.   \n\nI truly believe that outlawing or banning Kratom is the wrong direction.  Like anything, it requires moderation.  But considering it is 100% natural, and that it helps SO many people with SO many ailments, it warrants a closer look.  I have witnessed several people better their lives with Kratom, it brings tears to my eyes.  \n\nIn addition to pain, it also helps with anxiety.  Since my father's suicide in 2008, I've had intermittent anxiety in social situations.  Kratom soothes my pain and mind, but leaving me 100% mentally intact.  My life would not be the same if it were not for Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9858","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Wurz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not put Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.\nI know many people who take it safely, it will put their lives in danger if they have to turn to dangerous prescription drugs.\n\nLaura Long","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8000","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"laura long","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I suffer from extreme migraine. For years I had tired beta blockers, imitrex (triptan), aspirin, ibuprofen. While the imitrex would help, whenever I would get multiple migraines a week and take imitrex, I would ALREADY experience withdrawal symptoms. Headache (not a migraine), stomach ache, dizzyness. I found Kratom by chance and gave it a try and have been using it ever since. It will get rid of the migraine and allow me to get on with my life without the worry that I am one more migraine away from a withdrawal. I feel healthier and more confident in my health not being hooked on drugs such as beta blockers. \n\nNow if my personal anecdote does not convince you, let me use a more rational approach. Kratom is a plant in the same family as the legal and widely used coffee plant. It has been tied, loosely, to 15 deaths since 2014. In all of these deaths, Kratom was not the only substance ingested. Kratom has been touted as a much safer solution to opiate addiction, a substance that was responsible for 14,000 direct overdoses in 2014 alone. It seems legal painkillers are far more dangerous then this potentially illegal analgesic. Caffeine is perfectly legal and yet a few people have lost their lives to caffeine. To make kratom illegal would be to send millions of ex-addicts who are now kratom users back to the far more dangerous and addictive opiates. It is not a public health crisis. To make kratom illegal WOULD be the public health crisis. The numbers don't lie.

It's not the doctors fault as our pharmaceutical corporations pushed these drugs on our public.  Where was the DEA?  It's not like there weren't doctors who understood that opiates aren't good for chronic pain.  There is the rebound effect, for one reason.  Another is that after several days use they cause spinal inflammation which causes increased sensitivity to pain.  No the reason is money.  I believe this to be the reason the DEA clings to keeping cannabis Schedule 1 disregarding scientific evidence that proves medical efficacy.  The same goes for Kratom, which has not caused a single death when used without other toxic drugs.  I understand you see the DEA hasn't served it's purpose and that prohibition is a failed policy but what did you expect?  Prohibition is, and has historically been, about racial control and Empire building.  Need evidence?  Just look at the DEA empire and how you're struggling to remain relevant.  It is not the governments right to tell people what they should do with their bodies as long as it does not affect others!  Prohibition does not work!  What does work is EDUCATION!  Therefore I am proposing you make a slight change.  Instead of being the Drug Enforcement Agency how about becoming the Drug Education Agency.  Not only would you actually do good for the People, you would stay relevant long into the future.

I also know a few people who use it to avoid the abuse of prescription pills and illicit substances and it has completely changed their lives for the better as well.\n\nI was really upset when the scheduled intent was announced, but I gained a lot of respect for the DEA after they postponed the intent and allowed for this comment period.

It has done more for me than any doctor or pill has done for me as far as pain relief.  I have gotten many shots in the lumbar and have been prescribed opiates and they only worked short term and had limitations on use.  I feel that everyone has the right to natural pain relief, instead of constant bombardment of pharmaceuticals and other man-altered products for pain relief.  I feel that this is wrong to make Kratom illegal as it does not pose anywhere near the threat that most of your legal pharmaceutical drugs do that are on the market.  In fact, I feel the benefits far out weigh the risks by more of a margin than any pharmaceutical out there.  I think this ahs giving me pain relief and freedom from opiate pills and high medical bills due to lumbar shots.  This is something I think people need to rid themselves of the opiate problem in the country and should be a great ally in that respect.  This has been around for many, many generations all the way back to ancient times.  It has been a blessing for me and my family because I am more active for my children since I am not taking pain pills.  Kratom is the best possible pain relief for me and should be embraced as such among our medical professionals.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6488","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Fuller","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is certainly less dangerous than the opioids it replaces.

Many of these people do not even know what Kratom is and have no idea that if this \"scheduling\" does occur; their future may be drastically affected, and lives potentially even lost.\nI say this because Kratom has not only saved my life by allowing me to stop using the real issues of concern (opiates); but also because Kratom has changed my life for the better in so many other ways! All of these positive outcomes from an all natural, organic, harmless, and very effective leaf should be available for anyone in need! \nI do however believe that there should be regulations set for Kratom just as there are with alcohol. \nAs far as the pharmaceutical companies; I know that they are interested in the different alkaloids present in Kratom, and for at least one good reason.... because they are effective for many different symptoms. They are however plenty effective left alone in there natural state. If anything; altering the alkaloids within these leaves could very well turn them into addictive and deadly substances, bringing even more problems to the youth and the streets. To anyone familiar with Kratom, this is common sense! Which, makes me (and so many other people) wonder WHY?!?!? The only logical explanation being $$$$, which the pharmaceutical companies already receive more of than they deserve! For example; I have a type of a seizure disorder, and was without insurance for a period of time. The medication that I'm required to take on a regular daily basis by law, was costing me $450-$500/month!!!! Obviously I couldn't afford that, but had no choice than to put myself into a hole of debt just to be able to take the medication required.\nIf you (the DEA) are really here to help the people of this nation, than I know you will choose to do the right thing by leaving Kratom alone and accessible to adult citizens of the country.\nAgain, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for listening and learning about the positive changes Kratom has made in so many lives!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9765","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I just feel that much more needs to be known about and at least to have proven negative or adverse effects before it is made illegal.

I have experienced significant pain relief and heightened well being since being introduced to this plant 6 months ago.  It has reduced the amount of prescription medication that I needed to function, as I have both Fibromylagia and chronic anxiety.  \n\nKratom has had the effect of reducing my levels of pain and improving my mood along with reducing my overall sense of anxiety.  I am MORE functional taking a little bit of kratom powder throughout my day than I ever was on high doses of narcotic pain medication. I also have never had any negative side effects from kratom, including feeling high or overly euphoric.  When I miss doses, some of my pain comes back and I do not feel as well as I do when I am on it, but I have not felt any withdraw symptoms even close to the misery I have felt when I have given up caffeine at times related to reducing my coffee intake, even though kratom is technically a plant from the coffee species.\n\nI have several friends and relatives- all over the age of 30- who have used kratom to help reduce their pain, anxiety and depression to great effect.  Everyone I know who has used kratom has been impressed with its superior ability to diminish negative health symptoms while leaving them sober and clear headed.  I myself cannot afford to be intoxicated with my levels of responsibility and therefore, kratom has been a Godsend in my life.\n\nPlease do not ban kratom and allow the public to continue to use this medicinal plant for all the helpful things it is doing.  Most of the people using this plant are adults over the age of 25 and college educated, career professionals and often times are parents or grandparents.  Many kratom users are military veterans as well.  \n\nThey are choosing to use this plant as an alternative to prescription drugs which all come with varying side effects.  Kratom not only helps their health, but without any dangerous side effects. This plant is safer than over the counter Tylenol, which is incredible to me.  Kratom is also successfully helping people get away from heroin addiction and that is a extremely positive benefit that should be promoted and protected by leaving this plant accessible to the public.\n\nThank you,\nDanielle Augustine","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8537","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Danielle Augustine","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Schedule I is too extreme.

This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\nI was introduced to Kratom by a relative who claimed it had anxiety reducing attributes. As a U.S. Army veteran with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder I was immediately interested in this. I would imbibe in alcohol very often to ease my stress and when I discovered Kratom my alcohol usage was decimated. This plant indeed has medicinal value and has done more for me in a natural way than any manufactured drug could have. Kratom has also helped with my sleeplessness and mild depression. Personally I would rather take something natural than chemicals concocted in a laboratory. I have been using kratom for about a year and a half and to hear that it may be banned is a blow to the health of the citizens of the United States as well as myself. I have found that this plant has no negative side effects and does its job to ease my stress. It has given me a breath of fresh air to feel less anxious and look forward to the day again. \n\nKratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. Im asking you to please contact the DEA. Please send a letter or request an oversight hearing asking to delay this emergency action. I fear this action by the DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic and may even send me back to resorting to heavy alcoholism.

I have used Kratom off and on for the past year and a half. I stumbled upon Kratom after experiencing severe withdraw syndromes from Hydrocodone (which i had been prescribed for pain management after reconstructive jaw surgery). I had been taking Hydrocodone every day for 2 months to deal with the terrible pain. After my prescription had ran out, and being unable to obtain another prescription, I considered buying similar pain pills on the black market to combat the persistent pain. At this point I knew i had become addicted. Thankfully I had done some research on some alternative pain management and found out about Kratom. Kratom allowed me to avoid going down the path of buying pills from shady dealers and becoming a full blown pill head. It honestly changed the course of my life. Now you may be thinking that I simply went from being addicted to pills to being addicted to Kratom, and you would be justified in thinking so. But I can, and have gone months without taking Kratom, without experiencing any of the negative withdrawal symptoms that pain pills commonly produce. Kratom is a plant that has been around for thousands of years, similar to marijuana (which I think we both know is only \"illegal\" because of the political and financial motives of corporations and morally corrupt politicians). The whole concept of making a plant, yes a naturally occurring plant, illegal is ludicrous. Speaking from my personal experience and that of my friends who have tried it, this plant does not harm anyone (although studies need to be done to confirm or refure this and making it a schedule one drug will impede any chance of that happening). I have heard that it helps people get off heroin, which is a huge problem in my hometown of Hanover. I know 3 people from my small high school that have died from  heroin in the last year. Your resources would be better served preventing the sale and distribution of heroin. Kratom does not kill people. Marijuana does not kill people and yet it is still a schedule one drug with \"no currently accepted medical use.\" Are you serious? The fact that marijuana remains a schedule one drug, when it clearly does have medicinal value is why I remain suspect of the DEA. Who's interests are you really protecting? Because in the case of marijuana it definitely is not the peoples. Please do not make the same mistake with Kratom. Legal drugs (such as cigarettes and alcohol)  actually kill people. Kratom does not. Can the DEA be reasonable about this? Honestly. Im not trying to be a dick, and it might come off that way, but that is because I am pissed that this \"drug\" may be black listed for some bullshit reason (most likely for nefarious financial and political  gains) while the DEA claims its because it is a \"dangerous drug.\" Lets cut the bullshit.

I am currently employed as a sales manager for a local business.  I began using kratom approximately 3 months ago after hearing about it from various friends online.  I have been diagnosed with endometriosis and suffer from pretty constant abdominal pain, back pain, and an overall lack of energy.  I looked into kratom after being told that I will have to deal with this pain until I have children or go through menopause (I'll reiterate, I'm 29, that is a really long time!).  Now I can make absolutely zero medical claims for anyone else, I can only tell you what kratom has done for me personally.  After using it I have finally found something that provides pain relief without all the mental fog of pain meds.  I'm able to get back to life and go about my daily life without being in a constant fog from a prescription medicine and it has none of the unpleasant side effects such as nausea and constipation which I experienced with the various pain medicines I was prescribed.  Those prescribed meds caused me discomfort and left me feeling uncomfortable even doing small things like driving because I felt inebriated.  With kratom I can take it and I'm 100% myself and I don't feel \"altered\" in any way, shape, or form.  I am simply relieved of the pain and discomfort that I have been living with for over a decade now.  I also don't have to worry that one day I will find myself dependent as so many pain patients do, unable to get by without their doctor prescribed script.  \nI personally disagree with the call to ban kratom as there are far too many possibilities for this plant in daily life that could help so many people.  I also feel that there hasn't been sufficient research done to ban it wholly and call it a done deal.  This plant has been used for a very long time overseas for a variety of things and I feel there is a lack of sufficient evidence of ill effects that would support making it a schedule I substance - on par with crack cocaine, heroin, and meth.  Those are highly dangerous and lethal drugs, kratom is a plant.  Those substances have caused thousands of deaths and injuries and kratom does not have that sort of history.  I feel the DEA should really look into further studies and research before placing a blanket ban on kratom.  Again I cannot speak for anyone else and do not attempt to make any sort of medical claim but I do know that using kratom has given me my life back essentially.  I don't have to either sit on the couch writhing in pain or spend my time doped up on narcotics that dull the pain but leave me completely devoid of the ability to get out and live my life.  I do hope you take my comments and the many others left into consideration prior to coming to a decision on kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8010","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laura Whitley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been able to completely stop using addictive pain medication with the help of this plant.

I am so happy to have them out of my life and can not imagine being shackled to them in the future. I hope this is not the real motive behind this ban. The best thing for the general public is to restrict pharmaceuticals more and let people have access to natural pain relieving substances.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19165","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Barney Barney","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Nature should not be kept illegal!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20235","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lucas Lowe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have personally seem the medical value of this herb, and want the DEA to leave it alone!

I served my country for 8 years and almost lost my life several times during deployment to Iraq. After Iraq I struggled with alcohol issues and it nearly cost me my military career. However it was PTSD that would be my downfall. \nAfter being handed bag after bag full of different prescriptions I saw no way out of the current hell hole I found myself in and attempted to take my own life. After the military it was not much different, struggling with the aftermath of the horrors of war and trying to integrate into society. I found myself turning to painkillers for stomach issues and shoulder pain. They took away the physical torment but also the psychological pain. I quickly developed an addiction and turned to the black market and opium. I progressed to severe daily usage and was just one decision away from putting a needle into my arm to numb the pain.\nI was able to kick my habit with the help of kratom and I have been able to function more easily in society. My home life has never been better and I feel like I'm being the dad my son deserves. I feel mostly whole again and like I can face the world head on.

It is a 24/7 never-ending disease that has no cure.  It is a burning pain that victims describe as equivalent to draining the blood from the affected limb and replacing it with lighter fluid and then setting it on fire.  That only describes the physical side of the pain.  Since other people cannot see what is happening inside him they discount the amount of pain he suffers and some have actually said he is faking pain for some unknown reason.  It is easy to see why it is called the Suicide Disease because he suffers so much physically and has the added pain of being branded as a hypochondriac. He has been deserted by his friends and his wife who saw firsthand the constant and unrelenting effects of his pain and then left him because she couldnt bear to watch his suffering.  As almost always happens with this disease he has been left alone to suffer, and he frequently talks of suicide.\n\nHe sees doctors and specialists from multiple medical disciplines who try to help manage his pain, with only limited effectiveness.  Doctors prescribed many different drugs for him, but most only made him sicker.  The only real relief he gets is from OxyContin, but the prescribed amount barely reduces his pain from a 10 to about a 6 or 7 on a scale of 0 to 10 and the effect of the OxyContin wears off after only an hour or so.  He is allotted 3 per day by the prescription, so he is left with 21 hours of hellish pain out of every 24 hours.  He has no appetite and struggles to eat even a fraction of a plate of food.\n\nSeveral months ago we learned about Kratom and the role it can play in pain management.  After some research we obtained some Kratom powder from a local shop and my son tried a small dose of one teaspoonful.  Within moments he went from having his usual pained expression on his face to playing with the dog, laughing and making jokes.  He ate a plate full of food and asked for a second helping.  The smile on his face and joy he was expressing brought my wife and I to tears as we saw our son experiencing and embracing life as we havent seen him do in the 6 years since he contracted CRPS following a foot injury.  This was not a drug high but a high on life high.\n\nMy son now takes 1 teaspoonful of Kratom 3 times a day and it has been a lifesaver for him, offering many hours of relief.  He is able to go days without the OxyContin just using the Kratom and the change in his life has been remarkable.  To be clear Kratom does not eliminate pain.  It is similar to prescription opioid pain medicine which can only reduce it and hopefully make it bearable, but Kratom has done far more than that.\n\nAs parents we of course have concern for Kratoms safety.  But from what we have read Kratom-related deaths seem to occur only when Kratom is combined with other drugs.  There have been a total of 15 Kratom-related deaths ever recorded vs. 18,893 prescription opioid pain medicine deaths in 2014 alone.  The entire number of Kratom-related deaths on record is approximately 0.08 percent of the number of prescription opioid deaths in 2014 alone.  Put another way that is a ratio of 0.00079 to 1.  10,574 people also died from heroin overdose in 2014.  Adding Heroin deaths to prescription opioid deaths the ratio becomes even more lopsided.\n\nMy sons experience is that Kratom has a built in mechanism to protect against overdosing.  It causes nausea and even vomiting if you take too much.  He has not experienced addiction or withdrawal symptoms when he doesnt take it.\n\nI absolutely want more research on Kratom to unlock its full potential as a pain management tool.  Anyone who suffers from pain should have access to pain relievers that work and dont have the horrible side effects of prescription opioid medicine.  I simply ask that the DEA set a timetable for doing further research on how best to make Kratom available, and in the meantime to not schedule it pending the outcome of the research.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0521","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-19T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Larry George","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear sir or madam, my name is Jennifer Vanella and I am a Young entrepreneur and teacher from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. I don't party, I work with young people for a living so we talk a lot about the importance of staying off drugs for the sake of their bodies and minds. I spend my life trying to help people. However, I have some serious menstrual cycle ovarian cyst issues that caused me a lot of pain and sometimes can  be debilitating. For a long time doctors put me on lots of different medications things that would make me very loopy, and also very sick. I finally got to the point where I was starting to feel like I had an addiction to tramadol. I needed it for every situation. So before things got out of hand, I decided I needed to stop. But that wasn't much of a solution either. Because I was still in excruciating pain. So I started to wander around the Internet, and I came across these incredible people who were from all walks of life, and you were struggling just to be able to get up and go to work in the morning. I thought I was weak. And that I was alone and no one else struggled like I did. But I was wrong. So I started to watch how these amazing people interacted to support each other and... The thing that had started to set their lives right, was simply a tea. At first I didn't buy it, I figured there was some kind of scary catch. But I did more research and I decided to go ahead and order a sample. This was such a game changer! I wasn't in pain but I also didn't think it was a good idea to paint the bathroom bright purple with pink spots anymore. Meaning I had my wits around me. I also started to notice the social anxiety that had started to happen after I had been on the drugs was going away. I wasn't afraid... to go to a concert, or to the supermarket anymore. I was so happy, and I was completely off drugs. I had no idea there was something in the world that could help me like that without sending me on a wild carpet ride. But it existed, it was affordable and it was saving lives. Then one morning at the end of September I saw suddenly folks were saying that it was the scary terrible thing that was destroying lives in killing people. I was shocked! I have been passing along my tea for weeks and weeks! And it was helping my friends and family. I think that's why we decided to start #IamKratom because it was something that was helping us truly be who we were. Every day people who just wanted to not be in pain and make a difference in the world as good people of the United States. Thank you for listening to me. I apologize for this being too long but I felt like you needed to hear a little bit of my story to understand what a difference as a teacher this very gentle plant has made in my life. Please don't send me back to things that make me wonder who I am just to be able to get through the day.  It could've cost me everything if I hadn't been blessed to find this answer when I did. And I'm too young to be giving up and I have way too much work to do to educate and mentor the next generation of adults of the United States of America. Thank you so much for your time and giving us a chance to speak, Kratom really helps make our voices sing.

I am 54 years old and retired after an almost 25 year career as an administrator at the University of California. I first heard about kratom last year in reference to its use as a substance that helps individuals with prescription drug addictions. Being a non-addictive substance with no, or very minimal side effects, it sounded like it held great promise for those individuals. I again heard about kratom recently when the DEA began considering making it a schedule 1 drug. \n\nBecause of this latest information regarding the DEA's possible change to kratom's drug status, I became further interested in kratom and began researching and reading about it.  The more I read and the more I informed myself led me to want to try kratom as a possible remedy for the chronic insomnia I have had for the past 30 years. I have tried bio-feedback, OTC drugs, prescription drugs, meditation, essential oils, and herbal remedies. Absolutely nothing has helped.  My inability to sleep negatively impacted three decades of my life. Until kratom. After several weeks of kratom use, I now feel like I have a new lease on life.  My health and mental status have both improved.  For me, this feels like a miracle. \n\nI am strongly urging the DEA to keep kratom available for use not only for myself, but for those who need it to help them regain control of their lives and help them get off of the prescription drugs. The prescription drug crisis in the United States is a travesty. Kratom is known to help those addicted individuals. It also helps people like me, who are not addicted, but who have other health concerns that significantly affect our lives. \n\nThank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1792","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kathleen MacColl","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"FR Doc# 2016-24659\n\nI am a US Veteran and have served my country for 8 years.

Kratom poses less impairment and health hazards than both alcohol or Tobacco product's, however millions of people benefit from it. People suffering from chronic pain  have a safe alternative to very addictive and damaging prescription medication, which impairs a persons ability to function and be a productive member of society. Kratom allows these people to hold down a job, and fulfill their sense of worth and career. Kratom also is important to the veteran community who struggle with PTSD and other service related issues. Most importantly having had a family member fall victim to heroin addiction, it offers addicts a way out, and a way to stay off such a horrible addiction. In a world where 100's of people a day just in one city area are being administered narcan for overdose, it would be a crime to take a way a safer alternative, that by taking it away would most assuredly cause an increase in relapse, over dose from stronger oppiates, and forcing people to take prescription medication,  they do not want to be on, do to the hobbling effects they have.  \n\nWhile I can agree with age limits and ID needed to purchase Kratom, I 100% stand against an outright ban. I think it's over reaching, wrong and immoral to ban this. This plant does not pose any of the health risks that even schedule V items do, and scheduling or any other form of banning is not right or just. Please take the time to consider these comments and proceed with an avenue that does not restrict Kratom to people who need it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17426","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Herbert Holding","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FORGIVE MY SELF IF I DIDN'T SEND THIS COMMENT TO YOU.

I have suffered all sorts of physical pain in my life, but none of it compares to the misery of depression.  \n\nI researched and found a plant called kratom that many folks said was an effective anti-depressant, so I figured I had nothing to lose.  Much to my amazement and gratitude, it has been very useful as a \"breakthrough\" treatment for my most depressed days.  It does not make me \"high\"; it just makes me feel like continuing to live!  I would definitely prefer to stay on this all-natural plant for my remaining years rather than increasing my dose of fluoextine or seeking out a secondary psychiatric medicine.\n\nI have taken kratom for 2 years and have had no ill effects from it.  In fact, as a bonus, it has also miraculously cleared up my 10-year struggle with irritable bowel syndrome!  Finally, I feel like I can live a life again.  \n\nI implore you with my whole heart and being to keep kratom safe and legal for responsible adults like me.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I am a 32 year old female, I suffer from treatment resistant depression for which I use Kratom (mitragyna speciosa).  I also have nerve damage in my face (Bells Palsy) and arthritis as lingering damage from Lyme disease 10 years ago.  For these medical conditions, I also use Kratom and other herbal supplements like turmeric to help with inflammation.  I was once prescribed tramadol for these ailments but I found that with regular use, tramadol quickly loses its effectiveness.  I then tried Kratom, in powdered form, added to a juice drink or brewed as tea.  I found I could perform better at work, no longer requiring tramadol (and its ever increasing dosage), and that my pain and inflammation only improved over time.  Kratom is very important to someone like myself, to  whom traditional antidepressants are counter-active.  That is to say, prescription antidepressants make my depression worse.  Doctors have been unsuccessful in treating my depression since I was diagnosed with clinical depression at 12 years old.  \nI would like to add that I use Kratom responsibly; have never once had a negative experience, and I am an informed consumer meaning that I do my research when deciding on a product vendor.  I also see my family doctor at regular 4-6 months intervals, and receive regular blood work annually to be sure I am not suffering any ill effects from the Kratom or other health supplements.  So far, 5 years of Kratom use and being conscientious of my lifestyle, I feel better than I have in 10 years.  Thank you for reconsidering the scheduling of Kratom, and I hope you carefully weigh what is at stake.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16342","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Adamson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has help me in so many ways with my pain, and anxiety, so plz keep it legal thank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15240","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Goldie Ward","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please consider our pleas kratom has saved my life I broke my back about seven years ago and couldn't find a single avenue of relief but with kratom  I am experiencing a greater quality of life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12068","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jesse Wiley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is the only thing ever that stopped a 15 year alcoholic  bender.

I first heard about the herbal supplement around 5 years ago through a friend who had read a blog on the internet about the benefits of using kratom to help maintain focus and energy in the professional world.  This intrigued me, so I decided to do some heavy research, as I am not one to blindly ingest something simply based on a friend's good review.  After much consideration, I decided I would try kratom, responsibly, and see how it worked for me.  The benefits were obvious and plentiful.  After using kratom (much like one would use a multi-vitamin) I found myself much more alert and effective.  But this was only an added benefit to the real magic of kratom.  Before using kratom, I was battling severe depression caused by an intense addiction to alcohol.  Alcoholism has taken the lives of many family members, and I felt consumed by it.  Kratom became an extremely valuable tool in helping me quit drinking.  In part, I owe my life to the supplement.  It was something I could use to help move myself away from a dangerous lifestyle, while not being addictive, itself.  I have seen the wonders kratom can do first hand, and it would be a shame if others were prevented from experiencing it for themselves.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19131","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jacobsen Thurman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W\nKratom is a natural herb used responsibly by a 3-5 million persons in this country, including myself. I urgently and respectfully ask you to keep it legal. Kratom allows me: horribly shy, unfocused, depressed and tired me, an enjoyable, productive life. I'm middle aged and have a master's degree, but, because of my problems, have only held low-paying jobs. I've lost out on potential relationships because of debilitating social anxiety, and I used to drink a lot to try and deal with it. I was ecstatic when I found kratom after a desperate online search seeking help to get myself off of opiods (after no help from my healthcare provider! I had taken them as directed, but became physically addicted anyway), which works for me and yet does not hurt me. I even am considering getting a second job because kratom gives me energy and gumption. Great because I need the income! I now have a clean house, hobbies and the energy to raise my children. I also have terrible PTSD due to extreme abuse (I see a psychiatrist) and chronic back pain. When it was proposed to ban kratom, I was so scared because I don't want to lose my life the way I am able to live it now. I'm doing really well. And kratom doesn't impair or intoxicate me. Why ban something that doesn't destroy lives, doesn't kill, does not cause people to steal or become violent, like the meth that my ex was on when he tried to kill me. It gets people off of dangerous, addictive drugs. It doesn't turn you into a different person. It doesn't cause you to lose jobs or families. It's a tree leaf that actually kills pain (really! Thank God) and gives energy. I don't understand why it'd be scheduled. I'm still me, only more productive and able to talk to people without my heart racing and I can do housework without having screaming back pain. Please let me and millions of others keep kratom. I really am enjoying the lack of pain, the energy and the ability to concentrate and focus. I'm doing better for my family now, and myself, and I make better lifestyle choices.

For the DEA to Schedule I another plant  so harmless as Kratom and  which is helping the quality of life for those who take it with no ill effects, is something I feel would be a mistake in the end.

I hobbled around till I started taking kratom it don't  work like a med would but  I'd rather have a little pain still and be able to function correctly.

I am a recovering addict, and this little plant has given me my life back. I am a registered nurse where opiate dependency is a dangerous affliction to have. I have been sober for 2.5 years and have a successful career as assistant Director of Nursing. A position I could have never held without Kratom. My life as a nurse, a daughter, a mom, and friend has become full and enriched since becoming clean. I take some of this in the morning and at night. I don't feel anything with this plant. Why do I take it then? \n\nI take this to not feel any urges or cravings where it only takes one mistake to be brought back into the abyss of addiction. I have no more fear and torement. I live in a state where pot is now legal for recreation and I have no need to use this as well. I haven't smoked pot for over 10 years while this has been legal for 2 of these.\n\nWhat fear I do have is what will happen Kratom becomes illegal even for medical research. This would destroy me and my family and career. I don't understand why this is even an issue. Medically trained and being in my profession for 15 years, i could not comprehend why Pot is legal but Kratom will be banned. \n\nBefore making any decisions, please consider what negative effects will happen to thousands of people.\n\nShyla Johnson RN, BSN, CCRN-CSC","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4653","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shyla Johnson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for your time.

I am gainfully employed, pay my taxes, vote every election, attend church, give back to my community, and have never had so much as a speeding ticket. I am health conscious and try to follow a homeopathic lifestyle. I avoid alcohol and have chosen a dry lifestyle. I partner with my physician to lead the most healthy and natural life I can. Regardless of this type of lifestyle choice, I developed cervical cancer in 2006. I was pregnant with our second child at the time so treatment was postponed until after she was born. Unfortunately, treatment led to complications and I developed severe endometriosis. Due to the severity of the endometriosis, I faced a total hysterectomy and years of pain due to the necessary hormones and ever present endometriosis cells, which had invaded most of my stomach, chest, and spine. One necessary medicine to maintain health was causing crippling and debilitating pain. I worked with my oncologist on natural approaches, if at all possible, and that is when I heard about kratom. I did research into kratom, reading all I could on the history of use, any possible side effects, and benefits associated with this plant. I found multiple Internet sites that had vetted vendors over the course of several years, vendors who test all their products prior to selling, and I chose from that list of vendors. That was 9 years ago. Kratom became part of my daily health regimen. I take kratom with my vitamins each morning. I have had great success with using it as it has helped me deal with the pain associated with the endometriosis cells interacting with my required HRT. It also helped with my early menopause symptoms. I have semi-annual blood tests along with other testing my physician feels are necessary, and my levels have always been excellent. Both my physician and I are so grateful for kratom and the benefit it has brought to my life. I would be very upset if kratom should become no longer available to me. I have never obtained any \"high\" of any kind. If that was something I was interested in I would have agreed to the multitude of heavy narcotics my oncologist offered me for my condition. It is actually quite opposite. I prefer to be clear headed and ever present. I oppose the scheduling of kratom in any way. I would not be opposed to age restriction.

I struggled for over a decade with conventional treatments without success, even resorting to the zombifying methadone and suboxone. Even the existing maintenance treatments for opiate addiction leave the addict tethered to the drugs with the lifestyle and behaviors of someone in active addiction. These drugs are so powerful and bind so strongly to the opiate receptors that than can intensify an addiction to extremes well past heroin or oxycodone. Kratom however, is not a drug, and it's binding affinity is not very strong allowing addicts to satisfy the drive for opiates without the devastating effects. I have used kratom daily for 5 years and have yet to commit a crime to get it or even consider it, I very rarely experience negative effects other than a moderate depression that I am predisposed to and an elevation in blood pressure. I have no doubt that this ban would only add to the problems that it seeks to resolve. It will push addicts back to hard drugs and back into a criminal lifestyle and force those seeking homeopathic pain management to rely on very intense narcotics. I would like to believe this idea is driven by the best interest of the public and not by politics and lobbyist.

Our nation is in crisis with legal rx opiates being handed out in elephant strength for unnecessary reasons like a toothache. I have buried too many clients and friends to name herein  from overdose and alcohol abuse. I learned about kratom in 2011 from a kava bar where I sought a safe relaxing alternative to alcohol as being a trial lawyer I need mental clarity and no hangover to be at my best the next day at work in court. Kratom tea did not nor has it ever altered my mind. It helped me lessen my stress caused anxiety and shortly after finiding it a lady plowed into my vehicle while running a red Light. Doctors recommended vertebrae replacement.  I have 2 bad ones in my neck and one in my lower back. I refused to get surgery nor to take the rx opiates for life and I refused to become labeled \"disabled\". I used kratom, kava, chiropractic adjustments, acupuncture and massage plus turmeric and I kept my functionality and I manage my pain as my discs are irreparable without replacement.  I reviewed  11 medical experts signed letter to congress, along with a report from a nationally court recognized expert who quantified kratom toxicity in NC, and a report opinion from Dr McCurdy of the U of Mississippi who studied kratom along with the National Institute of Health and none of tbose documents said kratom was unsafe. In fact, all of those document stated that kratom was helpful and caused zero impact to public health and safety. I also saw a report from the Broward County, Florida, medical examiner and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement which conducted investigations nationwide on kratom at the request of law makers which also found zero impact on public health nor safety. Currently, in one county alone - Palm Beach County, Florida, where I have practiced law since 97- there are 13 opiate overdoses per day for opiate addicts   In Orange County, NC, in just one town - Carrboro - the local police department and emergency services have reported 1 opiate overdose per day average for much of this year. Banning kratom and or making it difficult or expensive to obtain more than it already is will cause those numbers of overdoses to exponentially increase and many will die. The medical examiner reports nationwide claiming kratom involved deaths have failed to prove one single death from kratom toxicity. Not one medical examiner nor toxicologist submitting these cases of kratom related deaths has quantified the amount of kratom which killed that person.  Why is it that in Asia-  Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, for centuries of consumption, there are zero problems of deaths or injury with kratom?  America can't be the only country with this problem when worldwide kratom tea is consumed. Please leave this tea alone. The number of opiate deaths and levels of alcohol related deaths are horrible now as it is. And please do something about OxyContin and fentanyl and the doctors who dole it out for years with no plan of weaning nor real pain management that has created this crisis. I have met many who remain functional with work and tax paying because they manage their pain or illnesses with the help of kratom and those people include police officers and firemen, medical professionals and drivers who must keep mental clarity which opiates wouidncause them to be disabled and unable to work.

I have used this plant recreationally and have experienced nothing but healthy effects for my mental and emotional well being. I can best describe the benefits as having a cup of coffee, but more positive: sharper concentration, a relief of anxiety, and a slight elevation of mood. I feel that anyone can try this plant without suffering damage to their mind. In my opinion, this substance has no addictive properties. \n\nI am worried that your organization is striving to categorize this plant as \"very dangerous\" without any scientific research to support the decision. I feel that significant research is needed to discover the ways that this natural plant can impact people before risking ruining the lives of Americans through drug penalties and jail time. It would in my opinion be a travesty and a tragic blow to democracy to forbid access to a plant that thousands have reported produces effects no less dangerous than a beverage stimulant, and that has reportedly helped many suffering from opiate addiction, arthritis, PTSD and other devastating health concerns. \n\nPlease take the time to re-consider your effort to federally ban this drug.

The feds should stay out of it.  And we certainly don't need the DEA/fed govt. screwing up peoples' lives the same way they have over marijuana.  How much money will be wasted by DEA enforcement being orders of magnitude more harmful than the drug?  How much money will be wasted decriminalizing kratom in four or five decades?\n\nKratom has been around at least 10 times as long as the United States.  If kratom was sooooo dangerous the federal govt had to get involved, where's the body of work showing all the lives destroyed by kratom?  There's no history of news stories about kratom-fueled criminals rampaging thru neighborhoods.  \n\nEvidence strongly suggests the DEA isn't concerned about kratom for reasons of greater public good.

I am a proud graduate from Texas A&M University. Like many in college I often drank alcohol on the weekends. I ended up letting the alcohol take over my life. My grades were bad and I was depressed. Every time I try to quit I would become more depressed and had to drink every night just to get by. I was introduced to Kratom by a friend who used it as an alternative to Coffee in the mornings.\n\nI noticed that in the evenings I could substitute the Kratom for alcohol and no depression. The Kratom does not seem to have the same negative effects on the body that alcohol does so I much prefer it as an alternative. I am able to quit using it without any withdrawals symptoms so it doesn't seem to be addictive.\n\nThis is a wonderful plant with many positive medicinal properties and seemingly few negatives. \n\nI urge you.

Kratom is not a drug it comes from a tree in the caffeine group and when used correctly is a safe natural alternative for everything I mentioned above. Big pharmaceutical companies are responsible for the prescription drug problem in this country. Keep this miracle substance available for the people.  How many people have to die from prescription drug over doses before you OUR elected official understand the positive safe alternative that is all natural. Keep it available for the people who need it to combat medical issues that without kratom they would have to take prescription medication.

I first used kratom 8 years ago, and I have used it occasionally since then. I suffer from ADHD, and I have found kratom to help improve focus and concentration. Additionally, kratom is very helpful for me in overcoming ADHD-related insomnia. Kratom has no harmful side effects and should definitely remain unscheduled. I know other Montanans who use kratom to relieve chronic pain. Kratom has been very helpful for myself and for others and it makes no sense to put this plant on the list of scheduled substances. Additionally, kratom has a safety record that is very similar to other legal herbal supplements such as St. John's wort, valerian root or echinacea. I have read through the initial notice of intent to schedule from the DEA and found the evidence being used to be insubstatantial and misleading. I hope that you will take my comments into consideration and not allow kratom to be scheduled.

I heard about the plant, Kratom, while searching for a natural alternative to opiates. I began taking Kratom and almost immediately it was like a fog was lifted.

I hate the feeling I get off these medications. It helps without any \"high\" (if that's what you want to even call it). Its Natural, and its more like coffee that can either feel like a really clean coffee without jitters and anxiety and in higher doses its like an relaxing tea  it doesn't feel opiate like, but it does effect just enough areas in the brain to stop opiate withdrawal without being like these highly altered opiate chemicals like Methadone or Suboxone and I'm starting to wounder if coffee, cheese (cheese also effects opiate receptors) and alcohol (also effects an opiate receptor) are next. \n\nThis is not a drug that you use to get high on... This is less then alcohol and the only reason I could think of this being made illegal is to keep people hooked on prescription opiates, Herion, Methadone or Suboxone. Three of these being legal and even if it is even a little bad for you there is no way its as bad for you as the four I've listed and honestly do you really think people on herio. really care about whay s good or bad for you? This is also why Thailand illegalized it in 1943(they have admited it, legalized it by prescription and are considering legalizing it because of they're growing opioid problem) Opium was legal and it helped people get off opium. This almost seems like the case now. The way the media is handling this, is like reefer madness part 2 its filled with lies and propaganda, and I wouldn't be suprised if people claiming its killing people are doing so because they need something to blame. 0 Deaths have been as a result of just Kratom use because its impossible to overdose on, the 14 of those have been debunked and shown to have had other drugs in they're system, and with the 1 death unaccounted for was probably done so with another some other drug that isn't being tested for like phenibut(you can find a lot of drugs online that can kill you and their being no way to test for them). It also has been proven to not cause respiratory depression (how opiates kill you) and you're body throws out what it doesn't want. \n\nRight now people are getting kicked off pain pills with addictions and horrifying at an alarming rate and without Kratom they're forced to buy pills on the street or Heroin(or they start with buying pain pills and end up on Heroin because its cheaper). This has helped friends of mine quit drugs like these, people in need of pain management, and also people in recovery that do not want to use opiates for pain or stay off opiates in general. Currently in the opiate world we have headlines like: \"78 deaths in 2 days\" because of a bad Heroin batch(my moms Ex was caught in that and died) \"28 deaths in 4 hours\" \"Fentanyl Overdose Deaths In Ohio At An All-Time High As Midwest States On Alert Over Opioid ODs\" and \"Heroin Laced With Elephant Tranquilizer Linked to 8 Overdose\". And this plant is really what we're worried about? Really? I think you guys really need to look at are drug laws, our prisoners, and the od count and really ask ourselves if this is working. The Drug war needs to end, and when you're banning plants keeping people of drugs, you really need to revaluate this epidemic.

It's been such a benefit to my health that it's hard to put it into words on a written forum. \nI have been suffering from a slip disc in my lower back for about 20 years and was diagnosed with depression at almost the same time frame. The medicine prescribed for depression (zoloft, effexor, and then back to zoloft) had terrible side effects that were not in agreement with me. I suffered from \"brain zaps\" and still couldn't regulate my depressive episodes so the medicine I was prescribed was barely a band aid. I took a muscle relaxer and tramadol (for pain) to help with the back problems. I didn't care a lot for the jittery nature of tramadol, so I took it only sparingly. \nA few years back, a friend told me to try kratom for my pain. He said I could take it more regularly and it wouldn't produce the side effects that I was having on my regular medication. I started taking it a few times a week and it really helped with pain management and the best thing is, I could work and function on it with no worries of being \"high\". It also seemed to help with my depression as I could elevate my mood when I was in a \"down period\", again, without it giving me any sort of recognizable \"high\". \nKratom is a valuable part of my life and my stabilized mood and pain reduction has been a benefit for my family as well. My kids get \"Dad\" more and I'm able to function without the side effects of regular pharmaceuticals. In short, I'd like to request that kratom be studied and perhaps having more people see that this is not a monster \"drug\" like heroin, will lead to more folks seeing benefits from it. A lot of us out here just don't work well with processed medication and all natural kratom has been been a blessing to our lives. I respectfully ask that kratom not be banned and that there will be sympathetic and level headed approach to regulating it for future use. Thanks for your time.

The negative stigma and misinformation of the medicinal values of the Kratom supplement have wounded the thousands of Americans that suffer from severe opiod addictions and the ability to contribute to our society and economy. The DEA's Schedule 1 prohibition of this plant substance is misguided and infringement on the civil rights of tens of millions of Americans. Considering that the side effects of this substance are realistically non-intoxicating, and simply provide people who suffer from chronic pain and opioid withdrawal relief, the nature of the DEA's desire to ban this substance does not reflect the regard for the citizens of the nation that the bureau should serve  The nature of these occurrences of opiod addiction occur from patients who simply followed their doctor's prescription orders for their pain management. Kratom tea has benefited my life tremendously in the quality of my work, productivity, pain management, motivation, and exercise of my routine. There are states like Oklahoma that have already made decisions on the manner they govern the Kratom plant, such as requiring anyone in possession and sale must be over eighteen years old adults. Public support has clearly shown you that adults, within their own state jurisdictions, should be free to individually use and control the Kratom plant as the market for it sees fit, and not be penalized and incarcerated for the use of such a beneficial all natural substance.\nI urge the DEA to suspend all efforts to criminalize the Kratom plant and it's chemical constituents. The states, some already doing so, should decide on their own sensible approach to the regulation of this plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20123","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think Kratom should s?t?ay legal.\n \nI oppose any law that prohibits responsible adults from being able to ?freely ?buy or take Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22064","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Scott Allen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom saved my life.

I admit that I, myself, have only just recently been investigating the possible positive effects that Kratom may provide for those who are pursuing it's healing effects and I feel that before a wise decision can be passed pertaining to a plant that has promising healing properties, more unbiased research should be conducted. I am strongly imploring the DEA to reconsider this decision and show wise council by their actions of withholding the ban until enough reliable statistics can confirm that this plant truly does or does not pose highly dangerous risks to the american public. Based on what little I have researched so far, it is my opinion that this plant is being villified unfairly and the reasons behind this seem nefarious and quite possibly based on greed and the special interests of big Pharma to protect their own profit interests that Kratom threatens. I challenge the DEA to show adequate, unbiased, lab tested data to present to the american public that shows the harmful effects that Kratom supposedly is accused of by groups such as NARCONON, which is backed by Scientology. The connection between NARCONON and Scientology should be suspect enough to indicate where their special interests lie and why they would be keen on supporting a ban on Kratom. I would like to state that I do not take Kratom nor have I ever used the plant in any way, shape or form for any medicinal or recreational purpose. I am just an average american tax paying male wanting to voice my opinion to help sway the DEA from making a bad decision. Among some of my reasonings are to support the rights of those individuals who wish not to be branded as criminals or suffer consequences of having to use this plant illegally because they are seeking relief from a plant that already has been providing them that relief with no ill side effects as opposed to the legal drug alternatives that do have dire side effects. I appeal to the common sense and sensiblities of the decision makers at the DEA to reconsider this ban and before allowing this decision to proceed, at least, allow research to prove its benefits to society and not be branded as this dangerous, harmful plant. Please allow a fair trial before rendering a harmful verdict that will affect millions of suffering lives that rely on this plant for relief from their pain. I pray you don't have family or loved ones that have found Kratom as an answer to their suffering only to be placed in a precarious dilemma with the possibility of that relief being classified as illegal and now they will have to go back to struggling to cope without the benefits of Kratom and it's alkoloids that provide that relief. Thank you for considering this plea and may you be guided properly in your decision making concerning the scheduling of these properties that make up this plant we refer to as Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15534","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Victoria and I am an advocate for Kratom. I'm 27 years old and work in web design and marketing. I can honestly say I use kratom only occasionally as a natural alternative to Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen, both over the counter drugs with reputations that make some of us very reluctant to ingest. We know both can cause liver damage, leaky gut, ulcers and blood issues and Acetaminophen alone is responsible for over 100,000 over doses a year. Kratom is a safe replacement (more people have died from soda machines falling on them) for pain killers and for some even coffee. I simply use Kratom for headaches and menstrual pain because it works better than any other option.\n\nI am a hopeful citizen that likes to believe we still have people in government that represent and respect the general public and this is the perfect time to prove that. Is there really even an argument against something that has so many benefits for our citizens who are in pain or suffering?

Making kratom illegal will not make people use drugs less, they will just turn to the illegal market to get drugs if they want them badly enough. With kratom made illegal it will raise the street value of other drugs that offer similar or stronger effects. Making drugs illegal only puts more power into the hands of gangs who have a supply of drugs. Keeping kratom legal will decrease the demand for other more potent and dangerous drugs.\nA good example of why making drugs illegal doesnt work is with lsd. With lsd harder to get people started creating other drugs with similar effects such as the NBOME series of chemicals. Many of these new drugs are almost completely untested before being placed on the market. People die because of a lack of correct dosing information. They think they're taking lsd, but infact are taking a substance that has much less room for error with overdosing. While lsd is almost impossible to OD on, many of the NBOME compounds can present serious health risks with as little as 2x the common dose. If people want certain kinds of drugs they will either find them through illegal means or people will attempt to create a replacement, which can result in a more dangerous drug being put on the streets.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22332","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zach Binkley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":" As a scientific professional with years of education in biochemistry, physiology, chemistry,  I find the  attempt to ban this plant reprehensible.

I know many people who have used it to overcome hard opiate addiction, and I am afraid for what might happen to those individuals if they were no longer able to access this helpful plant. Opiate addiction relapse happens at very high rates without replacement therapy, and kratom, for some, can be as effective as much more potent alternatives like suboxone and methadone. For many, the latter options are not options at all. Such individuals would sooner just go back to heroin or whatever hard opiate of choice. It is my belief that some people are just wired to be opiate addicts, and it seems as though kratom provides a much milder alternative than any pharmaceutical or street narcotics available. \n\nMany people who have used kratom for extended periods of time report minimal withdraw symptoms, similar to those from caffeine. It seems illogical to ban kratom while not banning similar drugs like coffee. I mean, where are we heading with this policy, I thought our country collectively doesn't believe in draconian rules such as those we would expect to find under sharia law. The way I see it, if you're going to ban kratom, might as well ban alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and while you're at it, let's require women to cover their faces in public and always be accompanied by a male relative when outside of the home. \n\nFurthermore, this all seems very suspicious, given pharmaceutical companies are beginning to examine the benefits of the active ingredients of kratom.

Although kratom is NOT an opiod, it has curbed my addictive habits by keeping me calm and level headed through stressful or intense times. \n\nI do not know what I would do if Kratom was no longer an option for treatment. I suppose I would need to go back to the maze of doctors and psychiatrists and through the course of many months and treatment sessions attempt to find a successful cocktail of medications to achieve what kratom does alone. It would be unpleasant to say the least. Sleepless nights, anxious days and chronic pain would be absolutely guaranteed while finding a suitable mental and physical health treatment would not. \n\nI am a college graduate and young professional working in the real estate profession.

I 100% oppose the DEA's attempt to place Kratom on the list of Schedule 1 substances for several reasons.\n\nFor one, this is a 100% natural product.  It's the dried leaves of a plant, ground up into a powder and either ingested that way, or placed in a capsule.  That's it.  The medicinal benefits Kratom users claim range from helping with anxiety to depression to aiding with drug addiction to pain relief, and more.  In a time when the opioid crisis is at an all time high, with thousands dying each year from overdose and/or complications with opiates, it would be ethically and morally irresponsible to place this drug on a scheduling so restrictive that it realistically halt research on the plant.  People are fed up with pharmaceutical's and need and should be allowed to medicate themselves with holistic methods.  Additionally, it would be financially irresponsible to make kratom a schedule 1 drug as well.  Health care is not something everyone can afford, and if this natural substance can provide medicinal benefits to people that would otherwise require costly and limited doctor's visits and extremely expensive prescription medication's, the DEA needs to do it's due diligence in order to make sure this plant is really such a danger to the public before placing it on a list so restrictive that it will again, virtually prevent research to be realistically performed on this plant.    \n\nAfter looking at the claim that kratom has been involved in 15 deaths in the last 6+ years, 14 of which involved other substances, I am not sure how that substantiates being a danger to the public.  I myself started using kratom about 2 years ago via the recommendation of a friend after talking about my anxiety and dislike for prescriptions such as Ativan and Xanex, and the effects of the plant a subtle, and I don't find it addicting at all.  There was probably a period of a month where I put the powders in a smoothie almost every day, and I experienced no withdrawals after I stopped talking it.  And the plant did help lower my levels of anxiety, and didn't make me fall asleep like prescription medications or cause memory loss, or dependence like prescription medications did.  \n\nAnything that's ingested by humans should be regulated, but I truly don't believe this plant should be banned and from the research I have done, the information does not support banning this plant on the basis it's a danger to the public.  Banning it would be a danger to the public for the people who use this plant to provide relief from various conditions they have not been able to find relief for otherwise.

I had just lost 90 pounds, and was working out 6 times a week and planning on competing in fitness competitions. then, I got sick, very sick. (insert long story here) and after I slowly recovered. I was left with devestating health issues and with 4 babies and a husband to take care of, and no ability to do so. I have been diagnosed multiple times, with multiple doctors with, Fibromyalgia, OsteoArthritis, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, IBS, Anxiety, Depression, and other assorted health problems. I was offered and prescribed pain medication, pills for depression, and anxiety. After trying these for a few months, and feeling like a drugged up zombie, still dealing wth pain, I threw it all away and determined to try and deal with my health issues, on my own, with no pharmaceutical help. I hung tight for 4 years and tried to live as healthy a life as I could, as my health slowly deteriorated more and more. I turned to alcohol and drank way too much, trying to drown out the pain and guilt I was feeling. Guilt that I couldn't raise my kids the way I had planned. Couldn't run and play with them, couldn't cook dinner, couldn't even smile or read to them most of the time. Finally, at the point of suicide, I saw a doctor and asked what options I had. But I made it clear that i did not want any opiates. I was so scared of adding addiction, onto my list of problems. Addiction runs in my family. He suggested Cymbalta, and assured me that it was wasn't habit forming and they have had great success with treating pain and depression with it. I had to try something, so I took it. The first two weeks, I didn't sleep at all, and after that, besides some other terrible side effects, the pain started to become, less and less sharp and horrible. and felt like white noise instead. For the next year, I kept taking the prescribed drug and lost all emotion and all will to do anything and lost any feeling at all. While my pain was gone, I was a walking zombie. I didn't care about my kids, didn't care about my husband, didn't care about my values or morals and my life spiraled even lower. After a devastating family emergency, realizing that I couldn't even feel sad or cry or anything, I weaned myself off of that poison ( a horrible and prolonged process) and started looking for health and life again. My dear husband who stuck by me through all of this, and was always researching and looking for ways to help me, found Kratom! The first day that I tried it, I knew that my life was going to get better. And almost instantly, I was able to get off the couch and out of bed and out the door, and start to Live again! Krater has literally given my children back their mommy and my husband back his wife. I still have bad days of course, But with Kratom, I have more (or any) energy, I am able to talk to people, go to my kids games and swim meets. Participate in school activities. Go grocery shopping. Teach my kids how to drive. Take a shower. Take a walk. Go to church. Have coffee with friends. Go out to dinner with my husband. All these things that everyone takes for granted, are things that I could not do, before I found Kratom. Kratom brought light to my life that had been dark for so long. Kratom gave me hope. This ban would take that all away again. Please dont ban this amazing plant that bring relief and hope to so many people. Banning kratom, would be like banning coffee.

I was in a car accident in 2002 and for 8 years (until 2010) had been prescribed and on pain management (with a narcotics contract) including but not limited to: 240 count 10/500 hydrocodone/acetaminophen, 150 count 15mg oxycodone and 240 tramadol (50mg) per month. I can say that I did abuse the substances, however, without them I could not function (every rib broken, spinal damage and 3 crushed or cracked vertebrae). I asked my doctor to take me off in 2010 because of family concerns and became suicidal. a friend told me about Kratom and I tried it to help with opiate withdrawls; it is the only thing that seemed to make my cravings for narcotics completely disappear. it also helped with my anxiety and depression and helped my to be an EXTREMELY productive member of our society. Many people I know and care about have used it for the same issues and many of them I feel in my heart would not be alive today if it weren't for Kratom (individuals with very high risk of overdoses of controlled substances legal and otherwise) AND alcoholics who are at least 2 years sober thanks to this HERBAL substance. Please do not take away something that is utterly harmless and put all of these people at risk again. \n\nI also wanted to point out: IT IS IN THE COFFEE FAMILY!!! More people have heart attacks and strokes or overdoses due to caffeine in months than any reported cases of Kratom emergencies or complications total since it has been introduced in America, and Bill Clinton planted them on the White House lawn!\nI believe that something [veterans use to control PTSD] and many, many people depend (not addictive depend, but using to control pain, emotion, and many other issues NATURALLY) should not have implemented against it laws reserved for TRULY HARMFUL SUBSTANCES. Much of the American population believe that this is coming from and due to bureaucracy from the pharmaceutical industries liens on the government so that they don't loose money pushing truly harmful drugs (legal as they may be) onto citizens impeding their abilities to function and addicting them to unnecessary substances.

In 1999 I was diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn's disease at the age of 22. For the next eight years I had spent on average about 10 weeks a year in the hospital with Crohn's disease flareups. I have been on a number of different medications including Remicade, Imuran, Asacol not to mention a number of antibiotics and steroids. I can't tell you how many times I've had a tube down my throat and have been fed intravenously. In 2008 I had a surgery that removes 11 inches of my intestines. The doctors informed me that this would alleviate symptoms for a while but I will always have this disease and I'll have to manage it with medication. \nIf you know someone with moderate to severe Crohn's disease you will be aware of how difficult it is to manage the disease. It is painful, uncomfortable, chronic and it leads to depression and a host of other debilitating symptoms. I discovered Kratom and 2007. At this point I have been on and off painkillers for almost a decade. After taking Kratom for a week my symptoms changed dramatically. I was now going to the bathroom two to three times a day versus 7 to 9 times a day. My energy levels were much higher. For the first time ever I felt like I was in control of this disease. I am no longer on any maintenance drugs. For the first time in seven years I went and spoke with a Gastroenterologist about my Crohn's disease. After reading my file they were very adamant about me starting Humara. If you read the many side effects, there is increase in the chance for Lymphoma. My father died of the Lymphoma. My mother died of cancer also. As you can imagine I'm in no rush to start this drug. I explain to my doctor about my Kratom regiment and they said if it works keep it up. \nPlease don't take this option away from me.

I stumbled upon this by accident. I was on a quest to help my then detoxing sister find some relief besides benedryl while dealing with her opiate detox. Almost 7 years ago I myself was addicted to opiates and know how painful withdrawl is. I found a website offering a sample if I paid shipping and handling. With the risk of addiction being smaller I decided to offer my sister this instead of  getting a prescription for Suboxone. I got the sample and gave it a try before I let her have it. I suffer from fibromyalgia and chronic lyme disease. before kratom I would sleep all day be in miserable pain when I was awake and be so drained and miserable I couldn't bear the thought of another day. After trying the sample about 3 grams I noticed I wasn't in pain and I felt good. HECK I felt NORMAL! I had forgotten what normal was but this feeling was it! I then began taking kratom myself on the days that I would normally cry and tell myself I can't do this I am just going to go and get pain killers maybe I won't get addicted this time on those days I have Kratom. AND MY KIDS HAVE THEIR MOM! When I go without kratom I don't experience withdrawal or pain from being without it. This herb is unlike anything I have experienced. It's a god send. And I am sure you are wondering how my sister is doing. She is sober. she no longer takes kratom  and has been sober for over 6 months. If she had taken suboxone she would still be using it. Using kratom along with my other prescribed medications like nerve blockers and such has helped me to lead a more normal life again. I think this herb has a lot of research potential and shouldn't be discarded so easily. I don't agree with minors using this product  or with it being sold in smoke shops. I think it should be treated the same way other botanicals are treated. As potent herbs that should be taken in a proper way.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6410","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tiana Larson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"How can you justify taking away a natural plant that can help people get through the day without depending on a man made substance,  I use kratom to help alleviate pain caused from a life long illness, degenerative bone deterioration in my hips,  at times the pain is so bad I can't walk,.\nWhen I was 5 the doctors said it was growing pains, when I was 16 they said it was arthritis and put me on 800 milligram motrin, and for 20 years the helped to get me by, but in my mid 30s when I couldn't take the pain any longer, waking up every night 3am in such bad pain i had to run the hottest bath I could handle , I would lay in it to number my hips and go back to sleep, in the tub.\nThis was an every night ordeal, I finally decided to go back in  and be diagnosed once again, this time with degenerative bone deterioration in my hips.\nThey put me on vicodin, and for 5 years it worked, except for the fact my body would get used to the dose and I would eventually have to take more.\nI decided to do research on natural relief, and found kratom, I started taking kratom and it would give me relief from the pain enough to not have to take the vicodin, and now 5 plus years later my body has not grown uses to it and require more to help with the pain like it did with vicodin,  in fact I use the same amount now as I started 5 years ago.\nPlease don't turn me back into a pill junkie.

Kratom is a natural herbal supplement, not an opioid, and does not fit the criteria of harmfulness reserved for Schedule I substances. \n\nSchedule I drugs are supposed to have a high potential for abuse and harm and no medical use. My experience with Kratom has been that it greatly helps, not harms, individuals. I first heard about and began consuming Kratom in July 2016 after reading about and researching it online. I have mild depression and generalized anxiety disorder, which affect me on a day-to-day basis and make it difficult to focus on school work, be in social situations, or sleep well. When I found out about Kratom I had spent years looking for a viable herbal alternative to prescription anxiety and depression medications, which I am reluctant to take because of their negative side effects. Kratom is by far the best supplement I have ever found to help me with these conditions. With a daily low dose of Kratom (3-5 grams) consumed in a morning tea, I have had great success managing my depressive symptoms and keeping anxiety at bay. For the first time in my life I feel like I am functioning normally despite my conditions, and am able to productively deal with panic attacks instead of becoming overwhelmed by them. I am able to step back and calmly use psychological coping strategies before such episodes get the better of me. Kratom helps me relax, soothes my emotions, eliminates irritability, and improves my daily tension levels. My performance in school and the quality of my daily life have improved greatly. I am able to enjoy time with my husband and family, work productively, stay clear-headed, and combat creeping feelings of sadness. Kratom has also been a wonderful tool for helping me get a full night's sleep, similar to but vastly more effective than other supplements I've tried, such as melatonin. Kratom has not cured my conditions, only helped me deal with their symptoms while maintaining a productive, active, healthy lifestyle. I have noticed no negative side effects from my Kratom consumption. I am not addicted to Kratom, nor do I foresee any addictive potential in my consumption. Though I consume Kratom daily, I have stopped taking it for weeks at a time while travelling and experienced no withdrawal symptoms.\n\nI am a responsible, high-functioning adult obtaining a six-year degree at one of the most prestigious institutions in this country. I am not interested in Kratom as a recreational substance, and believe it has little recreational potentialonly small doses are needed for help with symptoms, and though Kratom can produce a feeling of well-being, this is nothing like the kind of \"euphoria\" one would expect from an opioid. I can't imagine anyone using Kratom to get \"high\"an incredibly large amount would have to be consumed, which is impractical given the powdered leaf form this herb is available in, and effects would be very unpleasant (for example, nausea, sleepiness), discouraging this kind of abuse. An online survey of 6,150 Kratom consumers by Pain News Network and the American Kratom Association shows that the average Kratom consumer is a person over 40 looking for alternatives to pharmaceutical drugs that either didn't work for them or had side effects that were unbearable.\n\nScheduling Kratom would only deprive normal adults such as myself of one of the most effective tools available to them for help with a range of emotional and physical conditions. Further, given America's severe opiate overdose epidemic (a Centers for Disease Control report shows 46 deaths per day from prescription pills alone: http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/opioid-prescribing/index.html), it seems irrational and counterproductive to ban a supplement that many have used to help them get off these harmful drugs and avoid using them in the first place. If the DEA wants to control drug abuse, one of the best ways to do so would be to ensure that responsible adults have access to safe supplements of their choice rather than being forced to consider highly addictive solutions such as prescription opiates and anxiety medications.\n\nIn my experience Kratom is safe, non-addictive, and extremely effective in relieving symptoms of mild depression and anxiety. It should remain legal, minimally regulated, and publicly available.\n\nSOURCES:\nSee studies showing that kratom acts as a partial mu-opioid receptor agonistthat is, Kratom contains no opiates, but it does bind to the same receptor sites in the brain, providing benefits such as pain relief or anxiety relief without the same addictive potential, and without respiratory suppression, the primary cause of opiate overdoses: \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22133323 \nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kratom-drug-ban-may-cripple-promising-painkiller-research/\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7384","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-26T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom.

Our law enforcement personnel should not be out arresting people for personal drug use.

Understanding and help for people with drug problems should be the norm, not incarceration which invariably leads to more problems.

I am a 60 year-old woman, a mother and a grandmother, who has suffered with disabling fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue for nearly twenty years. I came down with this condition as the result of a viral infection, Parvovirus, which I caught from my youngest son when he was eight-year-old. I became very sick very quickly. I lost my job as a magazine writer, my marriage, my house, car, and savings. I fell into disability and poverty. For the first five years (when I still had health insurance), I looked to mainstream medicine for help. I was given many drugs and told to exercise. These medications ended up ruining my stomach and they really didn't help much. Then I lost my insurance and couldn't afford them anyway. At that point, I was in very bad shape both physically and emotionally. I began looking into alternative and health-based approaches, such as changing my diet, eating organic, and taking some supplements. Over the years, I managed to hold my own even while living with often excruciating all-over body pain and debilitating fatigue. After being approved for disability and Medicare, I sometimes took pain medication, but infrequently because of the bad effects on my stomach. Then about two years ago, I heard about Kratom on a fibromyalgia website. Since in my experience, herbs and botanticals had been more helpful for me than drugs, I purchased some Kratom from a vetted online vendor (vetted by a group of Kratom users). I took a small amount, about half a teaspoon, and within a day, noticed a distinct lessening of pain. I continued using half a teaspoon twice a day. My stomach tolerated Kratom well. Within a short time, my level of pain was consistently lower and I experienced a little more energy. I was sleeping better (sleep had been a problem since contracting this illness). My life regained some predictability. This was a huge improvement in my quality of life. I could help my eldest son, who is a teacher, with the editing of his first textbook. I had the energy for my grandchildren to visit me occasionally. I could do my own grocery shopping without ending up in bed for two days. I am not \"cured\" by any stretch of the imagination, but my illness is much more manageable and I am less housebound. My spirits are better as a result. If I skip Kratom for a day or two, the pain levels begin to creep back up. My doctor knows that I take Kratom and has noted the improvement in my pain level. It would be a severe blow to me if this botanical were to be outlawed. It has only helped and not hurt me. In fact, making it illegal and therefore inaccessible would in effect be taking away the one remedy that has helped me. It seems inconceivable that I and many other chronic pain sufferers could be put in such a position. I do agree that Kratom needs to be studied and perhaps regulated in some way. For example, not sold to minors and subject to inspection for purity (I have heard stories about adulterated Kratom). But it should not be given over to pharmaceutical companies so that it can be sold back to us -- we, the people -- at inflated prices and requiring a prescription. Kratom is an herb and should remain a natural product, that is, not have its active ingredients isolated and turned into a drug. The fact that it is an herb with active ingredients together with its naturally occurring co-factors is probably the reason why my delicate stomach previously harmed by prescription drugs can tolerate it. Please do not take this useful remedy away.

This is a very dangerous choice not only for pain sufferers but for the country as well.  The DEA should consider the health and wellfare of the people and let the people decide what is good for their health care. All the known pain relievers are now banned and scheduled by the DEA. I believe Kratom holds the future for pain relief going forward. Stop and think how wonderful not addicting pain medication could be and Kratom holds the secret to this. Kratom is a life changer and for once its a positive life changer. Please don't start scheduling things that  help people along side things that harm people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12482","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ian MacGregor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a retired ER RN with chronic pain. I learned of Kratom through a pain page that I post on and began researching articles about this plant.  In doing so, I also have come across many people who use it to help with their acute, but mostly severe chronic pain. Numerous testimonials from the pain community on how much this is helping people not only with their pain, but also with their chronic fatigue.  Then I met many people who have used it to help them ease their withdrawal symptoms getting off of Heroin etc. How many had tried unsuccessfully before but managed to not only \"get clean but stay clean\" with Kratoms help.  I have been very impressed all I have learned of the positive benefits of Kratom.  The benefits far out weigh any negative outcomes I have found in my searching and talking to people.  Mainly because the side effect of nausea is nothing, heck the side effect of nausea meds is nausea.  But the biggest fact I found that totally impressed me  was.... when the Kratom Community say it's natural it's not \"hype\" or just wording.  They are as a whole very serious over what they put in their bodies. They talk about organic, fresh, raw honey vs processed. Only using healthy all natural food/plants whenever possible. This does not meet the impression of \"out of control addicts,\" or  but quite the opposite in fact. That can't be further from the truth as I have Witnessed using my ER experience with many addicted people in my career.  Please keep Kratom where it belongs as an uncontrolled substance....not once have I heard of anyone \"getting high or taking it for that reason\".  And please keep it legal in the states it already is. A bonus would be legalizing it nationwide to help everyone.  But the most important two is NO BAN, NO SUBSTANCE DECLARATION. Thank You.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18006","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lisa nagy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In reference to DEA Docket Number 442-W:\n\n   I'd like to take this time to offer more than just an opinion, I'd like to share my brief testimony as to how having access to mitragyne speciosa (kratom) has helped me both in my personal and professional life. \n   I'm an extremely hard working small business owner out here in Katy,Tx, a thriving suburb located in the greater Houston,Tx. Area. I've experienced the ups and downs of what the economy can do for business owners like myself, and if there's one thing I know personally there's very little room to fall behind when you have mouths to feed. Long story short, I was in a pretty severe car accident back in 2013 and had to get immediately back to work. Doctor visits, Pain pills, and chiropractic adjustments did absolutely nothing to get me thru what was sometimes even the lightest of days. I have an uncle who is a family doctor here in Houston who understands the severity of relying on pain medications for back injuries and recommended that I instead try adding a serving of kratom to my morning tea or coffee and  having another serving in my afternoon tea to see how that helps me fair thru the day. The difference was noticeable. I didn't have to rely on heavy medications to help me continue my jobs and try to numb the pain, and I didn't have to feel light headed or dizzy when trying to do my daily duties. I slowly but surely built my body up to getting thru the most intense parts of the day with nothing more than periodic breaks and kratom tea. Knowing that I wasn't relying on pharmaceuticals to get me thru the day and was able to partake of a relaxing beverage instead has been the most civil way to deal with what could've been an end to my company. I've been able to actually engage with my customers again, instead of having to take a brief nap or shut down the tools for an hour. The fact that misinformed people want to restrict this more humanitarian way of relieving pain then having to be poked, proded, pricked, and pilled, only to go home and be sedated or get multiple side effects is downright inexcusable. The people who will be hurt most by these changes will be people like myself, honest, genuine, hard working, members of society who wish to continue doing our part to creating a wholesome society. We understand that natural supplements such as mitragyna speciosa is not only something that should be accessible to those who understand its benefits, but something people should not have to fear because of ignorance as to the benefits that it can provide us. If theres any worries as to the negativity surrounding it, please consider the educating about it, rather then jumping to restricting it. This really only harms knowledgeable adults.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7517","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eli Adame","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Test","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21903","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am urging the DEA and FDA to not place kratom on any sort of drug schedule and to consider it an herbal supplement.

I am a 44 year old business owner. A little more than 10 years ago I was having severe back pain that developed into debilitating spasms. I thought that the years of heavy lifting and working in the manufacturing industry had caused an injury to my discs. When the pain was interfering with my daily work I decided to seek out information on my condition. This started with an MRI and a referral to a neurosurgeon for review. I was told that I had multiple disc injuries and a combination of Degenerative Disc Disease and Spinal Stenosis. When I met with the surgeon he politely explained to me that I was experiencing rapid disc degeneration and the pain was primarily from severe arthritis that formed around the damaged area of my spine. He explained that he could not treat me surgically, the damage was too widespread for any real relief. He explained that in my later years the discs may harden and become leathery and my pain would begin to subside. He recommended that I see a pain clinic for spinal injections and cauterization to kill the nerves around my spine. This began an odyssey that we now know all too well. The pain clinic never told me that my brain would begin building opiate receptors, and that all people including myself would inevitably become addicted to the medication. For the 1st year the pain meds seemed to be the solution. In time, the pain meds would begin to lose their effectiveness. I was moved on to the more powerful Percocet. I would run out of my meds during a trip to see the family in FL over Christmas break. This forced me into withdrawing from the medication. This was a real eyeopener. Luckily it was near the end of our trip and I was able to restart my meds after a couple of days. This is how I learned how badly addicted I had become to the medications. I decided to start researching another homeopathic solution. In my search for help with the painful withdrawal from Opiates, I came across Kratom. I began to read about the leafs ability to reduce withdrawal symptoms from all forms of opiates, including Heroin. I was lucky, I had means and never had to resort to the use of a dangerous substance like Heroin, but I could understand why many people found themselves in this predicament. I ordered the product and began using the tea. From day one, I was able to stop using opiates immediately. The tea also had about the same effect as my pain medications, I feared that Kratom would hurt my health so I started to see my doctor regularly for blood work. I had slightly high blood pressure and cholesterol before my Kratom use. Within 6 months of use of the tea, my bloodwork would reveal that my cholesterol flipped, my bad cholesterol was low and my good was high. My bloodpressure also normalized. My hepatic tests all confirmed my renal functions were normal. That was 5 years ago. I have used Kratom for 5 years, and I will never let anyone tell me that this is not a life saving leaf. My mood is consistently better, my eating habits are healthier, and my pain is managed with a tea. I have also stopped using this leaf many times cold turkey, and let me tell you, coffee is harder to withdraw from. When I was on opiates, I would rise in the morning, and by noon, I would have to have my meds, or suffer the beginning of withdrawals. This leaf saves lives, and I am one of the people it has saved. I have used this leaf in low and high doses, and I do not believe that overdose at any quantity is possible. I also believe that this leaf is the solution to saving the people that are tormented with opiate addiction, including heroin. If you ban this leaf, you will be dooming thousands to death from opiates. This is a fact. I know from experience that caffeine is far more dangerous than this leaf. Just look at your own data from the poison control center. This is the data that is being used to justify this ban, and clearly, by this standard, coffee needs to be immediately banned from the world. Please stop trying to \"help\" people by banning substances that a government deems harmful. I can absolutely assure you from experience that the opiates I was on for 2 years were far more dangerous than this leaf. There is no controlling an opiate, all of it's regular users will end in addiction. Just look at the numbers it has taken, and the DEA is moving to make a cure illegal. This leaf has medicinal uses that FAR outweigh the dangers, if there are ANY dangers. It has been used for thousands of years without issue. I will continue to use this leaf for my pain relief and as a tool against depression. If you have ever had chronic pain, you know that depression is a part of a life of pain. This leaf helps me with both, and keeps me working and growing my company. I am clear eyed and ready for work everyday. And this leaf keeps me going.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19422","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Gerschick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly feel KRATOM should not be restricted in anyway, as is the case with HEMP, the rest of the world is right, and we would be wrong  if\n we add this prwe incorrectly as a Schedule 1 substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16215","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"George Baschiera","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Sean Avots, I am 24 years old and I make a living fabricating scale models for museums and visitor centers. If you have ever been in a visitor center there is a good chance you have seen my work. I am writing to vehemently oppose any regulation preventing adults from having access to kratom. I have severe anxiety and have been using kratom for over 5 years to make things more manageable for me. Without help, I find many types of social interaction extremely unpleasant or even impossible. When I tried prescribed pharmaceuticals, everything had horrible side effects, and the only drugs that worked were very addicting and completely stupefying. Zoloft, one of the drugs I was given, was not only completely ineffective but it has given me night sweats that plague me to this day over 5 years later. Kratom not only helps me with my anxiety, it makes the night sweats go away on the days that I use it. I have no difficulty only using kratom a few times a week, and with kratom I can more or less function as a normal member of society. I routinely have my hands within  of an inch of running saw blades so if kratom was heavily intoxicating it stands to reason that I would have many injuries by now. On top of this, I am currently trying to start my own business, so clearly my motivation and drive for life remain intact. In fact, with kratom, I am able to put myself into so many new and wonderful situations that I have never been able to participate in previously. Please don't make me, and millions more like me felons overnight. There is something extremely suspicious about the way this has all gone down and I feel like my government is attacking me, instead of helping me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8042","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sean Avots","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a Viet Nam Era Veteran  and I use Kraton supplement to control back pain.

My name is Andrew Ingram. I am 55 years old. I am gainfully employed, own my own home and VOTE!! \n\nI would like to take a moment to express my view on the proposed ban (or Scheduling) of Mitagyna Speciosa (or any of it's active alkaloids), better known as KRATOM.  This benign plant, that is a relative of the Coffee Plant should be and remain LEGAL in the State of Florida. (and the US as a whole).  The benefits of this natural herb are far reaching and amazing. Kratom is a natural herbal dietary ingredient.\n\nI have recently had a total hip replacement procedure (I am 55 years old), and was given powerful narcotic pain relievers for the pain after surgery and during recovery.  I was prescribed this medication for nearly 2 years after the procedure for complications that developed.  With the \"new\" narcotic pain medication restrictions in place in Florida and elsewhere, I was abruptly cut off from this medication without ANY consideration of the possibility that I had developed a physical DEPENDANCE on these substances.  I was made to endure what can only be described as HORRIFIC, DEBILITATING, LIFE THREATENING withdrawal symptoms, the like I cannot begin to describe verbally.  My life was made miserable by a substance PRESCRIBED to me, to the point I considered ending my life.  WITHDRAWAL from OPIATES IS THAT BAD!  My doctors told me there was nothing they could do, due to the \"new\" Narcotic Laws in the State of Florida.  I was NOT a \"drug seeker\", or Heroin addict.  I was NOT a bad person.  I was just getting a hip replacement. And NOW I needed HELP.  Help that was not available to me until I found this LEAF.\n\nI was never told I would be facing such a Horrible thing as Opiate Withdrawal.  When the withdrawals began, I went to my doctors, all of which told me that due to NEW FLORIDA LAWS they would no longer be able to provide my medication.  When asked about the withdrawals taking over my mind and body, I was UNPOLITELY told to DEAL WITH IT\n\nSo it began that I was FORCED to obtain medication in ANY way I could.  The next few months of my life were almost UNBEARABLE.  it was a NIGHTMARE!  It was at this point I was considering ending my life.  If not for my wife and child, I would not be here to write this.\n\nSo to get to the point, I was told about KRATOM from another patient that had also been ABRUPTLY taken off Opiate Pain Medication with NO SUPPORT and NO SYMPATHY.  I was able to find some Kratom (Legally for Sale) at a local smoke shop, and to my amazement, it made my withdrawal symptoms DISAPPEAR.  I felt like living again.  I was happy and joyful.  I no longer had to roam dark dirty streets, to try and find some relief from my misery on the Black Market. I no longer had to fear being ARRESTED and thrown in jail for something that was NOT MY FAULT!!! I could go to work again and be productive, I could interact with my family again.  KRATOM SAVED MY LIFE.\n\nI have now personally helped get 4 lost souls get OFF Opiates and back to their lives.  IT WORKS, there are NO side effects.  It was so very easy to stop taking Kratom once my body had healed from my \"doctor sponsored\" ADDICTION and MISERY.  Now I seek out Opiate Addicts and show them there is a way back to sanity...and that way is KRATOM!  Kratom also works the same MIRACLE for ALCOHOLICS.  I know this as well, since I turned also to alcohol trying to get through the mind, body and SOUL destroying Opiate Withdrawals. \n\nPLEASE, PLEASE do your research on this GOD-SEND of a plant.  It CAN, WILL and DOES help multitudes of people, when NO ONE ELSE WILL!  This is not some \"synthetic\" designer drug, or \"spice\" or \"Bath salts\"...This is a Mild, Gentle Natural plant that can and will HELP MILLIONS of Opiate addicts and Alcoholics!  Sadly it seems the BIG Pharma and Rehab industries are trying to HIDE what this leaf can do, all, it seems, for their OWN FINANCIAL BENIFIT!!  And use you, the DEA and FDA as their \"muscle\" to stop anything or anyone from taking away their PROFITS.  You all should be ashamed of yourselves!\n\nI am now a HAPPY and SOBER former Opiate Addict. KRATOM is the ONLY thing (and I tried EVERYTHING), that WORKS to rid oneself of the terrible scourge of OPIATE ADDICTION!\n\nP.S.  This all natural substance (the leaves of a tree), has also worked wonders for my Family members.  It has relieved my Daughters debilitating Menstrual issues, allowing her to work and function during her few bad days of the month, as well as replaced side effect laden depression medications for my Wife of 27 years.  ALL naturally with NO side effects or addiction issues!\n\nPLEASE KEEP KRATOM AVAILABLE to ADULTS with no restrictions.  You allow Tobacco and Alcohol? (I still do NOT understand how that can be, since tobacco and alcohol are PROVEN without doubt to be KILLERS!)  Why would you BAN something that is useful and does not KILL you, yet leave people to DIE...EVERY DAY...form alcohol and tobacco and OPIATE ADDICTION???\n\n\nAndrew Ingram","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1009","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Ingram","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am submitting this comment to the proposed ban on Kratom.

Kratom is no more dangerous than any other legal botanical dietary supplement.. \n\nI am a 29 year old attorney who consumes kratom regularly. I take kratom because it is a healthy botanical that helps boost my mood and gives me energy to get through difficult tasks. At times, I have taken kratom daily for up to a month. I have always been able to stop taking kratom \"cold turkey\" for weeks at a time without any withdrawal symptoms. For me, kratom has fewer negative side effects than caffeine.\n\nI know several people who use kratom for a variety of reasons. Every person I know who uses kratom is a respected member of society who has never been in trouble with the law. While taking kratom, none of us feel or act intoxicated. When I take kratom I feel relaxed and focused. It does not impair my ability to think or act. \n\nAny substance can be abused. As many people have died from water intoxication as have allegedly died from kratom. The possibility of abuse is not a reason for scheduling a substance. Research has made clear that the potential for abuse of kratom is very low. Kratom does not cause respiratory depression. You cannot over dose on natural kratom because your body will cause you to vomit if you take too much. Kratom does not work as a recreational drug because the \"high\" is so mild. Long term use of kratom does not harm the body. For all these reasons, kratom is significantly less harmful than alcohol or tobacco. \n\nBasing drug laws on fear and misinformation is a grave injustice to the people of the US. Putting people in prison and ruining their lives for taking a substance that helps them is unacceptable. Given the extremely low risk of kratom, the potential harm cause by criminalizing kratom far exceeds the benefits. If the DEA and FDA actually care about the american people, they will not schedule kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17345","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Cavazos","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not make Kratom illegal.

Of course, to ban it will help the private prison corporation and Big Pharma, but it will not help the people who truly need help.  There really is no need to ban it other than to help the prison corporation and Big Pharma.  Kratom has been used safely by millions in other parts of the world less profit minded than America for many, many years and has been used in America for many years as a pain reliever and opiod replacement.  The side effects of kratom are minimal and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential when compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs while the public overwhelmingly supports ending this wasteful, worthless, profit-making war in favor of humane medical treatment of the condition, which can be done using substances such as kratom.  Baning kratom would shut down all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opiod treatment.  If you add kratom to any one of the five drug schedules people who use it will be locked up and criminalized for life,  This solves no problem and does no one any good other than corporate pocketbooks.  \n\nI am asking you to live up to your purpose to serve the public good.  This is best done by assisting research to learn how to cheaply help people overcome their opiod addiction, not further lining the pockets of Big Pharma and the private prison corporations.  Please do not ban kratom or put it on any drug schedule.  This would worsen our country's already overwhelming problems of opioid addiction and overdose and the pointless criminalization for profit of non-violent individuals who need our help.

You name it, I've been on it.\n\nBecause of the length of time I had been on these medications  and the dependency I developed on these hard-core doctor prescribe narcotics, I opted to go with a replacement medication called Subutex, which is buprenorphine. \n\nI can say that Subutex definitely changed my life from being on all those heavy duty narcotics. I was finally gaining clarity, while combating my pain to a degree. But after couple years on subutex , I was getting tired of this dependency as well.\n\nI started to look at other natural options and remedies. This is when I discovered the amazing and natural plant called kratom. I was a skeptic for a long time and then I finally ordered some. Not only is the community involved around this plant amazing, they truly care and know their stuff when it comes to this point. I was never steered wrong. I have never met more giving and loving people as I did in Kratom  community. \n\nI got to read stories about how pain patients got their lives back, stories of how people that were addicted to hard-core street drugs such as heroin were able to completely kick one of the most impossible drugs to kick with the help of kratom. I got to read stories of how it gave them their families back and gave them their life back. I read stories of how people with anxiety and depression and social awkwardness also were able to get their lives back. There are tons of reasons why kratom has helped people, and I am one of those people.\n\nI did a taper off of Subutex, and with the help of this amazing plant was able to completely abstain from it. It helped me through the serious withdrawals that I faced and I was able to deal with my chronic pain as well. I never once felt high  and I never had bad reactions to this plant. \n\nIt would be a terrible decision to place kratom on a schedule one list. It is not anywhere near what schedule one drugs are. It is a natural herb that is safe, effective and helps people tremendously. With the nation finally starting to look at marijuana differently, this would be the most backwards decision ever at this point in time. We as people that are supposed to have freedom should be allowed to consume this natural plant. I am afraid that this decision will only fuel the pharmaceutical companies to continue to make billions of dollars on our pain and suffering.\n\nPlease consider every single letter you received before making this possibly tragic decision. It will hurt hundreds of thousands of people if it's banned. \n\nthank you for taking the time to read my story and my opinion on kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5295","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Serena Espinoza","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My husband uses product and it helps him tremendously it has replaced a pain medication.

I had been to a psychiatrist and had gone through 7 different rounds of drugs, none of them able to make things better (and often make them worse), and my relationships and performance at work were seriously starting to suffer.\n\nI desperately began seeking natural alternatives, and through my research discovered Kratom.  I spent a long time doing in-depth research on the biochemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and history of the plant (as my background is in biochemistry I understand the importance of being well-informed about ones treatments, and also enjoy learning as well).\n\nKratom has allowed me to get off of the pharmaceuticals that did more harm than good, and regain control of my day-to-day life.  I have never experienced any kind of withdrawal or dangerous effects from stopping.  There are no reported deaths from Kratom, and reports of such have all ignored the complications arising from the deceased taking large amounts of dangerous substances in addition to Kratom.\n\nIt would be foolish to ban this plant, related to the coffee tree, which has a long (thousands of years) history of use.  Kratom has helped so many people regain control of their lives and stop the endless cycle of prescription drug hopping.  To claim Kratom has no medical value is simply an outright lie, and to claim it has the same potential for abuse as heroin is preposterous.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1178","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket ID: DEA-2016-0015Agency: Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)Parent Agency: Department of Justice (DOJ)\n\n\nI'm a 35 year old mother of three and wife to my amazing husband of 13 years.\n\n\n\nWhen I was 12 years old I had extensive surgery to correct scoliosis. 2 Harrington rods were installed along the entire length of my spine and some of my cervical and lumbar spine were fused. It was the best treatment option for the time, but it has a shelf life of about 20 years they are now finding. The hardware is deteriorating and I know have scoliosis, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, and severe arthritis. \n\nI have a lot of pain on a daily basis, but I have always avoided pain pills. My condition is only going to get worse, not better with time so mentally I have tried to push through without. \n\n\nWhen I got to the point I needed them, my blood pressure was dangerously high from trying to tolerate the pain. But I had a dilemma; I love to hunt, fish, chase my 3 year old around, drive. Those are all things I couldn't do while high on prescription pain pills. Also, I realized I would making the choice to become an addict. Legal or not, that would then be my choice. They wanted to start me on methadone since it is considered life long pain. Creating an opiate addict, when all I was looking for was something to help me live a normal life. I searched for alternatives and that's when I found kratom. I ordered it out of desperation. I'd read everything possible from both sides of it and I was so desperate I pressed on. I was so desperate that when the package arrived in the mail labeled 'Not For Human Consumption' I tried it anyway. \n\nPain relief within 20 minutes. No high, no scary side affects; I felt nothing but pain relief. It did not cure me, nothing will; it did not remove all of my pain, but it did make it tolerable.\n\nKratom gave me freedom! I achieve a tolerable level of pain without without bing high, without addiction. I could just be a mom and a wife to my family and I could do that without being confined to my bed. \n\nMy blood pressure has remained normal for so long now, I get out of bed and I'm excited for the day. \n\nI'm a person who has never been into the drug scene, I hate feeling high. I drink maybe 6 times a year, if even that, on special occasions. I shouldn't have to choose to become an addict. I shouldn't have to worry about taking medicine now that will become ineffective over time as I need it more. Most days I take kratom, but if I don't need it, I don't take it, I appreciate that freedom too. I'm not basing my entire life around a dosing schedule. \n\nIn the past year and a half, I've gone for long periods of time without kratom, the only negative effect is a return of my debilitating pain. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22769","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Katie Madsen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep Kratom legal.

Not only has Kratom helped with the pain without the side effects of most Opeoid Medications, it helps with the inflammation and tension in my neck. Which allows me to be able to rest and sleep good at night. I have been able to avoid having surgery on my neck with the help of Kratom & Chiropractic care. I worked in a Chiropractors office for several years and many of the patients that came in that have had neck surgery were still in terrible pain, ended up being fused down their neck, and still having to take many medications.\n\nI have had no adverse reactions or side effects from using kratom unlike some of the Medications I took before. Scheduling Kratom will only hurt those looking for a natural alternative to a doctor shoving pills down their throat. My husband is an Addiction Councilor and sees on a day to day basis the prescription pill epidemic that's going on right now.

I have taken kratom for over a year now, and it has been very positive in my life. I am in a community of other such people who take kratom, and I have witnessed the same positive health from these people. People who have experienced poor health both physically and mentally. I also have not had a negative experience while taking kratom, and I do not believe that it causes anything more than just minor discomfort. \n\nKratom is an herb that has been used by many different kinds of people for hundreds of years to aid in health. Having good health and well-being is important to many people in society. To have a plant that is natural and positive should not be put on Schedule I. People like me, working people with families believe the same. I am a sales manager for my job, and I actively participate in hosting events for my store. Other people who take kratom are responsible workers. They have regular jobs, and normal families. Or they may be the brave men and women who serve our country. They are doctors, police officers, and friends and family. \n\nThis is a natural herb that could help many other people with the proper regulation. Studies have been preformed on the plant that shows positive results in favor of the ways kratom could help people. This includes positive things like depression, anxiety, PTSD, and addiction.

When I was 18 years old I had a surgery and started taking the pain medication that was prescribed to me.   Unfortunately, I made the choice to abuse the medication and that mistake robbed me of nearly a decade of my life while I struggled with opiate addiction.   I tried everything.  I tried to use a methadone program, then I went on to suboxone.   After about a year of being in a suboxone program I wanted nothing more than to quit taking it.   My doctor was not cooperative when I told him that I wanted to completely quit taking it and told me that suboxone was something that a person wasn't supposed to quit...that I would be on suboxone for the rest of my life.   As I'm sure you can imagine I was devastated to hear that as a 26 year old woman who had her entire life ahead of her.   Thankfully I wasn't willing to accept that and I started researching ways to quit taking suboxone.   \n\nAfter hours of online research I came across information about kratom.   I read about how helpful it was and while I was skeptical at first I decided to order it and at least give it a try.   It was one of the best decisions I've made in my life.   I ordered about 8 ounces online and took a small amount every few hours as needed to cope with my withdrawals and cravings.   Within half an hour of taking it the cravings were gone.   I continued to take it for about 4 months until I ran out and decided that I didn't feel like ordering another shipment.  I felt no withdrawals, no anxiety, no cravings.   I was clean...I was actually clean.  Kratom gave me my life back.   \n\nNow I've been clean for almost five years and I couldn't be happier.   I was able to get my dream job as a flight attendant which was something I could have never accomplished as an addict.   I was able to get married to a wonderful man and have my dream ceremony.  Now my husband and I are ready to start our own family and I am so thankful that I have this life that I never imagined was possible only six years ago.\n\nSince then many of my old friends weren't so lucky.   I lost so many wonderful people to  addiction and it breaks my heart that they weren't able to get the second chance that I got because in 2013 kratom was banned in TN.  Please don't take this away from the rest of the country by adding it to the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.  There are so many people out there who desperately want to change their lives but don't know how.   I genuinely believe that this tea could give them their life back just like it gave me my life back.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1672","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kelley Stephens","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nMy name is Laura and I am a 28-year-old wife and mother. I would like to express my opposition to the schedulingn of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (AKA \"Kratom\"). I have been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a painful and debilitating, inherited condition. There is no cure for my illness and I have struggled to manage the symptoms throughout my life. About a year ago, Kratom was recommended to me as a possible treatment for pain and other ailments. It allowed me to begin living my life again without strong and addictive controlled substances. Kratom is not any more addictive than caffeine, and I can say from personal experience that using Kratom regularly does not lead to tolderance or a need for increased amounts. It also does not produce a \"high\" like prescription painkillers. Kratom has a mild, relaxing effect that is similar to drinking chamomile tea. Restricting Kratom will undoubtedly block patients with real health concerns from finding alternative treatments to opioids, including myself. Kratom has allowed me to work full-time, care for my child, and function in society. Please do not add the only thing that has truly helped my disorder to the controlled substance list.\n\nThank you,\nLaura","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13632","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should be allowed to be used as an herbal supplement and at the very least studied, not condemned or made illegal.

If this natural plant can help even one family avoid the pain of prescription drug abuse, we need to research it and determine its pros and cons. Make the right decision based on science not fear and rumors. Don't make a foolish mistake cause it could be your kids on oxy, it does not discriminate.

I served about 8 years in the United States Navy where I incurred injuries to both of my shoulders.  At the end of my enlistment I received surgeries to repair both of my shoulders over the course of 6 months.  I was prescribed pain medication during the recovery.  After my prescriptions ran out, the pain continued, and I continued to seek relief.  For about a year I started the descent into full blown opiate addiction to the point of intravenous heroin/fentanyl and any other opiate, prescription or not, that I could get my hands on.  Between the pain and the withdrawal symptoms, I realized that I was trapped in the addiction and I could not stop.  It consumed my life and my job, relationships, and self confidence all suffered.  I found kratom through a friend's recommendation and tried it.  I was amazed at how well it helped with the withdrawal from opiates and even helped with the pain in my shoulders.  I was able to become opiate free, and get a great job with a power company.  I revealed to my family and girlfriend what was going on as I had kept the opiate addiction a secret.  I was able to repair the broken relationships and get my life back together.  Kratom assists me with being a productive member of society as I am able to perform well at work, I have healthy relationships with my family and friends, and I am no longer experiencing the debilitating depression that resulted from opiate abuse.  I eat healthy and exercise regularly and drink kratom tea on a daily basis.  I am so thankful for kratom.  I do not think that kratom should be scheduled as I believe that an individual person knows what is best for them and should be able to take the matter of their own personal health in their own hands.  I enjoy being an American citizen where I am free to practice the religion I chose, speak my political ideas freely, and drink the tea that I like.  Based on my own experience I think that kratom can help people with opiate addiction, pain, and depression.  Thank you for allowing me to comment and I hope that you make the right decision for the right reasons.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2400","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lee Parrett","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"}],"totalNumRecords":23226}
