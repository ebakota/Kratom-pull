By 2014 I started looking into more herbal type alternatives to meds. \nThis is where I stumbled onto kratom. Besides the effectiveness on chronic pain it allows me to be energetic and lead a normal life. \nI experienced NO bad side effects. It is virtually impossible to overdose and it does not get you high contrary to popular belief.  I will continue using kratom once I am legally able to do so. I cannot even contemplate going back to those dark years in constant pain. \nI plead with you to please do proper research and recognize the healing abilities of this herb.. \nYou can regulate usage to 18 years and over but please do not make this plant illegal. \nThank you for reviewing..","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16358","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Neela Singh","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI would like to comment on Kraton and its uses. First off, kratom is a close relative to the coffee plant \"is a tropical evergreen tree in the coffee family\" . Second, This plant has been used for 100's of years and has a excellent track record on the effects as well as its safety . It's effects are weaker than coffee - and if one overdosed, they simply would puke and feel better right away. Do the research and find out that this plant is ok for the public.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8792","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jacob Tacheny","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \nFirst off, thank you so much for supporting democracy by allowing somewhat of a public forum on this topic.

For years, I was on and off opiate pain medication to deal with the unbearable pain. This led to larger doses, stronger meds, and eventually a strong dependence on OxyContin. The dependence on Opitates caused me great distress, as I knew the dangers of addiction were real. Then I found this amazing plant called Kratom, and it's changed my life. With a small, consistent dose of Kratom taken twice daily, I am able to hold the headaches at bay and haven't taken an Opiate medication in over 8 years. There has been no need to increase my dose of Kratom, as it does not lose effectiveness over time. Due to the extremely beneficial results of Kratom, along with a strong conviction that there is absolutely no major risk of overdose or addiction, I believe it should remain legal. I am a financial professional and I work 40-60 hours weekly; without Kratom I have no doubt I would not been able to establish the life I have now. Please do the right thing and keep this wonderful plant legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16866","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Geister","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Never used it myself, but I heard a podcast talking about its' effects, and its' possible benefits.

I am married and very happy to be alive and a functioning, hard working person. I am only able to say this because of kratom. I was injured on a job about 16 yrs ago and was prescribed pain meds. Years later and a lot of struggling with side effects, I was taken off the meds by my doctor who did not help me with withdrawal. I later lived a sad and dangerous life just to keep from the horrible withdrawal and severe pain. I hurt people I loved and I made them worry over my safety. After years of this nightmare and an almost fatal overdose I was praying so hard and a lady from my Bible study group who practiced all natural herbal and homeopathic remedies told me how kratom had saved many people she knew. I have to say with all my heart that this has saved my life!!! For all those suffering and trying or dying to get off opiates pleas gives them this chance. I am totally free of drugs now and Contrary to what some believe I am not addicted or taking the kratom any longer because I now do yoga therapy for my pain. Please give suffering people the chance to live!!

I am a Case Management Coordinator at the Department of Human Services. I have used kratom for Restless Legs Syndrome and Irritable Bowel Syndrome since 2008. Before finding kratom I tried every prescription drug that is on the market for both of my chronic conditions. Every single medicine I tried was ineffective, or the side effects were so bad I was unable to continue treatment. In fact, the anti-Parkinson's medication my doctor prescribed for my Restless Legs Syndrome actually made my symptoms worse (this is a common side effect called \"augmentation\").\n\nI am a law-abiding citizen (I had to pass a background check to be employed at my current job), and I respect the law greatly, and one of the main reasons I chose kratom (like the hundreds of other people I have talked to in the kratom community), is because it is LEGAL, and because it does not alter who I am as a person like some of the medications I used to take for my chronic health conditions. It does not impair me, or alter my thinking or behavior, or affect my judgment. \n\nThe DEA may think it's as simple as choosing not to use kratom anymore if the ban goes into effect. But I have two serious chronic illnesses that have been successfully managed with kratom for more than 8 years now. I can sleep at night and not crash my car when I'm driving because a Restless Legs Syndrome flare up happens all of a sudden, because my Restless Legs Syndrome is helped greatly by kratom. I can focus at work because my Restless Legs Syndrome symptoms are under control. I can not wake up every morning sick to my stomach and throw up every day before I go to work, because my Irritable Bowel Syndrome disappears completely when I take kratom. \n\nMost kratom users respect the law like I do, and are not criminals. We don't abuse illegal drugs, most of us don't even drink alcohol or use other prescription drugs. We are moral, ethical people by and large. But we also have chronic illnesses that require treatment, and kratom is the only thing we have found that works. It has given us our lives back. That is why you will find such passion among us. We are literally fighting for our lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0327","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laura Seltzer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Danny, and I believe Kratom should remain legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17836","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Danny Abosch","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For this supplement to be a schedule 1 narcotic with little to no research, is criminal and not factual based.

I was born with a spinal deformity that causes chronic pain. There is no surgical or medical procedure at this time to help me. I have taken prescription pain medication since the age of 17. Last year, at the age of 36, I began searching for alternatives. The amount of relied I was receiving from the medication was not worth the side effects, and risk associated with opiate pain relievers. I just wasn't benefiting from them. In my search for an alternative, I came across kratom. I did as much research as I could, read testimonials from other people who were in my situation, and weighed my options. I decided it was worth a try. I have never been so happy about a decision. Kratom has given me the ability to participate in my own life again. I'm a productive member of society, a dedicates daughter that can now help care for my elderly patents better, and I'm happy. The depression that comes along with not being able to do things you need to do, some days not being able to get out of bed is overwhelming. I'm not a spectator in my life anymore. I'm not stuck at home in bed, focused only on my pain. I'm up and doing things I haven't been able to do in years. I attribute kratom with giving me that ability, and the joy in my life. Please keep kratom legal. Please allow me to continue having access to the plant that has really given me my life back.

I fear that if we ban Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, also known as Kratom, we may be losing out on the benefits that this plant could produce. Kratom has many healing properties including pain relief, energy booser, sexual stimulator, relieves anxiety, helps with addiction recovery, reduces blood pressure, helps regulate blood sugar levels, and it boosts the immune system. Many people use Kratom as a natural remedy to their ailments as opposed to using pharmaceutical drugs. This plant could possibly be the cure to the pill addiction problem that the world has come to know. Many pharmaceutical drugs do not have as many health benefits as Kratom, but are still legal. I fear that big pharmaceutical companies may be pushing to make sure Kratom is illegal so that they keep their position locked. \nIt is my hope that we delay the ban on Kratom so that we can further develop and properly use this plant to better mankind.

I oppose the DEA scheduling of the South East Asian botanical, Kratom. Though I'm generally in fairly good health, if I'm ever feeling under the weather, sad, or unmotivated, I always find Kratom tea to uplift my mood and give me energy and motivation. I don't always drink Kratom tea, but I appreciate the freedom of being able to drink this harmless herbal tea at will. I believe that Kratom should remain legal because it is a non-psychoactive herb from SE Asia that helps people be more successful and higher functioning members of society- as well as of their own lives. Physically, Kratom is of no danger to those who choose to partake- there is no suppression of respiratory function. Mentally and emotionally, Kratom allows people to have more control over their own lives- in helping people to gain the wisdom and strength to become one less statistic in the very real, ever growing pharmaceutical-industry-fueled opiate epidemic (for just one example). Please do not schedule this harmless botanical, that is so positive for so many members of society.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7867","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nora Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello....my name is Mark Grayczyk im a 55yr old father of 5 and grandfather of 4 beautiful grand children...I  am a christian by faith and am involved with the church....im also a recovering opeit addict with just over 3 yrs clean thanks to the rooms of narcotics anonymous.....like many of our kratom community I got involved with pain pills do to a chronic back ingery...I tryed everything to treat it... shots in my spin to the point of scar tissue ...a failed back surgery and in order to work and support my family was forced on to living on narcotics.......I rode the narcotic train for 10yrs and was horribly addicted  my life was centered around pills and over time the pills kept getting stronger and more dangerous...I have O/Ded 3 times to the point of near death....prescription pain medication is not the answer for me....around 2 yrs ago I was told about kratom from a friend who was treating his chronic pain with it so I thought I would give it a try.....it has been life changing to say the least...with just a rounded teaspoon in the morning I am pain free for most of my day...unlike the pills I dont get foggy or ''high'' and can work on it... when I get home from work I dose again and no longer live in constant pain...this all natural herb has provided me a quality of life I would not be able to achieve without it\nmy doctor is aware I take it..my whole family can attest that it has not only worked but been safe to take for 2yr so use me as your ginnie pig....all I ask is that you think long and hard before taking this mirical of a plant from our community  we have a very structured and dedicated on line supplier's and there quality can be trusted this herb is the answer not the problem please dont schedule it and make it unavailable  sincerely Mark grayczyk","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1976","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"mark Grayczyk","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Before I begin I would like to state that I've never tried kratom.

As a result, I suffered daily from extreme spasms and kidney pain. The daily agony did not stop there. About once every couple weeks up to once a week, I developed kidney stones that placed me in a state of misery. I was first prescribed hydrocodone, then oxycodone, then hydromorphone, and before I knew I was physically dependent to the point of no clear return to my normal self. Before I was put on narcotics, I was a successful and happy teenager, student, boyfriend, and genuine friend to many. \n\nBut then my life took a dark turn.\n\nI began missing school, failing classes, I lost my girlfriend of 2 years who loved me very much before my addiction took control. My situation describes many thousands if not millions of people who never thought they would have become addicted. I began to understand why people stole, robbed, and committed destructive acts to get these medications. Finding opiate narcotics wasn't to get high, it was only to not feel like the absolute worst flu you've ever had in your life. I describe a withdrawal as being thrown out in a tundra blizzard naked while wet from being in a previously warm and relaxing bath, then kicked while vomiting and feeling like you are being stabbed by a thousand needles all over your body at random.\n\nThis all changed when I found out about Mitragyna Speciosa, or 'Kratom'. The feeling of Kratom is not like taking a Vicodin or Percocet. It's more along the intensity lines of coffee yet it's effects can be either mildly stimulating or calming. It does not make you feel high, extremely euphoric, or manic. However it can tremendously help with mild pain such as migraines, joint pain, and muscular aches as well as prevent diarrhea and has been found to possess anti inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Kratom saved my life. I truly and wholeheartedly know that. Also you cannot overdose from it, Kratom is so natural and kind that it will force you to vomit if you even attempt to abuse it.\n\nHere's the most important thing to consider: IF Kratom is made illegal, recovering opiate addicts including heroin users that are tapering down with Kratom just to ease withdrawals, the US WILL not may , but WILL see an ever increasing spike in prescription drug and heroin overdoses and deaths because that will be the only thing left for them to turn to. I pray to God this natural plant does not become illegal for the sake of thousands of lives. An addict could be anyone. Do you want your spouse, sibling, child, family member, friend, to turn back to the harmful drugs instead of easing cravings and withdrawal with a natural plant that grows from the ground out of a seed created by God? It's here for a reason, and I believe to save us from the evil substances in a sense.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19957","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 60 years old and have been using kratom for about 9 months.I had been taking percocet before that ,which had ceased working.The kratom gives me no side affects .I hope you will give serious consideration before making this a class 1 substance,not only for me but many other people who use it to to avoid opiates.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16923","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Donald Hochstetler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom offered my sister a workable path away from use of more dangerous opiods. She has been clean for 5 years now, and everyone in my family believes her outcome would have been dramatically different (i.e. death from overdose) were it not for this plant. If nothing else, the active ingredients in Kratom should be studied for their combination of their agonist action on certain opioid receptors, while still producing a punitive effect (i.e. not just binding to mu-opioid receptors en masse).  It is my understanding that this makes overdose less likely than other opioid agonists, and chronic overuse somewhat unpleasant (from the research I've done - at least much, much less \"high\" producing than any other scheduled opioid).  The active constituents of Kratom should not be scheduled; even if leaving it unscheduled only saves a few hundred lives from opioid overdose, that is still more good than harm, by a huge margin.  It is my understanding that only a few individuals have died after ingesting Kratom, and these cases involved polydrug abuse.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2502","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Owen Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My Husband has what is known as Wilsons Disease, a genetic disease, he has nerve pain and restlessness as well as many other symptoms.

Due to a back injury I was prescribed pain medication.  Gradually my tolerance increased and I began abusing pain medication and benzos due to depression. This was an on and off cycle of abuse for years.  Finally around, 2012, I found this product, Kratom.  I used it to taper off of my opiate and benzo use.   Now I only have to occasionally use it to manage my pain and anxiety.  At no time did I even feel that I NEEDED kratom as a craving.  \n\nALL IN ALL, Kratom saved my life.  I can understand putting a possible limit on the amount one can buy, but KRATOM SAVED MY LIFE.  I can use it occasionally to manage my back pain and don't have to be resort to  going to the doctor and being prescribed a worse addictive drug like Lortab or Percocet to manage my pain.  \n\nI would not be alive today if it was not for Kratom.  I consider it as a dietary supplement that  can be used as an alternative to American over-prescribing doctors .  I have read the so-called horror stories online, but have never heard of anyone dying from Kratom itself.  \nMy doctor when I was on Methadone at one point was the one who recommended that I try Kratom to taper off opiates and benzos.  \nI also suffer severe anxiety and Kratom, along with therapy, has helped me get through that.\nI have a cousin who takes it occasionally to assist with his anxiety.  \nI firmly believe that problems come when people mix substances together, but Kratom taken alone has done nothing but help me and I never have felt a withdrawal effect from it.  I still keep it on hand for painful injuries or panic attacks, which is a whole other story, because I also was addicted to benzos during my entire use due to anxiety and veing overly prescribed controlled meds by my doctor then suddenly getting cut off.  With proper use of kratom helps with that as well.\nBottom line, I would be DEAD if I had not found Kratom.  I now have a full life with a family and I would really feel bad for anyone with chronic pain or anxiety that uses Kratom and suddenly can no longer take it.\nPAIN CLINICS ARE WHAT NEED TO BE TARGETED. IF KRATOM GOES ILLEGAL THEN PEOPLE WILL RESORT TO PAIN CLINICS AND BE PRESCRIBED EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE NARCOTICS OR OTHER CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES, OR OTHER ILLEGAL DRUGS AND THAT THOUGHT IS JUST TERRIFYING.\n\nI truly hope that my story helps make a difference to keep Kratom a legal product.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21580","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have really bad back pain and was on perks for so long and they stopped working\nSo I started to do other narcotics.

My pain can be debilitating and is probably exasperated my already existing dysthymia.\n I did not work for seven years bbcause my kratom resouces disappeared when ebay stopped selling it. I did not know where to buy it where I had the advice and support of a kratom community. I ended up back on pills and had humiliating and unsuccessful experiences with a pain mmanagemet doctor. In fact, most of my previous doctors tried to convince me my pain was not real and pushed SSRI medications on me with no success. I tried 18 different antidepressants over 20 years.\n Early this year I joined a facebook community that monitors and vets trusted vendors. There, I found affordable and appropriate strains and the kratom has changed my ability to function physically and mentally. I have worked full time this uear, first time in seven years. My family brags about my successes. I feel free and enjoy the benefits of real paychecks and a social life that I did not have for seven years.\n Kratom lifts my mood but does not make me \"high\". It makes me feel normal. It effectively relieves pain that normally only went away with oxycodone or morphine. There is no residual or rebound pain from consuming kratom unlike the bad feelings you get from depleting the brain's  ability to produce endorphins and dopamine when relying on opiate based medicines. Kratom is mild and gentle and does not harm me like some drugs that are scheduled by the DEA. \n  Please do not take this simple and miraculous healing plant from the people. Illegalizing it can only do more harm than good. I do not know how I would function without it.

Frankly, we have a huge opiate problem in the U.S., and banning this natural alternative is likely to only make it worse.\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17066","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \n\nI'm an active member of society who's worked in education for over fifteen years. In 2001, I was struggling with lower back pain and after many visits to the doctor, I learned that I had sacroiliac lower back pain. I was given opioid pain meds and like most, I found that it not only relived physical pain, but emotional pain as well. After a divorce a few years later, I began abusing the prescription drugs and soon found I needed them just to get out of bed. A few years later I decided to get off of pain meds and was fortunate to find krantom to be listed as one of the most safe and effective ways to ease the withdrawal. \n\nIf krantom was not available I would have continued abusing pain meds or found alternative drugs. Trust me, krantom does not get you high the same way true opioid does. What it does is offer a safe \"stepping stool\" for those not ready or unable to afford the monthly visit to the clinic. And why should there only be one method for getting off opioids? If ingesting a plant offers relief for those suffering why take that away? You're only forcing them to obtain it illegally (like we need more people suffering from addiction in our jails), or have them find other drugs to ease the pain. \n\nIf we've learned anything from the past (alcohol prohibition), it's that banning a substance that offers relief doesn't work. Isn't it better to learn from the plant and figure out why it's so effective?\nEnough is enough.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18117","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, I have been a Kratom user for 3 years now and mainly because it is the only thing that gets me a normal life.

I have heard a lot about Kratom but most information available out there is false or propagated by special interest groups. The other information i can get is from people that use Kratom and the most trustworthy information is from first hand use which seems to be mainly positive. If this plant can help control my pain and in turn keep me from relapsing and get me off of suboxone (which is also addictive) my life and my kids lives would be so much better. Further research on this product is needed to help me have a normal life again. I don't believe it should be made illegal until legitimate information is available to people like me. This is something that should me kept in mind. Opiate addiction is a blight on this great nation. As a person i have never been one to believe in suicide, but Opiate addiction is the only thing that has ever made that seem like my only way out. Please keep this in mind when ruling on the legality of Kratom. \nThank you for reading.\nAaron Keeler, TN","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9767","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Aaron Keeler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has in the past year and a half kept me from using narcotics, it's a natural pain reliever and anti depressant.

I began to seek alternative, herbal options when I was experiencing anxiety which started when I was laid off from a home care agency due to the company closing. Kratom, for me, has been a safe, effective alternative to the xanax my doctor initially prescribed me. After taking only a few xanax to help my brain be quiet at night, I realized how horrid it made me feel. I felt groggy, drugged, lethargic. I couldn't go to work in the mornings when I took xanax. I talked with my doctor and discontinued xanax. I have purchased kratom through natural herb shops, the only places locally I could find pure kratom. I do not want to take kratom laced with other medications or altered in any way. In my experience, when I have taken kratom, I have slept through the night. Occasionally, if it wears off and I wake up during the night, I will take another small dose to help me go back to sleep. I am consistently able to manage my anxiety and have restful sleep at night to help me function in surgery the next day. After years of quietly taking kratom, mainly because no one knew what it was, I began to see many other friends and family struggle with pain, inflammation or anxiety. Those who were homeopathically inclined, I have suggested kratom to and on a few occasions, offered a sample of mine. All have become regular consumers. All have found what I experienced, no side effects to speak of and effective at improving their pain from arthritis, joint pain from tendon and ligament damage and reduced anxiety. I will be devastated if this wonderful plant is banned. In the past few months, I made the attached graphic to compare kratom, which is fairly obscure, and turmeric, a well-known spice commonly in your spice drawer. I have also attached the sources for my research. Please hear our cries, our pleading with our government. We the people are asking you, please, with respect, do not ban kratom. If you find, after hearing all of our voices, that there should be some type of regulations put in place to protect the public, let those be that kratom be sold to people who are adults. Restrict kratom from being sold in a blend with other substances that could be part of the misguided targeting of kratom, so kratom can only be available as the safe, natural plant hundreds of thousands of Americans responsibly consume everyday.

My best friend was in a severe accident and was in a coma for several months. Due to her injuries she suffered severe pain since that time. This caused a dependency on pain pills that plagued her life. After almost 10 years of consistent opiate use, she discovered kratom. Within three months she was completely weaned off of the opiates. This gave her the quality of life back that she had been missing for so many years. Since that time, I have share the experiences I personally witnessed with several other friends and family members who had opiate addictions. Pretty much everyone experience the same relief of pain without the addictive properties that my best friend experienced. I have several injuries from my younger days along with a good amount of arthritis that I experience. I used kratom for relief of these aches and arthritic pains. I have never had any ill effects or withdrawal symptoms due to my occasionally use. I know this miracle plant is probably eating into the profits of the pharmaceutical companies that make these very strong opiate painkillers, but I have never met or heard of anyone who has overdosed and died from kratom, as opposed to the uncountable deaths from opiates and heroin. I just hope that the wise people that run your branch of government are wise enough to see that this plant does not belong on the list of illegal and prohibited substances. Please do not take this plant away from people that use it instead of stronger pain killers or street drugs.

Most who know me know I have suffered with severe pain for 3/4 of my life. I recently came across some information on a plant called Kratom. I spent four months researching everything about it. When you live with severe chronic pain the way I do, you are willing to try anything and everything to help you feel as close to \"normal\" as possible! For many years I have felt like nothing more than a pincushion with a delusional hope of being even half the person I used to be. With appointment after appointment. Scan after scan. Surgery after surgery (including a spinal neurostimulator that is supposed to help reduce my pain and doesn't). Injection after injection. Pill after pill. So many, I have become quite a pharmacist without a degree! Not that I've ever asked to be one or even had a liking for pills of any kind! I've never been the type to enjoy taking anything at all. I remember a time I would struggle with a headache just to avoid taking an asprin. Little did I know... taking pills would be my life. The unpleasant side effects of Pharmaceuticals are something you can only understand if you've been subjected to them as your only option to relief for an extended period of time.. all of which are horrible! Little did I know that my suffering could have ended a long time ago by drinking an all natural tea called Kratom. I am on month two of my Kratom journey and my body hasn't felt this good in a very very long time! When taking my regular meds, if you were to ask me what my pain level is my answer normally is anywhere from a seven to plus ten! However, here I am on month two of Kratom tea and my pain level has been NO more than a four....which to me is almost INVISIBLE! I have taken zero meds and have experienced NO withdrawls from dropping them either!!! UNBELIEVABLE to think that I am finally going to get the life I worked so hard for back! I honestly never thought I would as my condition (DDD) only gets worse and worse. I am still in shock and my emotions have been a complete Rollercoaster. I have been stuck between crying because I can't believe how great I feel...and unspeakable anger because our society allows people like me to suffer while making big Pharma richer and richer with no real pain relief for patients! Anger because I finally found something Natural that ACTUALLY WORKS and the FDA/DEA wants to take it away from us!!! Something so harmless in comparison to all the pharmaceuticals ever prescribed to me. The same pharmacuticals that have destroyed my stomach, intestines, gallbladder and liver to name a few. I have gone to extents that NO person should have to....just to find one single ounce of relief so that I can just be a mom, a woman... who can wash her own dishes, make dinner and care for her children. My journey has been unbelievably dark and full of more suffering than any one person should ever be forced to endure! Pain takes over my entire mind, body and soul regardless of how hard I fight! It changes you and makes you feel lost and worthless because you aren't the same person anymore. Many, many times I have contemplated my existence and lost any and all hope for a functional future. Suicide has danced through my mind way too often over the years. I honestly never thought I could feel \"ok\" again until Kratom gave me my life back! \nI am begging you to leave Kratom alone! Us chronic pain patients have had things shoved down our throats for years...let us drink our tea in peace. Please do not ban this harmless plant. The facts are there...the evidence that (pure) kratom is safe and works wonders is there. Don't we suffer enough already? Opiates/pills are horrible and they are the problem not kratom!!

I also have 2 years experience performing bench neurophysiology research at a US medical school.  Currently I practice in an area with extensive opiate abuse and THC abuse.  I find the pharmacological potential of cannabinoids very intriguing, but extremely limited by lack of research.  The endogenous cannabinoid system suggests an immense potential for pain treatment without the opiate induced respiratory depression that kills thousands of people.  I suspect that much of our lack of understanding of pain, pain treatment, and the endogenous THC system is a sad consequence of THC being listed as schedule 1 drug, and the effect this has had on reduced research. \n\nHonestly, I do not know much about Mitragynine and 7- Hydroxymitragynine.  But I know there is an absolute crisis of tragic deaths in the USA from opiate induced apnea (we have had a handful locally, each one devastating to the families and our community).  We need to know more about treating pain without respiratory depression.  Most likely, there is no fundamental reason for the two to be linked.  When we know more, we likely will be able to treat pain better than with opiates, and without killing thousands of people.  I want to know more about this drug, and the pain pathways through which it works.  Scheduling this drug category 1 will shut down the learning process, and lock in our ignorance.  How many deaths might it also lock in?  I am not for encouraging or enabling recreational drug use, but please do not impair our learning, innovation, and medical progress, especially where it is needed so desperately.

I am against the DEA listing kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. I was very disappointed that the DEA attempted to list Kratom as a schedule 1 substance without providing a comment period before, breaking the long established custom to review all comments before making such an impactful decision on all the kratom users country wide. I began using kratom while in law school as a substitute for more dangerous drugs such as adderall and vyvanse, which I see get abused so often in law school and other demanding graduate schools. This tea provided me with the focus and concentration to graduate from law school and pass the Florida Bar exam on my first attempt. It has also been a great help in productivity in my career and other endeavors. This substance is much less harmful than alcohol and many other substances not included on the schedule 1 classification. Kratom is a relative of the coffee plant, and to me is no less harmful as such. It provides similar effects of coffee and is no more addicting that its relative plant.\n\nI've examined a kratom study from the 50's, which was the longest study that I could find, which studied the Philippine migrant farmers who were regular users. I am unable to locate the study currently, but it should be examined before any final rulings are made. To briefly summarize, the study showed that the drug was as addictive as coffee, but did not provide any negative health issues although it had the same addictive qualities as coffee. \n\nIn conclusion, I think listing kratom as a schedule 1 substance would do a disservice to many people as kratom is a safe and useful plant. It has pain relieving qualities, cognitive improving qualities, and the ability to help people suffering from drug addictions, such as heroine. I implore you to keep kratom legal and help the many law abiding citizens have a natural remedy to aid them in their lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20293","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alexzander Lyle","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My husband has been using Kratom daily for relief and management if chronic pain.\nI have seen firsthand the incredible benefits of this plan\nHe does everything \"right\" to alleviate his pain (inversion table, hot tub, chiropractic, massage, stretching, exercise, ketogenic diet, supplilemenrs, green smoothies, epsom salts bathes . . . ) And only Kratom seems to offer sustained relief.\nAnticipating the classification of the plant, he recently quit daily use. \nTo both of our surprise, he had no noticeable withdrawal effects, with the exception of onset of pain symptoms.\n\nHe owns a business, is involved in the community, mentors small business owners, basically a respectable person.\nBanning Kratom will harm everyday people like him, and those worse off with addiction to other substances.\n\nInstead of classification as a schedule one drug, please encourage the use and safe access if this plant to truly heal and treat people.\nEncourage research of the effects, and review the personal accounrs if lives that have been positively impacted from this incredible plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5246","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Www.ezfoodsolympia.com","postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Boyle","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nAs a responsible adult user of Kratom products, I have found them safe and effective in treating stress and related back pain.

I truly think this plant needs to be further researched for the well being of so many people, and if you find evidence that truly proves it is anymore dangerous than alcohol, tobacco, or prescription drugs then I have no problem with it being illegal. But I do believe the time and effort of our government should look into this with unbiased intentions that are influenced by outside involvement such as big pharma and public opinion, and to truly help its people in which it is governs and sworn to protect and help, instead of looking out for these corporations with intentions that mean well but don't always create for what is best. Please, if this can help people without the use of prescription drugs I hope it can create some good.

It would be a shame to ban this plant from the people who truly benefit from it. Kratom is harvested from a tree and is safe when consumed in its natural form. Therefore,  I don't believe anyone has the right to tell me I cannot use it. To me it's no different than being told I can't drink coffee or eat chocolate. If it's found in nature leave it alone.

I work in a technical sales role at a software technology company. I would like to write a few words about the positive effects of Kratom.\n\nThroughout my life I have experienced mild anxiety and at times a lack of focus. I started taking Kratom on and off about 1.5 years ago to combat some of these negative cognitive effects I had been dealing with. Since starting to use Kratom I have garnered the focus to  accomplish following:\n\n-Learn full stack software development to the point where I have helped local businesses build systems and web tools needed. \n-Start public speaking and performing stand up comedy. Since I have let go of the taking of kratom and can get on stage without any use of it. However, it helped me get started.\n\nI can say with 100% confidence that I am not dependant on Kratom whatsoever. Just like I can stop drinking coffee or alcohol, I can stop taking Kratom no problem and my life would be okay. My take on Kratom is that sure, it can be considered a drug. But so can caffeine, nicotine and marijuana, which is increasingly becoming considered harmless and made legal in many states in the USA. \n\nJust like these the aforementioned substances, Kratom is not harmful. What are harmful are the drugs such as ritalin, vicodin, and other mind altering drugs that doctors prescribe day in and day out. My brother was prescribed ritalin growing up. I have no doubt that he didn't need it ,and could have used something much more mild such as Kratom with better health and cognitive benefits.\n\nWhat I can't understand is how the US government can have such an extreme reaction to a plant such as Kratom? I have taken it on and off for the last year and a half and at no point have I thought, \"Well, this should definitely be considered in a class of drugs with cocaine, heroin and methamphtamine.\" \n\nI kindly ask you to consider the regulation of Kratom just as you have with substances such as alcohol, nicotine, and how some states such as Colorodo have done with Marijuana. You will without a doubt save the lives and increase the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people without harming anyone.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nBest,\nMyles","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13698","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Myles Cooney","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I recently found out about Kratom and used it as an aide to kicking a nasty drinking habit.

I am writing to urge the DEA to deschedule kratom so that it can resume its over-the-counter status.  I support descheduling kratom for the following reasons:\n\n1. Preventing further harms caused by the War on Drugs:  Over the past 4 decades, we've tried to control drug use in this country by criminalizing use. This has led to spending billions of dollars annually on what is now seen by many analysts as a failed US policy.  Furthermore, a recent report by the John Hopkins-Lancet Commission has concluded that policies stemming from the War on Drugs have increased the death rates of opiate users. http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2016/leading-global-health-commission-calls-for-reform-of-drug-policies-worldwide.html  Kratom is a substance used by many former opiate users as a harm-reduction measure.  What justifies us scheduling this substance if it means more dollars spent on enforcement and criminalization in the spirit of what is now considered by many to be a failed US policy? What further harms will occur to current kratom users if they are driven back to using opiates? Scheduling kratom is a step in the wrong direction.\n\n2. The harms of kratom are relatively low:  Kratom has been used as a natural supplement for centuries.  Toxicity is a rare event.  Abuse potential is low.  During this time, the clinics I've worked for have treated thousands of patients for various addictions, and I've only heard of 2 patients ever entering my program for problems related to kratom.  Both times it was complicated by a history of opiate dependence. For comparison, this number is close to the number of patients I've heard of in my clinic that presented with an \"addiction\" to ibuprofin. The DEA should research not only the base rate of harms associated with kratom use, but whether these harms outweigh the true and significant harms of criminalizing the use of this substance. I strongly believe the harms of criminalization far exceed the harms of kratom use. These harms include driving users to the illicit kratom market; driving users to return to using a more harmful substance: opiates; the harms caused by arrest, incarceration, and probation; and cost to the taxpayers for enforcement.\n\nAs a treatment provider who cares about the wellness and safety of drug users, I strongly urge you to deschedule kratom.  The relatively few harms caused by substance do not outweigh the significant harms that will result from scheduling this substance.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4604","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Clinical Psychologist","postedDate":"2016-11-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Josie Tracy, PhD","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm very upset in how this was done .

I'd like to comment on this Kratom issue. I work as a paramedic on the west coast and teach medical classes for the hospitals. I also suffer from a good amount of PTSD from having worked 7 yrs in Stockton and Oakland. The pharmaceutical approach would have me taking one of the benzodiazipines but I can't as it's one of the banned medications for the DOT and working on or driving and ambulance. Kratom has served as a wonderful substitute for me when I have anxiety periods. Benzodiazipines definitely work better but Kratom is my best alternative. Whereas I dont push any limits and take it on days I work, it helps on my off days so I can actually get some sleep, thus helping me function better while working in the 911 system. I know quite a few other coworkers that do the same. I'd really like you to reconsider banning Kratom and allow it to remain one of our options in the emergency medical field. We all have PTSD to some degree. Thank you for your time and consideration.

I became heavily addicted to various opiates for almost 5 years. Found help through replacement therapy being administered Suboxone. When it came time to end treatment I found it just as hard to come off of Suboxone as I felt from opiates. Weeks and weeks of terrible withdrawals with no end in sight that was so hard on me that I ended up staying on the Suboxone I was trying so hard to come off. Trying to keep up with work became extremely hard for me during this period and I am lucky I was able to make it. Came across information regarding kratom online and did some research. I went for it and switched from Suboxone to kratom and ultimately off of both. What I will tell you is that coming off the kratom completely was so much easier on my body and my mind. I am so thankful to have found kratom and what it did for me and my health. Please reconsider this ban as from everything we are seeing it is certainly helpful to many people on many levels from addiction treatment to pain management.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nWilliam Washburn","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22207","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Washburn","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nThis seems like a substance that requires m7ch more research before it's taken off the market.\n\nWe have 5 states that just legalized a drug that's been illegal for decades and still is, at the federal level.

I am not addicted and have no withdrawals when I stop taking the kratom.

I am not a drug addict and have never done street drugs of any kind. Kratom is safe, effective, has no side effects or withdrawals.

I'm 51, and a professional painter.  I do not think the DEA should ban Kratom because I believe it helps so many people who suffer with chronic pain, such as myself.  4 years ago I was diagnosed with Degenerative Disk Disease, Osteoarthritis, and Spondylitis in my low spine.  My condition is very painful. In an effort to put off surgery, I kept my weight down, exercised, had regular visits with a reputable chiropractor, as well as regular use of opiate painkillers prescribed by my doctor.  All of this is well documented in my medical records.  One year ago, I had to have ALIF surgery on my L5-S1 vertebrae because my condition worsened and the pain became intolerable.  6 months after surgery, I was able to stop taking the handful of daily opiate painkillers.  I experienced withdraw for a terrible week when I stopped.  After several good months, a new pain presented in my back that radiates down my legs.  While the surgery was considered successful, it appears that my L4-L5 disk has become a painful issue I now have to manage.  I was warned by my surgeon that this may happen.  I'm currently in as much pain as before my surgery and do NOT want to start taking the painkillers that gave me awful side affects and terrible withdraw.  I started Kratom last May.  I read about it online while researching 'opiate painkiller alternatives' and it manages my daily pain bringing it to a tolerable level.  I experience no side effects. I stop taking Kratom from time to time to gauge my pain.  I have never experienced withdraw as I did with hydrocodone.  The Kratom plant has given me relief and I'm able to perform the physical labor my job requires that I otherwise would not be able to do.  Please do not ban this wonderful plant.  Kratom helps me and I do NOT wish to return to addicting opiate painkillers and all their side-affects.

Other than speeding tickets, neither of us has broken the law in our 25 years of marriage. It was on a long car trip to a family member's memorial service that my son suggested my wife and I give Kratom a try for our pain incurred during the drive. Before that time neither of us heard of Kratom.\n\nMy wife suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis, Diabetes, Spinal Stenosis, ADD and Depression. I am a disabled veteran with Degenerative Disk Disease, Chronic Back Pain and Major Depression. My wife will not write a comment for fear of retaliation that is why I'm including her story. And hers, frankly, is more incredible than mine. You see all her doctors are amazed that she's not on disability herself.\n\nOn this car trip we looked online for a place near our hotel that sold Kratom. A store was located about 30 minutes away so we went there. The Kratom helped both my wife and my pain levels go down significantly. It also helped me feel more at ease around family we hadn't seen in years. This is how our introduction to Kratom began. \n\nMy wife takes 21 medications and had to clear taking Kratom with her various doctors. None of which had a problem with the addition of Kratom to her regimen. She is prescribed narcotics, but they are very tight with them and she refuses to take them at work. She augments her non-narcotic pain medication with Kratom so it doesn't effect here ability to do her job.\n\nI add Kratom to my medication regimen on particularly painful days when my medication doesn't quite do the trick. I'm not prescribed narcotics because I've had problems with them in the past and do I not want to have problems with them in the future. Kratom also helps me in the social areas where I have such a deficiency. Some people drink alcohol, well I do not. Kratom takes the edge off enough for me to relax when I need to be in a social setting. I loath social settings. \n\nKratom is a plant that we take to help with our pain and  help with anxiety. It is not a miracle, nor is it a drug. This controversy that has been created will change nothing in our eyes. When you outlaw it you will have created thousands of criminals out of ordinary taxpaying US citizens.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6503","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello. Thank you for withdrawing the emergency intent to classify kratom as a Schedule I substance. I am a 50 year old nurse (for 25 yrs), a mom and grandma. I also drink kratom tea for chronic pain. As I read through these comments, a couple of things stand out to me. \n\nFirst, an overwhelming majority of commentors have had positive effects from kratom, and in most cases, it greatly improved their quality of life in one way or another. For some, it actually played a part in saving lives, whether for those that are battling addiction, or are struggling with depression, or PTSD. For others, kratom allows people to live and enjoy their lives without debilitating chronic pain, or having to take opioid pain medications, which come with their own problems.\n\nSecondly, and most importantly, each and every person commenting is a real person. These are real people, living real lives, with real struggles that kratom helps them manage. They are not numbers, or a statistic. Each and every person's life is important, just like yours and mine are. \n\nThe average kratom user is over 30 years of age. Many are grandparents, like myself. Most are law abiding, productive citizens. They are going to work every day, paying taxes, raising their families, enjoying life with loved ones. These are not people looking to get high (because kratom does not get someone high). Many are actually using kratom to keep them AWAY from harmful, addictive substances. If kratom use produced a high, it would be much more popular than it is with people looking for that effect. It is not a substance of abuse. Kratom simply lifts mood and helps to provide an overall sense of well-being, making it useful for those dealing with depression. It is also useful to aid in opiate withdrawals. It helps keep cravings at bay, thus helping an addict work on recovery and sustain sobriety. Of course, being sober allows a recovering addict to reclaim their life and be a positive member of their community. It keeps them out of jail, out of the court system, out of the ER. All of those are costs to taxpayers. Most of all, kratom helps to keep people out of the grave from OD. \n\nKratom also helps in alleviating pain, allowing people with chronic pain to actually live a quality life. Waking up every day in terrible pain, unable to move, has a profound effect on how someone lives. They can't enjoy life like everyone else. They are limited at what they can do, and if they hurt every day, they can't really do much at all. You can't understand how hard it is to live with pain, until you have to. Pain can also lead to depression, which can be debilitating on its own. \n\nThis simple natural tea can give someone their life back. Why take that away, from even one person, let alone thousands (possibly millions)? By prohibiting or limiting access to this plant, you will be causing a severe negative impact on people's lives, real people. This will hurt individual people, and their familes. It will effect more people than you may realize. Please, reconsider taking away a natural remedy from good people that just want to live their lives the best they can. As you read these comments, understand that these are real lives you will be effecting. By allowing kratom to remain legal and accessible to adults, you will be helping people, and literally helping to save lives. Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12353","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"T K","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am an adult male in my mid-30s. I am married with 2 children and a third on the way. I am a certified teacher finishing a Masters degree in the spring in Education Administration. For about a year, I have been using kratom as an anxiolytic treatment to minimize the social anxiety I experience in large crowds and at social events. I have tried other pharmaceutical treatments such as Buspirone and Xanax with little success. Kratom, on the other hand, has been extremely useful in managing my anxiety in these situations. \nI began looking into treatments for my social anxiety once I became aware that social drinking had become a default self-medication strategy to address my social anxiety. For obvious reasons, I found alcohol to be a problematic approach to managing my anxiety because of the significant side-effects it presents, such as impaired motor function, impaired judgment, long term health risks, and withdrawal (hangover) effects. In my experience, kratom does not impair my motor function or judgment, nor does it carry any significant withdrawal effects. I would go so far as to say that kratom has been instrumental in helping me avoid alcohol use as a self-medicating strategy for social anxiety, and thus it has opened up for me the many benefits of an alcohol-free lifestyle. \nIn my experience, kratom does not have a high risk for abuse. In the last year, I have had no trouble limiting my use to no more than once or twice a week, and I have gone months at a time without using it. \nProhibiting my access to this substance would significantly lower the quality of life I've experienced while using it.

I'm 22 years old and I professionally cook in restaurants in NYC. I have been using kratom on a daily basis for a little less than a year now, and I would like to share some of the impact that this plant has had on my day to day life. I work long irregular hours on my feet, in a very hot environment, doing work that is prone to injury and heavy lifting. I believe. People deal with physically taxing activities differently. I'm not someone who will take the vicodin that my doctor recommended for my knee, as painkillers have caused a dependency problem for me in the past. Im not someone who takes Advil or Tylenol. From injuries to the physical ache of waking early in the morning after working late the night before, kratom gives me a truly unique relief of pain and physical peace that I deserve as a human being. \n\nSecondly, I don't drink coffee. I've had problems with insomnia since high school. And while I do enjoy the energy and increased output from coffee, I will definitely have trouble sleeping early that night. A fast strain does the same thing as coffee for me, without the catch. Moreover, slow strains will help me sleep. Finally, there are mental, psychological effects from kratom. They are by no means debilitating, nor would I even describe it as a \"high\". But through exploring strains, I have seen the motivation of coffee, even enough to exercise at times. I've seen the creative calmness of strong Asian teas, relief of stress and anxiety, even stage fright. As a young man, there is a storm going on in my mind, between subsiding hormones and the first responsibilities  of adulthood. As a person, I'll always pursue the chance to \"make the noise stop\". What about people that don't drink alcohol, or live in states that still outlaw marijuana? I believe that people should at least be free to at least pursue natural means to relieve whatever ailments life may have.\n\nI will conclude by urging the DEA to step up in regulation of quality. I believe that extracts should be regulated more carefully. As a daily kratom user, I steer clear of any extracts. I believe they are much more likely to cause issues with dependency. I believe that kratom in alot of headshops or tobacco shops (the ones that are packaged like they came from the same company that makes k-2) is often low quality and sometimes dangerous. I have only used high quality product from a trusted vendor. I take controlled doses at controlled intervals and have a 7 day rotation of strains (mainly to prevent an increase in tolerance). In doing so, I have taken kratom every day for many months now, with only good things to say. Kratom is not dangerous. Starbucks gives me more negative side effects than kratom. Many people that properly use kratom see that, and it creates a justified frustration that the DEA have priorities that don't have much to do with protecting the people. But I believe that the issue was a lack of understanding for the plant and the people who use it. I do hope you see kratom from a different perspective this time around. Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12858","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Calvin Fletcher","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W\n\nI am writing to you today to voice my concern over the potential scheduling of Kratom.\n\nI am a responsible Kratom user for about 2 years now, and currently use it a few times per day to help me deal with my difficult mental and physical symptoms.  During my life I have been diagnosted with depression, PTSD, and fybromyalgia.  Kratom tea helps me deal with the symptoms of these conditions, and scheduling it would absolutely have a detrimental effect on my personal well being.\n\nThroughout my life I have been through the full cycle of doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, and have been prescribed all types of medication for depression and pain management.  The side effects of these medications are too extreme for me to be comfortable with taking them on a regular basis, and being physically or chemically dependent on them is not a solution that I consider rational or sustainable.  Since taking Kratom I have stopped drinking alcohol completely, and have not had the desire to use any synthetic drugs at all.\n\nEven if I was not a personal user, I would be opposed to it being scheduled.  It is currently and for the foreseeable future legal in Canada and Mexico.  Scheduling it here will just create another black market for the cartels in Mexico, and organized crime like the Hells Angels in Canada.  The hundreds of thousands of people that use Kratom responsibly will still want it even if it becomes restricted.  If the leaf itself is difficult to import, the home made extract business will thrive in its place.  This type of product would just serve to further deregulate what is currently a healthy, self-regulating market.\n\nScheduling it will also effectively cancel current research on it.  If it can be shown to be effective at treating drug addiction or depression, it could save countless lives across the country.  It is definitely worth looking into considering there is a growing opioid epidemic.  Banning a healthy and safe alternative to classic opioid medications is only going to lead to more deaths and abuse of synthetic opioids, which nobody wants.\n\nThank you for reading my thoughts.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10812","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please study the effects of Kratom before banning in any way.

I am an assistant manager at a local convenience store. Kratom should not be placed under any scheduling, but definitely not under the same scheduling as heroin. I first started using kratom about 9 months ago. A friend of mine introduced it to me. I struggle with constant back pain and my friend suggested I try kratom because it helps her persivere through her constant back pain as well. Kratom has helped me in a number of ways. First and foremost, I have terrible back pain and kratom allows me to make it through my 10 hour work days in less pain than I've ever been in. I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder as well as an anxiety disorder which involves debilitating panic attacks. In the past 9 months I have only had 1 panic attack. Prior to 9 months ago, I was having panic attacks almost twice a week which led me to miss a lot of work days and lay in my bed for hours on end. It should remain available to me because I have seen much improvement in my back pain, anxiety and depression. Lastly, it helps me fall asleep and stay asleep. Before kratom, I was sleeping an at most amount of 5 hours per night. During those 5 hours I was waking up constantly and not getting a good night's sleep. In conclusion, my circumstances are not the only circumstances in which kratom has been a positive influence on the quality of life. There are 10,000 or more people that belong to the kratom facebook group who all have similar stores as mine. So please, keep kratom available for the sake of our quality of life. I've never had a bad experience with kratom and I can say that I never will.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9823","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ashley Plasterer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a stay at home mother of 3...I am a wife, mother, sister, daughter. I am able to be successful at all these because I have found kratom. It in no way is the cure for any of my ailments, however, kratom has tremendously helped me. Before discovering kratom I would lay in bed, it was difficult to take care of my husband & children, it was actually a chore rather than the blessing that they are. I was a shell of myself, on prescription medications that would temporarily relieve some issues, but leave me foggy, extremely irritable and just not myself. I ended up getting depressed. I am a pastor's wife, so really there is no time to be depressed. There was no time to be in bed just because I didn't feel good. I desperately needed a change, and by the grace of God I found kratom. This leaf has given me a new life, given my husband back his wife, my children back their mother! I ask that you please carefully consider everyone who opposes this ban's comments. This is not a \"drug\" that gets you high, this is simply an alternative to actual drugs in which I and so many others want nothing to do with anymore. Please hear us out, kratom alone can not kill you by overdosing such as countless prescription medications that are deemed safe. Kratom has helped me tremendously, and I'm thankful to God everyday that he led me to discover this.

I'd never heard of it, but the more I researched, the more I thought I'd give it a shot to see if it could help my wife and I out. After a bit more research on the effects and to find a reputable vendor, I bought some. It only took about a month and a half to two months, once we found a helpful vendor and a brief learning curve on making capsules, and habit changes and slow tapering-- we were able to finally kick a nearly six year painkiller addiction. I don't know many people who have had a problem with painkillers or opiates that do not want to kick the habit. It's a difficult thing to do, and I can honestly say that kratom was a godsend in that it finally  allowed us to get over that hump that we'd been trying for years to do without the agony of cold turkey withdrawals which, having tried before, left me nearly suicidal and in agony for days until I finally gave in and found more pills. Having gone through that, I can understand why some people are so desperate to try and move on to things like heroin. Luckily I we never reached that point and I'm not sure we could have done so without the support of others and the help of kratom. We've since stopped using kratom, except occasionally when I need a bit of relief from  a nagging lower back problem...but not more than a cup of tea or a couple of capsules. It can be addictive- but I assure you it is nothing like the stranglehold of opiate painkillers had on us for so many years. Please consider something a little less severe than a schedule I classification. There is immense benefit to this product if used responsibly,  in a manner similar to wine, or other regulated but legal products.

I have chronic pain due to injuries to both knees anf plantar fasciitis, and only wanted relief, without feeling doped up. In going along with the treatment our current system provides left me with either little to no relief, or depending on opioids. After deciding i didnt want to be nodding off and feeling dopey anymore, i stopped the opioids, and was surprised to find myself going through ugly withdrawals. I searched for a remedy for the withdrawals, and came across information about Kratom. I promptly purchased some, took a small amount, and within 15 mins, the discomfort of the withdrawals was GONE. Not only that, but the pain was more effectively dulled than with the painkillers i had been on, AND i didn't feel dopey! I have continued to take kratom twice a day since then, and i've seen a huge improvement in my quality of life. I have also seen improvements in other areas.just before i began taking kratom, i had gone to see my doctor and he took blood. He said that i was pre-diabetic, triglycerides were a bit elevated, and my blood pressure was getting high. Since then, whether it is directly because of the Kratom, or the changes in my behavior that Kratom has allowed, all of those things have normalized, and i am no longer pre diabetic. It's amazing.\n\n6 months ago, my 76 year old father in law broke his hip and came to live with my wife and i and our family. He was badly injured in Desert Storm by an IED, and has nerve damage from chemical weapons used at the time, and he has chronic pain as well. He was addicted to Oxycodone when he moved here, and had been for years. I suggested he try Kratom, and when he did,  he was so moved by the effectiveness of the plant, that he poured his over 60 Oxycodone pills down the toilet and swore them off. We had been in fear that he was succumbing to alzheimer's due to his lack of recall and confusion. Since beginning kratom, done a 180 in terms of cognition and mobility. \n\nOutlawing kratom would have devestating effects on my whole family, as i have four daughters that have seen their dad be much more active and hands on with them. In fact, when my 8 year old sees me limping or in pain, she asks me...\"daddy..did you take your Kratom???\"...as she can see the clear improvement when i do. \n\nPlease consider my family and my veteran father in law when considering banning this supplement. \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22917","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Urias","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has changed my life for the better in multiple ways.

My career for the past 31 years has been in the mental health field.  For the last few years, I have successfully treated pain and fatigue with kratom. Diagnosed with Lupus, Sjogren's Syndrome and Celiac, all within a short time, I followed all doctor recommendations to treat the horrific symptoms of my auto-immune diseases. By the time I was introduced to kratom, I was taking 18-28 pills a day, had attended close to 60 appointments and had 8 procedures done since being diagnosed. After all of this, I had no real improvement. Consistently, I was in a great degree of achy, diffuse pain. Consistently, I was so very tired that I felt as if I was wearing a lead suit.  I missed work a lot. I slept a lot. I cancelled so many plans in the first year after diagnosis that I stopped making plans. I became reclusive. My family was so concerned for me. At work, I applied for FMLA because I was in danger of loosing my job. One day I was reading in one of my Lupus groups about a women who takes kratom to ease the same symptoms that I was suffering from. She described drinking kratom tea a few times a day and talked about the improvement she was experiencing. I decided to try it. I am so glad that I did. I read a lot of information before coming to the decision. The first time that I drank kratom tea, I slept through the night without waking up to take pain medicine. Within 3 days I had completely stopped all pain medication and analgesics. I stopped missing work, I even let the FMLA lapse because I didn't need it. I started making plans with my family and friends. I rarely cancel plans anymore. My life is significantly better and it is due, in great part, to kratom. I feel that making kratom unavailable to people like me would be tragic.  I want to live and function normally and I have found a way to do that. I am opposed to making kratom a scheduled 'drug.' I would like to see kratom become a dietary supplement, as it is most often ingested in a tea.

Iam a stay at home mom right now and i  have been using kratom for over 2 years. My reasons for having first starting to use kratom was simply because i was tired of using anti depressants that did not work and only worsen my problems. I have also found that it helps the pain i have in my lower back and both knees. Ive never had anything that has worked for me and i especially don't like taking any kind of opiate, since in my younger years i struggled with addiction to  heroin and pills. I have also had an hard and long battle with alcoholism. Kratom has given me back the will and motivation to  be the person iam today; to get through the little petty things that seem to catch you at your worst, im able to fight through it. I can be the mother my children deserve,  the affectionate and caring fiance, the older sister who you can look up to and a daughter my parents can be proud of. Im not saying in any way that kratom is a cure or a fix for your problems, but it has definitely helped me to face situations i wouldn't normally be able to handle or get through the rough patches that come with acheiving sobriety. Im a better person today because of the help i get from kratom, it is not a drug, it is not a legal high, it is a leaf  given to us from our mother earth. It is my miracle plant. It is a tree of life that saved mine, i truly believe that. I have seen it help numerous people iam close to and love, if they hadn't discovered this i don't know what would have happened to them or if they would still be alive. I only wish we knew about this plant sooner, maybe hundreds or thousands would still be here today. Iam asking that you please not ban kratom, i promise you it is not a new destructive drug that just popped out of no where like most of what we see now. it has done so much good for me, my family and thousands of others. Just look into your hearts and ask yourselves, given everything you have come to discover about this plant, if it really is worth putting the lives of americans at risk.

My entire experience with alcohol, a legal drug, has led me to the conclusion that it is one of the most dangerous substances known to humanity yet there are no legal restrictions (except age) placed on its availability. Kratom, on the other hand is a naturally occurring substance, that unlike alcohol, and according to my research has NEVER led to death, disability, fatal motor vehicle accidents or loss of income.\n\nI live in Ohio, the state with the highest opioid mortality rate in the country. Kratom provides a safe, gentle alternative to opioids. I strongly suspect that the pharmaceutical industry is lobbying for making it a Schedule 1 controlled substance because I see no objective rationale for this decision. \n\nI have used Kratom to combat fatigue and pain. It induces a very mild euphoric state, that is enough of an energy boost to allow me to exercise on a daily basis. I have chronic stomach pain, shoulder pain and anxiety. Ingesting less than a teaspoon of Kratom allows me to ride my bicycle and hike. It has been very hard to keep active and fit while battling the pain and exhaustion  that the above-mentioned conditions cause.

It is natural and does not cause me to be dependent on opiates anymore. It is not an opiate.  Please do not ban a natural substance. It should be studied and regulated,  not banned. Please realize that many people will be able to get off addictive drugs with this product. Please do not schedule it as the same level as dangerous drugs. It is a tea,  in the coffee family.

For those unaware, this disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes frequent (8-12x/day), bloody diarrhea during flares. This disease exists in broader class known as Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and includes Crohn's Disease.  \n\nI started taking the current state-of-the-art medications (5-ASA derivitives) to control this illness, but unfortunately, I am one of those who suffer from a severe side effect, known as recurrent pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart). To counter this, I was prescribed immuno-suppressants and corticosteroids. Both of these drugs are known for not only their severe risks and side-effects, but also for the strong resistance that the body develops for them.   \n\nIt was around this time that I found Kratom. Kratom is an interesting herb for Ulcerative Colitis and other IBD diseases because, at least for me, it performs two miracles: it helps to prevent diarrhea during flares and it has incredible anti-inflammatory effects.   Many of the immediate effects of Kratom wear off within 6-10 hours  the effects that people talk about, like the mood-lift. The anti-inflammatory effects, however, appear to linger for 3-4 days! \n\nAlong with some other alternative treatments, I believe Kratom has dramatically reduced the inflammation caused by this disease. I have been using Kratom for almost two years, twice weekly, using roughly 6 grams of dried leaf material made into a tea.  \n\nA kratom ban would be a great loss for myself, and I assume many others, who use this herb for this purpose. Those who have this condition are contraindicated from using typical anti-inflammatory medications such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen, as these NSAIDs worsen our diseases by causing ulcerations and bleeding within the GI tract. We dont have a lot of other options!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11501","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tyler Landis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a recovering opiate addict . I have been clean for three years. I was injured on the job and was on workers compensation for three years and was put on OxyContin. I was on heavy duty pain medication for years. That ultimately lead me to herion .After a near fatal overdose of fentanyl laced heroin I still couldn't stop using because the withdrawals were so bad for so long and I was in constant pain from my injuries years earlier. I didn't want to take suboxsone or methadone I wanted to not be a slave to the opiates. I did some online research and discovered kratom. I was open to try it and did. It didn't completely take the withdrawal symptoms away but made them tolerable. I successfully beat my heroin addiction and opiate addiction with kratom.  I take kratom daily. It helps manage my pain from a hernia that I have had surgery on and now have a second hernia. I have herniated disks in my upper back and have chronic pain. With kratom I have no horrible withdrawals if I don't take it. It keeps me from needing opiate pain medicine. It's a great product and is far different from illegal drugs.  No one is out robbing pharmacies or breaking into people's homes to obtain kratom. If kratom is banned there will be an increase in people seeking opiates and is going to worsen the opiate epidemic we are facing today.

I have worked as Greenskeeper at a golf course for the last 27 years. It is a physical and demanding job, involving long hours and very early morning starts.  Kratom helps me cope with the symptoms of my Lyme Disease like nothing else can. My Lyme Disease symptoms include multiple swollen painful joints, and debilitating fatigue. This comes in what I call flares, they can last 2 weeks to a month. Kratom allows me to keep working and lessens the symptoms. I am unable to take most Rx or OTC meds as I have a severe pork allergy, and most of those pills contain pork derived ingredients like magnesium stearate, stearic acid or come in a gelatin capsule. So that really limits my options for pain relief. Liquid formulations for pain relievers are usually not covered by my health insurance. So my options are limited again, unless I want to pay out of pocket. Kratom works better and is more affordable. I take it as needed during flares, and I have found it to be non habit forming.  Please do not make this a Schedule 1 drug.  It does have medicinal value and has no potential for abuse in my experience.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2883","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Douglas Evan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, \nAs much as I enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning, I enjoy a cup of Kratom tea in the evening to relax.

I discovered kratom roughly five years ago at the recommendation of a friend.  I've been using it regularly since then and it has given me a new lease on life.  Although it tastes awful, it helps give me energy and focus throughout my day and takes away all of my usual aches and pains that prevented me from living an active, full lifestyle.  I used to get terrible malaise and anxiety-- I would hole myself up at home and feel like I wanted to pass out whenever I was in public, but since I started taking kratom, I've felt much more at ease. I'm able to get out of bed every day and go live life.  I can't say enough how much this simple, safe plant has improved my way of life.\n\nWhile I've been using kratom, I've recommended it to several of my friends and family members, and they have all started using it, too-- some of them have even given up using opioids for their pain since they no longer feel like they need to take them.  Others have even been able to stop abusing pills/heroin or living stuck on suboxone.  It's truly miraculous. My city is completely overrun by this heroin epidemic...I've had many friends die as a direct result of opiate overdose...to see, not just one or two, but several friends/acquaintances stop taking these harmful drugs and be able to get their lives together is one of the happiest things I have ever witnessed.  This plant is miraculous.  I've seen studies that suggest it's nearly impossible for people to abuse kratom, and even if they manage to take such a large quantity, they won't die like they would on heroin.  This plant absolutely needs to be researched! Our country has been completely swallowed by opiates/opioids, and right here we have a possible solution that isn't jsut as harmful and addictive as the medicines we currently use!  Not one person I know that has been put onto a methadone/suboxone treatment has managed to get clean successfully. They spend thousands of dollars (or taxpayer dollars) taking these drugs (which, quite frankly, are even worse than heroin itself in some ways) for years before finally going back out and getting high again.  Each and every one of them falls off the bandwagon-- they can't afford to continue treatment, they aren't tapered off correctly by shady doctors....but with kratom, that just doesn't happen.  It's incredibly cheap. It's very effective. It doesn't get them high.  They don't get cravings and they don't go back out into the streets looking to score.\n\nI'm sorry that I can't provide anything more than anecdotal evidence for my claims.  However, seeing the people around me that I love being able to be freed from their awful addictions is all the evidence I'll ever need to believe that kratom needs to be researched thoroughly and made widely available.  The DEA wants to place it under Schedule I, making research extremely difficult.  Even if it is only for a few years, how many more people will die in the streets that could have been saved for $50? The DEA should be protecting people from things like heroin and promoting kratom as a way to get back on your feet and get your life together.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16606","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Myers","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep this plant legal.

We do not know, as you state, that these are the main psychoactive constituents of kratom. In order for this statement to be correct, all components of kratom must be isolated and tested separately and in various combinations; which has not been done.  The leaf contains a unique mixture of compounds that could have important medical value for the following reasons:\n\n1)\tThe leaf appears to have efficacy in ameliorating opioid withdrawal. There must be other compounds in the leaf, not yet identified, that participate in this effect otherwise we could simply mix the 2 opioids therein and produce the same effects on withdrawal. This has never been done.\n2)\tA neuroscience colleague of mine takes the leaf for depression; a very difficult disease to manage. Studies are needed to explore the role of the leaf in depression as it is unlikely that the alkaloids themselves are producing this effect.\n3)\tI have an anxiety disorder and tried the leaf to see if it would be of value for me. While I did get a brief feeling of euphoria for a minute or two on the first dose, this has not happened again. It does not appear to control my primary disorder. \n4)\tHowever, what I did find is that it has appetite suppressant value for me. I am at risk for type II diabetes and I take it on weekends when I am most likely to overeat. Along with dietary restrictions of simple sugars and light exercise, in just a month I lost 13 pounds and will take the leaf to drop another 10 pounds so that I am no longer classified obese which is the primary risk factor for type II diabetes.\n\nIt is my view that the small amount of alkaloids in kratom leafs do not explain the above noted and many other medically relevant effects reported by others. I should note that my usage level does not produce addiction as I have no withdrawal symptoms when I stop using it. \n\nI request that you hold off scheduling the alkaloids in kratom for at least 3-5 years so that the full benefits of this leaf can be explored both by users and the scientific community. There appear to be unidentified compounds beyond the opioids that are either independently active or interact with the small amounts of these specific alkaloids to produce valuable mental affects. I for one will soon no longer be at risk for diabetes; a disease that is having devastating effects in the U.K. according to current reports.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7002","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brent Vogt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a  20+ year sufferer of a chronic pain and fatigue, I have been on pain medicine from my physician until I found Kratom.

Kratom, mitragyna speciosa in my experiences, can assist in a much gentler toll, so gentle in fact it is not readily apparent. \nWith 18,893 overdose deaths related to prescription pain relievers, and 10,574 overdose deaths related to heroin in 2014, if the trend was flat it would still be vastly too high.  A large number of kratom proponents share with us they have used this plant to kick prescription and heroin addictions, and stay off. Why remove a simple, safe herbal medicine that can assist with whatever these issues are, and research the plant instead? For example, aspirin, was based off a compound found in willow trees, to name one among thousands of plant inspired medicines.\nAs someone that has had a long and beneficial relationship with kratom, I would just like to stay I hope it stays free for us to choose this natural medicine, and learn as much as we can about it.  I believe these actions held by both parties signifies this as a just action. Thank you for using reason and for respecting the will of the people, regardless of your own inhibitions on the subject.

I'm a 30 year old, 4th grade school teacher. Since attending middle school, I have lacked the energy to be engaged with other people. There seemed to be a million thoughts in my head, and yet my action-taking-tank was always on E. \nThrough my family's financial help, I made it through a great college, graduating with Dean's List honors every semester. I fit right into the nose-to-the-grindstone lifestyle that getting good grades required of me. Following my graduation, I was left feeling more \"blah\" and seemed prevented from moving toward fulfilling relationships, even casual friendships. This was felt as a tension throughout my face and body,  the kind after you've been trying to hold back from breaking down and crying. Tears seemed to prick at my eyes just from passing too close to strangers. \nFast forward to today. I am lucid as if I've just woken from my best sleep. I've come back from my school. I wake up at 4AM these days, even on weekends. I start with a 20 minute meditation, before waking up with a cold shower. I'm then caught between renovating the bottom floor of my house to rent on AirBnB, and preparing lesson plans for my beloved students. \nI would not have gotten here without Kratom. I was deeply discouraged with my overwhelming tension with other humans. I read a book called \"The Mood Cure\" and thereafter began taking amino acids that started helping for a short while. I then searched the internet for long term paths to living comfortably in my own skin. I began taking Kratom after seeing its reviews for making people feel \"like themselves\" without feeling \"high.\"\nTaking Kratom for the first few times allowed me to go grocery shopping wearing my real face without a scowl. It was like discovering that I had been walking through my whole life with thumbtacks in my shoes that I could now simply remove whenever I needed. \nKnowing that I can use Kratom in a pinch, I feel nourished, and safe, and eager to connect with my students, new friends, and even go on dates. Monday through Friday I experience hundreds of children wriggle by me, and I'm smiling just thinking about them now. I'm getting shout-outs for caring about the students from parents and admin. This is an attribute that I never would have possessed before discovering there was a supplement that existed like Kratom.\nKratom clears my mind and makes the daily routine become infused with a sense of curiosity. I've gone months without it. It does not make me want more. It's just great knowing that if I am facing a class of 20 special-needs children, I can be myself no matter what (literally) hits me. It is like a 4 hour sense of \"I can't wait to try what comes next!\" \nI've shared this Kratom with other teachers. The responses have been so positive, always something along the lines of, \"I've had anxiety all my life. I really felt like this helped.\" \nPlease consider allowing Kratom to continue retaining its current status. The banning of Kratom would be a wound to so many of us moving forward in wellness.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19546","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Galen Goble","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom. There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20668","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Davis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I see the pictures of parents overdosed with their kids in the back of the car or in the shopping cart; horrifying photos of people and their families being destroyed by opioid addiction.

Studies show that kratom's side-effects are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are minor when compared to those of opioid withdrawal.

I found that kratom has been instrumental in me being able to rejoin the work force as this leaf of a tree has helped me immensely in dealing with not only my crippling depression and anxiety- but the associated fatigue and also by helping to alleviate the pain associated with a severe back injury I obtained in 2009; without the use of highly addictive, synthetic opiates. \n\nIn fact I used to abuse opiates of all kinds- starting with those produced by big pharma and later heroin. But kratom has assisted me in maintaining my sobriety for almost 3 years now when no other treatment was successful. \n\nThere's a lot of propaganda being spread around, things like 15 deaths associated with kratom in the last couple years. But these deaths were the result of poly-drug use and not a single one through the sole ingestion of kratom. In fact I can assure you that far MORE lives are saved through using this natural substance to rid themselves of their life-destroying addictions to opiates our own government helped to create. It is also claimed there is no known medical benefit when there is clear anecdotal there is, yet the DEA wants to schedule the active alkaloids before even allowing for any proper scientific inquiry in to the topic- something that will be impossible to do with Schedule I rating- this is complete and utter hypocrisy at it's worst.\n\nNot to mention that the DEA is a government agency whom represent the will of the people and the people have clearly spoken here that they do not want this. \n\nIn summary years of life destroying mental and physical ailments that I have suffered are, for the first time in my 30 years on this planet- able to be handled by me on a day to day basis because of an herb that's been used safely for millennia by native peoples of the south pacific.

Numerous times over that 8 year period I had tried everything from methadone, suboxone, or cold turkey to get off the pills and continuously circled back around, eventually, back to opiates.  It's a miserable life and a miserable way to live but the power of that opiate addiction truly cannot be understood unless you yourself are in those shoes.  I see stories all the time about how bad the heroin problem is getting and about all the people dying or overdosing constantly because of the epidemic and it's a constant reminder to me that it could have been me in that latest article, dead from another overdose.  Just another statistic.  When you are on opiates though none of that matters to you because of the power the addiction brings.  And with it being such a miserable way to live you just tell yourself \"if I die then maybe that's a good thing.\"  I think we both can agree that that's not a normal way of thinking and also is a tragedy that it's how most people who are under the grip of an opiate addiction feel.  \n\n     Now like I said before I had tried everything before to get off opiates and just kept circling back to them like 90%+ of other opiate addicts.  I really believe there was a combination of things that would bring me back around, but what I realize today is that I had to be ready myself to quit first, but also that the medications such as Methadone and Suboxone made me feel horrible.  Plus all those medications did was switch habits for me and they were not any cheaper than opiates.  Every time I tried to get off of those medications the withdraws from those medications were even more unbearable so I would just go back to opiates again.  Now with Kratom I was skeptical that it was going to help me get off opiates but after trying everything else I really had nothing to lose.  Well that skepticism quickly turned into optimism, which then turned into life saving.  HOW I had never heard about Kratom before, for so many years, just befuddles me because of how effective it has been for me and as well as others I have read about.  I cannot stress to you enough about how much of a life saver it has been for me.  I have not taken any opiates for about 2 plus months and what's different about it this time is that I don't have an urge to seek out opiates and kratom has really made me feel like myself again.  I feel like a normal person again and feel like I can contribute to society again like I had always wanted to do.  Another thing is that the kratom does not give me some type of high where I want to take it all day everyday and is now my new monster.  I take it once a day, in the morning, and that's sufficient enough until the next day.  I have more energy now and am not lethargic like I was ALL the time with opiates.  My depression has gone down as well and I'm not having problems sleeping anymore like I had been since I started taking opiates.  \n\n     So to whoever is reading this I urge you to please not only keep kratom legal and available, but to also have some studies done on kratom.  It just blows my mind that rehab centers across the country as well as doctors are not recommending kratom to opiate addicts to quit opiates.  I feel like there is so much more to learn about kratom and that everyone needs to be aware of how effective it can be for opiate addicts like myself and others.  There are way too many people dying in this country from the opiate epidemic and if we are going to be honest about it, the way that our doctors and rehab centers across the country are trying to fight this epidemic has been a losing effort.  Why are 90%+ addicts going back to opiates?  Obviously because the treatment methods being used today are having almost zero effect.  I feel like I really have a chance not only to stay off opiates but to actually live the life I always wanted to live and strived to live all because of kratom.  I've never felt that way since becoming addicted to opiates and I really feel like if kratom was banned I would never feel that way again.  Thanks you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1548","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"DEA is joke!

I was introduced to Kratom at the beginning of this year (2016) and have been taking it ever since. I have struggled with being addicted to different things for the last 12 years. I had the most difficult time staying away from pills, heroin and meth especially. I would be clean for a little while, but always ended up relapsing. Since I've been taking Kratom, I have been able to stay clean for the past 9 months. I have also been able to maintain a positive attitude, have had steady employment and have had less anxiety and depression. Those are things that ultimately led me back to using in the past. Taking a little bit of Kratom in the morning and at night keeps me in a good state of mind. It also helps me get a little boost in the morning. I've never been so successful in all my life and I know Kratom plays a role in my motivation each day. Could I live without Kratom? If it is banned, I will have to..I don't feel I am dependant on it, but I do believe i owe it some credit for the way I live my life now. I would really hope this matter is closely looked at and banning it is reconsidered. Kratom not only helps me, but it helps others in my life who have depression, chronic pain, PTSD and substance abuse issues.

Kratom has supplemented my health so that I can perform my duties as a 49 year old mother of 4, wife, business owner and student. I am studying to become an aromatherapist and herbalist because I have experienced benefits derived from the plants and trees that God gave humanity. \n\nIn the past decade, I have taken prescription medicine to prevent migraines (Propranolol), survive daily stressors (Celexa, 2 years) and relieve pain from sciatica, degenerative disc disease and severe spinal stenosis (Neurontin, Norco, Flexeril). I was having side effects like not being able to wake up in the morning and memory deficiencies (including not being able to recall basic words). I did have back surgery that took away pain radiating down my legs but gave me permanent nerve damage which is also painful. For many years, I visited my PCP, specialists, surgeons and followed their directions to a \"T\", taking the prescriptions as prescribed. I was still miserable. The prescriptions either didn't work (in which case my doctor would try another one that had the same results) or there were unwanted side effects. After much research, I found a product that contains butterbur, vitimin B and ginger to use as a migraine preventative. I found that by using this product, my migraines decreased by 90% which gave me part of my life back. I also found that a mixture of kratom, ginger, turmeric and cayenne pepper enhances my ability to move around and go about my productive day without the need for any of the medicines prescribed for my back issues. My memory has mostly returned and I no longer need at least nine hours of sleep. The changes I made, independent of the physicians I saw for 7 minutes a visit, have improved my life and productivity immensely. \n\nAs an herbalist in training, I have learned that the multitude of components in plants, i.e. the whole plant, work together synergistically with other plants to bring our body back to it's natural, non diseased state, when taken appropriately.  There are usually a small number of components in a plant that can be proven to \"work\" in some action, but when they are separated and concentrated, they end up having side effects. We NEED the whole plant that includes ALL the components for it to be reasonably safe and effective for our wellness goals. Kratom is a tree that I have found safe for me, without unwanted side effects. I have been using it for 5+ years. I have an annual physical and blood test every year that confirms this. \n\nPlease do not regulate nor schedule kratom for adult use! I have not been able to find any data that this God given tree has killed even a handful of people independent of other drugs. I'm just not seeing the danger that would warrant any type of scheduling. If addiction is a concern, why are cigarettes, alcohol and coffee available? I have not personally had any type of withdrawal symptoms when I didn't ingest kratom. Weaning off Neurontin was much more difficult. In my life, I can choose to have children, buy a gun or travel on every continent but I need permission to drink kratom tea? Is this still the United States of America; the land of the free?  If you want millions of kratom using adults to be productive and pay their taxes, leave kratom alone.

After rigorous testing, it was determined she had a disease called Transverse Mitalis, and possibly MS. She was told she may never walk again. The medicines her doctors put her on were not only addictive, but the side effects were so terrible that she could not function and be a mother to her 7 children. \nShe did some research, and was able to find KRATOM - a very safe and effective natural supplement, which has been the only thing she can take to manage her chronic pain and allow her to function. \nFollowing this experience, I became a sales rep for a company that sales Kratom. In the three year I have worked for this company I have heard hundreds of stories about people effectively and safely using kratom to manage pain, stop seizures, help with migraines, relax muscles, and possibly the most compelling - to get off harmful addictions from prescription drugs.\nKratom attaches to the same receptors in the brain as opiates, giving a sense of relaxation and pain relief. However, unlike opiates, you cannot overdose on kratom, it is VERY mildly addictive (as opposed to opiates which are incredibly addictive), and there are no serious side effects. In fact, the biggest side effect is nausea - which is a blessing - because it works as a natural regulator. If you take too much kratom for your system, you will simply throw it up. \nI have NEVER heard a story of anyone overdosing, going to the hospital, or dying from kratom use alone (Following the DEA intent to ban I read some reports, but in each case there were other unsafe DRUGS - not herbal supplements - in their system). \nI am not a regular user of kratom, but have tried it and find it to be a safe and effect natural supplement.  I would like to add my voice to the millions of people who use it every day.  This is NOT a dangerous drug. A ban on kratom would cause more harm than good - forcing people to go back to legal yet far more addictive drugs, creating an underground market where anything could be labeled and sold under the kratom name, and I fear ultimately causing hundreds and possibly thousands of deaths. \nI'm asking the DEA to permanently reverse the ban on kratom. In a country where opiates and other prescription drug addictions are at an all-time high, kratom is NOT the problem, it is a solution to the problem.  \nSincerely, \nEmily \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0099","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Emily J","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it may concern,\nI am writing share my support for kratom tea.

I have used Kratom for several years now.  The role of Kratom in my life is of extraordinary importance to me.\n\nDuring 1983, I began experience unusual agitation in the nerves and muscles of my legs.  It is very difficult to describe, but what I can tell you is that it is an insidious, torturous symptom that makes sleep impossible, and causes me great anxiety and agitation during the day.  Over time, this condition spread to my forearms.  I have worked closely with my physician of 40+ years, and we have yet to find anything that will stop and control the symptoms.  The condition does not have a name and has otherwise remained undiagnosed.\n\nI was introduced to Kratom by a family member who also suffers from similar, random nerve/muscle attacks.  I began to experiment with commercially prepared Kratom strains from a U.S. company.  I prepared teas, tinctures and also tried a teaspoon of the powder with water.\n\nAfter years of suffering from this quiet torture, I quickly found out that certain strains of Kratom are able to stop my horrible symptoms within 15-20 minutes!   This has been life changing for me.  The other benefit of Kratom as an alternative remedy is that it does not impact my judgment, motor skills or overall mood in any way.  It simply and powerfully mitigates my symptoms.\n\nIt is unimaginable to me that anyone would want me to return to a life of physical unrest, agitation and anxiety.  I am a good, productive and law abiding citizen who simply desires to maintain the excellent quality of life that I have because I have access to Kratom.\n\nI would gladly discuss this with you in person, particularly to try to describe the symptoms of my condition without access to Kratom.  Please, please give careful consideration to my story and to the stories of the many other beneficiaries of the properties of Kratom.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMark Winfield Poulton, age 61","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10035","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Poulton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern,\n\nI believe before any action is taken on 'Kratom' we should be performing more testing.

I was put on heavy pain meds in the hospital and was prescribed equally potent opiat painkiller medication during and after recovery. I became physically dependent on the medication after being on them for so long and decided to seek counseling and plan to taper the medication and use ibuprofen for my knees. The ibuprofen or any NSAi drug failed to adequately subdue the pain from the permanent damage to my knees so my doctor shifted my treatment to subutex in order to ween my way down. After being on subutex for a couple years I decided to ween my way off of that drug because of the cloudy feeling it produced. I used Kratom help with the withdrawals and depression while seeking posative reinforcement from my counselor and started rebuilding my life to what it is now. I couldn't do it without kratom to help transition from the subutex to only Tylenol now.

After a particularly trying year when I had to quit my job to take care of my 79 year old mom after she became ill, l turned to my doctor to try a few things. That's something I've never done, but I was kind of desperate. What he gave me didn't work, or made me feel worse, especially the antidepressants. I tried two different kinds, and I ended up with migraines, which I've never had before.\n\nAfter that, I looked for a natural herbal alternative. That's when I discovered Kratom. This herb has been the only thing that has helped ease my anxiety, which in turn has helped with my overall stress.\n\n I added Kratom to my daily routine in June 2016, when I started back to work as a chef (which is an incredibly high stress job), while still taking care of my mom's affairs which included selling her house after she had to go into long term care. It's helped lift the cloud, without making me feel impaired, or straight up bad (like the antidepressants, and anti anxiety meds did.)

When I first got clean I experienced depression unlike any I had ever known before. I was sleeping 12 hours a night and was not able to make myself get up for work and though I was no longer abusing drugs, I was still struggling to live a happy life and be a productive member of society. My friend introduced me to Kratom, I was weary at first but eventually tried it. Since then, I have not experienced the amount of relief from depression I have experienced from Kratom anywhere else. It does not get me high, I do not experience euphoria or anything other than feeling like myself again. I now work 2 jobs and I am finishing my college degree. I am over a year and a half clean of drugs and alcohol and I am able to live a happy life. Without Kratom this would not have been possible. If someone had told me and I hadn't experienced it myself I would never have believed it. It has been the only thing that has relieved me of depression. I don't abuse it, and I don't ever feel \"high\" I am very cautious because of my history of drug abuse. And Kratom has changed my life. Please don't take that away from me and the many others it has helped with chronic pain and mental illness. This is a medicine for people not a drug to be feared or banned. It also helps fellow drug addicts come off illegal narctics that have consumed their lives. The war on drugs hurts addicts.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

A nurse friend of mine recommended that I try an herbal solution - kratom.  I rolled my eyes at the time because I assumed that a plant couldn't offer me any real pain relief.. otherwise I would have heard about it by now, right?  \n\nI take two caplets in the morning and two after lunch, and my back pain is gone.  Incidentally, I also found that it was a more effective stimulant than coffee, which offers much more severe side effects.  I have been living caffeine and pain free since I discovered this supplement and I am truly floored by the idea that we are even considering a ban.\n\nI had no idea that my government could reach into my cupboard and unceremoniously decide for me that I should have to live with liver damage, nausea, or back pain... because.. ?  I'm still not clear on the because part of all this.  Because it might act on the brain in similar ways to opiates?  Is this some horrific sin on its own, when it causes no demonstrable harm?  It was my understanding that the privilege of emergency scheduling was afforded to the DEA in order to combat the rapidly produced synthetic drugs that pose a clear and present danger to our public.  This is not happening right now... public opinion on kratom ranges from \"What's that?\" to \"That literally changed/saved my life.\"  The number of deaths that are 'linked' to kratom is laughable to anyone with a college-level statistics class.  \n\nI have done nothing wrong by availing myself of this natural form of pain relief.  You are not better than me because you use Advil instead... Or caffeine, for that matter.  The number of people killed by eating dishwasher detergent pods last year is much greater than the number (inconclusively) linked to kratom.  And hey ok.. folks are less likely to want to eat detergent pods so let's get away from the substance itself and talk about usage... You allow us to kill ourselves with alcohol and cigarettes, but you want to forbid us from the mild stimulant/pain reliever offered by kratom.

I would like to voice my opposition to the DEAs Intent to Schedule the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, which would make Kratom (Mitragynaspeciosa), a schedule 1 controlled substance with no medicinal value. This would put Kratom, a plant helping\nmillions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown Kratom to be a safe and effective, regulated dietary ingredient that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose. Kratom is not a drug and is non-addictive.\n\nI am an educated, responsible adult consumer of Kratom. This plant has given me my life back, safely, without risking addiction to dangerous, narcotic prescription pain medications, Anti-Depressants, addictive Anti-Anxiety medications and alcohol. I have not taken ANY pharmaceutical medications or alcohol since March of 2015, when I researched and discovered an amazing plant, Kratom. I consume Kratom for Chronic Pain due to diagnosed Spinal Disease (Degenerative Disk, Sciatica, Herniated disks), Severe Depressive and Anxiety Disorder and PTSD. I had been battling these issues for over 15 years and have finally been able to live a clear headed, productive and virtually pain free life, since discovering and consuming Kratom in March of 2015. Prior to finding Kratom, I was basically housebound and unable to function due to the side effects of the prescribed medications that my Doctors put me on to treat my multiple, diagnosed conditions. After a period of time, the narcotic pain medications became ineffective, and required me to consume more and more of the dangerous, addictive \"medicines\".  I was so afraid of becoming another statistic... and accidentally overdosing on these medications and die! I am a Mother, I have a wonderful family and had been developing a start up business. I don't want to die. I want to continue to live and be my happy, productive and creative self! I quit taking the pharmaceutical medications and then (out of physical and mental desperation) began to self medicate with alcohol. Of course, this did nothing but make things worse and rendered me unable to function... just as the medications did. I eventually went back to the Doctor and got back on the medications... again. It became a vicious cycle... until I found Kratom. I got my life back! I am an active, productive, happy member of society and my family! My business is flourishing and my future has never been brighter!\n\nKratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. I fear that if Kratom, in it's organic, pure form, is taken away from those of us that depend on it's medicinal value, will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic, maybe even my own. I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same, if possible at all, without Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20740","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Starr Sisk","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please work with the FDA to conduct tests on the safety of this drug so that we have a better understanding of it's workings.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10996","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"chris watt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Re: Docket No. DEA-442W\nA product that has been deemed safe and designed to replace dangerous and addictive opioids should not be banned or\nclassified as a Schedule 1 drug.

I have 12 years military, with a deployment to Afghanistan 2009-2010. I am a father of 3 young children, am in excellent health and maintain a healthy diet while exercising 5 days per week. I've consumed Kratom daily for 6 years and it has helped my well being to the point I consider it life changing.\nPrior to discovering Kratom, I was an alcoholic since my early 20s, made exponentially worse after returning from Afghanistan. My drinking stemmed from a crippling social anxiety that has plagued me since childhood. I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression by the VA and was prescribed several medications, which I often carelessly combined with alcohol. I worked in a meaningless job and my career prospects seemed very limited. When I discovered Kratom, I found it gave me a sense of well being, alertness and increased motivation. I didn't have the heavy urge to drink that I used to, as the well being, alertness and motivation gave me greater confidence in social situations. I drank much less, eventually limiting to 1 or 2 drinks at social functions and finally completely quitting alcohol in 2012. I have not had a drink since then. The motivation I found from Kratom also helped me to be a better employee and a better Officer. I found myself eager to take on more complex projects.\nKratom has helped me live to my full potential. It has not cured anything, I am still and alcoholic and always will be, as it is a disease. I still suffer from social anxiety, but my increased motivation and well being have made my social anxiety much more manageable. I still have PTSD and while it has improved over time, there are events from Afghanistan that will always haunt me. I no longer take medication for PTSD as I feel better and more clear-headed without them. The Kratom has not replaced these medications, but the positive benefits of Kratom have lead to a holistic sense of well being, including diet, exercise, increased focus (leading to greater satisfaction with work and other challenges) and a positive state of mind that has helped me overcome challenges without the aid of medication.\nI maintain a very positive mood, strong work ethic and these have helped me immensely at home, at work and while serving. I will outline some of the accomplishments in my life since discovering Kratom to highlight the positive effects and underline the point that these would not be possible for a drug user or an alcoholic.\nIn my military career, I applied for a Commission as an Officer in the Intelligence Community, which is arguably the most competitive community in the US Military, outside of Special Operations. Not only did I receive a Commission, but I have been a model Officer, have held multiple leadership roles, have consistently been ranked above my peers and have been sought as counsel by many Senior Officers that far outrank me. Much of my work has been in the Counter Terrorism arena and I can say with confidence that I have made positive contributions to National Security. I am known as a top performer in a very elite community and my family and I are proud of my service and the great work I've done.\nI made a civilian career change several years ago and I am not only a stronger provider for my family, with a great career and promising future, I truly love what I do. In my day job I write reports on suspicious financial activity, often stemming from potential criminal activity, including Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Narcotics and Fraud, which are used by Law Enforcement. I know with absolute certainty that my work has been helpful to Law Enforcement, including several high profile cases, and that work has been possible because of my increased focus, motivation and positive mood, all of which have been helped by Kratom. My work requires me to be sharp, focused and clear headed; these are attributes that would be difficult for an alcoholic or a drug user. While I can only truly speak of my own experience with Kratom, since 31AUG16, I have met thousands of others (including many fellow Veterans with stories similar to my own) who have benefitted from Kratom and I'm in awe of the high level of motivation, comraderie and general positive attitude of the entire Kratom community.\nIn addition to the aforementioned, I am a father of 3. I am extremely active in their lives and Kratom has helped immensely. Before discovering Kratom, when my alcoholism and its catastrophic effects had me at my darkest hour, I felt that if I did not make major changes, my only option might be to take my own life. Fortunately, I did make changes and those changes were helped immensely by the positive benefits of Kratom. This was before my children were born, so essentially, their lives got to begin because mine was able to continue. Kratom helps so many, please let it continue to do so.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5406","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have chronic back pain from injuries playing college soccer.

I am not a kratom user at this time but as a person who regularly uses natural supplements I would like kratom to be a legal option for me in the future. I know people who use it or have used it in the past for pain relief.  They did not become addicted to kratom and did not suffer common side effects that would have come with either over the counter or prescription pain medications.\nI am writing about kratom as a person who has studied herbal medicine for over 10 years and uses herbs daily.  One example is red yeast rice which helps control cholesterol instead of using a prescription statin medicine.  Statin medicines were originally derived from natural sources such as red yeast rice.  Aspirin was developed from willow bark, another natural source.  Penicillin was derived from mold.  I could state many more examples off the top of my head but my point is made  many if not most over the counter and prescription medications originated from substances found in nature.  They were then synthesized by pharmaceutical companies to sell at a nice profit.    \nI can share a personal anecdote about herbal supplement use, specifically red yeast rice.  I had been taking it for years until my physician told me my cholesterol was in a good range - she told me to stop taking it.  After six months without red yeast rice my cholesterol was back up and the same physician suggested a prescription statin medication.  I reminded her that she was the one who told me to stop taking the natural supplement which had been controlling my cholesterol.   I am back to taking red yeast rice again rather than a prescription, controlling my cholesterol naturally.  I share this personal story as an advocate for herbal supplements; I know they work.  As I stated in the beginning of this letter I would like to see kratom as a non-pharmaceutical option for me if I choose.\nKratom is a plant that should not be regulated any more than coffee should be regulated.   Kratom is not an opioid and is not any more dangerous to consume than coffee.  There are many natural herbal supplements on the market today that work safely and effectively.  People need to be allowed the choice to use a natural substance over a pharmaceutically derived medicine. I deserve that choice.  The American Kratom Association (at www.americankratom.org) lists many facts, success stories and scientific studies that support my position that kratom should not be banned or regulated.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13074","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rosemary Denehy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I'll try to make this quick. :)\nKratom saves lives and improves quality of life. \nPrescription medications have a lot of side effects and take so many lives each and every year.

This would completely ban the sale, possession, cultivation, and consumption of kratom, a harmless, mildly stimulating plant used for generations as a mild energy booster and mood lifter.\n\nThis is an extreme course of action that should only be reserved for substances with a high abuse potential and/or pose a serious threat to public health and safety. There is no evidence that kratom meets either of these criteria.\n\nFor most people, kratom is used as a mild mood enhancer -- much like coffee. It's unique, stress-relieving properties also make it a viable replacement for dangerous substances like alcohol and illegal drugs, giving people a safer, healthier way to relax at the end of a stressful work day. It is also effective as a social lubricant, helping people to open up and have fellowship with others. Others use it for its energizing properties, to make the work day go by a little easier -- all without any known harmful side effects. I have personally witnessed all of these phenomena in my own community of over 300 people who all consume kratom regularly.\n\nI discovered kratom on a suggestion from a friend, and began drinking a tea made out of it occasionally. It's relaxing properties made it easier for me to open up to people and socialize, and before long I stopped consuming alcohol and going to bars to escape the stress of my work day. Now I am healthier and happier than I was then, and I've experienced zero side effects.\n\nMy story is not unique -- many of my friends and associates have experienced similar, mild benefits from the kratom plant. Putting this substance on the Schedule I list would have a significant, negative impact on the lives of many Americans, without any provable benefits. I strongly encourage you to reconsider.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18890","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dustin Rohde","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing to invite your consideration to omit mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as Schedule 1 Drug.

We clearly don't have enough science on the matter. Currently the DEAS has marijuana scheduled as a Schedule 1 drug with \"no medicinal value\" and this is patently false to the point of being laughable. This is evidenced with the spreading outright rejection of the DEA's current scheduling in the form of more and more laws allowing for the medicinal and recreational use at the state level.  Whereas the opiate addiction epidemic has killed and continues to kill countless americans, including my best friend Carolyn Daley in 2015, Marijuana and kratom do not have such a body count. Even worse there is a growing public consciousness that kratom can help opiate addition recovery. For the DEA to ban this natural plant-based substance at this time without more research and scientific evidence as to its danger except for some anecdotal stories and knee-slap reaction with equating it to far more dangerous synthetic drugs sold in head shops would be a tremendous disservice to the american public. Even worse, it risks sending the message that the DEA is increasingly irrelevant and ineffective when they seek to waste resources to suppress the use of beneficial drugs instead of focusing on drugs that really can kill and are widely accepted as dangerous. Kratom is not one of these drugs. Dont make the same mistake as you did with marijuana and set the country backwards. The information on kratom will only continue to spread in this day and age and eventually the benefitial evidence of this substance will outweigh its danger in a majority of the public's consciousness and the scheduling will be reversed and the DEA will be mocked for having scheduled it as dangerous in the first place. Let's be smart and not go down this road again. Get the research done and until then, sit on your hands and don't interfere with a good thing.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15651","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Ford","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I know someone who was able to get off heroin using this.

I believe that this would have a devastating impact on the lives of hundreds of thousands or even millions of Americans who have been using this herb effectively to treat medical conditions. As I'm sure you are aware, a Whitehouse.gov petition was created in opposition to a kratom ban and it generated over 145,000 signatures from concerned Americans. I believe this number is really just the tip of the iceberg, there are certainly many more people in the kratom community who didn't sign the petition. \n\nKratom has been sucessfully and responsibly used by many Americans in the treatment of various health conditions. To name a few: the treatment of pain, including chronic pain, the treatment of anxiety, the treatment of depression and for opioid addiction therapy. For many it is a safer alternative to the dangerous opioid pain-killers that would otherwise be needed to provide adequate pain-relief. These prescriptions commonly damage the liver, stomach and kidneys as well can lead to miserable withdrawal symptoms and have a significant risk of respiratory depression. Kratom on the other hand has not been tied to organ damage, has mild to no withdrawal symptoms and has a low risk of causing respiratory depression. \n\nKratom's safety record is objectively better than that of prescription opioids as well. In cases where kratom was found in the body of the deceased, it was not ruled as the cause of death in any of them and in almost all cases there were multiple drugs present. By contrast, over 20,000 people die from prescription opioid drug use every year in the United States. Also, in a 5 year period between 2010 and 2015 only 600 kratom related calls were made to poison control centers in the United States, a very small number. To put that into perspective about 50,000 calls were made to poison control centers concerning laundry detergent packets during that same period of time and over 55,000 calls concerning prescription opioid drugs have already been made to poison control centers just during this year alone. www.aapcc.org/alerts/opioids/\n\nIt is my belief that banning kratom will lead to nothing but suffering, misery and even suicide as people who suffer from chronic medical conditions are forced to stop using an herb that has helped keep their health stable, for years in some cases. This will also doom many former opioid addicts who have managed to stay clean from heroin or other similar drugs with the help of kratom.  I believe that all people want here is to be allowed a choice in their own healthcare. Most people in the kratom community are not opposed to an age restriction (like 18 or 21 and up) or the ban of products that mix kratom and other substances together but kratom should remain legal to sell in products containing only kratom to adult consumers.

Im a 9 year user of kratom (mitragyna speciosa) I would like to bring to attention two specific conditions I have. One: At age 9 I was struck by a car in windsor missouri, this is on public record and if need be I can validate all my injuries without any problem. I was struck by a vehicle going 45 miles an hour (a 1970's model cadallac ironically the mayors wife of the town I lived in is the one that hit me.) From this I gained serious problems with my back that required extensive surgery in my younger years. This bred me into the realm of opiate drugs particularly hydrocodone for the first few years of pain management and treatment. \n\nThat and the muscle relaxers they had me on eventually led to me developing heavy mental problems and heavy depression. When depression began creeping in I was 15-16, and it was directly due to the amount of medications I was on even by my doctors own admission he said I had been switched around too much so they stuck me on an analogue (or at the time a brand new approved analogue known as norco's.) \n\nThats where I drew the line the medications ALL the medications they had me on didn't work. Nothing worked my depression increased due to the anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications they put me on and the pain killers didn't even touch my pain not even in the same realm of possibility as what kratom has done for me. \n\nI wanted to die when I was on pills, I felt like a leper- someone who needed to avoid other people because if I had been around them I did not trust myself to be around people without snapping. This is when I began developing a hereditary condition I have known as Lynchen simplex chronicus. During my depression it heightened my anxiety majorly and caused a dormant condition to awaken in my genetics, an incurable genetic condition known as Lynchen Simplex Chronicus. My particular brand was associated directly to my anxiety. \n\nMy skin torn, my body aching and in insurmountable pain I made a decision that I would rather die than live like this and if I couldn't find a solution- that was exactly what I was going to do. True misery is something I lived in for years and after I lived in misery for those years the fear of death truly became nothing to my mind. I had a mental breakdown at my brothers house the year I made that decision during thanksgiving, i'll never forget I just lost it, hit the ground and started crying, writhing in pain and anger I truly was in a dark place.\n\nMy brother in law brought me to a 200 dollar walk in clinic the next day, he paid for me to get looked at and I spoke with an older doctor, she had a very sweet nature, turns out the condition I have (lynchen simplex chronicus) is very well known in south east asia where this doctor was from. She stated to me that there isn't much that can be done about the skin condition except get on a regiment of anxiety and depression medications and hope for the best.\n\nThat is when I told her everything I have said in this post so far and she looked at me knowing where I was at and how close I was at the end of my rope and she went on a limb and took pity on me and informed me of kratom. That was the moment that changed my life, the moment I didn't feel frustration any longer I remember thinking \"an herb that will stop my pain and depression and anxiety? That's preposterous. Modern medicine couldn't even help me how will this?\" \n\nWell.. After scratching my skin to the muscle, after dealing with the \"thousand year itch\" for so long for the first time once the kratom passed my lips within 2 days and ONLY 2 days my rash was completely gone, I didn't even have that bad of scars from it. I felt for the first time since I was 9 years old what I would deem \"normal\" not \"high\" that is what I was trying to escape, that feeling of dread and being forced to supplement your daily existence to even walk by taking opium based pain killers is no life to live. \n\nI have taken kratom for 9 years and haven't touched even so much as an ibuprofen. Kratom is dangerous? That's an outright preposterous statement. I have taken enough that I \"would have definitely died if it were dangerous in any lethal capacity.\" I have never experienced any of the supposed side effects (hallucinogens, Close eyed visuals auditory hallucination/ respiratory depression) The side effects aren't real- completely made up.\n\nI want it to be clear by banning kratom you will be greatly reducing my quality of life and millions of others. By allowing this ban you are forcing people to \"ignore their pain and anxiety\" instead of deal with it, because that's what pills do, they allow you to ignore the problem- a temporary band-aid. Kratom is a solution to many problems and if you go by other research done in other continents that DEFINITELY have fully researched it- you would realize exactly how good it is and how much it could change the way our medical system works. http://ensobotanicals.com/kratom/","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2026","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"The Botanical Bros","postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Walden","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Nov 29, 2016\n\nOur Story,\n15 years ago I married the love of my life,  We had 2 children together and soon I realized the hold alcohol had on him.  We had together enjoyed the recreational use of drugs and alcohol but as time went on and we became parents I noticed that as he loved us alcohol was his first real love. It was something that needed to be considered before groceries, in any travel plans or daily activities.  It had taken the front seat to our lives.  I tried many times to be bold and leave but love kept drawing us back together. He has always had an amazing heart but as time went on and the alcoholism got worse our lives became more and more unpredictable.  \n\nAfter 13 years of marriage, 2 children, 3 attempts at treatment and 4 separations  he was up to a liter of vodka every day.  He had suffered at least one seizure and unable to go beyond 20 mins without a shot to keep from triggering the start of detox symptoms. \nUncountable attempts to clean up on his own were continuously unsuccessful. Many of these included spending time in a hospital or detox center so as not to risk the danger of such a significant detox on his own. \n\nA year and a half ago he chose treatment once again to get his family and more importantly his life back.\nHe completed it successfully and came out with a new perspective.  Unfortunately he continued to struggle with Migraines, Anxiety and insomnia.  Many of these he would have previously treated with a drink but he tried so desperately to avoid that road again.  \nHe found himself taking up to 10 doses of Excedrin migrane every day to control the pain and struggled to feel comfortable out in the world among his peers.  \n\nAfter about 9 months the drink got a hold of him again and it was insane to see how quickly the alcoholic reverts.  It didnt take much to get him completely intoxicated and after only one drink it was almost impossible for him to leave the house without the pull for the bar.  \nThey say that no matter how long the alcoholic is sober they start right back to where they left off.  One drink would lead right into the detox phase of shaking, vomiting, fevers and tremors.  This was like a nightmare everyday, not knowing what to expect coming home to and the most painful part was watching him struggle not wanting to walk that path but having every cell in his body drawing him down it.\n\nI am very much a naturalist and know how his previous life of using pharmaceuticals recreationally could lead to additional problems. However something needed to change.  \nHe was preparing to go to another psychologist and get some form of medication to assist in the cravings when he stumbled across Kratom. In doing research to avoid the psychosis that the previous medication caused he found that many others were having relief from cravings, pain and anxiety with this natural substance.  \n\nWe found it available at our local herb shop and immediately noticed a difference.  There was the light back in his eyes.  He even suggested we go play tennis!  \nIt has now been 6 months of using Kratom and I wouldnt go back for anything.  Of course I still worry if some major life crisis will lead back to the bottle but I really think that even if he were tempted just to try his dramatic past life keeps him from even testing his strength.  \n\nI was concerned with him taking another substance, especially after hearing about the DEA issues. However after seeing him on Kratom is like seeing a NORMAL PERSON in my husbands skin.  I have a man now that has compassion and patience,  Vision and follow-through and most importantly fairly predictable in mood.  I am no longer afraid of the dr Jeckyl/Mr Hyde factor and our kids have their father back.  \n\nI understand that many are concerned with a substance that they can't control the chemistry, however when using a natural substance we often suffer less from side effects because the body gets the complete chemical makeup that is presented naturally.  Especially with a product that is as unadulterated as the Kratom herb.\n \nI hope that the struggles that we have gone through as a family will help others find peace in their own lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18199","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hey DEA.

I understand that a large amount of people are concerned that they will lose access to this plant due to our country's war on drugs campaign. In my research, Kratom has not lead to overdoses, dependency concerns or behavior indicative of psychosis so am befuddled why we would schedule this plant in the same class as marijuana. Numerous people have found that they are able to live/manage their chronic pain without using a narcotic, which seems to me that we should be happy given the documentation of widespread abuse by people seeking relief for pain.  As a street drug, Kratom has no market value. You don't smoke it, it doesn't get you \"high\" and as bad as this plant extract tastes, would not have the appeal to our younger generation who have the opportunity to find real \"drugs\" on any given school parking lot.

Note that in Alabama, opiate deaths doubled once Kratom became illegal. Also note that Kratom has never killed a human by itself (as far as it's known). With public pressure to deal with the PHARMACEUTICAL and never-ending ILLEGAL opiate problem mounts, a reaction to ban a tool to help people FIX that problem is the most childish reaction imaginable. There's absolutely no logic to that kind of behavior and it makes people want to leave the \"land of the free\". There may be subtext that the government is in the pockets of big pharma which is a clear and correct narrative, but you would be further cementing distrust and hate toward the government by doing this. With no research and the current context of the country in mind, I can add my personal story. The tremendous cost of going to a psychiatrist+chologist against searching for anything illegal or alcohol will naturally lead someone with depression/anxiety to the least costly and embarrassing alternatives. To put this up front, I took Kratom for 5 straight years, with no breaks. Getting bloodwork done once every couple years out of worry led to NO negative impacts that were observed. One thing to consider is: there is actually a ceiling to how \"high\" a person can get. You will start throwing up quicker than you will kill yourself by ODing. It is plant matter, not an extremely potent synthesized powder. You would have to search out harder drugs, which most people wouldn't do if this is available easily to sooth the body and mind. During this period, I held a steady job, got promoted, became management, never showed up late, held a girlfriend the entire time. Before this, none of the above. Of course, more research the better. I understand some interests want to prevent that. Think of what making this plant illegal does for people like me. When my health insurance bill is about to go from $375 to $430/month at the beginning of the year, those of us who are non-lobbyists, non-hedge-funders, non-tax-payer-paid civilians have to make real life decisions about how to cope with whatever we are born with mentally, physically, or what have you. No, I don't game the system. No, I don't have kids. No, I have not done something terrible warranting some political stigma. I am a relatively well off white male. I will stop here so this is actually readable. Feel free to use this as an example in public discourse. This plant saved my life.

I oppose the scheduling of these alkaloids for three distinct reasons: my personal experience with Kratom, accessibility of this plant for research purposes, and the overall goal of reducing harm. \n\n\nI work as a landscaper as well as a caretaker for my parents' home and two rental properties. I suffer from chronic back pain due to a genetic misalignment of my L5 and S1 vertabrae. I also suffer from negative thinking patterns and anxiety. I have found that Kratom helps reduce physical pain and concomitant negative thinking, as well as reducing feelings of anxiousness throughout the day. Since beginning Kratom use I have been able to work outdoors in variable conditions without pain while maintaining a clear head and cogent thinking. My productivity and positive thinking have both increased. My doses of Kratom are extremely small (1/4 tsp.) and I have noticed no deleterious effects or withdrawal symptoms if I cease my Kratom use for any length of time. \n\n\nThe best way to encourage research into the medical properties and potential benefits of Kratom is to keep it legal and accessible. Scheduling mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine will only reduce accessibility to research institutions tasked with unlocking the potential medical benefits of this plant. It is in society's best interest to encourage as much research into these alkaloids as possible. Research institutions seeking to study the medical benefits of cannabis are severely restricted by way of the Schedule 1 status of that plant. I urge the DEA not to repeat this decades-long prorogation of scientific research by scheduling mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. Current research seems to confirm my personal experience with Kratom as a safe botanical supplement with far, far less danger to society than legal substances like alcohol and tobacco products. \n\n\nI appreciate the Drug-Enforcement Agency as an organization tasked with reducing harm. No doubt this has been accomplished with the banning of many destructive synthetic compounds that are extremely, immediately harmful to users and their families. I urge the DEA to weigh the relatively little harm caused by Kratom as a legal botanical compared to the harm induced by making hundreds of thousands of current American Kratom users felons with the scheduling of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. I firmly believe that keeping these alkaloids legal is the less harmful path forward. Scheduling them would inevitably lead to the formation of a black market as it has in the case of cannabis. Black markets suffer from lack of quality control, tax evasion, violence, immense expenditures by law enforcement and the justice system, and the fragmentation of families due to drug sentencing laws. \n\nThank you for accepting public comments on this issue. I urge the DEA to keep mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine legal. Please do not make felons out of hundreds of thousands of otherwise peaceful and nonviolent citizens, including many veterans of our Armed Forces, seeking the relief Kratom provides.  \n\n\nSincerely, \n\nColin Richardson\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17304","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Colin Richardson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using kratom for the past 2 years.

I must say I'm a little puzzled by this recent action to schedule this as anelicit drug.

To be safe i take this supplement when i am home for the day and not planning to drive, but that is out of an abundance of caution because other than helping with my pain, I do not feel any different mentally after taking this supplement. With all the dangerous options people living with chronic pain are presented with, it would be a real disservice to us to make this unavailable. I'm  so grateful I found this herb to help me with my pain before ending up being prescribed-a nd inevitably becoming addicted to- a prescription painkiller that would most certainly pose a risk to my safety.

I have suffered chronic pain and fatigue since contracting a Hospital Acquired MRSA infection during rotator cuff surgery in October of 2014. I was initially being treated with an opioid for the chronic pain, but it was about at this same time that information was surfacing about the extent of opioid abuse and overdosing. Because of concerns related to the opioid \"epidemic\" I began looking for a safe, effective, legal and preferably natural alternative. I spent days online researching this and the consensus kept coming up that Kratom was the right alternative. \n\nI tried a small quantity at first, and was pleasantly surprised at its effectiveness. It eased my pain considerably, but probably just as importantly it relieved the fatigue that is so often associated with chronic pain. I was able to take part in most of the activities that I had enjoyed prior to the unfortunate MRSA experience. I have now been enjoying Kratom for nearly two (2) years and have not experienced any adverse effects. On days when my pain is mild, I simply forego the Kratom, and then on days of more severe pain I am able to get the relief and energy that I need to enjoy my life.\n\nI would like to see more research done with Kratom, and in the meantime would experience a significant reduction in my quality of life it is Classified as a Schedule I Drug, so please allow those of us who get so much benefit from this natural supplement to continue to do so.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19800","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am an addiction medicine physician.  I hate to post anonymously, but I just don't feel comfortable using my name.\nI do not see Kratom as a significantly risky drug of abuse.  It certainly does not pose the risk that heroin/fentanyl poses and it is very likely less dangerous than either alcohol or marijuana.  \n\nAlthough there have been reported deaths in people who have kratom in their system, the important question is what else was the person using and what was the actual cause of death.  Given the grass roots support for its use, and therefore the likely high incidence of kratom use, it seems unlikely that it poses a danger of overdose and death given the small number of deaths that happen to have kratom on toxicology.\n\nI think it would be helpful if further research were done on it's risks as well as its possible benefits, which would be more difficult if it were classified CI.  The same issue occurred with marijuana and now we have the bogus concept of \"medical\" marijuana  without the benefit of good research done on its components, such as cannabidiol.  I'd hate to see this happen to kratom also when it may truly have some benefit.\n\nI've never had a patient see me for addiction treatment who described kratom use, so I suspect it's not a major player as an addictive drug.  I'm concerned that those who seem to benefit from it will continue to seek it if it is reclassified, and the risk exists that what they find will be something unknown and possibly more dangerous since they will have to resort to illegal sources.  Additionally, it raises the issue of law enforcement and punishment of illegal kratom users, should it be reclassified.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16116","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The world of drugs is shrouded in many half truths and mysteries. None so much as Kratom, I've found over the last four years of taking it. Despite the fact that it has been consumed by humans regularly in southeast Asia where it is endemic to for several hundreds of years; very few people I have found know about it.\n\nLaying in my bed, a victim of strep throat from smoking too much hookah with strangers (my bad), I simply could not afford to go to the doctor. I tried to tough it out and go to class with tylenol, but, this simply was not working and was dangerous because the streptococcus was getting worse. I eventually had to leave and go back to my hometown, where I could not eat anything solid anymore and even swallowing liquids was a pain. My mom had been taking this ... thing, called Kratom, for a year or two. Ever since, she had a lot more energy, a lot less pain, was much less depressed and generally was just a better person to be around at all times. When she didn't have it, I didn't really notice a difference like withdrawals. She'd go back to being much more negative, and being around her was simply unpleasant before she started taking Kratom.\n\nMy turn, I guess. I could barely swallow anything and my mom entered my bedroom, as I was burning up with a fever of 103F four years ago, and gave me water, tylenol for the fever and... what? I had to ask her what they were, and after initially refusing, the pain became so agonizing that I somehow managed to force down six gelatin capsules containing Kratom.\n\nAn hour and a half later, my fever went rocketing down and the amount of pain in my throat went from a 9/10 to a 3/10 and I was comfortable to sleep. I was amazed, truly, absolutely amazed. I went from feeling like I was dying to my throat pain going away. I was also mentally stimulated, and talkative. But I found myself able to pick which way I wanted to go: stay awake and do something productive if I needed to like fix a meal, or go to sleep without anxiety and pain. It was quite perfect. \n\nAt first, it was a bit of a \"buzz\", but, fairly quickly over time it simply has turned into a feeling of wellbeing, clarity, no anxiety or depression, and positive thoughts. It is the only way I can properly function and communicate in a hectic, loud workspace while having severe PTSD and other disorders. Technically, this plant falls under the category of \"opioid\" which is an alarm signal for many people, however, it is extremely unique in its functions with different bonding sites in the brain, while also being generally considered far less addictive.\n\nWhat is its medicinal uses though? Why did the DEA try to ban it? Well, when combined with alcohol, drugs or research chemicals in the past, only a few (single digits) people have died in the U.S., and none of them from strictly non-extract Kratom-use only. What are the benefits? Besides the positives listed, I have personally seen it do the following:\n\nCure addiction to methadone and heroin by using Kratom to wean off of the substances.\nTemporarily cured my father's alcohol problem. He didn't drink for over two years, which is incredible for my father, a lifetime alcoholic.\nI was drinking quite heavily before I started taking Kratom on and off four years ago; now, it's become only socially.\nBeneficial for agoraphobia and many other anxiety and depressive conditions, including my PTSD\nHelped my step-mother quit abusing her percocet, while providing pain relief for arthritis and fibromyalgia\nI personally detoxed from months of Oxycodone/Vicodin post-surgery using Kratom. Result: no withdrawal symptoms from sudden discontinuation of my painkillers when I \"weaned off\" with Kratom. It is quite a safe substance. The worst I've ever seen with Kratom is a person vomiting once, and then they are fine. Kratom. Is. NOT. A. Problem. Please, stop policing our private lives. It does not impair you whatsoever.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4822","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Samuel Sizer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In Dec. 2003 I was a passenger in a van pool on our way to work when the van got caught up in a multi car  accident.

I was given several diagnoses, treatments, and medications with no effect. It wasnt until March 2013 that I was properly diagnosed with CRPS (chronic regional pain disorder). Again, I was given a slew of treatments and medications to try and treat the severe pain.  Among this list is methocarbamol, topiramate, cymbalta, lyrica, a series of nerve blocks in my back, and a 2 week ketamine IV treatment. As a consequence of my disability, I also developed depression and anxiety. Having my life turned upside down, losing my job, feeling self conscious, loss of self worth and zero control over my life were also taking a toll on me. Not only were the medications ineffective for my pain, anxiety, and depression, but the side effects of drowsiness, dizziness, apathy, and confusion only added to my issues. \n\nI cant begin to describe the level of misery in my life during this time. A life with CRPS can a life of constant pain and suffering. It has affected every aspect of my life. While my prescribed medications offered some minor relief, they were unfortunately not enough to improve my quality of life to a bearable level. I was desperate to find further relief.  I began researching organic natural alternative to prescription medicines.  In doing so, I found Kratom. I found scores of people whos lives were positively changes by this supplement, from depression, pain, anxiety, help to safely get them off opiates, and many more benefits. I have been so grateful that I found Kratom.  It has been a significant factor in helping to manage my chronic pain anxiety, and depression. Together with a spinal stimulator, a moderate dose of gabapentin, wellbutrin, and responsible use of and Kratom, I have been able to regain a quality of life I had not had before. It is an essential part of my ability to sleep better, walk with less discomfort, periodically leave my home, and have a healthier state of mind in dealing with my disability. A life without Kratom for me would most certainly mean a return to a life of pure misery. I prospect I find terrifying. \n\nIn summation, I believe evidence shows Kratom is a safe alternative/addition to pharmaceutical drugs. It has been wrongfully categorized as a harmful and addictive substance. Kratom has been used for its many benefits for a very, very long time. When compared to legal substances like alcohol, tobacco and opiates, which pose a clear and significant threat to humans, Kratoms history demonstrates a far superior record. \n\nI implore you to please support a responsible compromise of a 21+ age requirement on this supplement and keep kratom legal. The consequences to those of us that depend on this supplement will be devastated and therefore the quality of life, will be deeply harmed. Thank you for your time and service to our nation. \n\n\nSincerely, \n\nBill Leigh\nTo take the drastic actions of making Kratom a controlled schedule 1 medication is drastic and will hurt so many people in so many ways. Those formally addicted to opiates will return to them, those on pain may have to turn to opiates, those depressed or have anxiety could turn to dangerous substances. Sensible age restrictions, marketing regulations, and possible quality oversight are reasonable actions to protect both people and this suppliment. I respectfully implore the DEA to not make Kratom illegal without much more research and input from both proponents and opponents of Kratom. The unintended consequences of making Kratom illegal will be catatrophic for many people. I ask the DEA to please slow down in their actions. \nThank you for alllwing me to voice my concerns and share my story.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7840","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bil Leigh","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, I have been consuming Kratom fo years.

My best friend was in a severe accident and was in a coma for several months. Due to her injuries she suffered severe pain since that time. This caused a dependency on pain pills that plagued her life. After almost 10 years of consistent opiate use, she discovered kratom. Within three months she was completely weaned off of the opiates. This gave her the quality of life back that she had been missing for so many years. Since that time, I have share the experiences I personally witnessed with several other friends and family members who had opiate addictions. Pretty much everyone experience the same relief of pain without the addictive properties that my best friend experienced. I have several injuries from my younger days along with a good amount of arthritis that I experience. I used kratom for relief of these aches and arthritic pains. I have never had any ill effects or withdrawal symptoms due to my occasionally use. I know this miracle plant is probably eating into the profits of the pharmaceutical companies that make these very strong opiate painkillers, but I have never met or heard of anyone who has overdosed and died from kratom, as opposed to the uncountable deaths from opiates and heroin. I just hope that the wise people that run your branch of government are wise enough to see that this plant does not belong on the list of illegal and prohibited substances. Please do not take this plant away from people that use it instead of stronger pain killers or street drugs. Thank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15627","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Brandon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me and my family though so much.

I have been with my wife for 28 years and I have an adult daughter and a granddaughter who just started kindergarten. I have been in construction my whole life except for times that I spent furthering my education which I earned an associate degree in automotive service technology.\nI am writing this letter with hope that it helps persuade the FDA and the DEA to NOT schedule Kratom as a harmful substance. I started consuming Kratom two years ago hoping for a natural supplement that would aid my depression and help me focus on my daily activities. Before I started consuming Kratom I utilized marijuana for about 30 years. I was never much of a drinker and rarely used any harder drugs. After starting Kratom I just felt good, not high( because I know what high feels like after smoking marijuana for 30 years), I just felt good..and had more energy. Kind of like a good cup of coffee that lasts for a few hours, without the caffeine headache. I also didn't feel the need to smoke marijuana anymore.\nAfter doing construction work all my life and getting a little older I do experience some back aches and strains occasionally, on occasion requiring a trip to the walk in clinic for muscle relaxers, etc. Since starting Kratom I haven't had any medical problems, I haven't even been sick in two years. The couple times that I have strained my back I consumed red vein Kratom and the pain was much more tolerable. \nTo sum up this letter I would just like to say that Kratom has done nothing but improve my life in multiple ways. My family is aware of my Kratom use and we just treat it as if it is a supplement that actually works to improve your health. If the FDA and/or the DEA were to make Kratom unavailable to the public my life and the life of the people around me would be diminished.\nSincerely, Scott Barnes","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0681","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Scott Barnes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My life has become very stressful after hearing that the government intends on criminalizing kratom, a plant which has absolutely changed, and quite possibly even saved my life.  It has helped me overcome addiction to intravenous use of opiates/heroin and alcohol, and also helps me cope with very severe depression, anxiety, and agoraphobia.  After I stopped my drug use, I did not leave my house for over a year because of SEVERE social anxiety, where I can't even look at someone in the eyes or be around a crowd of people without having an anxiety attack.  Kratom has saved my life, and has given me life back where my social anxiety has been greatly minimized, I have friends again, and a job.\n\nIt seems likely that kratom is less lethal, intoxicating, and addictive than alcohol, yet saves and changes thousands of lives for the better... why is it going to be taken away from the people whose lives it has changed?  If every opiate/heroin addict were to replace their deadly habit with kratom, over 30,000 lives might be saved next year. And the effects are so mild, yet the benefits can be life saving.  It just seems to me that the advantages of kratom remaining legal far outweigh the liability it poses to the public.  And if there are risks, why can't they just be studied and labeled/communicated to the public, similar to alcohol and cigarettes?  \n\nPlease keep kratom legal so the people who's lives have literally been saved, can continue to have a life and progress.\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22666","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think it would make no sense to schedule Kratom, rather there should be quality standards like for herbal teas.

I am a 41yr old male living in Louisiana.  I am the store manager of Natchez Market an independent  retail grocer in Natchez, MS.  Currently on my 10th year as store manager and consider myself very good at what I do.  My main job is to make the location/owners money and provide excellent customer service.  I also use the plant kratom to help alleviate pain caused by heavy lifting at work and a moderate case of scoliosis since I was a child.  Some days the pain is unbearable, but since discovering kratom almost two years ago, I am able to easily make it through the day as I take when needed.  The plant helps the sharp pains in my back to subside and keeps the muscles from tightening to the point of having spasms.  I really think research should be done on the medical properties of the plant as it does work in my opinion.  I was introduced to kratom by a friend because he saw the road I was going down on opiate pain killers.  When the doctor would prescribe them I would take the prescription, but afterwards would always look for more until I had to break myself off of them.  It was always a cycle I knew could lead to ruin, but with a good job could not risk it.  With kratom however I never felt that urge to keep taking the plant.  I could take, alleviate the pain, then go without.  It's good to have my life back without having to take endure all the back pain.  No side effects that I noticed except occasional sensitivity to light.  I do not understand why it would be classified into a class of drugs that would make me a criminal as I am a hard working, law abiding, tax paying citizen of our great nation.  Please consider doing some research on the plant before labeling not for any medical purpose.

I tried everything to stop injecting, eating, snorting etc... opioid painkillers many times. Each time I failed and ended up worse off than before until my addiction and relapse nearly took my life. When I was released from the hospital the doctors prescribed me fentanyl (a drug I had previously overdosed and nearly died from) and oxycodone. They knew my medical history and still sent me home with a bag full of pills and fentanyl gel patches. Instead of going home to my certain death by ingesting these painkillers I checked myself into treatment even after being in the hospital for 7 months. I was in agonizing pain for 28 days and eventually completed the treatment program. Upon release from the rehab I was in I went to many doctors seeking an alternative to pain management. 3 different doctors told me there was no other option to control my pain than prescribing more opiates. I was devastated and went home to do more research. I stumbled upon a forum about kratom and decided to give it a shot. I purchased an ounce of the powdered product from a sterile, professional environment owned by a very educated vendor. I had my doubts but I took the dose as advised and waited. What came next changed my life forever. I had no searing pain in my sternum where I had been sawed in half and I felt alive again. It was all the benefits of opiate painkillers without the \"high.\" I've been taking kratom every day or two since then and have not had the urge or need for any further treatment.

Prior to this, I struggled on a daily basis to be able to sit in front of a computer all day after the 6 surgeries I've had on my back in the last 8 years. This impacted my performance at work, my ability to have a social life, and most importantly, the quality of my time with my 9 and 13 year old daughters. The worst negative side effect I've experienced in this year and a half is constipation, which was nothing new after years of prescription narcotic pain medicine. The idea that the DEA has attempted to crack down so hard on this plant, which bears no likeness to the other drugs they're trying to classify it with, is completely baffling to me. People on heroin, cocaine, meth and alcohol lose their jobs, families, quality of life, and in severe cases, their lives. Kratom has improved those areas of my life with no negative aspects. I realize there are a lot of politics that are also playing into this decision, but I implore those with the power to stop this needless classification to think about the quality of life for Americans who already have enough pain and suffering. The health care in this country is in shambles as it is with it only getting worse. Please focus attention where it's needed with cocaine, heroin, meth and other drugs that are ruining and/or taking lives...not a harmless plant that is improving lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14609","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeremy Ward","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In reference to:  Docket No. DEA-442W .  The proposed ban on Kratom.\n\nIn my experience, I have rarely come across a natural plant product that can do so much good and, as far as I have seen, be safe for people to use.  Kratom was and is the only substance that helped me to stop taking narcotics for pain.  I have had numerous surgeries and suffer chronic pain in my neck, back, hip, and shoulder.  My neck and lower back are fused due to severe herniation of disks.\nAfter many years of pain management with a doctor, I found that narcotics did not work any longer and I was only taking them to keep from getting sick (withdrawal).  The doctor tried many treatments and stimulator implants combined with prescription pain killers.  The doses only kept going up and my personal life suffered.  I was always depressed and 'distant' according to my spouse, family, and friends.  I made up my mind that I had had enough and was getting off the pain medicine cycle of destruction.\nMy doctor helped me slowly decrease my doses, put me on Suboxone and gradually weaned me down to nothing.  I found that I still had withdrawal symptoms and a high level of pain.  I refused to return to narcotics and heard from an acquaintance that Kratom had helped many people in my situation.\nI researched it and read all I could find regarding it's use, effects, and how it worked.  Since the compounds mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine occupy the same receptor sites as opiates, but had little effect compared to opiates, I could see how Kratom could help.\nI used 2 tsps powdered Kratom with a cup of juice a couple of times a day and found the withdrawal symptoms totally disappeared and the pain level I experience constantly, decreased to a tolerable level.\nSince then (about a year and half), I continue to use Kratom and have seen no adverse effects.  In fact, my body fat content decreased, my labs improved to all within normal limits, and my blood pressure was much lower than before.  My friends and family welcomed me back to the 'real' world.  My head was clearer than it had been in years and I was able to communicate intelligently with friends and family again.\nAs far as the substances being addictive, I have not found that to be the case.  I have gone without Kratom and suffered no ill effects other than an increased pain level.\n\nI hope and pray Kratom will be left alone and available to adults who need it.  It is very comparable to strong coffee, which, as we know has pain relieving effects from caffeine.  It is far safer than any of the street drugs out there.  Please don't put it in the same category.  Please keep it legal.  \n\nSincerely,\nE.J.B.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1736","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jimmy B","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me kick a pain pill codependency for me.

I quite in the summer of 2013 and went through horrible withdrawals. Even after the withdrawals, I still didn't feel like myself. I had zero energy or ambition. So I started back up again, but figured i could take a lower dose just to get by and be able to function. 3 years later, I am back to were I was, taking 60-120mg a day. After getting laid off in March, I wanted to stop using Oxycodone so I didn't have to worry about being at a new job and going through withdrawals again. But not using, left me so lifeless. Then in September, I came across a post on reddit about the DEA's ban on Kratom. After reading through the comments I wanted to give it a try. So I called a local Kratom shop and the were able to answer all of my questions. I decided to give it a try. That was seven weeks ago. I haven't taken a pill since. I wish I would have known about this a long time ago. Pills made me feel normal but it would also make me very sleepy and I wouldn't want to do anything. Kratom takes away the anxiety of not having enough pills, gives me energy, seems to help my depression and costs a whole lot less then pills. I feel like I have my life back. I also don't have to take Kratom if I feel I don't need it. To me, Kratom is no different than coffee or energy drinks. Except coffee and energy drinks didn't help me get off of pills. I was so fortunate that I didn't lose my life to pills. Kratom can help so many people.

My symptoms included pain 25 out of 30 days every month, with at least a week of that in tears, due to the amount of pain. Within two months after surgery, I was then diagnosed with Hashimotos Hypothyroidism, due to a high thyroid stimulating hormone blood analysis number along with an extremely high thyroid peroxidase antibody number, meaning that I would be on thyroid replacement therapy for the rest of my life. Symptoms include memory lapses, extreme exhaustion, hair loss, and difficulty of losing weight. Within a few months, my teeth started falling apart, and not one dentist or doctor could explain it, or would even take the time to help me figure out the cause. This does cause a great deal of pain at times, and restricts what I can eat. Just this year, August of 2016, I was officially diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and bursitis of the hips. My doctor prescribed cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant, along with Tramadol, which is an opioid analgesic. Cyclobenzaprine has many drug interaction warnings, along with a scary list of side effects, including confusion, fainting, hallucinations, and seizures. Tramadol also has many drug interaction warnings, one of which is a muscle relaxant like cyclobenzaprine, is addictive, and can be overdosed on easily. Tramadol also has side effects similar to cyclobenzaprine, and personally, it gives me major migraines when I take it.\n\nAfter I received the diagnosis for Fibromyalgia, a friend Ive known for years introduced me to the natural plant called Kratom. I did a lot of research on this plant, as many natural herbs and supplements dont affect me the same as other people. This friend also added me to a Facebook group for a specific vendor that she uses, full of many knowledgeable and helpful people to help me on my journey of regaining the energy and normalcy that has been missing from my life for years. \n\nSince I started dosing Kratom, my pain levels have decreased tremendously, and my energy level has increased substantially. While this past fall was our busiest season at work, Ill also be able to attend school again to finish the college degree I started 10 years ago, one that my parents never received, as well as start low-impact exercises in order to keep my weight in control. If Kratom is easily abused, I have not experienced that, as I take extremely low doses (1 to 2 grams per day). The only so-called negative side effect that Ive noticed is an increase in water intake. \n\nTo me, Kratom is just another natural herbal supplement, similar to many others found over the counter, like the Valerian root that I keep in my purse at all times to help with muscle pain, or the herbal teas I drink to help me sleep or keep allergies at bay. \n\nIn short, natural Kratom is helping me to overcome low energy and memory issues due to my body literally attacking itself, and allowing me to live a normal life. I urge you to keep Kratom off of the Schedule I Controlled Substance List. Without this natural plant, my only options are minutes, hours, days, weeks, and years of pain, or the possibility of my body being damaged further by synthetic drugs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6013","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alexis Turner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi...I am a 33 yr. old female kratom consumer and this topic and thought of this miracle plant being\ntaken away from me is very important to me and breaks my heart. Kratom has truely been a life saver\nfor me and a few other people I know. To start my story I myself was a part of the hidious world of \nHeroin addiction. For a total of 10 yrs. SAD!! The only way I found out of it was to get on Methadone.\nAnd yes methadone kept me from using Heroin, but I was still was not living nor was I happy. All I did all day \non methadone was sleep...waking for maybe 5 hours to go to work for a bit...being in a sleep haze then going back to my mom's (cause I lost my place) to go back to sleep. I was still very much a slave to the sleeping spell. Then came the time when i was coming off methadone. No easy task! At all!! I had to take a month off of work. I couldent function! The only thing methadone left me with was horrible, inescapable anxiety. I didn't even have the mental strenth to shower or get myself something to eat. How could I live like that? The thought made me cry. (I would also like to add here that since the age of sixteen I had been on anxiety meds Effexor, Paxil, and Prozac that did not work thats probably why I was drawn to drugs like Heroin) Then one day I was told about KRATOM. At first I thought it was a joke. I didn't try any for awhile. I thought how can that help me?. After weeks of just feeling awful. The anxiety making me not care about anything I thought I have to try something so I bought myself some KRATOM,. That day my life changed for the BETTER!! KRATOM has brought me back to life!! I now have my own place. I have kept it up and running for the past year and a half. I work a full 8 hours a day..not just 5. Im alive and living and thriving! Im a part of the real functioning world! Im no longer that ugly druggie hidden out of peoples vue. Nor am I that hopeless girl sitting in a room with soo much anxiety she cant even think to move. KRATOM  helped me get my life back and moving. KRATOM IS NOT BAD! GIVE IT A CHANCE! PLEASE! Let it stay around so it can maybe help someone else out there. Alot of us have been through the whole opiod misery and dont want to go back. We just want to be happy and content...and for many many more KRATOM can bring that!...

I am 65 years old and currently not working.  \n\nI oppose the DEA putting kratom on the list of Schedule 1 controlled substances.  I do not use kratom now and do not intend to use kratom in the near future.  \n\nA friend of mine had major back surgery in 2013.  She had her spine fused with metal rods and screws.  Since the surgery in 2013, she has been in constant pain.  She started taking kratom in June of 2015.  Since then, I have seen a noticeable change.  Her pain seems to be tolerable and she can function at her job and doing household chores.  For her kratom has been a lifesaver.\n\nBefore taking kratom she did her research.  She has shared a number of the kratom articles she found with me. The most informative article/research paper that is current, is titled Update on the Pharmacology and Legal Status of Kratom by Walter C. Prozialeck, PhD. I have attached that document to my comment here.  Anyone who has not read the article should read it, because it is well worth the time.  Most, if not all of the articles that she shared with me fall in line with what Walter C. Prozialeck, PhD wrote.\n\nAs stated in the article there have been a limited amount of issues with kratom.  From what he wrote it is unclear whether kratom is 100% at fault with these health issues.  By looking at the big picture, the negative issues are a very small percentage of the people that are actually helped.\n\nAs I stated at the beginning of this letter, I do not use kratom now and do not plan to in the near future.  Good health is not a given.  Each and every one of us could lose our health at anytime and end up living a life in pain. It is because of this that I feel kratom should remain available.\n\nIn conclusion, I am asking that the DEA NOT put kratom on the list of Schedule 1 controlled substances, as the positive results far outweigh the negative results.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22975","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Johnson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello to whom it migh concern.  \n\nI support Kratom  or Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine to remain legal.

I have been on a variety of medicines for this disease including the most recent and very expensive biologics. Most are very expensive, have dangerous / damaging side effects and none have given me significant, lasting relief. \n\nOn my own, I have tried, in parallel with conventional medicines for Crohn's disease, almost every herbal medicine and alternative therapy out there.

My doctors are aware of my use of this natural remedy, and have not discouraged me from using it.  I have experienced absolutely no side-effects from my daily use of Kratom. It is also inexpensive when compared to ANY prescription drug I've been on. One doctor has even expressed an interest in recommending it to other patients of his who suffer from IBD given my remarkable outcome.\n\nThere are little or no intoxicating effects from this medicine...if anything, it is a mild stimulant akin to coffee.

I had been healthy my whole adult life until age 38 when I was diagnosed. I took no prescription meds. Once I was diagnosed I underwent many procedures including a stem cell implant, which failed. I was on many meds- Lyrica, hydrocodone, tramadol, Zoloft, and Xanax. I began to develop a tolerance to the opioids and had to take more and more. They left me lethargic and I couldn't function on a normal basis. I lost my job. UNTIL I found Kratom! Over the course of 2 months I came completely off my opioid medication! I am still taking Lyrica, but at smaller doses, and have been able to cut my Xanax dosage in half. The pain relieving and calming effects of Kratom have led to me resuming my work as a professional counselor. It has changed my life! I have been using Kratom for 6 months and have developed no tolerance and have a daily regimen that has worked great for me! There are so many different strains that if I ever did begin to develop a tolerance, I would simply switch strains, as I have heard that is very effective. I am BEGGING you not to make this healthy plant illegal!! I think of how many people are in the ER every weekend for alcohol related accidents and illnesses, and alcohol is clearly addictive! If anything, Kratom could help these people find healthier ways to achieve a calm, relaxed state.

I do not support the scheduling this herbal supplement. I have suffered from back pain issues since I started working at a automotive components factory at 19 years old. In 2006 I was diagnosed with Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. I suffer from pain & weakness caused by this, bulging discs, degenerative disc disease & sciatic nerve pain. I was prescribed dangerous pharmaceutical pain medication. It wasn't long before I had to start taking other pharmaceuticals to combat the side effects of the pain medications. This caused a vicious cycle that caused more harm than help. I was sick everyday. I tried but couldn't succeed at getting myself off these medications. The several times I tried, I ended up in the ER with horrible withdrawal symptoms. Being sick & not being able to move around has caused my muscles to deteriorate much faster. I felt hopeless in this situation. Then one day I saw a post in my chronic pain support group on Facebook. The member claimed she was able to get off all her dangerous pain medications & return to a productive life with the help of a plant leaf called Kratom. I was intrigued. I did some research & placed an order. I have been taking Kratom for over a year & a half. I have been able to get off all my pain, depression & anxiety medications. I have been able to do more in the past year & a half then the previous 10 years in a dark haze of pharmaceuticals. Kratom gave me back quality of life. Kratom is not addictive on its own. People with addictive personalities can become addicted to anything. I was on a dark & lonely path to death before Kratom. Now I'm back in the light.\n\nAdult Americans do not need to be mothered by an unelected government agency. I believe we have a Constitutional right to take a natural plant we believe helps us have a quality of life. It boggles my mind that alcohol & tobacco, both of which have no medical value & high potential for abuse are legal, & this agency is trying to ban a plant leaf.

I've tried countless medications with little hope that I would ever actually feel okay in my own skin. Every doctor tells me I'm x, y and/or z, with little consistency. Over the past couple of years, 2 small children later, I could feel myself getting worse and worse and I got to the point where I could barely live my daily life because of how bad the anxiety had become. This all happened while being under the care of a psychologist and psychiatrist. My husband, who was always the one to advocate for my wellness, started looking into all of the different kinds of drugs I was being prescribed and was horrified by the side effects. We came across countless testimonies of how Kratom has changed people's lives for the better so we gave it a shot. I was skeptical, naturally, as pharmaceutical medications barely worked for me, so what was the likelihood of something natural? I was proven wrong the first day I took it. It was probably about a half hour after I took it (encapsulated) and my anxiety, and the other pains caused from my mental health, started to subside. I couldn't believe it! My husband and I are probably two of the biggest skeptics and now probably two of the biggest supporters of Kratom.

I've entered rehab twice under my own volition to help deal with the problem. While I have experienced short periods of success, long-term I was never able to achieve complete sobriety. In 2008 I became addicted to Oxycontin and battled that off and on for 3 years. I finally decided I wanted to quit and attempted to reclaim my life with use of Suboxone. Let me tell you from experience Suboxone is one of the most difficult drugs to quit. Due to the long half-life and the strength of The Binding affinity of the opioid in Suboxone, withdrawals are extremely intense and last for weeks. It can oftentimes take several months to feel anywhere near normal. I can honestly say it was the most miserable experience in my life. After a few attempts I finally discovered kratom which I purchased on the internet. I slowly weaned my usage down and after a few months I quit cold turkey. I was semi miserable for 3 days but it was nowhere near the trauma that I went through trying to quit regular opioids and Suboxone. Literally within 4 days I was back at work and feeling pretty good. I remained clean and sober for about 6 months when I decided that my quality of life was better using a reasonable amount of Kratom rather than trying to white-knuckle my way through life. In just four short years I rebuilt my life. I've repaid much of my debts. I've improved my credit score to the point where I could buy a house should I choose. Restarted my career and I'm currently a director of online marketing for a large company. I have a 401k. I have a beautiful three-year-old son. And come Thursday it will be exactly two years since I've taken my last drink. On top of that it's been 4 years since I've taken an illegal drug. I know that your mandate is to protect the public from dangerous substances. But I truly believe with all my heart that Kratom does more good than harm. With more education and more research this wonderful plant could be the key to ending the nasty opioid epidemic that has claimed so many lives before their time. It pains me to think of all the people who are on the edge of Destruction and have discovered Kratom only recently. I'll be fine. I have medical insurance. I can go down and get Suboxone any day I want. But the people who are not economically advantaged have a very tough choice. And unfortunately many of those same people will make the wrong choice. They will end up back on prescription opioids, or worse. Some of them will end up in the hospital, and some of them will end up dead, never to reach their full potential.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9400","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anon Anon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I know some who struggle with opiate addiction, from what they've told me, going through withdraws is a difficult process and if this in anyway could help them transition off, then it should be made available.

In 1999 comma botched foot surgery. Then in 2010 a car wreck that messed up my back 2014 an injury to my hand and in 2016 I found out I had the generative bone structure in my spine. So I have been in a lot of pain for a long time with no relief what through a family friend earlier this year I was introduced to kratom and it has helped me to be able to function through a normal daily life where I can work without pain I can go to the store without pain comma get the kids up for school make them breakfast. These things that I consider to be normal I had a hard time doing before without a lot of pain. But a family friend who happened to be a veteran of the Marine Corps had been using Kratom for it sometime and found it to be a major relief for his back pains 223 helicopter crashes in Afghanistan being shot in Afghanistan being stabbed in Afghanistan. Plus it helps with his PTSD the anxiety calms down when he's taking it it helped to get him off his opioids that the doctors had gotten him on and which he had gotten addicted to. He was at the point no one even his wife and son wanted to be around him anymore because the opioids made him unbearably mean. But with the help of an open-minded doctor he was able to get off those drugs throw his addiction away all due to kratom. I do believe that the DEA is wrong Kratom should never ever be classified as an opioid or a level 1 drug like heroin that is so wrong.

I was suffering an addiction to Tramadol. The Tramadol was used at first to help with chronic pain that I suffer daily. \nThen one day when I didn't have it on a trip that I had taken, I was sick with flu like symptoms. My daughter is the one that told me that was withdrawal.  It didn't stop there, I went on for years and even went to finding it wherever I could to help stop the WD:( and feel \"normal\". \nI finally decided that I needed to change my life and was scared to death of being sick for God knows how long. A friend told me about Kratom and I figured what do I have to lose, as long as it was not going to be my life. Welllllll, my life has become so much more manageable! I am stunned on a daily basis! My pain is manageable, no more prescription drugs or narcotics. I am for the first time in along time getting my life back on track. \nPlease, for the love of thousands of lives do not make our miracle plant impossible for us to get. \nThank you so much for your time and thoughtfulness in making a decision that will affect thousands and thousands of people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4058","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Linda Nikodem","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am against a ban on kratom. I have someone close to me who was addicted to opiates.  He is one of the nicest, most intelligent people you could ever hope to meet.  When he was ready to stop using he entered into suboxone therapy.  He was able to get through 16 fairly successful months, followed by six months of staying clean.  When the urge to use returned, Suboxone treatment was no longer available because the clinic he had belonged to before was full with a long waiting list.  It is the only one within reasonable driving distance in our area.  Also, it was barely affordable, and would have been a stop gap intervention at most due to its high price.  That's when my friend became aware of kratom.  It was very accessible, legal and affordable.  Most importantly it has been as effective as suboxone in controlling the urge to abuse opiates.  Please do not take away this lifeline by making it illegal or largely unavailable to people without access to other forms of treatment.  Kratom really helps, one thing on a very short list!\nConsider that list, and kratom is the only thing that is affordable, widely available and effective. Please listen to your conscience and keep it legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6044","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\nYou need to start seeing the big picture, people will die if you make kratom illegal","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2004","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jaimie arden","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"DEA\n\n Please do not place Kratom as a Schedule 1 Drug.

I purchase it from a local kratom/kava bar in Gulfport, Florida. I consume it 1-3 times per week with no more than 12 oz during a 24-hour period.\n\nKratom helps me in the following ways:\n\n1. It relieves severe headache/sinus pain to a remarkable degree. My pain is caused by recurring and sometimes severe sinus infections. \n\n2. It is a mild mood enhancer.\n\n3. It reduces general anxiety, which I experience at various intervals.\n\nI've never experienced an undesirable side effect from kratom. There was never a loss of equilibrium. My only caveat is that drinking it on an empty stomach may cause some mild nausea, although vomiting never occurred.\n\nWhen kratom became unavailable to me due to the temporary ban, I did not experience withdrawal, either physically or psychologically. I did miss it, however, because I was at times experiencing the sinus/head pain as well as anxiety. But I never felt an overwhelming desire for kratom.\n\nOf course, various medications are available for alleviating pain and anxiety. But I would much rather use a natural herb for relief as opposed to potentially harmful or toxic medications created by the pharmaceutical companies.\n\nI fully support the legalization of kratom, except the minimum age for its use should be 18.  \n\nFinally, I applaud the DEA for reversing its decision to ban kratom at this time, and sincerely hope that the lifting of the ban becomes permanent.\n\nBest regards,\nDavid Yelenchic","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4133","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Yelenchic","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not give kratom and it's alkaloids a schedule because it has great medical benefits.

Who exactly is benefiting from that decision? Not the public. Make the herb a schedule 2, and research the hell out of it. Make something meaningful out of it, like perhaps a pain killer that isn't so addictive, or hard on the system that it is killing the patients who need to use it regularly. I am tired of watching the death, and addiction here in Wisconsin. When I found out that the deaths from opioids are fraction of the one here in Wisconsin in places like California where marijuana was legal for medical uses. I was sickened, and now this agency wants to do it again. Refuse research and blindly enact law in place of science, and reason.

I found this book listed on Amazon.com: Kratom and Other Mitragynines: The Chemistry and Pharmacology of Opioids from a Non-Opium Source by Robert B. Raffa (Editor) Opioids such as morphine, codeine, and oxycodone are extracts or analogs isolated from a single source: the opium poppy. For a long time, it was believed to be natures only source of opioids. But it now appears that biological diversity has evolved an alternative source of opioid compoundsthose derived from the plant Mitragyna speciosa. This plant, known as Kratom in Thailand or Biak-Biak in Malaysia, has long been used locally as treatment for pain, fever reduction, diarrhea, and even depression. Kratom and Other Mitragynines: The Chemistry and Pharmacology of Opioids from a Non-Opium Sourcepresents an introduction to the chemical and biological properties of alkaloids isolated from M. speciosa as well as their synthetic analogs. The book covers various topics including phytochemistry, medicinal chemistry, and pharmacology. Current research, analgesic effects, and addiction potential are also discussed. As the first extensive text on the basic science and clinical use of Kratom, the book provides readers with a concise yet comprehensive introduction to natures \"other opioid.\" About the Author Robert B. Raffa is a professor of pharmacology in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Temple University School of Pharmacy as well as a research professor in the Department of Pharmacology at Temple University School of Medicine. He has bachelors degrees in chemical engineering and in physiological psychology, masters degrees in biomedical engineering and toxicology, and a doctorate in pharmacology. Dr. Raffa was co-leader for analgesics discovery at Johnson & Johnson and was pivotal in the elucidation of the mechanism of action and development of the analgesic drug tramadol (Ultram). He is the co-holder of several patents, including the combination of tramadol plus acetaminophen (Ultracet). He has published more than 280 scientific articles in peer-reviewd journals and is the co-author or editor of several books. --- Kratom is being used by many people for chronic pain relief, for anxiety and to lessen withdrawal of dangerous drug addiction. To say it has no medical value is plain propaganda. I'm not sure why the DEA or any other government office would want to remove a helpful herbal supplement from public use when so many people are getting tremendous health benefits from it.

In 1999 comma botched foot surgery. Then in 2010 a car wreck that messed up my back 2014 an injury to my hand and in 2016 I found out I had the generative bone structure in my spine. So I have been in a lot of pain for a long time with no relief what through a family friend earlier this year I was introduced to kratom and it has helped me to be able to function through a normal daily life where I can work without pain I can go to the store without pain comma get the kids up for school make them breakfast. These things that I consider to be normal I had a hard time doing before without a lot of pain. But a family friend who happened to be a veteran of the Marine Corps had been using Kratom for it sometime and found it to be a major relief for his back pains 223 helicopter crashes in Afghanistan being shot in Afghanistan being stabbed in Afghanistan. Plus it helps with his PTSD the anxiety calms down when he's taking it it helped to get him off his opioids that the doctors had gotten him on and which he had gotten addicted to. He was at the point no one even his wife and son wanted to be around him anymore because the opioids made him unbearably mean. But with the help of an open-minded doctor he was able to get off those drugs throw his addiction away all due to kratom. I do believe that the DEA is wrong Kratom should never ever be classified as an opioid or a level 1 drug like heroin that is so wrong. I believe Kratom is a very good thing it is a natural plant in which people use for centuries and By Word of Mouth someone spread some good news to other people just like people do every day.\n                                                                                                                          Sincerely yours\n                                                                                                                              anonymous","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22017","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been a miracle herb for me, I suffer from insomnia and restless legs syndrome and have tried many prescriptions that either didn't work or I became dependent on.

In result of that injury and case I was also given a disability rating which would have qualified me to start drawing that disability. Unsatisfied with that idea, and the continuing chronic pain over the last several years, i chose to rely on opiate pain medication to help me continue to work and try to lead an active lifestyle, in spite of my injury. Over the years I of course developed a physical dependency to opiates, which I was fine with if thats what it took. But over those years there were several times when i would have problems getting my prescriptions due to a variety of factors, leaving me in withdrawal which is like dying, but not bieng allowed to die.  Finally, after some years, my doctor of several years retired, causing me to have to find new doctors in the new town i moved to. Due to the growing crisis and stigma attached to the perscribing of opiate pain killers, i was left in pain, and in withdrawal, trying to fight through a mountain of red tape to get the care I needed. Often I feel that skepticism os a tool ised to deter addicts, which is ungodly frustrating , even infuriating, to those of us with legitimate medical cases. My job and my personal life, my very security was greatly impacted and at ris without those meds , and as a father with responsibilities i was so fearful...how was i going to protect us when i couldnt muster the strength to deal with all that was happening with me mentally and physically? Thats when I discovered Kratom. Not only has kratom helped me through the withdrawal process, but through the anxiety and depression that can and may linger for months and even years. And that anxiety and depression can be debilitating to say the least. Kratom isnt as effective at providing the pain relief that opiates did, but it does help...and thanks to this miracle plant Im able to go to work, and ve active outside of work as well...my personal life is better for it as well as Im able to be more social and interact with others, as im not held back by mental and physical pain to the point of not being able to. I hope that eventually, with the right care and physical conditioning, i may not need anything at all. The chances are slim, but i feel optimistic, perhaps the best side effect i could tout from this wonderful discovery! Theres no high involved either. In the beginning I was taking pretty hefty doses...and never once did i feel high in the least..just ok again, just ABLE, again .so it doesnt effecr my judgement or performance negatively, at home nor in the workplace.

There are currently millions of people who still do not have health insurance, even with mandatory Obamacare. Without kratom there would be nothing left for pain relief, without first seeing a doctor and getting a prescription, except for alcohol. Please don't take away the only thing that might provide relief to those who cannot afford insurance, doctors, or the high cost of prescriptions imposed on us by the greedy pharmaceutical companies. I have used kratom and did not turn into a heroin addict. I would like to be able to continue to use it for my arthritis and deteriorated vertebrae. I do not want to have to get a prescription for potentially addictive medications such as hydrocodone or OxyCotton. Let's face it, we know those are addictive, yet doctors prescribe them all the time. I'd rather stick with a natural herb and have control over my own decisions about my body.

I am a 65 yr old woman. The only grandmother to 9 wonderful grandchildren. WThis is my story. I hope it will help you to understand why I feel it is an unjust move by the DEA to put Kratom under schedule 1. \nI am a 65 yr old woman. The only Grandmother to 9 wonderful grandchildren.\nI have Lyme Disease that took 8 months to diagnose, which means I have late stage Lyme and though I have been through treatment I have been left with chronic diffuse bone and muscle pain and crippling fatigue. I also have bone spurs and stenosis in my cervical spine which causes a condition called Occipital Neuralgia. Occipital Neuralgia causes intense pressure headaches, shooting nerve pain and extreme muscle spasms in neck and shoulders. I tell you this morbid story so you will understand what Kratom means for me. It means a real life. I have always been a very active person. I have worked all of my life, eaten well and exercised. My jobs ranged from catering, working in greenhouses, owning my own store and territory manager for a high end gift and decor company. That was 8 yrs ago. For the last 8 yrs I have lived with pain and fatigue as my constant companions. I have missed family gatherings, gone on family vacations at the beach where I stayed in bed the whole time, missed my grandchildren's school events and more. I was on pain management with opioids for 6 of those yrs. my pain was made sometimes bearable and I either felt manic and not like myself or fatigued and  fuzzy brained. It  left me with limited freedom for living. Every 4 hrs the withdraw set in and I would feel horrible.  It was a life chained to a heavy weight that would jerk me back into increased pain throughout the day. 18 months ago I tried Kratom and have the joy of getting busier each week since then. I am out of bed everyday and have the energy to babysit my grandchildren, go to school activities and family celebrations. I swam in the ocean this summer and taught my granddaughter how  to dive through waves. To say it felt glorious is an understatement. I still have bad days and flare up's from my illnesses but they are less often. I am exercising and active between them.   \n Kratom has done this for me, not only helping me with my pain but giving me a release from the overwhelming fatigue. I ask you to please stop this action from the DEA not only for me but for my grandchildren who now have a grandmother who is an active and loving part of their lives. To make my wellness into a felony is beyond my comprehension. I have never felt high from Kratom just normal. That is all an ill person wants to feel is normal and that is how I want to feel. Not sick, not in pain, not fuzzy headed and  not exhausted just normal. Please take into consideration the multitudes of people getting help from this plant and help stop the DEA from scheduling this leaf that has helped so many.\n       Thank you for your time, Karen Mattison","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0961","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Karen Mattison","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My girlfriend is suffering from opiate addiction and kratom is an alternative solution  to  assist in her recovery.

I see people struggle with addiction day in and day out, and it's no way to live. \nI was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at 16, an inflammatory chronic bladder condition Interstitial Cystitis at 20 (had symptoms previously), and more recently Inflammatory Bowel Disease. I have T 11-12 disc ruptured in my back, and chronic nerve pain from the back issues and from Lyme Disease. I am a recovering Anorexic, and have been diagnosed with Anxiety and Bipolar Disorder. \nI can't remember the last time I felt okay before kratom. Having had lost most of a will to live, and struggling with daily chronic pain in various parts of the body, mentally and physically. I would fantasize about being hit by a car head on so i wouldn't have to deal with it anymore. Lying awake all night from racing thoughts, nightmares or pain. An awful way to live.\nI first learned about Kratom in 2013. I was researching botanicals and stumbled upon it. I did a lot of research before ordering, and found Kratom that worked well for me.\nKratom gave me a life I couldn't remember ever having. My low moods stopped being nearly as low. I wasn't terrified as much to leave the house and didn't feel afraid out in public. Racing thoughts calmed down and I could catch up with myself and not be in an ongoing manic cycle. I could sit or stand for longer than a few minutes without starting to experience a burning pain. I could sleep through the night without having to use the bathroom 6-8 times. Usually if I slept through using the bathroom i would wake up with terrible pressure on my bladder and burning pain in the urethra because of Interstitial Cystitis. This doesn't happen nearly as often with Kratom.\nI feel like, I don't even know how to describe. Not the empty dead shell I always thought I was supposed to feel like. Too tired and exhausted to take care of the dog or myself. Too depressed to want to wake up the next day. Fear of becoming addicted to pain medications for my conditions. I turned down opiates so often, and would push through the pain to not risk the addiction. I almost threw it all out, contemplating to just take the pain pills and eventually let them run their course and take me. But something in me didn't really want that. \nKratom helped me find my true self, the self that didn't want the devastation of being dependent on pain pills, and eventually addicted to them. After a bladder procedure in 2011 i had to be on oxycodone for weeks, and it was awful. I couldn't go to work, was sick all day from the pills and felt so out of it and awful. \nI can't imagine a world where people recovering from opiate addiction, treating PTSD, chronic pain or mental illnesses would be denied their lifeline. Kratom is our lifeline. I know I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for Kratom. I've been able to get my life back, and be able to do things that I couldn't before due to my chronic illnesses. I am forever grateful for this plant, and thrilled to see how many people it really helps. Please, save Kratom and save lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2055","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W\n\nI am a 50 year old software engineer and business analyst and have been using Kratom off and on for over 2 years. I play competitive tennis at a fairly high level and have had several severe muscle and tendon tears over the past few years. Prior to finding Kratom I had to get an opiod prescription from my doctor and/or take up to 6 Advil per day when injured. Opiods create a fuzzyness, for lack of a better word, in my mind which impacts my work performance. Kratom provides similar relief to opiod/Advil combinations without the work inhibiting fuzzyness and without the danger of liver damage that comes with Advil use.\n\nI realize that Kratom is probably seen as a threat by opiod manufacturers who have a strong voice in our government. I just hope you listen to the citizens on this one and keep Kratom available and legal for those who choose to use it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3866","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeff Hamilton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nMy name is Jennifer Keswick-Caballero. I am 46 years of age and work as a lab technician in Denver Colorado. I consider myself to be a mature, intelligent, and responsible adult who uses kratom on a regular basis to alleviate depression, help with focus, and boost my energy as needed. My husband uses kratom to help with chronic back pain in lieu of other addictive and damaging pain medications such as opiate drugs or NSAIDs. We have been using kratom in it's powdered form for over 5 years. Neither of us has experienced any negative side-effects due to our kratom use. In fact, I went to the doctor's office for a health check-up last spring, had blood work done, and received a perfectly clean bill of health.\n\nI am writing to you to voice my strong opposition to the DEA's plans to classify mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as schedule one substances. This classification would stall scientific research of kratom's potential medical benefits and force many Americans to turn to other forms of harmful prescription drugs in order to combat pain, depression, and other health issues. This would exacerbate the opioid epidemic that has taken hold in the United States and be a great disservice to the many Americans that rely on kratom to relieve a myriad of health issues.\n\nAs you are aware, there have been 15 kratom-related deaths reported between 2014 and 2016. None of these deaths can be attributed to kratom use alone. In fact, 14 of the 15 deaths involved other substances and the 15th was due to severe hypoxic encephelopathy, which has not been reported as a known side-effect of kratom use. https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DEA-2016-0015-0004  15 kratom related deaths is nothing compared to the number deaths that occurred due to accidental acetaminophen overdose during that same time period.\n\nIn closing, I urge you to reconsider your plans to classify mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as schedule one substances. There is no \"imminent hazard to public safety\" as has been claimed by the DEA. Restricting access of mature adults to kratom only benefits the pharmaceutical companies that sell opiate drugs and NSAIDs. Please do right by the American public and allow scientific research on the effects of kratom to continue without the unnecessary constraints that are placed on substances in the schedule one category.\n\nThank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18937","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Keswick Caballero","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do more research before making illegal.

I implore you to make an informed decision by educating yourself on the relative safety of this plant compared to coffee, alcohol, tobacco, and prescription drugs, and I urge you to research the medicinal potential that this plant has ALREADY displayed. Please re-consider placing this plant in the most severe scheduling category and consider reasonable legislation that would restrict its use to 18+ like other states are already considering. The following are pertinent facts for your consideration:\n\n* Kratom is a plant, NOT a synthetic chemical or Street Drug\n\n* Kratom is in the same family as the coffee tree (Rubiaceae)\n\n* Kratom is no more habit forming than coffee see recent article by the cato institute, www.cato.org/blog/addiction-problem-case-kartom\n\n* Kratom has been safely used for thousands of years as a medicine\n\n* No one has ever died from taking Kratom alone.\n\n* It is impossible to overdose on Kratom\n\n* Tens of thousands of Americans can attest to the beneficial properties of Kratom\n\n* The state of WI may reverse their ruling to ban kratom see https://www.botanicallegaldefense.org/wisconsin-kratom-community-looking-to-deschedule-kratom/\n\nFurthermore, Kratom and its 30+ active alkaloids show tremendous dietary supplement potential. The legislation, as it currently reads, would place Kratom and its alkaloids in the most severe scheduling category, schedule I. Making this plant and its constituents schedule I, effectively makes it impossible for legitimate researchers to discover and develop valuable medicines from Kratom that could benefit the lives of millions! This is not a sensible approach to regulating this plant.\n\nCurrent peer reviewed studies on Kratom and its constituents have shown that Kratom has no acute toxicity1, displays powerful antioxidant and antibacterial properties2, assists with drug and alcohol withdrawal symptoms3, contains several oxindole alkaloids which have exhibited potent immunomodulation properties, and even contains constituents that have exhibited anti-cancer properties!4 A brief search in any scholarly database will present hundreds of peer reviewed studies andclinical trials that can attest to the medical potential of this plant.\n\nA few more facts for you to consider when making your informed decision:\n\n* According to the CDC, cigarette smoking causes 440,000 deaths in the United States every year; about one of every five deaths in this country are caused by cigarettes!\n\n* Alcohol causes more than 1.2 million emergency room visits and 2.7 million physician office visits due to excessive drinking each year!5\n\n* Pharmaceutical drugs are one of the leading causes of death in this country, killing one American every 19 minutes! 6\n\n* Prescription opiate pain killers account for more than 475,000 emergency room visits annually.7\n\n* Over the counter pain relievers such as Tylenol send over 56,000 people to the emergency room each year with liver related complications.8\n\n* The Mayo Clinic has reported a 28% increase in overall mortality in people who drink 4 cups of coffee per day.9\n\nIn summary, the current proposed legislation places the medicinal herb Kratom and its constituents in the Schedule I category which is reserved for highly dangerous, addictive drugs that have NO medical value. The medical literature has proven Kratom and its constituents to be quite the contrary; a useful, safe, medicinal plant that has been used for thousands of years without incident. Kratom does not present a significant threat to human health or safety, when compared to legal substances such as alcohol, tobacco, Rx medications, Tylenol, or even coffee! Scheduling this plant would prohibit any future research and criminalize tax paying, productive citizens in your state as drug users, who are simply benefiting from the use of this plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7830","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brett Leist","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used kratom for over ten years now and find it supplements my healthy lifestyle both physically and emotionally.

While I was not successful in completely quitting right away, the kratom helped me cut back gradually until I was taking only one tablet per day.  Withdrawals made it impossible to stay off opiates but kratom made them bearable.  There were no methadone clinics in my rural town and Suboxone was not available to me either.  It was cold turkey or kratom.  \n\nToday, I still use kratom for back and shoulder pain caused by scoliosis & injuries sustained in a car accident.  It is an occasional thing along with my other herbal supplements (valerian root, ginseng & passionflower).  Losing kratom would leave me without an option for moderate to severe pain, putting me at risk for reigniting my opiate addiction.  I cannot take that risk.  \n\nI'm currently employed full-time and considering going back to school next Spring.  I am an asset to society.

I have a wife and son who need me to be sober and present for them.  \n\nI know kratom is not a magic cure for everyone, but adults must be trusted to make decisions regarding our own health.  The risks of kratom are far fewer than those of heavy narcotics or even alcohol.

She tried rehabilitation facilities along with the saboxin and methadone for withdrawal symptoms with absolutely no success. She was approached by a gentleman who was once addicted to heroin himself for 7 years. He told her about Kratom. My daughter contacted me and asked if i could research it. Needless to say i spent countless hours researching.  My daughter returned home in hopes of trying the kratom. After 4 days of taking the kratom she was up and eating, socializing, and feelingback to a normal healthy state.  After 1 week she did not even feel the need to takr the kratom daily.  I am beyond grateful to that guardian angel who took the time to present this herbal supplement to my daughter.

I cannot afford to enter rehab or the suboxone treatment, not covered by insurance.  I started out 10 years ago taking 3 norco a day, over time additional meds were added.  I ended with 300 norco 10mg, 100 oxycodone 10mg and a 50 mg fentanyl patch.  I was not aware of the severity of these meds, my doc assured me I was not an addict, so not to worry.  What a joke, she suddenly withou notice retired.  I was in trouble, big trouble, no where to turn pain management just took almost every thing away immediately and when I turned to other sources they promptly threw me out of pain mamgement.  I tried suboxone only to find I had to pay out of pocket for office visits and meds.  Cannot afford that. I am a 60 year old female, never in any trouble in my life, facing this mess, the shame that comes with it.  I accidentally heard about kratom, having been using it effectively for months, without side effects, affordable, it has reduce my incessant cravings for pain medicine.  I don't know what I'll due if kratom is not available to me.  Why would you even consider kratom a problem, it answered my prayers.  I hope you will resist any government involvement, the government has proven to make things worse never better.  I know if kratom helped me it is helping many other folks in my situation.

I survived a very serious auto accident 14 years ago.  From this accident I have spinal injuries and I am in constant pain.  I started using a botanical product 5 years ago to manage my pain.  This plant is called \"Kratom\".  The use of Kratom to manage my pain has provided to me an option for pain management other than opiate based drugs. I want a natural means to manage my chronic pain and Kratom provides that to me.  I have been able to have a career and raise three children because I learned to manage my physical injuries and pain with Kratom, massage & chiropractic therapy.   Kratom is utilized by Americans to break away from opiate addiction and as is an alternative to opiates.  Kratom is a natural and should remain a legal botanical. Responsible consumers are using it safely across the country and the world for relief of a variety of both mental and physical ailments. The situations and circumstances of a few do not represent the many.  Implementing sweeping, harmful legislation based on misinformation and alarmism is not a public safety solution. Kratom should not be on any dangerous drug list.  It is a plant, which gives us a product that has a medicinal use.

Though I'm a female, I have worked every area of construction for years, even to this day. Physical labor leaves the body sore and tired. I have had back problems for years unrelated to my profession. I was prescribed Vicodin, Percocet and Oxycodone by \"responsible\" physicians. If there is a real threat to the health of this country, it's the poison given to us by doctors. The pain meds left me depressed, tired, out of it and after a while physically addicted. No, I was not addicted because I abused the medication, I was addicted because I followed a doctors orders. I had to go through a physical and mental detox from a pill our trusted doctors gave me. Afterwards I went years dealing with the aches and pain until I found kratom. It eases my back pain and gives me energy comparable to a strong cup of coffee. The fact that this plant is even slightly being considered a danger and under the threat of being taken from responsible adults is absurd. Dangerous? Alcohol is dangerous. Pain pills are dangerous. Tabacco is dangerous. Kratom is not dangerous. Im in danger of having a right as an adult in the United States of America taken away from me for no viable reason. What are my other options?

I discovered Kratom about eight years ago.  I was, at this time, bordering opiate addiction.  After severely injuring my knee and having corrective reconstruction surgery, my body heavily craved how the prescription medication made me feel.  Stopping seemed impossible because I would become very ill any time that I did not have evidence of the pain medicine in my body. I did not want this dependency to continue.\n\nI stumbled upon Kratom while researching ways to end opiate dependency.  What I learned, I believe, is information that needs to be made public.  It is information that could help the many who deal with this addiction to a far greater level that I could ever understand.\n\nIt's simple:\nThree to Five grams of Kratom ends the bitter and painful withdraw symptoms caused by the ceased use of opiates.  I quit opiates instantly after my first dose of Kratom.  I've never looked back.  I take Kratom daily still today and believe that it has positive affects on mood, energy levels and your overall sense of well being.  I consume Kratom with no guilt.  Kratom is natural.  It is a product of the earth.  It is raw when we consume it. It is leaves on a tree.  But it is also a large solution to an even bigger problem in our nation. \n\nI hope that this message reaches someone who understands the power that this tree potentially has and how it could possible change the lives of so many who need change.\n\nPlease save Kratom.

I researched online how I can look for a remedy for my anxiety without taking heavy medication and I found kratom. Since taking kratom I have come off all of my medication and it helps me with being social and having less anxiety on a daily basis- if there are days that I do not take kratom I do not go through any withdrawals but I believe it helps me pass through the anxiety so I can function normally.

I would like to start off by talking about my past and why I use Kratom to help me. Starting at a very young age my siblings and I were taken away from our mother by CPS and put into foster care due to Real drugs like Meth. We then stayed at the children's home for a few months until a family was able to foster us. We got lucky to be able to stay with each other ( all of my siblings- two brothers and a sister). Unfortunately we were placed into a home that had more problems we could imagine. The father was using kids in the foster system for the check he received. He had about two more foster kids plus two of his own. He was an alcoholic that was very abusive to his foster kids. there were times we had to eat popcorn for breakfast, lunch and dinner while his family had real food. I can remember standing against the wall for 10 hours a day for doing nothing wrong. He ended up abusing my brother extremely bad. He had seven heart attacks then he was in a coma for three months. He is paralyzed and has brain damage. That was a very difficult time for all of my family. My mom was in jail at the time. We were placed into a better homes. We were broken up for about five months then back to our mother. We stayed with her for a while then the real drugs consumed her yet again. We were back to child protective services while my mother went back to jail. We were broken up for a while then we made it back to the old mother again. The time we got to spend with my mother was the best time of my life at that time. Unfortunately she could not stay off drugs. We went from motel to motel time after time. When she would leave us in the room and go do her thing it was heart breaking to watch her leave. I felt like a dog being left at home that cries by the window. We once again got taken away. We were put into a nice family a speech therapist fell in love with my brother when she worked with him. I could tell you about a million other horror stories in between all of that to try to show you I know what life can do to you and that I have seen the worst in life and in people. I have done very well for myself but have also had my own struggles. I was prescribed Vicodin for a period of time and was addicted. I was not out of control but I knew I had an issue. I heard about Kratom and how it can help with withdrawals. I decided to try it. And thank the lord because this Kratom stuff was actually working. It made me feel normal and calm. I was so thankful something was going to finally help me. I was able to quit immediately without even missing an ounce of sleep or work. If you know about withdrawals you know that what I'm saying is amazing. I did not have any side affects that ever made me worry or feel bad. All I had to do was mix it with milk. I quit taking Kratom for about a year and started back up for my anxiety and stress. It helps tremendously with my anxiety and I am so thankful for that. I do not have to take something even more addictive then Vicodin like a benzodiazepine. I have overcome so much in my life, I have a great job an amazing wife and dogs. This world has a tremendous amount of opportunity but it can also take everything you have. I have been able to experience both sides. I know a lot about addiction and Kratom is not addicting if anything it has the power to help people overcome their challenges in life. This plant helps me so much with anxiety and stress from things I had to grow up with. this plant is amazing please do not take this away from the public let the FDA do their research so we can figure out the real power of this plant and help change the world for the better as so many pharmaceutical drugs have a strong hold on many of our people and family. Kratom can help. \n\n\nJon","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11673","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Reference: Docket No. DEA-442W.\n\nNy name is Keith Pascucci. I live in Scarsdale New York. I am a 44 year old Catholic school teacher for the Archdiocese of New York City. I have been an educator, and the Director of Technology for the Archdiocese since 1996.\n\nSince the decision to potentially make Kratom a schedule one controlled substance, myself, and the people of the Kratom community, are suffering a massive wave of depression, anxiety, panic, and emotional stress. Those of us that use Kratom to manage our various ailments are absolutely terrified that our beloved leaf is on the chopping block. This whole situation is causing me unimaginable mental agony.\n\nI use Kratom tea daily for my various spinal cord problems. I was diagnosed with Spinal Stenosis, Scoliosis, and Degenerative Disk Disease in 2000. I suffered in agony until 2011 when I finally found Kratom. This gentle herb works amazingly well to bring my pain level from a 10+, to a 1-2, without the use of prescription, or over the counter pain relievers. I also found that it offers a gentle mood boost and provides me with mental clarity and focus. A cup of Kratom tea has replaced my morning cup of coffee. I have never been an opiate user, so I really cannot make claims about opiates. I do know that if I were to take opiates, I would not be able to drive my car to work. Opiates are mind altering, and people cannot function normally while on them.\n\nI also would not be able to teach. I teach in an elementary school setting, and in order to do my job, I must be awake, motivated, creative, and patient. Kratom assists in managing my pain perfectly, without the dangers of addiction, possible DUI, and all the other toxic side effects that come from using synthetic pharmaceutical medications. My decade long use of Tylenol, Advil, and Aleve did extensive damage to my liver, kidneys, and stomach. I have documentation proving all of the aforementioned organ damage. I have suffered acute renal failure and acute kidney failure as well as decreased liver function due to Tylenol and Advil. I also suffered a lot of pain, and numerous bleeding ulcers, as a direct result of Naproxen Sodium, the active ingredient in Aleve. Since finding Kratom, all of these conditions have been reversed, and thankfully my body was able to heal. I still have multiple spinal problems, that would be causing me debilitating pain if it were not for Kratom.\n\nThis potential ban is certainly not about safety or health. Prescription drugs, tobacco, and alcohol kill hundreds of thousands of people each year, but they are still legal and approved by the FDA. The pharmaceutical industry wants to control every medication in this country, limiting the options for holistic medicine. They want us to believe that their chemicals are the only answer. I am a well educated Kratom user, and can see right through what is happening here. This potential ban could destroy the lives of thousands of Americans under the guise of an agency that is supposed to be here to protect us. The DEA will be creating felony criminals that they will then attempt to arrest, flooding our courts and prisons with good, law abiding people that are Veterans, nurses, teachers, doctors, lawyers, priests, nuns, parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and every other walk of life you can imagine. This could potentially be a huge mistake, and as a result, the overdoses, suicides, and addiction rates will skyrocket. Alabama has already proven this. The overdose death rate has risen 140% since they hastily banned Kratom in their state. Prohibition does not work. The war on drugs is a losing battle that has cost American taxpayers trillions of dollars.\n\nI am asking you to take my story into consideration, and I ask that the DEA does not schedule what could be the answer to this country's massive and exponentially growing opiate addiction epidemic. An age restriction of 18+ would be the perfect compromise. The Kratom community has safety regulations in place that have worked quite well yo this point. The 15 alleged Kratom related deaths have all shown multiple substances in the toxicology reports. The FDA is now doing research and studies to show how safe Kratom really is, and I hope their findings prove what I already know, and have experienced first hand.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\nKeith Pascucci\n11 Jackson Avenue\nUnit 72\nScarsdale, NY 10583\nCell: (914)-497-2571","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3263","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Keith Pascucci","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been an incredible relief for my chronic pain.

I am a recovering addict, and have been clean for the entire 5 years since I found, and began using kratom. At my worst I was using Oxymorphone, and Oxycontin nonstop throughout the day for over 3 years; All thanks to an emergency appendectomy in which Doctors felt the need to dose me with percocets like candy, and once I felt how good they made me feel when the surgery pain left, I was itching for more. I have no one to blame but myself for falling into the pit of addiction....But I also have no one to thank, but myself, for stopping cold turkey and going through the worst withdrawals and sickness I've ever felt in my life. Once I finally started to come out of the detox fog I started to research natural options to get my life back on track and to get my mind right enough to enjoy life again. Kratom has completely turned my life around and keeps me upbeat, motivated and in good spirits since I found it. As it stands right now, have also quit drinking all together, including social drinking, I've quit using tobacco (after years of use), and I also quit a recreational pot habit. I can only chalk that up to kratom as, I feel it's all I need and I have no urge to use anything anything, even the TOTALLY acceptable, alcohol. Not only does it destroy all depression for me & make me focused and productive while working, it works wonders in helping me relax and sleep at night without the hangover and fogginess, alcohol used to present me with. \n\nIf you're going to ban it, which I think is totally unacceptable, atleast come out and be honest: You are banning it because Big Pharm is seeing a profit opportunity, and they want the money they think they can make on it. Don't come out and lie about it being a public hazard, when you know damn well there are ZERO reported deaths contributed to kratom by itself. But just so you know, there ARE MANY reports of this plant saving MANY lives; This is 2016, the web does exist, and people know folks like you, are NOT the gospel, and be all end all when it comes to the truth. \n\nIn conclusion, I implore you to NOT ban kratom, and if you feel the need to regulate it; regulate it like you do Herbal Supplements at most. Scheduling is NOT something that should be in the same conversation as kratom.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17266","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Before I tried kratom l was unemployed, had low self-esteem,negative body image,and was suicidal.

I tried cold turkey and treatment and nothing worked.  I used Kratom in its organic state which did not create a high rather it reduced my urge to use and also allowed me to break free of the emotional withdrawals of opiates.  I no longer use Kratom and there was no withdrawals from Kratom.  I can only guess that the big pharmacy would like to remove this organic, herbal to prevent users from withdrawing on Opiates unless one purchases another magic pill from a doctor for withdrawals.  I used Kratom as a tea and this ancient method has been going on for hundreds of years.  It has therapeutical benefits; and I believe that this planet affects the profitability of big business.  \n\nKratom does not alter any senses.  It does not make you lazy or drowsy.  It is not like Marijuana, Opiates, Tobacco or alcohol which has addictive characteristics.  Yes there may be exotic forms of the product that may intensify a calming effect, but ultimately the product is like a supplement. And if this supplement counters the effects of Opiate withdrawal like it did for me, well the choice for legal acceptable uses are far more beneficial than the deaths from overdoses to opiates.  Prince, Michael Jackson, Witney, the list goes on for famous opiate suicides.  \n\nThe true constituents are the people of this great company and not the corporations that pay our politicians.  I have read many articles pertaining to the events to ban this drug and the requests to ban are sponsored by big pharmacy.  \n\nKratom is like Gray Earl tea; it is relaxing and calming.  However, it has the ability to reducing opiate withdrawals and I never had a side effect other than the one that helped me kick an opiate habit.  I truely hope Kratom will continue to be an options for the many others that find the need to kick the opiate habit.  Kratom is a solution to beat a deadly habit created by big pharmacy.  And the corporations sponsoring the elimination of an organic planet, should not have this much power.

We all know that prescription abuse is on the rise, 45 people die every day from opioid prescription pain killers, and I believe that Kratom could help with lower these numbers. \n\nWhen I come across people's testimonials of how they overcame years of drug or alcohol abuse with the help of Kratom and how they are still clean, I became overjoyed with happiness, happiness that there was hope for people who needed it.  Now with Kratom at risk for becoming illegal, I feel sadness, sadness for the ones who finally bettered themselves and will now possibly face relapse because they can no longer get the help they had from Kratom.  Please, please, please don't ban Kratom, Kratom is helping people be the person they want to be, a better clean person, a person who can finally be pain free and do normal day to day activates.  If there was any time to listen to The People, the time is now!!!! Keep Kratom Legal!!!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5244","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban this until a thorough investigation has occurred.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12960","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Wolfgang","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped so many people like me, who suffer from severe depression, anxiety, PTSD, and more.

I am a 28 year old military veteran suffering with post traumatic stress disorder. I have been taking Kratom for 2 years. It started after I was prescribed medicine by the VA that made me not function with day to day life the way I had before suffering from PTSD. I was introduced to Kratom by another veteran at the clinic. I was able to quit every drug I was on and go back to living my life. Thanks to Kratom I know am a successful real estate agent and have been happily married for 2 years. I am beyond scared that this drug will get banned and I will have to go back to taking pharmaceuticals that depress me and make it hard to function. This drug is safe and can be very positive for all kinds of illnesses. It really saddens me to see this in the same light as heroin, LSD, and other narcotics. This is complete ludacris. If this drug gets banned it will not only ruin my life but millions of other hard working tax paying Americans. I fought for this country for my right to take a natural suppliment that can be compared to caffeine.

It was so hard to stop because of the withdrawals that I was never able to, until I heard about Kratom... Now I'm completely drug free thanks and only thanks to this MILD plant that doesn't get you high in the slightest, but just eases ALL the symptoms of the horrendous opioid withdrawal symptoms.\nUnfortunately and sadly the only other option for people like me is Suboxone, an opioid 10 times stronger than morphine, that does get you high (unlike Kratom). Suboxone was the last opioid o had to get off of (and the HARDEST to get off of) and sadly suboxone clinics are popping up everywhere, the ads are all over the Internet and radio. The reason it's so popular for addict is because it does get you extremely high! My heart wishes Kratom to be available to Everyone and for suboxone to be BANNED!\nPlease instead of banning, regulate it and put quality control guidelines for suppliers. The only Kratom that's dangerous (like anything other supplement) are \"Kratom\" that have been mixed with other stuff and labeled as Kratom... If there was just a nationwide regulation on quality and purity, making sure there were no additives in the Kratom, there would not be ANY deaths or poison control calls.\nKratom is extremely mild and doesn't get you high, so there's no new to restrict it at all. Please just regulate it... Kratom literally saved my life and IS THE ANSWER FOR THE NATIONAL OPIOID EPIDEMIC. So please don't fill our jails and force people to take suboxone or go back on drugs. Please keep Kratom legal and regulated.

I am 38 and live on the Northside of Chicago. I currently manage the luxury suites at Soldier Field, and it's all thanks to Kratom. Who I am, It has helped me become a positive, active, contributing member of society. I am 38, and the only reason why I m not dead because of an OD or getting robbed in a drug deal is because of Kratom. I live in my own apartment in a nice part of the city, all thanks to kratom. When I was a homeless, unemployed, criminal minded drug addict I did not have a place to call my own, or did I care. All that mattered was my next injection. I have a job, a good one, along with pursuing things that I believed were behind me. I've started to explore, with a new vibrance, all the things that drugs suppressed. I realize how much I care about creativity, learning and other people. Drugs robbed me of that and it has taken time to get back to a confident perspective in my life. I was pushed alternatives such as methadone and suboxone and all they did was buy me a little more time to do something destructive, so I could do something destructive. Don't you see the insanity? Kratom has offered me a safe, natural, alternative to the dangerous life I was leading chasing street drugs. Kratom was not easy for me to find and took painstaking research and fortitude to free myself of my heroin addiction without having to go to some church and tell strangers my secrets. It's more than that, Kratom works and has helped to relieve the symptoms a myriad of pills never could. I believe it should be researched, not criminalized, in the name of the countless load ones we have all lost to this shameful disease. the blood is now on you, because you are hearing the effects of kratom, first hand, and the choice should be an easy one.

I'm 34 yrs old. I've been in the construction industry since 2002.  Essentially since I left high school. I've been self employed since 2005.  Not. Day goes by where I'm not busting ass. I spent 6 months of my life in New Orleans after Katrina volunteering.  I'm a single father.  I was a semi professional BMX rider & well respected,  I rode motocross for 10 years on and off.. and well worked my butt off to afford my hobbys.  The list of things I've done in this life is respectable,  I love people and I always do the best I can to help people when ever I can.  I hope by now you have a feel for me and my motivation in life.. I'm always busy!  2012 I had a minor accident at work that led to low back problems 2 herniated discs.  We're unsure if it's 100% from work or the years of Bmx/motocross/snowboarding,  I was put on pain Meds something I was new to. Just under a year later I was in an accident and narrowly avoided a head on collision.  Still totaled my brand new car and well two more herniated discs in my neck.  Pain Meds went up.. it lasted for about 3 years then I begin to hate how they robbed my soul.   May I add I also have knee and shoulder issues from ridding bike and motorcycles over the years.. to keep things short and effective, to get to the point I was feed up with the feeling pain Meds gave me.. the physical addiction that comes without warning.. it's something that is unavoidable when on a daily routine of pain Meds just to live out your daily life.. then I decided to do the best I could to make a change., I had heard of Kratom from online forums and I decided to give it try.. it was the best things I've done for myself in my life period! I've been off pain Meds for over a year and I haven't looked back.  I take Kratom 2 times a day sometimes 3 depending on pain. I sleep amazingly! It helps stabilize my mood when in pain and tired from work and overwhelmed.. it helps me with energy to get me through the day.  I could go on.. it's changed my life.  I have no physical addiction.  I can go days without it but I have difficult sleeping without it due to muscle spasms and severe cramping in neck and back.  All of which used to be controlled by hard pain Meds and muscle relaxers.. now I need none of them.  I can't express enough how it's helped me deal with my unfortunate circumstances.  I ask you kindly to listen to us and do what's right.  Please do not ban Kratom.  I'm severely panicking now because of this potential ban.  I understand your role in keeping the people safe however please look further and you will find that this is beneficial.. better than so many legal substances on the market today widely available to people. Ban pain Meds! They ruin lives! People don't need them.  This is all we need.  I'm trying to be as upfront as honest as I can be.  I'm sorry if this comment isn't structured properly and or jumps around.  This is what is coming strait from my thoughts and emotions right now.  This is more important than trying to prepare a perfect comment for you to read because this is real. This is my life! My daughters life! My fapmily's life! Please do what's right. Please!

I tried prescription drugs (serious side effects) and many other remedies until I learned about Kratom at the RLS official website's message board.

I am a 45 year old male dealing with  chronic pain and have 2 herniated discs at L4-L5 and L5-S1 areas of my spine.  I used to be prescribed Morphine + Oxycodone.  I first heard about kratom online, and decided to try it out.  That was 2 years ago and I have completely stopped the expensive, dependent nature of the pharmaceutical drugs.  It's worked wonders for my back and even though I still feel pain, it's much less of an issue.  Even while on low doses of the drugs mentioned above, I would have some sort of awful side effect, but most of the time I had a lethargic lack of energy and was constantly numb.  I had no emotion.  That is what those drugs do to a person, at least it did for me.\n\nI'm not saying those drugs don't have their place, but unlike kratom, those drugs are not only damaging to the user (easily overdose), but damaging to the friends and family of the person taking them.  It changes a person's personality and not for the better.  I lost a lot of friends because of my mood swings and all I cared about was taking my next pill.  I am completely fine with limiting Kratom to someone who is 21, if teenage use is an issue, but I personally never have had the bad withdrawals like I did from the harder prescribed opiates.  You also cannot overdose on Kratom, at least not to be life threatening, which is a huge benefit.   I hear it's also good for those folks with anxiety and depression, and it truly has saved my life and made me into a more productive person.  I can speak from experience that it helped me get off the harder drugs (which was still not easy), because I did my research on ways of quitting and this was the best option rather then go on another opiate (methadone), so I asked my doctor and showed him what I found. My DOCTOR gave me the \"okay\" to give it a try since it was legal and he was aware of reports of people getting off the hard stuff, which was extremely helpful.  This simple plant has been a life saver for me and I'm sure many others..\n\nIf the DEA does indeed ban Kratom, I and others like myself who have fought hard to live a good and reasonable life and to deal with the hand God has given me, would be in a very difficult position.  I don't want to go back on the hard drugs, but unfortunately that would be my only option as the pain can be so unbearable at times without my current kratom regimen.\n \nFinally, I just wanted to talk about the scheduling it on the same level as HEROIN is being considered.  It's nothing like heroin (although I haven't tried that) but I have read about the effects and watch the news.  I don't want to be considered a criminal simply because I am trying to live my life and the last 3-4 years I've taken kratom without issue.  This all just doesn't make any sense, I don't know where it's coming from, and I really hope you understand that enforcing this will cause immense suffering to people like myself.  I have always respected the laws of our country and have fought to protect them, however this is the one that I can't stand behind right now since it will affect me personally at a level that others without chronic pain can't comprehend.  Where is the compassion?  I don't even know why or how this became an issue, since it's been legal for a very long time and I really don't want to go back to finding a doctor and living that old life again.  I'll also have a very hard time destroying the kratom I already have if it becomes illegal because of the benefit it provides, and I'll be stuck between the law and my well-being, because I have nothing else for the pain!  My wife is very worried about this as well, and found this site for me to make a post.  I'm not sure if anyone will read this, but it seems so outrageous.\n\nPlease reconsider adding this to the scheduled \"drugs\".  I have served my country and I believe this is an excessive use of force in applying these severe restrictions to something so small.  That's all I have to say.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13271","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Keith Brown","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a person with both knees that are bone on bone and being prescribed pain medications, I found myself becoming addicted to them.

I baffled behind the proposal to place it into the same legal category as such terrible drugs as heroin etc.  It's a plant in the coffee family, and about as dangerous as coffee or tea. Kratom is not an intoxicant!  It does not make a person high or \"stoned\" in any way!  And it's been used safely by many health-conscious citizens in this country for many many years (and for hundreds years more in S.E.Asia).\n\nKratom offers its users several benefits.  It is a non-opioid, and has been used by many Americans to withdraw from actual opiates such as heroin. Think of the irony of classifying kratom as a Schedule 1 substance when it helps people get *off* such terrible drugs!  It has been used by many to withdraw from--and stay off of--alcohol addiction.  It also offers pain relief for muscle strain or minor surgery.\n\nI'm 64 years old, and a retired librarian.  I was diagnosed with clinical depression not long ago, and my doctors have put me on three or four different anti-depressant medications.  I read about kratom online, and tried it as a tea.  In a most remarkable way, a single cup of kratom tea, twice a day (one in the morning, one in late afternoon), helped me stay more clear and depression-free than any prescribed drug I tried!  And with no side-effects whatsoever! To this day, if I'm feeling a little down, every now and then, a cup in the morning really helps me start my day.  This plant has been a real boon to me, and an enormous ally in my fight against depression.  I beseech you not to take this away from the people like me, and the thousands of others who have found it so helpful in their lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1143","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"George Dillard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI am writing to share my story on Kratom.

Around that time, my depression and anxiety became highly debilitating and seemingly insurmountable. I had trouble sleeping, connecting with my family and loved ones, socializing, and holding a job. At one point I considered suicide. \n\nAfter researching herbal and healthier alternatives to prescription medication, I discovered kratom. Kratom has helped me manage my depression and anxiety, helped me regain focus and motivation, and helped me get my life back. In the three years I have incorporated kratom into my life I have never felt impaired or under the influence. I have never gotten sick or felt unwell because of it. Kratom has helped me in the same sense that chamomile tea has helped me rest, caffeine has helped me wake up, or St. John's Wort has helped me balance my mood. I see no reason why kratom should be banned or classified under the same scheduling as heroin. The effort to do so has been a waste of resources and money.\n\nI implore the DEA to not ban kratom (mitragyna speciosa). Please do not make kratom a Schedule 1.\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12439","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Cunningham","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Don't ban this drug.

I feel it will make things worse in a society that is plagued with drug addiction, it will make life difficult for those trying to manage pain without taking addictive prescription pills, and I feel it will cause a new problem with illegal drugs sales by forcing kratom to sit on  the black market. At this time we have been inundated with a large amount of heroin throughout our country, We have many individuals with pill habits that were stifled by concerned doctors that over prescribed addictive pain killers only to find those patients made even worse decisions by switching to a cheaper, even more addictive substance on the street. There are many individuals that curb their pain issues with kratom. I know some of these people. There are also many people in this country that have had a hard time quitting taking pain meds but found kratom and realized it is weak enough to stop using without withdrawal and strong enough to give themselves a false yet manageable feeling of pain relief while they ween themselves off of the pills they were addicted to. I know two individuals that have done this and have found many stories like theirs that relate. I feel by making kratom illegal it will still be consumed, but illegally. It would still be sold...but illegally. Many people will risk being caught just like with marijuana, drug dealers will manipulate the substance in ways to make more money and possibly making kratom more addictive by lacing it. Worse of all, prisons will house some of these people. We have enough non violent criminals behind bars for things like marijuana. As marijuana becomes closer and closer to being legalized there is no need to start another prohibition with a different leaf. I am all for regulation, I am all for leaving it be the way it is, but to ban it completely makes way to a waste of time for our criminal justice system and forces people to rely on even harder drugs to curb their addictions.

When I was a teenager, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was on psychiatric medication my entire adult life, but the medications still failed to entirely manage my symptoms. I was a straight A student in high school, but by the time I was in college, the symptoms of bipolar had gotten so severe, I barely managed to graduate college, and it took me six years. \n\nI've been a teacher for ten years now, and my symptoms became manageable enough that I can function at my job, but I was still plagued with breakthrough mood episodes, plus unpleasant side effects from the medication I was taking. About three years ago, when I was having a particularly bad day, a friend of mine offered me an herb that she said helps her. I was skeptical, as I view most herbal supplements as placebos at best, but I tried it anyway. I immediately felt normal in a way I had not felt in fifteen years. I began taking kratom regularly, and it has managed my bipolar symptoms entirely. \n\nAt one point, I was taking 9 different medications for bipolar disorder. Several of them were just to control the side effects of other medications I was taking. I've been taking kratom alone for three years now, and these have been the best three years of my life, as far as having the symptoms of bipolar disorder under control. Also, as an interesting side effect, I also have irritable bowel syndrome, and kratom has completely put an end to those symptoms as well. When I noticed that it helped with that also, I did a little research online and found that there are people who take it specifically for that purpose. That wasn't something I had expected, and it was a pleasant surprise. \n\nKratom has significantly improved my quality of life. I know there is discussion about whether it is addictive or not. I have noticed that if I go too long without taking any kratom, I start to feel some mildly uncomfortable side effects (yawning, eyes watering, slight restlessness), so I guess it may be addictive in that way, but it's less uncomfortable than what would happen if I would miss a dose of some of the prescription psychiatric medications I was taking, and it's not addictive the way other drugs of abuse, such as tobacco, are. When I quit smoking a few years ago, I definitely craved cigarettes, but I never crave kratom in that way if I am late in taking my next dose. I do experience a mild \"discontinuation syndrome\" from missing a dose of kratom, but I experienced much worse withdrawal symptoms from missing a dose of medications which were prescribed to me for bipolar disorder. \n\nMy life is better from taking kratom, and I have come to absolutely no harm from it. It truly frightens me to think of having to live without it, and I know there are many people who feel the same. I hope that you make an informed, compassionate decision regarding kratom. There are many people who trust it to take care of our legitimate medical needs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6691","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeff Sehorn","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To make this efficient, I will start off by saying that kratom has helped my life in so many ways, yet has not harmed it in any.

These ailments interrupted my busy job, which requires constant focus, and disrupted my personal life, often leaving me sleepless and restless more often than not.

I am a middle-aged businessman, self employed for the last twenty years.  And just to be clear, I have never sold Kratom, or profited from the sale of Kratom in any way.  The following story is taken entirely from my own personal experience with Kratom.  \n\nI have had the great misfortune of experiencing chronic pain as the result of an accident that occurred when I was very young.  For my entire life, I preached to my friends and family against the evils of prescription drugs use, but as the years passed, and my aches and pains began to surface with age, I fell prey to the allure of prescription opioids, which helped me make it through my hectic days.  I have always accepted my responsibilities as an American citizen, and continued to function as a contributing member of society, paying my taxes, employing others in my retail business, and voting at every possible opportunity.  But a relatively innocent year or two of prescription painkiller use soon turned into ten or eleven years, and my habit continued to grow until I eventually came to realize that I was a fully functional slave to my addiction.  I had progressively graduated to the strongest of opiates, and I was very addicted.  \n\nI heard about Kratom from a friend, and decided to give it a try to belay some of the more serious side-effects I knew I would experience while attempting to quit painkillers.  I stopped all intake of opiates 'cold-turkey', and contrary to all of the television commercials that insist that you can't do it on your own, I was able to eliminate all prescription opioids from my life.  The process of withdrawal was intense, but I was determined to succeed.  I credit Kratom for playing an important role in helping to ease the symptoms of withdrawal and greatly contribute to my success.  I did my homework, and followed online suggestions for the dosage of Kratom I should take.  And after about two months of moderate Kratom use through this period of very serious opiate withdrawal, when I felt the time was right, I was able to completely discontinue the use of Kratom without any noticeable withdrawal or side-effects whatsoever.  I've been free of opiates for over a year now, without any outside influence or support groups or alternative prescription drugs.  \n\nKratom played an important role in releasing me from my addiction.  As we all read in the news every day, opiate addiction by Americans is an evil plague that sorely needs to be addressed on a large scale.  Normal people like myself can succumb to it's ease of availability and the temporary relief that it provides, but quitting opiates is near impossible for most people.  Kratom is new and relatively unknown in America.  If I hadn't heard of it from a friend, I probably never would have realized it's incredible benefits.  I feel that Kratom should remain legal as one possible option for Americans to treat their own addiction without help from society.  The financial drain of opiate addiction on our system is immeasurable, and any harmless tool that can be offered to help people deal with their addiction on their own should remain legal and readily available.  Kratom is not dangerous.  It's not addictive.  And it's continued availability may actually help ease the financial burden of dealing with opioid addiction in our society.  \n\nIt is my opinion that Kratom is similar to any natural source of caffeine or possibly an 'herbal tea', and it should be considered as such by the DEA and left as a legal uncontrolled herbal supplement to be used freely for any intended purpose by all Americans. \n\nSincerely, \nJay Lawrence","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15945","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jay Lawrence","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I wanted to report my experience with Kratom to the DEA because I believe I suffered a problem because of it. I had never used it before. I ordered from a reputable online source and tried various strains at low amounts (1/8-3/4 teaspoons) mixed into yogurt or made into a tea. I wanted to try it to ease anxiety and bipolar symptoms. I had been taking 1/2 of a low dose Norco (rarely) and it made me feel better but I new those were bad to take so I did a seach to find something that would give me a similar effect. I must say that I can see where Kratom would help a person addicted to pain pills because i no longer wanted the Norco but the Kratom replaced it quite well and relieved some pain. BUT, I could tell you it seemed to me that after only a couple of doses I found myself mildly obsessed about it, wanting to take some everyday- like a mental addiction, not physical. The most important thing I want to report is that I become hypo thyroid after 2 months of using those small doses of Kratom (3-4X a week). Prior to using, a TSH test showed me at 4.6. I had noticed feeling very fatigued and went to the doctor and took a TSH blood test. My TSH was over 8.0-having doubled and meaning I was hypothyroid. I did some research on the internet and found 2 instances of this happening to others. One case citing severe hypothyroidism linked to Kratom addiction. And other small instance I cannot recall now. I am not sure the Kratom caused my thyroid problem but I suspect so. I had no other changes, diet, med, or otherwise that could have caused it. The Kratom was the only new substance I was putting into my body. Needless to say, I threw the stuff out and don't think that is safe for everyone and that it really needs more testing before people use it on a regular basis.. Thank you.

I started having some anxiety again.  I had been on an anti-depressant for two periods, many years ago, and had some crazy side effects from them.  When it came up again this time, I started looking at prescription medicine.  I researched every drug I could find for anxiety, plus some for other things that are sometimes used for anxiety, and I found nothing that I feel good about taking.  Some of them have crazy severe side effects (like possible retinal detachment with one of them), and they all have at least some side effects I don't want to deal with.  I briefly tried taking one of them at a small dosage and had horrific nightmares.  I had this before on the anti-depressant and don't want to deal with that again.  I was forlorn to realize there was nothing I felt I could take.  But then I tried kratom, and I have been so pleased.  I have only used it a few times since I discovered it, as I don't feel the need to use it often, but every time it has been amazing for taking away my anxiety, without any side effects.  I did NOT feel altered in any way, except more calm.  I am so relieved!  I am so grateful.  I am an elementary school teacher and I try very hard to have a wonderful attitude around the children, and having relief from anxiety helps me be at my best.\n\nPlease do not take this away from the people.  There are so many prescription drugs that people take that are seriously dangerous, but yet they keep getting prescribed.  There's no way that this plant should be made illegal.  Thank you for taking these comments seriously and genuinely considering the needs of the people.

At times it is yourself and one other person carrying a 300 lb person down 3 flights of stairs.

I graduated with High Honors in the top 10% of my class, from an institution that enrolls over 30,000 students. I have never been accused of being a drug addict, a drug-seeker, or of being high. In one letter sent as a graduate program recommendation, a former professor described my research on the impact of comorbid post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury in U.S. combat veterans as, \"the most brilliant scientific content I have ever witnessed from an undergraduate student.\"\n\n I am a responsible, reasonable, and hard-working citizen of America, like many in the Kratom community. It is not reasonable or responsible to add Kratom to the list of scheduled drugs, therefore making myself and many other decent folks into felons. The short and long term consequences of making Kratom illegal will be so overwhelming it is impossible to estimate the damage that will be done to the overall good of society if law-abiding Americans are convicted and sentenced to harsh drug punishments for possessing what is simply an herbal dietary supplement. \n\nI find it is imperative to remind you that throughout the course of our history and the history of the world, we have paid immeasurable costs for decisions made against something, whether it be an idea, a race of people, or a plant, simply because it is relatively unknown, and therefore misunderstood. When we find ourselves in these unavoidable dilemmas, we must air on the side of rationality, patience, and objective thinking. Specifically with regards to Kratom, we must air on the side of scientific peer-reviewed, empirical research, and also distinguish between studies that are valid and reliable. Research from scientists who are paid by groups that have a financial investment in banning the plant are neither valid nor reliable, but instead produce skewed data due to biases and failures to isolate confounding variables. The limited amount of research to date on the benefits of ingesting the plant matter of Kratom suggests a world hope for some people who desperately need it. The answer is not allowing Pharmaceutical companies to monopolize the alkaloids and make them much more powerful and potent. This has been the guideline with other substances in the past, and this is why America is in the midst of suffering the biggest opiate crisis in the history of the world. \n\nPrescription opioids, whether they're obtained legally or illegally, have caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans by causing respiratory depression. I do not foresee history being kind to the administration that chooses to ban a non-opioid plant that shows promise as an opiate replacement, without the risk of death of respiratory depression, addiction, or death, as is the case with FDA approved substances. \n\nAlthough there will be naive people who will believe the lie that Kratom has killed 15 Americans, at least 14 of these Americans had other drugs in their system. Any high school student can tell you that these other variables in these people's systems are called confounding variables. You cannot link Kratom to death, essentially proving cause and effect, without eliminating these confounding variables (prescription drugs). \n\nI have been drinking Kratom tea for over 6 years, because it improves my quality of life. Just as regular exercise, a healthy diet, drinking water, and adding tumeric alongside my daily dose of magnesium has improved my quality of life. I am a better human being because of it, and I do not believe that banning Kratom is the right decision. It is not the right moral decision, nor is it the right scientific decision.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12584","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Alford","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom this concerns:\n\nI am alcoholic and addict that has depended on kratom usage for my recovery.

Back 5 years ago he was suffering from chronic pain in his hip which was making everyday activities and being a floor installer  a lot harder on him. He went to a doctor who took X-rays and diagnosed him with perthes a degenerative cartlidge disease. The X-ray revealed that his hip bone was in the shape of an ice pick and he no longer had any cartridge left son it was straight bone on bone grinding. It was causing tons of pain and was effecting his sciatic nerve and would leave him in tears after a long day of work and being a father to two little girls his life revolves around being up and moving, piggy back rides, and dancing with daddy. But he was in so much pain he couldn't do those things. His doctor who he was seeing at that time referred him to s specialists who decided his best relie for pain was painkillers. Instant relief he said. He was put on tramadol and after 2 weeks he had gone through a whole prescription which should of lasted a month. He went to his doctor and said they weren't strong enough and he had to take doubt to feel relief. His doctor then prescribed him something stronger loratabs. He asked his specialist what can they do long term to help maybe a hip replacement is something to look into and the specialist said, \" no you are to young.\" He advised him to get with a primary doctor who would help manage his pain pills and surgery will be something to consider later down the road for now this will be a bandaid. What a nightmare that would become. We found a primary doctor who was happy to help feed him more pills. Never asking why or giving advise on new pain management treatments or any  physical therapy options. The next 3 years of our family's life had become a living nightmare. The man, the father, the son, the husband to be was gone. Our family was torn to pieces and hurting bad. During those 3 years I as a mother had to fight to protect my children from this lunatic and mad man he had become. My children where hurting and scared of their daddy most days. He was distant, cold, and heartless.  He no longer had time to spend with his children his time was occupied being in a comatose state after a long day of work and he had begun eating 12 to 14 pills a day of loratabs. He would spend his time in search of anything to feel again. He began trying new drugs just looking for that high again and drinking extremely heavy (a whole handle of tequila in a night). He was mixing his pills with other drugs and is was a roller coaster ride of highs and lows. From one day to the next it was a guessing game of how the day would go. He over dosed a few times. He would pass out in mid sentence, he would ramble on and make no since of what he was saying. He would become withdrawn and sketchy. And into the last year he began being abusive mentally, emotionally, and physically. We tried on several occasions to get him help and sober. We tried getting him off the pills but the withdrawals were unbearable for him. He had lost weigh and become very sickly looking. He was killing himself and there was no getting through to him.  After 3 years and many attempts I finally gave him the only option left he gets clean and off the pills no matter how hard the pain would be and find a docto to do the surgery or a new treatment that was safer or I would leave him and take the kids and never come back. He swor he'd get sober and didn't wanna lose his family. We began looking into new treatments. After many attempts he finally found what saved his life. KRATOM!  The last 2 years he has been completely clean and hasn't turned back. Kratom gave him his life back. He no longer drinks alcohol like he did before or has urges to get high on drugs. He has become a better man then before. He works hard to give his family everything they need and is happy and content. He no longer has to deal with pain the way he did before. Kratom has helped manage his longer term issues with his hip and as well got his through the with drawls after getting off the pain killers 2 years ago. He swears by Kratom and has even been able to reach out to others who have suffered drug problems, pain killer addictions and alcoholism and have changed their life's for the good since taking Kratom. I may not be a Kratom user myself but I've seen the benefits of Kratom as an outsider. My children and I have gotten back the man we love and are proud of the man he has become. Kratom saved his and our life's.

I suffer from severe social anxiety and I have been using Kratom for the past 3 years as an alternative to addictive prescription drugs. Kratom helps me function every day without impairing me and making me feel like a zombie like prescription benzodiazepines or traditional opiates. I refuse to take such dangerous and addictive prescription drugs because I have seen a couple of my family members ruin their lives from becoming addicted to them. Kratom is not harming my body in any way. It has been very helpful with calming my anxiety and it even helps relieve my moderate back pain after a long day on the job. Without kratom I would be a nervous wreck and I would have trouble functioning in public and in social situations. Scheduling Kratom would be devastating for me and many other Americans . Instead of scheduling Kratom, please consider allowing Kratom to be regulated with things like age restrictions for purchasing it and quality control testing for suppliers. Finally,  I would like to say thank you for not going ahead with the emergency scheduling and allowing the public to have a voice  in this matter.

In 2014 I was diagnosed with AML (Actute Myeloid Leukemia) from which I developed deep cysts in my legs as well as permanent  neuropathy.  I am happy to announce I am currently in remission, but the devastating effects from my leukemia has left me with an abundance of symptoms. During my months in the hospital I was on a constant morphine drip, stopping the pain meds was probably what I looked forward to the most once I was told I was in remission, as I was vomiting at least twice a day for a solid year. I had no idea what I was in for. I can't describe the hell on Earth I experienced when I stopped taking my medicines. Not to mention that I had no options other than opioids for my constant leg pain. I went 6 months without leaving my house because I never slept. I could have gone back on my morphine but had to keep reminding myself staying off it was best for my overall health. I didn't work, I didn't go out to see friends, not even on holidays. I was in such a dark place (I also had lost my two brothers in a car accident years before) that many times I sat in my bathroom talking myself out of taking my life. Then my sister mentioned to me she had read an article on Kratom. Obviously I didn't want to go back on any actually traditional \"medicine\" but after reading the article and doing research I figured things can't get much worse so I'll give it a go. The first night I took a teaspoon I slept for EIGHT HOURS! I cried to my mom the next morning from sheer happiness. This has been my miracle. My daily headaches and shooting pains were almost non exsistant. I had energy back and felt human for the first time in years. Kratom has no weird effects on me, it's actually the only thing in this world that makes me feel normal, before I felt like I was on drugs naturally because I was so deeply depressed. Everything was wonderful for those few months, I even got a brand new job at a hospital. I am not taking any other prescribed drug. Then right as I was feeling my dark cloud going away, I read that Kratom was being banned. I had this flash of heat and dread creep over my body. I am begging whoever reads this please don't take this miracle away from people who are using it responsibly over a fear that doesn't exist. I don't want to go back to where I was, please do not ban Kratom. It truly saved my life. I never once felt unsafe fearful of side effects. I don't want to be on opioids anymore, or anti depressants. This is a real heartfelt plea.

Kratom is a very important plant. The alkaloids contained within it have an incredible capacity to partially modulate the opiod receptors without causing respiratory depression or other adverse side effects in most people. The side effect profile seems to be on par with or much milder than many over the counter or prescription drugs. It is not a dangerous plant and should be classified with similar status to caffeine. Due to this very mild partial opiod agonist activity, it has the capacity to modulate opiod withdrawal without the user becoming substantially effected by the drug. The legal, prescription alternative, Buprenorphine does not have this capacity. Although a partial agonist, Buprenorphine is extremely potent and has very obvious drug effects. The effects of Kratom do not very much exceed that of caffeine for most users. What if a heroine addict could feel normal with not much more than a cup of coffee and they could grow that plant at their home? It would be a massive improvement over suboxone and subutex which both can be abused no matter what big pharma wants you to think. Again, Buprenorphine is a VERY powerful and very addicting drug.. If Kratom is scheduled and not immediately available for prescription or over the counter purchase, thousands of users will be forced to turn back to much more dangerous drugs either from the pharmacy, the street or the internet (research chemical opiods)... \n\n Kratom is also currently being used as an anxiolytic for those with PTSD, depression and anxiety. It has great success in some treatment resistant patients and again is far less addicting and dangerous than the typical prescriptions of SSRI's or Benzodiazepines. Those currently using it for affective disorders will also have to turn to more dangerous and addicting drugs in the case of its ban.\n\nIn small doses, I have personally used it as a substitute for caffeine and it offers a very clean-motivated state of mind without jitters like caffeine or the euphoria and side effects of amphetamines typically used for attention deficit disorder. I also spent 13 years of my life in blue collar labor cutting down trees and have severe back pain at times. I have previously been prescribed prescription pain medication and medium doses of Kratom are far superior to prescription opiods and Tramadol and do not have the side effects associated with these substances. I chose to use Kratom instead when I required medication and the plant itself was perfect. I had no need to turn to more powerful extracts and my tolerance actually went down over my use. It seems that when used responsibly, the user can actually be sensitized to the plant and may require less rather than more like prescription opiods.\n\nKratom should be available for those over 18 as should caffeine as both are similarly addicting. I realize that regulating caffeine at this point would be very difficult, but ideally, they should be treated with similar respect. The plant should not be classified as a dangerous drug. It is only a benefit to our society. I do however have concerns about its extracts and potential analogues. Any extracts of the plant or analogues of its constituents should be regulated, but the plant itself is nearly harmless and should be available to adults.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23026","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Parker Kelley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If the DEA were to add Kratom to the list of schedule 1 narcotics, it would be a tone-deaf mistake which would cause me to question whether or not the organization is acting in good faith to protect the health of Americans. I have not used Kratom, but from what I understand there are several important facts regarding the substance. First, it is a naturally occurring plant. Second, it seems to be far safer than both other schedule 1 drugs and other legal substances (e.g., alcohol and tobacco). Third and perhaps most important, there is some evidence that it is helpful for people trying to overcome opiate addiction. The pharmaceutical industry and government regulating bodies are partly responsible for this epidemic. This makes it particularly egregious that they are considering a course of action which would limit individual freedom (something we value in this country) and prevent people who are struggling with addiction from helping themselves out of the hole they are in. We have already seen that those in charge of narcotics scheduling are unwilling to deal honestly with the American people, sidelining an initiative to remove marijuana from the schedule 1 list. This should have been an incredibly easy decision as marijuana meets almost none of the criteria put forward for schedule 1 status and no informed individual can honestly say it belongs on the list. And now the DEA is considering an overly aggressive action to add Kratom to this list without offering sufficient justification. This is utterly tone-deaf and would be a step in the wrong direction for drug regulation in this country.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12734","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ben Perrodin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been a godsend to me since I discovered it a few years ago. I've had to deal with anxiety all of my life and have been put on every type of anti-depressant to try and alleviate what I have suffered for so long. Nothing quite seemed to work and the side effects of some of these medications were unbearable. Try titrating off Effexor while going to work and simply performing the necessities of life, I've never felt worse.\n\nI finally got my anxiety somewhat under control with Citalopram and Xanax but as a result I was emotionally and mentally flatlined. It was not a life at all. I was just a shell of a person with zero desires as a result. This situation unto itself lead to depression and all that comes with it. I had IBS, my thoughts were that of a nihilist who was just hung up on life as a whole. The thought of living this way for the rest of my life consumed every minute of my life. Something had to change.\n\nI came across Kratom from a military vet that I met at our local dog park. He used it for pain and he also alluded to it helping with what I assume was PTSD. He didn't really want to relive his past and how he got to using Kratom but he was pretty emphatic on how Kratom had helped him.\n\nI sort of brushed it off but said I would give it a try. The following day he gave me a little bit and I told him I would try it. I took the pills that he had given me and about 30 minutes later I felt the effects. My inner dialogue that was always so negative seemed to have quieted for the moment. That alone was a relief. If anyone here has anxiety or depression you know what your inner dialogue / voice can do to you mentally.\n\nWhat Kratom did was essentially alleviate all my negative thoughts for the moment. And within that moment I felt like my head was cleared and I felt optimistic. It wasn't euphoria, it was finally just a different mindset that none of the medication I had been on ever offered. At that moment I just cried, I felt something different which hadn't happened in a long time. I was just so happy to feel something other than my flatline self.\n\nSince that day I have been using Kratom every other day. I got off all my other meds over the course of two months and that alone should be a reason for Kratom to be legal. I know it helps people with opiod withdrawal but I'm here to state that it helps with the ever-so-cumbersome withdrawal from anti-depressants and controlled substances like Xanax.\n\nThat is essentially my story and how Kratom has given me life again in some respect. My anxiety isn't completely gone by any means, but I'm managing it in a different and natural way. I gained 15 pounds while on anti-depressants and that is gone as well. Depression can also lead to IBS which I had and as a side benefit Kratom helped me with that affliction as well.\n\nTo ban Kratom is to hand some users back to the medicines that didn't work or made them feel \"better\" by completely blunting our emotions and personality. That is a road I never wish to go down again. The fact of the matter is that I have an imbalance that is anxiety for whatever reason. This is how I'm wired and it is something I have to deal with for the rest of my life. I didn't choose to have anxiety. I wish I was a med-free functioning soul but it has never been in the cards for me. I've been afflicted with anxiety since I can remember a child.\n\nI should be able to use Kratom as I have so that I do not have to go back to what I was on.

I am 22 and a junior at the University of Texas at Austin, on my way to obtaining my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I've worked for a small business doing systems administration for 3 years now. I am financially independent of my parents, paying for university in part myself and in part through federal funding. I am sober, thanks to kratom.\n\nOne year ago, I was technically homeless after having been kicked out of where I lived because of an addiction. I was not in school, for I had dropped all of my classes six months before, because of a different addiction. Although I held the same job I do now, I struggled to manage even part time hours. I have struggled with addiction since my early teens, mainly with alcoholism. I kept it together reasonably well in high school and part of college, excelling academically and managing to hide the issue from everyone around me, but such a facade cannot last forever, and it didn't.\n\nAbout 6 months ago, I attempted for the umpteenth to quit, but this time I used kratom tea to do it. Although it was still an ordeal weening myself off of alcohol, kratom made it possible.\n\nLet me be clear: kratom tea did not replace alcohol. Kratom allowed me to adjust to the psychological impact of sobriety because it is so mild. I regained my ability to have fun while sober by drinking kratom tea in the interim. I could not treat kratom tea like alcohol because drinking more than a small amount makes my stomach hurt. I cannot properly express how grateful I am that such a thing exists.\n\nI am not opposed to all legislation, I understand many are concerned about various long-term effects it may have. I am opposed to keeping kratom out of the hands of people who really need it by making it Schedule I. I am opposed to treating kratom like heroin without regard to the consequences.

Kratom is an organic botanical that's been safely used for centuries to help people cope with many different chronic pain conditions without the use of opioid pain medications. \n\nConsidering the current opiate abuse epidemic our nation is experiencing, banning or restricting an herbal supplement that helps people avoid using prescription opiates by classifying Kratom as a controlled substance would cause irreparable harm to thousands of American citizens.  Kratom's potential for abuse is also extremely low.  According to Walter C. Prozialeck, a professor of pharmacology at Midwestern University who has studied Kratom extensively, [T]he amount [of kratom] that a person has to take in to get any severe effects is ridiculously high. Youre talking 10 to 15 grams of raw leaf. Most people who are using kratom for pain management dont take that much. Most people cant take that much. (Nick Wing, Some Say Kratom Is A Solution to Opioid Addiction. Not If Drug Warriors Ban It First, Huffington Post, updated Sept. 7, 2016, 8:38 am, www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kratom-ban-drug-policy_us_56c38a87e4b0c3c55052ee3f).\n\nDespite some sensational media reports to the contrary, Kratom's safety is clear when compared to coffee, alcohol, tobacco, and prescription drugs.  DEA's emergency scheduling NOI cited 660 Kratom-related calls to poison control over a six-year period ending December 2015, but the NOI failed to put that number into perspective.  For example, in the past six years, poison control has received 23,203 calls for caffeine, 66,300 for essential oils, 1,464 for Echinacea, 681 for Ginkgo Biloba, and 1,173 for St. John's Wort.\n\nMany people have been using Kratom for years with no ill effects, and Kratom's support of their health and well being helps them to continue to be productive, tax-paying, voting members of their communities.  Please do not compound our country's health and addiction problems by banning or restricting a supplement that so many people are using safely and responsibly.  \n\nSincerely,\nRobin Martin-Emerson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15677","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"robin martin emerson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \nI suffer from severe depression and anxiety.

I live in north Florida and I am currently employed as a Deputy Sheriff at my local Sheriff's Office and have been employed there for 18 years. Approximately two years ago, I was suffering from lower back pains caused by spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis. I was prescribed hydrocodone by my doctor to help deal with the pain. I am aware of the addiction that comes with taking hydrocodone and the damage it will cause to my body and I did not want to be in that situation. After 8 to 10 months of taking the prescription, I started looking for an alternative and natural ways to deal with the pain. I have never heard of kratom before until I came across it in my research and decided to give it a try. I have been taking kratom now for almost a year and it has been wonderful. My pain is minimal and it does not make me drowsy like the pain meds did. Kratom is not a drug and it does not impair my judgement or vision.  I stopped taking kratom for a few days to see if there were any side effects including withdraws and I was fine, other than my pain level increasing. I introduced kratom to a family member of mine who was an alcoholic to see it kratom would maybe help him. He has been taking kratom now for about six months and has not had a drink since. Kratom has helped me so much and possibly saved my family members' life from alcohol abuse. Scheduling kratom would be devastating and cause me to go back to these harmful medications and my family member back to alcohol. It makes sense to allow adults to have the decision to take kratom to help them in life. I see good hard working Americans taking kratom to help them in their lives. I would also like to add that as a deputy for many years, I have never responded to someone's house because of kratom. As a deputy, I have never spoke with an individual who was looking for help because of kratom. Please do not schedule this natural plant. Thank you for your time.\n\n   D.

I am 28 years old and though I hold a degree in human development, I cannot work in my field because I am disabled due to complications from Cystic Fibrosis. I am writing to let you know that I respectfully opposed the DEA's proposal to make the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine schedule 1 substances.\n\nI have been using kratom for 3 years as an herbal supplement that helps reduce my symptoms of anxiety, akathisia, and pain from chronic inflammation in my body-especially my lungs and joints. Before I knew about kratom, I was bed ridden with pain and at the same time tormented with the inner restlessness caused by akathisia which I developed from the use of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications. It seemed I could only function if I took narcotic pain medicine. I was frustrated and felt trapped in my situation and decided to look for alternatives. I researched online for natural forms of pain relief and came across the mention of Kratom. I was skeptical in trying it because nothing had helped me up to that point. But I was looking for anything so that I could have some quality of life returned to me. Once I began to supplement with Kratom, I noticed a huge improvement. I was able to use less and less narcotic pain medicine until I didn't need it at all anymore. Also, Kratom helped to calm the intense restlessness and pain I felt from the akathisia. Since then, I have been able to return to exercising, I can do chores around me house, something I couldn't do before, and I actually feel happy. I used to pray for either healing or death because I could not fathom existing any more in the state I was in. I believe God answered my prayers by guiding me to find Kratom. \n\nIf you make this natural herb illegal, please consider that you will be crippling many people who like me, suffer from pretty serious disabilities and you'll be sentencing them to a very poor quality life. Please do not take the people's right to use a supplement that helps them have a more normal life. I do not know what I will do if I have to go back to depending on narcotics that after a while have no effect and back to living with the agony that is the restlessness of akathisia. The thought is unbearable. \n\nThank you for reading my story and considering it as you make your decision.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21030","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marla Hernandez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \nI believe we need more research on Kratom!

I use it, and have a friend that is a distributor of it locally. There's a shop in town that's also been selling it for 15 years. My girlfriend has lower back problems that are only \"fixable\" by surgery, and she's not even 25. Taking Kratom daily she is able to live her life without the pain of a herniated disc and a torn disc, she's not some crazy meth addict or act anything like it. .  . I know this because I used to be one. It gives a boost of energy similar to a nice espresso and the pain relief of a Percocet. Clear minded also, not groggy and foggy from prescription drugs. \nWith all that in mind, let's look at another thing it's being used for, getting people off dangerous opiates. Heroin addicts have used Kratom to help with withdrawals and Kratom helps ease the process of living without these dangerous substances. With the current opiate epidemic across America, banning Kratom would lead people who have used it to rid themselves of harmful opiates, and with Kratom have an alternative to help them stay off.\n\nHow would banning Kratom do anything but make it even more obvious that big pharma is in your pockets?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17834","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jesse Streid","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is not a dangerous drug.

I am a machinist and CNC operator. I would like you to know that I'm opposed to your proposed ban on Kratom, or more specifically mitagynine and 7 -hudroxymitagynine.\nI started taking Kratom about 3 years ago. After a long battle with opiate addiction. Kratom gave me my life back. I had been using prescription painkillers for the better part of a decade and even resorted to using heroin because sadly sometimes it's cheaper. Kratom literally saved my life, and I think it unfair and even cruel that this law and category 1 scheduling that the DEA is putting into effect will take the option of using Kratom to get off hard and harmful drugs away from people. People who are fighting with addiction and want to stop should be being told about Kratom!  I am aware there are other drugs to combat opiate addiction but as someone who has tried other ways like Suboxone and methadone I believe Kratom is 100 times better. Not only are these other drugs harmful but they are just as addictive if not more so than the drugs they are supposed to get you off. I was able to stop using Kratom when I wanted I still take it on occasion because it helps with pain and anxiety which is why I was on prescription drugs in the first place and the root of my addiction. There are very many positive attributes of this plant, not just the ability to get people off opiates but it also has pain relieving qualities and works great for anxiety. All this and I've never experienced any side effects other than the dry mouth on occasion. \nI wish I had known about Kratom earlier in my life. I wouldn't have struggled with addiction for so long and I would have told friends about it that we're going to the same thing. Sadly it's too late for some of them that died from overdose they'll  never have the chance to have Kratom save there life like it did mine. Please keep Kratom legal and available to anybody who wants to use it.\n\n\nSincerely,\nNicholas Taylor","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17636","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nicholas Taylor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is a great option for people dealing with chronic pain\nMuch better than opioids\nIt should remain legal\nThank you for the opportunityt to give my opinion","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16392","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"carrie hastings","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 39 and have suffered from chronic pain due to a car accident years ago which led me into a   ten year full blown opiate addiction.

I am strongly requesting that you please reconsider placing kratom on the list of Schedule 1 Controlled Substances. I have been using kratom on and off for about two years now, generally a couple of times a week at most. I was first introduced to kratom by a coworker of mine when we were discussing methods of reducing and controlling anxiety and I am infinitely glad I listened to their advice. I struggle with fairly severe generalized and social anxiety and moderate depression. Combined that often resulted in me having panic attacks while on campus and having to hide in a school bathroom until they passed, missing class, or being physically unable to force myself out of bed in the mornings to go to class because I felt like I could hardly breathe and was too nauseous to move without  potentially throwing up. As much as I wanted to succeed in my classes I was struggling  with the possibility of academic suspension simply from the number of classes I physically could not attend. Even though I knew I needed help I was terrified to go to doctor and be stuck taking prescribed drugs indefinitely especially based on all the terrible experiences many of my friends have had taking that route which only worsened their problems. When I began taking kratom, for the first time perhaps since middle school, I felt normal being at school. I felt like I could fully focus on the professor and subject matter without my head swirling in a thousand different directions and constant state of apprehension and fear for no real reason. Just being able to raise my hand in class if I have a question or answer to the professor's question like any other student felt so freeing and completely new to me. Despite the fact that I have been using kratom fairly regularly for the past two years and found it extremely helpful, I have never found it to be addictive in anyway. To put kratom in the same schedule as such highly addictive, dangerous, and damaging drugs like heroin feel extremely  wrong to me as it has none of those properties. It is simply a harmless dietary supplement that many people find very helpful in their lives, often when nothing else has worked for them. Taking this option away from people before scientists can even fully discover all of it's medical benefits feels like a greatly missed opportunity when it could potentially improve the quality of life of thousands of Americans.

While mitragynine has opioid pain killing properties, it has been found to not only be less addictive, but when derivatives are co-administered with morphine, even decreases the addictive properties of morphine itself. Most importantly, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT MITRAGYNINE CAUSES RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, which is the reason that addicts overdose on traditional opiates.\n\nThis study found reduced potential for opioid addiction when a mitragynine derivative is co-administered with morphine: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18550129\n\nThese studies found no respiratory depression in kratom users, or -arrestin-2 recruiting, the enzyme pathway responsible for traditional opiate side effects like respiratory depression (remember, respiratory depression is the reason so many are dying from opiates in this country): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425236/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27556704\n\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b00748?source=cen&\n\nApart from the research that needs to be allowed to continue, apart from the potential billions of dollars you'd be cheating the USA out of with the development of mitragynine-based next generation pain killers, you need to realize that there are many people out there who had been hopelessly addicted to strong opiates (which could kill them at any time by being slightly too strong), but were able to get off of them by using a leaf that is all but impossible to overdose on (you refuses to release details on the 15 overdoses that you claim took place over three years , and regardless, 150 people overdose on Acetaminophen PER YEAR, but the DEA isn't banning Tylenol).\n\nBy using small amounts of this leaf, some have been able to get their lives back without having to resort to the stupefying effects of expensive pharmaceuticals like suboxone (which still hold the risk of death by respiratory depression). All the DEA will accomplish with this measure, is ensure that such people get thrown back into the gutter, while simultaneously banning the most promising next gen pain killing compound to date. This ban is a totally baseless overreach by the DEA that will only serve to make things worse for addicts, researchers, and the general public. This ban cannot be allowed to go through, the DEA cannot be allowed to cut next gen opioid research off at the knees, while simultaneously ensuring that we will see an increase in opiate deaths, an epidemic you claim to be trying to alleviate.\n\nGoing forward with this mitragynine ban is socially irresponsible, morally deplorable, and scientifically unwarranted. Please make the right decision, stand with the public, and withdrawal any intention to ban mitragyna speciosa and its active alkaloids.

My dad is in his late 70's. has worked hard all of his life, and unfortunately now suffers from debilitating arthritis and chronic pain.  His doctors have been prescribing hydrocodone for him.  As most everyone knows tis is an dangerous and addictive drug.  Also my dad d hates the side effects, won't take hydrocodone and just suffers and stays on the couch instead of living the active life he would prefer.  My dad is conservative and skeptical of anything new so I was pretty surprised when a new lady friend (my mom passed away a few years back) persuaded him to try a new herbal supplement called kratom.  In our recent visits, (I live a day's drive way) all we had been able to do together was watch t.v. and eat.  My dad surprised me by announcing he had tried a new herbal medicine  that had  been helping him  feel better and then suggested we go for a bike ride down by Pensacola bay and over to Bayou Grande.  It was the first time in years we had been able to enjoy some active time outside. \nDad uses kratom about three times a week and now works out at the YMCA, walks with a senior walking club (the Seville Quarter Milers)  and rides his old paper boy Schwinn around the  neighborhood.  All this ion the last few months since he began using kratom a few times a week.  I sincerely hope for my father's sake and many others around the U.S that you will not reschedule this safe and beneficial medicine and make it unavailable to people who benefit from it. I would argue that this herbal medicine is much safer than narcotic alternatives which are addictive and over the counter pain relievers which damage the stomach lining and liver.   There is no true public safety concern to justify re-scheduling this herbal medicine.  I would agree that it should not be available to minors but nor should cough medicines, allergy medications, nasal sprays, etc. but these are not unavailable to the general public.  With health care costs rising, kratom nis a relatively inexpensive alternative to much less effective and more unsafe alternatives.  Please... think about your own elderly mothers and fathers,. anyone else you may know who suffers chronic pain.. why deny them this medicine that has been proven to be safe and effective for over a thousand years.  Thank you for your consideration in this matter,\n\nJoe Moore.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15416","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joe Moore","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It's a natural, non manipulated tree that grows from the earth & has the ability to help people.

As a recovering alcoholic, I have benefitted from kratom through it's uncanny ability to take away cravings for alcohol and other drugs. Additionally, it diminished or completely expunged feelings of withdrawal and relieved delirium tremons when I had a debilitating and embarrassing period of relapse. \n\nI do not use it for recreation. Instead, when I feel unbearable depression or cravings for alcohol, I take a small dose, about 200-400 mg, and I feel as though my life is that much more manageable. I don't find it to be addictive but rather relieve compulsions of self-destructive behavior. It is not the first thing I turn to as I am involved in AA and therapy, but kratom has been a back-up on hard days.\n\nKratom leaf has also helped with pain management. I primarily use it during my menstruation and sometimes with back pain. I recommend it to friends who have debilitating pain from other diseases and/or injuries, and most find it helpful.\n\nI researched cases where kratom was said to cause negative repercussions, addictive behavior, or even death, and noticed that other drugs were combined to cause such results. In my opinion, kratom by itself is not a harm to society. I believe it to assist addicts of all kinds safely leave the bondage of their drug of choice and aid the depressed and chronic pained.\n\nIf I could not freely buy this leaf, my recovery from alcoholism would be a much harder road to travel.

Often the migraines side effects are so debilitating I can't get up and feed my family. Until I take a dose of kratom. Within 45 min., my pain has significantly decreased, my energy elevates, I can focus again, and have a smile on my face while with my family. Instead of using narcotic  pain meds that made me nausious, drowsy, irritable, and still resulted in me having to use an ice pack and lay down. Migraines are a full body affected illness. Relief of these are imminent for functioning during typical  daily activities, and kratom absolutely meets the requirements set in place by standard treatment and management of chronic migraine sufferers.

However with kratom I take as needed and do not feel as if I must continue taking kratom unless I need it. I do not feel the urge to consume kratom or any cravings or withdrawal type symptoms of pain medications. Kratom is my saving grace in reference to my chronic migraine diagnosis and the recommended med for it. Because the natural herbal supplement, kratom, worked drastically better. Please. We pain management sufferers demand consideration and the chance to be allowed to choose to use the kratom. Without governed involvment. This has zero to do with politics. Please We ask that you reason over this issue and allow kratom to continue to be sold in America. Pro kratom for Chronic Pain sufferers who do not want to get hooked on and addicted to narcotic pain medication!

I started taking Kratom in mid-august for back pain, depression, and anxiety. Although it works very well for those issues- it ABSOLUTELY is an addictive band-aid. \n\nKratom and it's alkaloids attach to the MU receptor, which sends a release of dopamine and endorphins. Kratom also has a profound effect on serotonin in the brain.  Of course that is going to help anyone who is in a depressive state or anxious- BUT anything that activates the MU receptor like that absolutely causes an immediate tolerance and physical dependence on the substance.\n\nI see others say they had \"no withdrawls\", and are touting it as a magical substance- all incorrect. \n\nOver the course of a few months I had gotten myself up to a \"high dose\" of Kratom, and got food poisoning, which disallowed me from eating it one day. I went straight into withdrawals.\n\nSkin crawling, sweating, writhing in bed, hallucinations, and suicidal ideations. It was a fucking living nightmare. I absolutely turned on the plant when it revealed it's dark side. \n\nMost people are loving Kratom- because it works so damn effectively. Just like other drugs of abuse! Kratom addiction is very similar to a Tramadol addiction and withdrawl. Maybe not heroin, but absolutely kiddie heroin.\n\nIn the end I spent 8 days in the hospital due to Kratom. The doctors had seen it before. Intense Kratom withdrawals.\n\nI urge all who take this plant daily to realize that it does cause addiction in those prone to it, and it absolutely causes physical dependency.

Speciosa (kratom), a relative of the coffee plant.  I wish to share the impact this herbal medicine has had on me, and my mother.\n\nFirst of all, my mother takes it exclusively to stem the gastrointestinal side effect of a prescribed ssri, Cymbalta.  Without her one teaspoon of kratom daily, she would have constant, unpredictable diarrhea.  After decades of trial and error, Cymbalta is the only medication she has had that helped issues of PTSD and depression, and kratom is the only medication (counting prescriptions) that has allowed her to leave the house.  Now, she can travel to visit friends in her town, go grocery shopping, and even travel out-of-state to see her only grandchild.  Kratom vastly improved the quality of my mother's life, and she has taken it for years underneath the supervision of her primary care physician.  She does not drink alcohol, and does not use any illegal substances.  Kratom is not a recreational drug for her, and her dosage has never increased.\n\nI, like my mother, have suffered the alienating and frightening effects of PTSD and major depression since adolescence.  My effects originated in different circumstances, but like her, after years of unpleasant psychiatric medication roulette, diligent cognitive behavioral therapy, traditional psychoanalysis, EMDR, I have found a medication that works.  Again, I deal with the side effects of an ssri that diminish my productivity and ability as a parent and citizen, has harmed my promising career, and has left me basically housebound.  Paroxetine reduces my symptoms to a more manageable level, but leaves me with extreme fatigue.  Prescribed pharmaceutical remedies have failed me. Coffee leaves me overstimulated, and amplifies my startle reflex and anxiety.  Kratom, on the other hand, I can take as needed, without becoming agitated.  It helps relieve my fatigue and my social anxieties, so much so that I have volunteered with an elementary school reading program, have taken on leadership positions in wilderness guidance for the Girl Scouts, and can travel without my husband. For the first time in my adult life, since my sexual assault, and its subsequent trauma, I can wear a bathing suit to the beach or pool.\n\nMy family life, my parenting abilities, my marriage, and my community have all benefitted from the gentle benefits that kratom has provided to me.\n\nI was prescribed Xanax as an adjunct to my ssri.  Cautious due to a family history of addiction, I did not continue that prescription.  I have stopped my use of kratom for weeks at a time, just to make sure I was able.  Kratom has more manageable dosing, as its effects are subtle.\n\nPerhaps instead of scheduling an ancient herbal medicine that has killed no one, and also helped to combat the scourge of prescription opiate deaths and addiction, m. Speciosa should be regulated.  Adding a new phantom in the failed War on Drugs will not put the United States of the right side of history: think about how destructive marijuana scheduling has been to families, communities, snd society.  Maybe a better use of American medical research funding would be to study our broken mental healthcare, addictive drug rehabilitation, and pain management structures. \n\nThank you.\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9625","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,  \n \nMy name is Laura Stevens; I am a yoga teacher, and a paralegal.

Kratom is a leaf from a tree. The leaves of the tree can be crushed and made into tea (preferred method). The effects of Kratom are gentle mood boost (like coffee), and a mitigation of pain. Although Kratom interacts with opiod receptors, like cheese and chocolate) it is not an opiate.  \nDepressed breathing is the cause of death via opiate consumption. Kratom does not cause depressed breathing. \n \nThere is an opiate epidemic in the United States. In 2014 over 14,000 humans died in the United States from prescription opiates. The profit-seeking-system that caused this epidemic, needs to be quelled. Kratom is a save, natural alternative to the dangers of doctor prescribed opiates. In September I lost a close friend from an overdose (depressed breathing). Hes gone forever, and every day I think about how I could have saved him by introducing him to Kratom to get him off of the opiates.\n\nPlease consider us, as Americans and our constitutional right to the pursuit of pain-free happiness by not scheduling this wonderful plant.  \n \nThank you for your time,  \n \nLaura Stevens","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21293","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laura Stevens","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I had never heard of krater before this proposal to ban it.\n\nAfter research I conclude such a ban would be the height of foolishness for a number of reasons, but this one reason should be sufficient:\n\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21789","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Theodore Brazeau","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nKratom is a natural herbal supplement that I have been using for several years.

I am what some might call a functioning addict although towards the end of my drinking & pill popping career things began to spin out of control as I took pills all day (every day) & was spending lots & lots of money  money that should have been used to support my family or put away.  My attitude was erratic & I would suffer high highs & low lows  all of this held me back at work & caused rifts in my personal relationships.\nI sought help from a psychiatrist who specialized in addiction & went on Suboxine, which did help me somewhat for about 2 years ... it would also keep me up at night & made me feel horrible in the morning.  I found that Suboxine was pretty addictive as well & I would need to take it every few hours in order to function.  When I eventually came off of Suboxine, the withdrawals were an absolute nightmare  even worse than pills like Vicodin & Percocet.  I then found myself in an anxious & depressed state long after the drug had cleared my system.  Fearing that I would have to go back on Suboxine (or worse) I found Kratom.  \nKratom is a natural, reasonably priced substance with effects that are less intense than the drugs mentioned above & since I began taking Kratom, I have gotten my life back to full form both professionally & personally.  I work for a major media company & have been promoted at work since I began taking Kratom ...  my wife & I just purchased a new home & our relationship is stronger than ever ... friends & family consider me a person that they go to for support & stability whereas I used to just bring chaos into their lives & often times violence  these are tough things to admit, but they are the truth.  I also just want to add that physically, I am in the best shape Ive been in since I was a teenager.\nKratom helps me with my anxiety, depression & substance abuse.  It has been 4 years since I had a drink, 4  without a pill & 2  years without Suboxine.  Kratom is not heroin or LSD.  Kratom is not K2 or Bath Salts.  if Kratom is taken off of the market, it will impact my life & most likely not for the better & I know that there are others out there like me, so please keep that in mind before making a decision on banning this substance.  \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18680","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyler Rayner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"to whom it may concern;\n    In 2006.

First off I am very relieved about the open comments. I am 21 year old and am a recovering opiate/heroin addict. I also suffer from Bipolar disorder, Severe anxiety, and depression. I would like to start by saying, I would not be where I am in life today without Kratom. I discovered the plant about 2 maybe 3 years ago. At that point, I was homeless, Jobless, carless, and stealing. When I couldn't afford to get my fix anymore I got to the point where I just wanted to take my life. So I got help. Ive been in and out of rehabs put on a numerous amount of medications that only made me feel more dead inside, or as if I was being lied to. Methadone, Sub, ect. all those things made me feel like I wasn't actually getting clean. I stopped treatment. eventually fell back into the same habbits. I remember when I was debating on whether I should end my life or give treatment another shot, an old friend of mine who currently works at a head shop got ahold of me. He said something along the lines of \"Hey man, You don't look so good, I know whats been going on, come into my shop tomorrow I need to talk to you about something, please\". So I pondered what he was talking about. I went into the store the next day and he told me about \"Kratom\" It sounded farfetched and too good to be true, but at that point I was willing to give anything a shot.II had bought a 14 gram bag of a strain called, \"Bali\" When I got home, feeling anxious, I mixed about 3 grams into a glass of water and chugged. Uncertainty started to rise as I felt nothing. It did nothing, I was left in disapointment. I thought maybe ill just do this cold turkey. After day 2 of quitting the withdrawls were way to intense I was sweating, Puking, not eating and on the toilet what felt like every living moment of the day. So I tried kratom again in hopes that it would do something.. I waited... waited.. nothing.. So I ran into my room searching for something sharp to slit my wrists.. then I felt lighter. My symptoms were slowly being relieved. I stopped and sat there. everything I had anticipated was coming true. It was like a miracle. No a gift from God. I had found the answer to all my questions. I have been clean from heroin for almost 2 years now.. I have been able to get off 10mg of Klonopin A day, 60mg of Prozac a day, and off 50mg of seroquel a day. I went from being all these things, To working 2 full time jobs, I own a car, I have my own place, Im off drugs and medications, I'm even off Kratom at this point and have went \"straight edge\" Kratom saved my life, and has gave me the strength to believe I can do anything I want. This PLANT that isn't even chemically altered has saved many lives other than mine. It is a safe alternative to Pharmaceutical opiates that have been killing people for years. This ban has disgusted me. Alcohol a substance that offers NOTHING BUT RECREATIONAL USE is legal and has killed more people than things deemed illegal. Kratom, does offer recreational use but It also offers people a chance at getting their life back.. More safe than alcohol. Our voices need to be heard Kratom should remain legal and not scheduled.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1648","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Erik Wymer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello. \n\nI have severe arthritis in both of my knees and my right hip.

I fought in the Iraq's Sunni Triangle in 2004, Iskandariya, Iraq  06-08, And Afghanistan 09-10.  As you can imagine it changes you,  you lose something that you can never get back.    The Army tried filling that void with multiple combinations of anti depressants, anti-anxiety , antipsychotics etc.  That made me worse,  I got divorced and lost my kids.  I tried percocets and got addicted, I found what I lost, a sense of happiness (or so I thought).  I got out of the Army and graduated to heroin.  I spent $8,000.00 in 2 months. \n\n    Either I  was going to die or do something unthinkable to maintain my habit.  I tried getting into rehab but for the $16,000.00 price tag it was impossible.  I luckily found a cash only Suboxone prescriber.    I was taking 24mg a day for one year.  I asked how long I have to be on this,  he said minimum 5 years.  Suboxone is worse than heroin in my opinion.  I started to ween myself off.  Over the course of 1year, I successfully weaned down to 1/16th of one pill.   Against his guidance.  I tried to quit, but I couldn't take that final step,  I didn't want to get high, so I maintained the 1/16th dose until I heard of Kratom.  I read that kratom could help with withdrawals.  So I purchased the ground leaf.  It did little,  so I ordered the potent extracts which did effectively help.  And yes there was a high with the extracts, but I was tired of being out of it all the time and needed to get my life back so I could fight for custody of my kids.  \n\n\n     I slowly switched from extracts to lower doses (2 TBS) of powdered leaf three times a day.  Over the course of 1 year I am now down to  TSP 2-3 times a day.  Since getting off of suboxone I look 10 years younger, I've gained my weight back, I am a  functioning member of society again, I am winning this custody battle, and in a wonderful relationship.  Oh and I have not gotten sick since starting kratom,  I do not get flu shots,  so I know for a fact there is medical properties in this wonderful plant.   It healed me, and its a plant.  So basic, yet so effective.     \n\n     So in my experience a simple plant did more than years of trying the myriad of FDA approved medications, even heroin.    Please take this into consideration before labeling me a felon drug addict.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely, Chris Pizzino","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15094","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Pizzino","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't ban kratom.

That would put it in the same illegal category as heroin. This is not an addictive drug. I know. For those of us seeking a less dangerous alternative when pain is overwhelming, for those times when we may need a prescription for an opiod but wish not to go down that road of addiction, Kratom has been a safe herb. I have had no side effects nor am I addicted. I believe in government regulations, but this is one case where I don't think you should intervene. If you take this herb-and it is an herb- away from people suffering in pain and illness-the only alternative is opiods or going to heroin. How is that going to help the worst health care issue of the century-addiction? Kratom is a safer choice than opioids or street drugs and if you take this away from people, there are no other safe options to deal with pain or to help with withdrawal from opiods. There are fewer deaths from Kratom than tylenol, or antibiotics for that matter. Please attend to more important issues such as opiod addiction and heroin abuse.

I suffer from bipolar disorder, anxiety, insomnia, restless leg syndrome and social anxiety. Kratom has changed my life so much after many years of suffering with mood swings and feelings of rage, sadness and anger. I was not able to feel control of those emotions in the past, even after many years of trying different prescription medications. Those medications caused weight gain, sleepiness and other issues. It has helped my depression a ton but also let me just be myself, finally! I am finally able to enjoy things in my life, my hobbies, my family, and my work. Kratom has helped my social-anxiety so much, if it wasn't for kratom I wouldn't leave my house to grocery shop or just be with my family, much less, be able to work a normal full-time job. Before I found kratom, I was unable to sleep more than a few hours per night. I used to have to depend on benzodiazepines, which alone, caused me great worry as they are very addictive and very difficult to stop taking when used often due to horrific side effects, however, it was necessary so that I could sleep at night to handle my daily responsibilities.   I feel that because kratom is a natural plant, in the coffee family, is very mild, non-addictive, and it is not an opiate or benzodiazepine, it is my safest option.  I would like to thank you for your time, I believe that kratom should stay unscheduled for people over 18 to use for their needs.\n\nSincerely,\nChad Woods","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9388","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chad Woods","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've never used kratom but I believe heavily that we should allow for natural herbal suppliments, especially those who it really benefits other people.

I have been working in the medical field for 36 yrs. As a person with long term medical experience, I am always skeptical of broad claims made by individuals or companies, about supplements, diets, herbs, whatever. I researched Kratom for over a year before trying it. I have never used illegal drugs and have not had a true addiction to any prescription drugs. I have suffered from some significant side effects when discontinuing antidepressants and when I discontinued Tramadol. When I began using Kratom, I discontinued Tramadol, and did not suffer the side effects I had experienced previously. Tramadol had simply stopped working for my pain and I was not willing to increase the dosage above recommended dosages. I found that I was able to do more activities after starting Kratom, something as simple as working a full day and then going grocery shopping, did not cause the severe, disabling pain I usually experienced. Maybe because Kratom is related to coffee, I decreased my caffeine intake but could still sleep well at night. Kratom has made me feel more in control of my pain, since I don't have to worry about pain medications or what kind of side effects the medications that will be tried next will have. I don't drink alcohol, as I don't like the feelings of being out of control. so have been pleased I do not have unusual feeling with Kratom. I don't feel light-headed, dizzy or have a major euphoric feeling, just better control because my pain is less. Kratom has not cured me, anymore than Magnesium has cured my migraines, but it helps. I have talked with multiple people that use Kratom, for multiple issues, and I believe that banning or scheduling Kratom will send many back to opiates, legal or illegal, other illegal drugs and many other prescription drugs, with undesirable side effects. We have a HUGE drug problem and so many drug related deaths, Kratom appears to be helping many people with these issues and should remain available. Making it unavailable, without complete studies and investigation is unfair to the many that are using it and have found a more active life again. When you compare the deaths linked to opiates, even legally prescribed, there is no comparison to the number that MIGHT be linked to Kratom, most were also using other drugs and alcohol. Please, keep Kratom legal. So many pain patients, anxiety patients, veterans with PTSD and previous drug addicts rely on it. It may also have the potential to save many lives that could end because of legal and illegal drugs, like opiates and heroine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15027","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Virginia Barrett","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am an American Citizen and I am greatly upset by concept that the DEA would push for the regulation or ban of any substance; much less with 0 scientific research to direct such action.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9213","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Evans","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello\nMy name is  Jake.

We lead in opiod abuse across in all age groups, and local research has shown we consume 9.2 kgs of morphine equivalent per 100,000 residents.  Oklahoma has traditionally been incredibly stringent on drugs, and it is causing severe damage to our society.  And while Narcan is now carried by some emergency services groups, only one pharmacy location in our capital city of 3.5mln people even carries it.  Additionally, local policies against drug paraphernalia cause individuals to resort to dangerous options (such as re-using needles), spreading disease and misery through HIV and HEP C at levels which devastate lives, as well as create churn in our over burdened medical systems through increased costs in our broken pharmaceutical system and CDC resources.  Policies like what was being proposed are the reason why Oklahoma jails are filling up (1.3% of our population is incarcerated) and there is no evidence that increasing this number will do anything short of bankrupt our already financially burdened state.  \n\nClearly, our approach to drug scheduling and raising the barrier to entry to drugs is not a viable solution.  I believe fully that any government policy which places policy over the physical welfare of it's citizens is dangerous, misguided, and morally corrupt.  \n\nKratom is one herbal solution, and while not perfect, solutions which decrease overall social misery is what we need to focus on as a nation if we are to better our way of life, solve our criminal justice system, and remove dependency on dangerous drugs.  Our life spans are shrinking despite research in advanced medicine and a virtually unlimited amount of money being spent through public and private initiatives.  \n\nAnecdotally, I have several friends who routinely use various herbal remedies for various purposes (bodybuilding, pain relief, sleep aids, etc), and kratom is such an example of one.  No harm has come to them, and to place this drug as CDS seems to be reactionary and without scientific basis. \n\nI am looking forward to the day when we can treat chemistry and medical science in a methodical way which prioritizes drugs on a spectrum of harm to individuals and society, instead of the out-dated FDA's definition of \"abuse potential\".  Getting the right chemicals to the right individuals is a task that goes well beyond the DEA - it belongs to FDA, our doctors, police, court systems, our drug companies, farmers, substance abuse counselors, and individual patients.  Only a holistic view with public health as a concern is our hope to end the death and misery the war on drugs caused.  \n\nOur current system places drugs such as anabolic steroids on par with morphine, where the former is medically as safe as horseback riding and the latter more akin to russian roulette.  We have depression medication handed out en masse in a nation where suicide is the 10th most likely cause of death, but these are largely considered a legend drug.  The scheduling of drugs makes no sense in a world where data driving analysis is the norm and people are willing to relocate to new states and countries to pursue individual health. \n\nPerhaps the closest analog to kratom's ban was the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014, which placed Pro hormones (chemicals which convert to anabolic steroids) as CDS III.  Bodybuilders and casual gym enthusiasts want quality results from their time in the gym, but with anabolic steroids being banned, they were forced to resort to more dangerous drugs (prohormones), which are known to be highly liver toxic and dangerous for users.  As individual chemicals kept getting added to the list, more and more dangerous versions (sometimes multi-stage derivatives to standard steroids) are being used.  \n\nSimilarly, krocodile made it to the scene as heroin was cracked down by law enforcement... and before heroin, morphine and opium.  The average lifespan of a krocodile user is only 3 years, all of which are perhaps the most brutal one can imagine.  With every addition to the list, we are producing another set of addicts, another set of drugs, and another set of problems for our society. \n\nLet's be fully clear - adding kratom to the controlled substance list does not save lives.  It will destroy them.  \n\nI look forward to working with the DEA, FDA, and the Congress in any capacity I can which will help prioritize and schedule drugs based upon risk, benefits to the patient, cost to the individual, and cost to society as a whole.  \n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2669","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon Bagwell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't put Kartom on the Schedule I list.

I work for a large provider of mental health services with a state mental health program.  I suffer a chronic inflammatory condition that affects my joints, skin, and muscles and have been prescribed various types of pain management.  One of the hallmark symptoms of my condition is chronic pain.  I've tried several anti-inflammatory medications available by prescription and OTC, which ultimately led to severe stomach ulcerations.  I cannot use anti-inflammatory medications without having nosebleeds and worsening stomach ulcerations.  I used opioid pain medications under the care of a doctor with great success at times.  However, this came with many side effects.  And despite the negative effects, my body (and my mind) required more.  The therapeutic value decreases as the need for more increases.  I was eventually prescribed a very strong medication that caused severe and constant migraines, complete loss of appetite, severe and unrelenting depression. I was ready to end my life.  I finally destroyed the rest of my prescription because I was so sick of the constant migraines and the dysphoria.  I had missed multiple days of work during the course of my treatment related to pain and the depression that follows.  I had used my short term disability already through Prudential and was planning the application process for Social Security Disability with the help of an attorney.  I spent months reading and digging for answers on suppression of inflammation, pain reduction methods, and alternative treatments.  I read about kratom and decided to give it a shot.  I was happy with the results after a few days of supplementing with kratom.  It didn't kill all of the pain like prescription pain killers did.  But I didn't expect that.  All I wanted was a tolerable level of pain without the brain fog, without the drowsiness and depression.  Kratom gave me just that.  I started eating again, as my GI tract returned to normal motility. Kratom seemed to reduce the symptoms associated with GI inflammation.  I was able to think clearly again.  I was able to have emotions again.  I started lifting weights and walking, then slowly worked my way to jogging.  When I returned to work, my work life was much more stable.  I was finally able to work 1 year with no call ins.  I made some major improvements in my life.  Kratom kept me out of the disability system.  It kept me out of the roulette wheel of pain management meds, addiction, and possibly darker paths.  I use this as a supplement just as I would any of the other herbal supplements I take daily.  \nI lift weights when I can and I do cardio.  I work a full time job and work overtime.  I have state employee benefits and a state retirement.  I have a savings account that climbs steadily.  I have worked and paid taxes since I was 16 years old.  For 21 years I have been a hard working tax paying citizen.  My life does not fit the profile of an abuser of controlled substances.  I have never been arrested or in any kind of trouble.  It is unreasonable to make kratom a controlled substance!  There are thousands of people just like me who do not want to be on narcotic pain killers.  There are thousands of people who have multiple adverse reactions to anti-inflammatories and simply cannot take them.  It is economically sensible to leave kratom as a legal herbal supplement.  Please do not take away our option that allows us to work and continue to be part of the economic infrastructure.

I am 33 years old, a homemaker, and am strongly opposed to the intent to schedule the plant known as kratom. I am a mother first and foremost...my 6 year old daughter is my life. I want her to grow up with an active, engaging mother (myself). For years, I suffered from arthritis pain, anxiety, major depression, lack of energy and a host of other problems related to my health. I was given prescriptions by my doctor, but while the problems were overall not as severe, they definitely were still present and cast a huge shadow over our household. A friend suggested that I read up on kratom, so I did some research and found it to be considered safe, having been used for thousands of years in Asia. \n\nI first purchased some in early 2014, from a vendor online. I was quite skeptical that a plant could help improve my life, but I gave it a shot...I figured at that point, I didn't have much to lose. Almost immediately, my health improved. I was able to play with my daughter, and truly enjoy life. Instead of being stuck in bed most days, I started becoming active and was able to lose weight and gain back energy I hadn't felt in years. I now volunteer for a pediatric cancer foundation in my spare time, chase my daughter around, and am active in her school. \n\nI owe so much to kratom. I have absolutely zero negative effects from kratom. Unlike with many prescriptions, I don't feel dizzy, foggy-headed or \"drugged\"...kratom is myself, only better. I dread what my life will become if kratom is taken away and made illegal. My daughter will lose a huge part of her childhood...my husband will lose his best friend...and I will lose my ability to be an active part of society. Please consider the lives that will be affected...not just the people like me, but the people like my daughter and husband. Kratom is safe and effective, it should continue to be available to the American public as it is in no way a threat to public safety. I truly do not understand how horrific things like tobacco and alcohol can be kept legal, yet kratom not. \n\nThank you for your consideration on this matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0670","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Melissa Lambert","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \nI am a 43 year old semiconductor fabrication tech, and I am writing to you in regards to the proposed ban on the all natural, organic, life changing herb \"Kratom\" .

I've been taking Kratom for  3 years now, and it has changed my life in an extremely positive way.

So on one hand they would help, but then on the other they would create new unbearable issues.  A family member that suffers from the same issues as myself told me about Kratom, so I gave it a try, and I haven't needed anything else since! I can go out to public events, deal with my very demanding job on a daily basis, etc. with absolutley NO side effects. I don't know where the DEA gets their facts, but Kratom is definitely NOT a drug, it does NOT get you high, and its as addictive as caffeine. It's in the coffee family and is not even close to an opiate. Please keep Kratom legal, and available to the American people. There are so many health benefits from this wonderful, life changing herb.  I truly believe that God put it on our planet for a reason. I don't like opiates, or any type of chemically produced drug.

I have been on two deployments to Iraq, plus too many field exercises to count, and I live with chronic pain everyday of my life.  In January 2010 in Iraq is when my chronic pain started and for about four years no one knew what was causing my pain.  I started taking 5/325mg of  Percocet twice a day in October 2010 when I returned from Iraq because from the beginning till this time the pain progressively got worse.  I left and went to my next duty station and the pain continued.  In July 2011 I was sent to the Pain Clinic, and the doctor was giving me all kind of shots in my back, but had absolutely no clue as to what was causing my pain.  He started me on 10/325mg of Percocet three times which didn't not take the pain away, it only helped make it tolerable.  The year 2012 rolls around and I am in the same physical state I was in initially when I went to see the pain doctor, and absolutely nothing was helping.  The shots were doing nothing and by this time I built-up a tolerance to the Percocet.  Next he puts me on 60mgs of MS Contin three times a day, I am going from a total of 30mg of Percocet a day, to 180mg of MS Contin a day, this was a huge leap in narcotics.  I was on this for over a year and was not living life, as the ms contin was making me so exhausted it is amazing I was able to function.  I would go in to physical training so exhausted, I could barely keep my eyes open. I would be in bed by 7:30 p.m. and  on the weekend I would not get-up till 2 p.m. If I needed to run errands on a weekend that was a chore, as I would not leave the house till 4 p.m.and only be out for a couple of hours, and as soon as I got home I was back in the bed.  I stopped running, going to the gym, or doing any extracurricular activities because between the pain and exhaustion, it was just too much.  Finally in January 2014 I got off of the ms contin, and was not taking anything for a couple of months, till I just could not handle the pain.  By this time I had a new pain clinic doctor and she realized I have sacroiliac joint dysfunction,  which also causes my hip to hurt, and I have pain that runs down my leg.  I started taking Tramadol in  March 2014 because the pain was just intolerable, then back to Percocet because Tramadol did not help.  In December 2014 I was out of Percocet and did not have an appointment anytime soon to see my pain doctor.  I started looking something holistically that would help me to live with my pain, and not having to take narcotics for the rest of my life.  I found Kratom which does not only help with my pain, but it also helps me deal with my PTSD, anxiety, and insomnia.  I am able to run, do distance walking, siting or standing for long periods of time because of Kratom.  I am able to do my chores around the house without being in excruciating pain while doing chores, or even when I am done.  I have been able to paint rooms in my house.  As for as the addictive quality of Kratom that some insist it has, I have not experienced it, and I have been taking it for two years now.  I will drink one 8.5 ozs  container and sip on that all throughout the day if I need it.  I will have one 12 oz container in the late evening, but I never finish it as I don't need to.  I will have 8 oz left by the morning. In each of these containers I only use 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons per container.  I don't have any withdrawals the next day, if I only drank 4 ounces the night before.  Kratom has been a lifesaver for me. I don't want to ever have to go back to taking a narcotic especially for the rest of my life,  because I have already been told I will have chronic pain for the rest of my life.  I served my country for 24 years, and I did all that the military asked of me, and now in the end I have to suffer with the pain, and the many other ailments that came with serving.  Now a big organization that has no idea what life is like for  many of us Veterans that live with many physical problems, but still want to be a productive part of society, are being told once again, what we cannot do for our pain.  I understand if it does need to be regulated because of the abuser that are out there, but if that is the case regulate coffee, cigarettes, and alcohol, just to name a few.  Every last one of these maintains an addictive quality, to include the drugs that are prescribed by providers such as Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, and Fentanyl, again just to name a few.  Coming after a leaf that helps and has helped many for years without first coming for those drugs that are legal and cause deathly harm is cowardly.  It is like attacking a defenseless child, but letting a killer get away.  Thank you for the opportunity comment, and also thank you for taking the time to read this. Hope you have a wonderful pain and ailment free life. Take care.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20157","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Adam Swider and I am 30 years old and have a Masters degree in Science.

Teaching is my vocation, and it is central to my life; but I do not work full time, because I cant. My entire adult life has been marked by severe anhedonic depression, which has profoundly affected my professional prospects and my personal relationships. Anhedonic is not just another way of saying depressed; it is a terrifying, seemingly progressive characteristic of depression as I experience it: the loss of the capacity to feel pleasure. And pleasure doesnt just mean laughter and joy and frivolity, things that might seem luxuries; it also means the emotional buffer that allows resilience in response to stress, conflict, and trauma. To lose that buffer is crippling, especially when the situation is compounded by anxiety. Meanwhile, sleep, even brief naps, sleep that should knit up the raveled sleeve of care, routinely precipitates me into a state of bleakness and terror from which I must recover on waking. Depression has been part of my life since I was a teenager; anhedonia gets more devastating every year.\n\nOver the past 35 years, I have been prescribed over thirty medications as treatment for my conditionmany for years. I have been through tricyclics and lithium, SSRIs, MAOIs, atypicals, anti-psychotics, thyroid hormones, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, opiates, and OTC supplements. I have undergone a wide range of tests in the hope of finding aggravating medical conditions related to my symptoms. I have had years of therapy, which taught me some valuable things even as it ultimately confirmed my belief that my problem was fundamentally physical. One doctor was convinced that I suffered from an endogenous opioid deficiency. That may be true. Heartbreakingly, despite years of hope, work, and frustration, no combination of those strategies has proved entirely adequate. I have been forced to accept that treatment-resistant depression is a lifelong condition, and I have lost too much life already. I cannot afford to keep investing my hope in best practice treatments that do me more harm than good, even if they worked for the wide center of the bell distribution. Instead, I do what I can to live with my depression, to hold on to the few people I am still close to, to keep on teaching, and to sustain whatever creative work I can manage.\n\nI discovered kratom three years ago when I was researching the relation of endogenous opioids to depression. It proved to be a godsend. While kratom doesnt cure my depression and anhedonia, it is a profound help in surviving them. Kratom has also helped me to rid my life of both benzodiazepines and pharmaceutical opiates, neither of which had cured or adequately treated my condition more than transiently despite a decade of doctor-prescribed regular use. \n\nI am a doctors son. I read a lot about kratom and its alkaloids before I actually tried it. What I found out convinced me it was worth trying, and to my amazement, it was. But it does not make me high. Kratom is a mildly psychoactive herb that is as amenable to sane and responsible use as coffee or tea. It also has mild mood-elevating and analgesic properties coffee and tea do not; but I can say, emphatically and from experience, that kratom is nonetheless that kind of thing, not some kind of herbal heroin. What it feels like, to me, is having access to my normal self again. It helps me turn toward the love and work that are the only genuine anchors for a rich, worthwhile life in the world. \n\nThe DEA announcement this fall treated kratom as a drug of abuse and kratom users, categorically, as abusers. But the misguided people who have sought out kratom as a poor excuse for a legal high are vastly outnumbered by the large community for whom kratom has been an invaluable support to productive, socially responsible lives. We are not abusers seeking a furtive, dangerous, antisocial thrill; we can't even recognize ourselves in the DEA's portrait of this supposed public health crisis.\n\nYou will have heard from many former addicts who credit their sobriety to this benign herb, and from countless chronic pain sufferers, many of them middle-aged or elderly, including not a few disabled veterans, who are grateful for having found it. But I can speak from direct personal experience only for people like me, sufferers from treatment-resistant depression, crippling anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder. It is no exaggeration to say that kratom has helped many of us save our own lives. If the sheer size of the kratom-using community has been invisible until now, that is precisely because we are NOT a lurking threat either to society or to ourselves.\n\nFor me, this is about the pursuit of happinesslove and worknot some recreational high. \n\nIt's about the dignity of being allowed to manage my own private life and turn toward what matters.\n\nPlease keep kratom legal, with whatever regulatory process is appropriate to keep it unadulterated and safe. Please listen to us.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6310","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gregory Foster","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Alicia McGee Damron,  I'm a 38 year old mother of two and live in rural North Carolina.

I don't even drink soft drinks (I prefer water) and I eat whole, real foods (including fresh eggs from my backyard chickens and vegetables from my garden) and practice yoga in my quest to stay fit and healthy. I mention this to give you an idea of the type of person I am.\n\nFor occasional acute pain (such as when I pulled a muscle in my back) I have used kratom to help. It definitely helped my pain and there was no \"high\" associated with it. I researched this herb before I made the decision to use it. It was NOT an impulse buy. I was happy to have it as an option because it fits with my lifestyle choices.\n\nAlthough I've only used kratom a handful of times myself, I have three family members who use it on a regular basis to help with chronic pain issues such as rheumatoid arthritis, back pain stemming from an old injury, and knee pain due to degenerative issues. I've seen how much it helps them maintain an active lifestyle and improves their quality of life.

In our country millions of people struggle with drug addiction and major substance abuse, I have been one of the many who have in the past. I can honestly say that Kratom has saved my life. I discovered Kratom while i was searching for anything to help me not be an addict or depend upon harmful prescription drugs to battle my addiction to opiates. I am 53 year old professional woman with a 19 year old daughter with special needs, someone who had so much to lose if i took the very dangerous step toward more harmful drugs, and i can admit that i am positive my next step would have been to move on to heroin. I thank God every day that i discovered Kratom. My life is now free of addiction for the first time in 20 years. I welcome each day and i thrive every day with enthusiasm and a deep love of my life and the life of my family and friends. I have NEVER had any adverse reaction to Kratom. I dont think that is even possible. I can understand the concern surrounding Kratom. Perhaps banning it to underage children would be the only ban i would agree with. I, along with millions of other citizens beg you to not ban this life saving plant. Our country is in the throes of such a crisis with addiction, PLEASE allow us law abiding users of Kratom to continue to live without opiates controlling our lives. I have not taken an opiate in 2 years and i use Kratom only 3 times per week. As you can see, I am not dependent daily on Kratom but it certainly keeps me free of any illicit drugs . Kratom is saving lives. Kratom is the answer to the drug crisis in our country. Please hear all of us as we support keeping Kratom legal for all adult citizens.

I would like you to compare Desoxyn(methamphetamine) to coffee.  Now, I would like to compare heroin(diamorphine) to kratom.  That is what's going on.  If that plant becomes illegal which has both an opioid antagonist and a partial agonist in it quite like suboxone in which this plant will not cause death (although suboxone still can but kratom will not).\n\nI had to change to using butyr-fentanyl after the controversy over kratom and do you know the feeling of overdosing with your mother over you trying to save you with Narcan when you are a sixteen-year-old teenager with a 3.8GPA (and hopefully it will increase) and active in sports and in boy scouts.

Because of the DEA and their misinformation, this lead to my close to death experience where I had to be narcan'd 3-5x because of how potent these legal fentanyl analogues are.  And once again, that's not the problem.  I am not involved very much with politics of how these agencies work (as again, I am only sixteen) and I have heard the rumors of the economic benefits that come from banning Kratom as a new drug that is \"non-addictive\" was going through clinical trials.  Because I have lost the access to Kratom over all this controversy, I may have just lost my scholarship and my whole life.  I am underage and I do not use this drug to get high.

No withdrawal no change in mood or personality No ulcers or decreased liver/ kidney function no drops in BP. Her back pain is no longer controlling her life we don't have to plan around her back pain. It also goes without saying that this herbal supplement kept her from continuing down the path of narcotic pain medications being prescribed by her Dr. which is a very serious issue for many in this country. I would ask those of you at the DEA who are concerned to focus your efforts on the opiate epidemic that is rampaging throughout the medical community. Drs are to quick and willing to prescribe medications that have the potential to destroy people's lives. This plant has done nothing but give me my wife back without the negative side affects of opiates, no withdrawal no making sure we didn't miss a drs appointment or calling every pharmacy in a 25 mile radius to see if they have the medication in stock just so my wife doesn't go through withdrawal having to plan around her drs appointments as well as her prescription refills. on really bad pain days she's no longer completely out of it because of the medications. I implore you to please not go through with the proposed ban on what has given me my wife back I don't want to go back to the way things were before she started taking Kratom this plant works. I can't stress enough how devastating it will be to have to start my wife back on opiates and N-SAiD's especially after finding and using a highly superior all natural herbal supplement. Please focus your efforts on the opiate epidemic and not on a safe non addicting herbal supplement I appreciate the opportunity to express my thoughts on this and for you at the DEA taking the time to review the proposed ban. Again I implore you to not take from me what has given me my wife back and given her, her life back","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6967","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew B","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a veterinary student and use Kratom for test anxiety and managing knee pain.

However there is so much more to this strong belief of mine.\n\nI found Kratom a year ago after a 3 knee surgeries in 3 years and the subsequent prescriptions to pain-killers. The Vicodin made me dizzy, nauseous and lazy.  I did a lot of internet searches along the lines of \"natural Vicodin alternative\", etc. Up came Kratom and the hundreds of amazing success stories. My curiosity was piqued and I ordered a sample.\n\nIn short, not only was I able to toss the prescriptions for my pain, but it has also allowed changed my life with regards to my life-long struggle with severe depression and anxiety. it has absolutely been a \"game-changer\" for me. I now use it daily and have been doing so for a little over a year. I never \"crave\" it or \"need\" it. It doesn't impair me in ANY way. \n\nWere this plant to become illegal, I would be devastated. My fiancee with severe Lupus has also been able to throw away her Vicodin prescription. We (all Americans) have finally found a natural, non-addictive alternative to pain medication; one of the biggest addiction problems in this country. As if you didn't know that fact. :) But the list of OTHER medical benefits is astounding. \n\nMy depression would resurface and it would lead me back to the fruitless search for more prescriptions that have never worked in 40 years. I feel so good about taking a harmless, non-toxic leaf... 100% natural. It has made me more effective at work, I have been more social, it allows me to actually look forward to the day. I am so grateful to have found Kratom. \n\nI ask that you read this very short summary of laboratory research on Kratom as an anti-depressant. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20869223\n\nIn conclusion, I urge (plead) you to consider my story amidst the hundreds of thousands you will see. There are people if far worse pain than me that have found freedom with Kratom. We are not a community of addicts. We are people that want to contribute more to society in a positive way. Please listen to us.\n\nI sincerely THANK YOU for this opportunity to be heard. It is greatly appreciated.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1584","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Turpen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI am a 26 year old woman living in the Southeast US. I work full time as an inside sales representative at a national company, and do a small amount of artistic freelance work as well. I first was introduced to kratom by a friend who has had trouble with depression. He mentioned he'd had some at a local tea place and it had helped with some of the sleepiness (physical) and general hopeless & low feelings (emotional) he was struggling with. I experience moderate depression and moderate to high anxiety, which so far I've treated with regular therapy sessions and a low dose of antianxiety medication (taken on an as-needed basis). \n\nAfter having the person working at the tea shop explain to me what to expect & the general properties of kratom tea, I tried it. The experience wasn't quite like any other I've had (I drink alcohol and have tried marijuana a few times, in addition to having had painkillers prescribed to me after various surgeries). I felt physically less sore & stiff from my day at work, and also less \"muddled\"-- it was noticeably easier to express my thoughts & I felt a bit like I'd had a cup of coffee (but without the heart racing/ other side effects of caffeine). This was accompanied by a calming effect slightly reminiscent of the painkillers, but without slowing my thought processes or physical responses. Overall, it was a very positive experience. \n\nI've consumed kratom tea (the powder mixed with water and a little milk) maybe 20 times total, spread over the course of a year. It's been particularly helpful to me when my depression kicks up and I'm tempted to drink alcohol (sometimes to excess). Instead of trying to obtain the \"escape\" from my negative psychological symptoms through drinking, I can dependably find an even better solution that simply helps me function in a calm yet alert way. I can't medically claim kratom has antianxiety or antidepressant effects; but I can assert that using it has allowed me to limit & sometimes eliminate my use of prescription medications to treat those symptoms.\n\nI've only experienced negative effects of drinking kratom tea once, and in that instance it was due to the fact I drank it after not having eaten recently (against the recommendation of both my friend and the tea shop employee). I felt an upset stomach and some nausea, which was alleviated by slowly drinking water & eating a small meal. \n\nI would add that I carefully observed my motor functions the first few times I drank the tea-- my friend had told me that I should have no trouble driving 20 minutes home, but I wanted to be especially careful since I'd never consumed this before. He was correct-- if anything, I noticed a slight increase in my alertness (comparable to half a cup of coffee). I have never felt impaired by kratom. \n\nI feel that this naturally occurring substance has noticeably improved my well-being, and has no negative effects that I have noticed. I have had no symptoms of dependency, nor have my acquaintances who consume it. My friend who first introduced me to the drink is a more frequent user (due to his more severe and long-standing depression), and similarly has no symptoms of dependency and consistent relief from his illness. \n\nI strongly oppose efforts to ban the use of kratom in the United States, especially as there is currently no significant clinical research to support claims of its negative effects. I also know that some of my acquaintances who consume kratom do so to support their efforts at battling addiction to hard drugs (usually opioids) that have been repeatedly proven to be very detrimental to health as well as being physically and psychologically addictive. \n\nFinally, if kratom were to be made illegal in the US, I would stop consuming it-- but I would worry for those depending on it as a substitute for prescription drugs/ heroin. Those struggling with addiction would likely seek kratom from another source, which would be completely unregulated (since illegal). Either they would risk their health by using this black market kratom, or they would return to using hard drugs. \n\nI urge you to reconsider this move to make kratom a Schedule 1 Controlled Substance-- or at the very least, postpone it until we have dependable research & large, duplicated studies to establish the benefits, neutral effects, and side effects. Kratom has helped me personally, and I find it extremely hard to believe that it is harmful, and it certainly doesn't seem to belong in the Schedule 1 category of controlled substances. I respect the opinions of medical experts and the data collected in clinical trials, but cannot find there is sufficient evidence at present to merit placing kratom on the controlled substance list.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13164","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm not a person who gets involved in policy-making usually, however this issue is close to me. My first objection to banning kratom is the expansion of the obviously failed (and what seems to be universally not-supported) drug war. To arrest people for drugs is ridiculous, to arrest people for kratom is very similar to arresting someone for drinking coffee(coffee probably has a stronger effect). lastly, kratom helps people who desperately need help and whatever resource that may help (ie opiate addicts). the drugs available for opiate addicts are ineffective, and often lead to addiction themselves. It is not up to the DEA to decide what does and does not help people, they are there to protect the public. banning kratom will not help anyone. it is very disturbing to a lot of people that this ban is being considered, and the implications are even more disturbing. stop this ridiculous drug-war, and don't stand in the way of medicines that people seek out for themselves that have 0 negative effects for most that take it. \n\nsincerely,\nconcerned citizen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11021","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps me function and not take SSRI's which I must have if not for kratom.

I suffer from degenerative disc disease, have torn ligaments & muscles in both knees, & the depression & anxiety that goes with knowing I have been unable to participate in my daughters' lives because of the severe pain. I decided to try kratom because I was tired of standing on the sidelines of my life. The prescriptions I was on were doing nothing for my pain. I couldn't sleep. The anti-depressants were just an emotional \"off\" switch. I couldn't care less about anything, including my family. I had also started drinking, heavily. Let's just say I was a mess, a disgrace, & completely ashamed of myself. I started taking kratom about 7 months after I detoxed from the methadone I was on to relieve my pain. I was still drinking, though. I couldn't handle the pain without it. The doctors won't prescribe narcotics to me because I was on methadone. The medications they gave me were a joke, anti-inflammatories help, but not much.\n   Today I am happy. I am healthier than I was a year ago. I am involved in my children's lives, & have hope for the future for the first time in a very long time. I am a member of the PTA, & am able to volunteer. I am looking forward to starting a job, as I was in too much pain to do so before. I am asking you to please not ban kratom. It is an herb that has helped me to finally be the mother, wife, & daughter that I always wanted to be. I'm not in (much) pain..it's still there, but I can live with it. I also would like to say that kratom has killed any desire to drink., which is a great thing for those of us with alcoholism! I am proud to say that I am now 13 months & 15 days clean & sober. My prescriptions were an albatross, they made me feel high & not all 'there'. \n   Before I learned about kratom, my husband tried to get me to smoke marijuana to help ease my pain & anxiety, but, I'm not a kid anymore...I don't want to feel high..the mental medications made me feel 'spacey', & I didn't like it one bit. Kratom has no 'high'...that's one of the things I like most about it! I get pain relief, anxiety relief, motivation, & clarity of mind. \n    Once more, please reconsider your stance on this. Please keep kratom legal!\n                                                                                                                                   \n                                                                            \n                                                                                                                             Thank You,\n                                                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                                     Mercedes Kiffer","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8944","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mercedes Kiffer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have never been addicted to any opiates and do not use kratom as an opiate.

We've consumed it in nearly all available forms and strains, including liquids, raw powder, capsules, etc. I can speak on Kratom's behalf as an advanced critical thinker, as a college instructor with a Master's in English Literature, The main and sole reason for consumption in my household is for daily medical, health, and motivational benefits in the same way coffee or lemon water would be used for health and motivational reasons for one's daily functions. The editorials published initially published on Kratom, such as the article in Vice Magazine that compares it to a brainchild of Oxycotin and Adderall, are completely hyperbolic and fictitious. Both prescriptions the article compares Kratom to are controlled substances for good reason. However, Kratom has never elicited anything near the experience of being prescribed an opioid medication nor an amphetamine for ADHD. What I've come to understand from my consumption of Kratom is that the natural substance experienced a brief period of exaggerated media coverage in order to increase consumers awareness and motivate sales when it began making its way on the shelves of smoke shops and online stores across the US. Had Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, the active ingredients in Kratom, resembled any of the main or side effects of the aforementioned controlled substances, it would have been stripped from the shelves years ago when the first wave of concerned citizens investigated the it, largely due to the mixed and promotional nature of the published editorials on Kratom. Kratom is a cousin of the coffee plant, and consuming feels very much like ingesting a more mild, foul tasting version of coffee. Coffee's powerful caffeinated effects far exceeds the physical and mental effects on the body when contrasted to Kratom. Kratom's effects are much more subtle, and much less altering. My partner and I use Kratom as a coffee alternative as its lack of caffeine feels significantly more healthy and relaxing on the body, and doesn't exhibit any of the alter state or feeling of anxiety that coffee offers. The other main reason for consumption is Kratom's known abilities to promote well being and a sense of overall natural happiness rooted in a softening of anxiety. I would compare this effect to St. John's Wart, the popular herbal substance available to help curb daily depression and promote positive feelings of well being. Kratom feels like a mild version of both coffee and St. John's Wart, but remarkably more natural on the body. The misconception that Kratom carries any mind or body altering properties, or that it has any negative or dangerous consequences to one's health is completely fictitious and has never been described or experienced by myself, my partner, or any of our friends or colleagues who use Kratom regularly as a replacement for caffeine or other natural herbal remedies. Kratom's regular use in parts of Asian, primarily Thailand and Indonesia has been documented to show its value in daily use. Kratom leaves are used in the same manner that Americans use coffee. I found Kratom to be an incredibly effective and healthy alternative. Withdrawal to Kratom after extended use resembles the mild symptoms of coffee: a slight headache for a day or two, with no psychological or physical withdrawal symptoms. The literature review that cites Kratom as a concern attempts to place it in the same category as other opioids, which has become a major epidemic in the United States. The use of Kratom couldn't be further from the use of opioids. Although it possesses the abilities to register to the same receptors as some opioids, it does not illicit the same affects. This is common in other substances, as some strains of marijuana can bind to receptors but cannot provide a \"high\" therefore are not grown or circulated. The comparison of Kratom to opioids is a stretch at best, as they are two completely different plants with two different biochemical effects in the human body. The main concern of opioids, including the attempt to label Kratom as such, is the risk of respiratory failure. This was a concern of mine until I became using Kratom, and found the recent studies on Kratom show there is no risk of respiratory depression in Kratom. All incidents of injury or medical concern involving Kratom have all involved use of another abused substance, such as opioids, alcohol, or cough syrup.

I am against placing mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, and kratom plant on Schedule I.  Instead, I suggest that kratom is regulated like alcohol and tobacco (to ensure that suppliers provide unadulterated plant material).\n\nIn terms of scientific understanding, the data available so far suggests that the main kratom alkaloids modulate a number of molecular targets, not just the opioid receptors. Further, it appears that these compounds are \"mild modulators\", meaning that they show low potency and low efficacy. In other words, they are not nearly as powerful as prescription opioids and they affect a wider range of molecular systems. There are also differences in how mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine turn on the opioid receptors (compared to classical opioids), and older literature indicates much better safety profile in terms of respiratory depression of mitragynine in several mammalian species.\n\nUnfortunately, the clinical data available today is only anecdotal (reports by users online and in this public deposition). In my opinion, DEA can not ignore the hundreds of reports from people who benefit from kratom use. The theme I gathered from these reports is that kratom is mild, yet effective at alleviating suffering caused by intractable/chronic pain, depression, anxiety, and drug abuse. \n\nIn terms of the risks, the number of cases of intoxication and death linked to mitragynine/kratom (discussed in the DEA's document) must be put in the broader context. How many deaths are reported as caused by alcohol, tobacco, food allergies, prescribed medicines, etc? This is a question for toxicologists and epidemiologists, but it is essential that the handful of mitragynine poisoning cases are considered in this perspective.

Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n\nStop working for big corporations and big money and start doing your job -- working for the majority of average Americans.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15608","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"C Brussat","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a natural occurring plant, and its alkaloids should not be added to the banned substance list.\n\nKratom is a healthy supplement.\n\n!!!!!!

My circumstances have led me down dark and dangerous roads, which included trying a myriad of antidepressants from professionals (many of which produced intolerable side effects), to the inevitable route of self- medicating with perscription narcotics after a dentist prescribed them. I discovered that some narcotic pain meds actually provided relief from my issues. Needless to say, those meds come with a host of other terrible effects, like addiction and all that addiction entails. I begin to lose myself and I lost all normal aspects of my daily life in the struggle. After desperately searching online for help, I found an article about kratom. I took a chance and tried it. It was a revelation, a miracle that pulled me from the brink. I was able to finally stop all antidepressants and narcotic meds simply by taking a few capsules of this plant. It literally changed my life. I was able to excell, able to function in society. I can focus. I can think. My anxiety ceased and my full potiential bloomed. I have literally risen to the top of my company (well, not the very top, but almost; I'm second-in-command). I'm aware that kratoms legality has bitter implications for narcotic drug makers, but I pray to God, for the sake our society, that this naturally-appointed BALANCE born into the world isn't criminalized.

It can't be moral or ethical to incarcerate people for medical issues.  As a nation we need to move away from criminalizing simple treatments for health problems.  Treating pain management with police and prosecutors and jails is a tragic waste of public resources.  Criminalizing use of herbs like kratom is also destructive of our families and communities.  Please allow the American people to continue the use of this simple home remedy.  Many of us cannot afford treatments offered by the medical industry even with insurance.  I know I can't.  Medical care in Alaska is even more unaffordable than the rest of the nation.  Treatment for migraines by the medical industry is frequently ineffective.

Kratom has given me back some normalcy because of its effectiveness, mild nature and lack of negative side effects.  I've taken it for close to 6 years , on and off.

The effects of Kratom, unlike drugs of abuse in the often-compared opiate class, are mild, and the euphoria of the drug, if experienced at all, is very limited even in first time users.  Additionally consuming excessive amounts leads to nausea and worse feelings; that is, it is a self-limiting substance much like caffeine.  Just like it does not make one feel a cocaine rush to consume 20 cups of coffee in rapid succession, consuming tens of grams of Kratom will not result in an heroin-like high but, on the contrary, nausea and discomfort (not death mind you -- please refer to the scientific literature for overdose characteristics).  As such Kratom needs no additional law enforcement to limit its use in adults because it limits its own consumption, much like coffee.\n\nIn addition to the simple fact people enjoy taking Kratom for the clarity of thought and the peaceful feelings it imparts without physical impairment, it can unfortunately be addictive.  I attest to this reality, but the level of addiction and subsequent withdrawals if one stops taking it, are relatively minor for the vast majority of users as compared to hard drugs. There are other ways Kratom can actually even help society.\n\nOpiates, for example, do endanger the lives of people who become addicted to them, and that is sad.  However, even here Kratom has a use: it provides a way for people so entrapped by the cycle of opiate abuse to get off those drugs or greatly reduce their use and, thus, reduce the harm even death they can pose to the abuser.  Kratom does this by helping curb the strong and horrifically painful withdrawals that opiate abusers feel when they are getting off their dope without having to shame or suffering the stigma of getting outside help.  It empowers people to fix themselves while not spending tax dollars or wasting the limited time of our policemen and women doing other jobs, the judicial system's available time, and jail's limited space.\n\nAdditionally Kratom can help people, such as the elderly and our vets who bravely served our country so we may enjoy its freedoms, who deal with pain daily by providing a way out of opiate use, thereby reducing the strain our healthcare system must endure for more risky treatments such as opiate prescription, treatments that render the user less mentally acute to enjoy life and work.  \n\nSo my experience has shown me the simple truth that Kratom has a medicinal use and overall strongly benefits society, not harms it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8160","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Roger Hofer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":8,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is in response to the DEA's intention to make Kratom a Schedule I substance. It includes a great amount of information on what Kratom is and the what will happen if the DEA goes through with the emergency scheduling. Dear DEA, Please remove Mitragynine & 7-hydroxymitragynine which is in Kratom from becoming a Schedule I substance. I am 29 and suffer from a herniated disc, chronic neck pain, TMJ, arthritis in my neck. I support a family of four on a single income. I have been to many doctors with little success for treatment. I have found that Kratom improves my quality of life by being able to work. If I didn't have this herb I would be on disability from pain. It isn't comparable to any drugs, marijuana, alcohol or other stimulants. Kratom helps to improve my quality of life that I suffer with chronic pain. Please don't make this herb illegal. Cervical injections, botox injections, chiropractic care, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, yoga exercises have not helped with my pain. Kratom is a well-known, well-researched herbal substance drawn from the leaves of trees within the coffee family. The number of cases of documented harm from kratom use is remarkably low, both as an absolute matter and when considered against the extensive history of use of kratom, both inside and outside the United States Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are two of the primary alkaloids of this plant. These two compounds are not synthetic and should not be lumped together with \"bath salts\" or \"spice\". Kratom has been used as a medicine by many people for thousands of years. It is a potent remedy for physical pain, anxiety and depression, and could be used to aid with opiate withdrawal by those who would like to quit using illicit drugs such as heroin. Kratom is NOT a hallucinogen and should not be classified as such. Adding mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as a Schedule I substance is rash and unjustified prohibition, resulting in a foreseeable increase in street drug-related crime, as well as a punishment to those who are currently using it responsibly to treat various ailments. The reason that there are no deaths solely attributed to Kratom is because Kratom does not affect your respiratory capacity. It does not slow down your central nervous system. It's potential to do harm is virtually impossible. Kratom has very limited recreational capacity. The White House petition has over 100,000 signatures for the \"Please do not make Kratom a Schedule I Substance.\" The federal government has invested significant resources to develop alternative pain management strategies. This includes a study funded by the National Institutes of Health in partnership with the University of Massachusetts and the University of Mississippi to investigate the use of Kratom as a remedy for opioid withdrawal. This study led the researchers to apply for a patent identifying the Kratom extract, mitragyinine, as a useful treatment for other addictive drugs besides opiate derivatives. The DEA's decision to place Kratom as a Schedule I substance will put a halt on federally funded research and innovation surrounding the treatment of individuals suffering from opioid and other addictionsa significant public health threat. Remember the DDear Colleague Letters of Senator Hatch and Congressman Mark Pocan. We hope you realize the threat this scheduling causes the people seeking legitimate use of this special plant to improve our quality of life.

I went to my local head shop in town and asked several questions regarding kratom and it's affects. I was so relieved to know there was an alternative substance in relieveing my pain. Doctors don't like me using this but for me it's so much healthier I feel than opiates. Besides, with all the regulations now on opiates my dr's stopped prescribing them to me. I did have to take kratom for a 3 month period straight every day for my pain in my lower back and when my pain got better I did not have any withdrawal symptoms at all, NONE......

I am a childcare provider, respite aid for special needs families, mother to 2 girls and wife of 15 years. Before I found the naturally occurring tea leaf Kratom, my life had become incredibly painful due to my condition, Syringomyelia along with osteoarthritis and facet joint arthritis in my sacrum. I was alive but not truly living. I had broken down and applied for social security disability. My days alternated between getting in and out of bed, and I carried so much guilt (to the point of having panic attacks several times a week) for all the things I could no longer do for my family. I began searching for alternate supplements to help with my pain in July 2015. Within a month I discovered kratom and found a proper vendor who had clean, high quality product. Kratom absolutely changed my life. I went from battling to get out of bed everyday and praying I would someday be able to collect some sort of disability, to on my feet in constant motion, back to work and finally FINALLY providing for my family again. I once again became a functioning member of society. In my rise from all the depression that accompanied my chronic pain, I began helping families with autistic or special needs kids. I can honestly say that because of Kratom, I was not only able to go back to functioning in society, I was able to help others who truly were and are in need of help. I became reliable to others again. The thought of losing this NATURAL leaf and how the repercussions of that would rip my newfound freedom out of my hands is DEVASTATING.

About a year prior he had been in a car wreck and hurt his back and arm.  I knew he had been getting treatment and taking pain medication for it.  When we moved in together he was in good health other than his injuries and being in some pain.  Over the course of the two years we lived together, I watched my older brother who is always been healthy, physically fit, active, and happy slowly deteriorate into a shell of himself.  His pain medication had slowly stopped working as his tolerance grew and he started buying pills off the street and then started buying harder opiates the same way.  This went on until I came home from work one day to my brother in nothing but his boxers laying on the floor in withdrawals.  He went to rehab and got sober.\n\nAfter being sober he still had to find a way to manage his pain and he found an herbal supplement that worked wonders in kratom.  Over the last three years, my brother has gotten healthy, gotten happy again, is physically fit again, and even started his own business.  A big reason he has been able to do this despite having chronic pain is because of a safe and inexpensive herbal supplement.  I heard about the DEA wanting to make this supplement a Schedule I narcotic which would turn my brother into a felon for possessing it.  Why would you take something that helps countless number of people get off and stay off opiates and live pain free and make it illegal for them?  I thought we were suppose to be trying to fix the opiate crisis, not make it worse.  If it is made illegal and my brother and others can no longer use it, what happens to them?  Are they suppose to resume taking the things that nearly killed them or may kill them?  Who is responsible for my brother and others should they die from taking the strong opiate drugs that are very dangerous?  Because I assure you that if that happens and my brother dies, I will not stop fighting until someone or a group of people is held accountable for his death and I am sure other families feel the same.  When it comes to the opiate crisis, dont be part of the problem, be part of the solution.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15748","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jenny Witt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Side effects of kratom are minimal and withdrawl is mild, pretty much negligible compared to opioid withdrawl.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17021","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anne Griffin-Lewin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it concerns,\nMy name is Jennifer and I suffer from MS.

It is a harmless plant that has not only done a lot of good for me, but many other people I know. I am a 43 year old health fanatic and am very cautious about what I put in my body. Also, I run my own business and experience a lot of stress and anxiety in my work day. Kratom is something which I have consumed for the past 2 years and it has been a blessing in reducing stress and anxiety without any negative side effects. I have also never experienced any addiction to it. Whenever I stop drinking coffee for more than 3 days I have terrible withdrawals and headaches. I have never had any withdrawal symptoms like this from Kratom. It has been a blessing in my life. I believe alcohol has 1000 times worse effects on my body than Kratom. Since I began taking Kratom, I have not had to increase the amount I consume to get the desired effects and I have really appreciated that. In the past, I used to reduce stress/anxiety by having a glass or 2 of wine a few times a week...but with alcohol I always experienced negative side effects like depression, increased physical pain in my body, hangovers next day, and even slight addiction to want more. When taking kratom, I have never felt any side effects like this. It has truly been one of the most positive things I have consumed. I barely drink alcohol now. Also, Kratom has been a complete blessing in reducing pain in my body. I herniated my L4-L5 vertebrae in my back over 15 years ago, and the pain can be excruciating some times. In the past, I have been prescribed opiates to help with the pain. Whenever I took them, I pretty much stopped immediately due to the negative side effects: such as nausea, extreme tiredness or lethargy, fogginess in my brain and bad constipation. I was also always concerned with their strong addictive effects, so I stopped taking them immediately. I have seen friends and family members get lost in opiate addictions and ruin their lives. When I started consuming Kratom, it reduced my pain significantly, while also lifting my mood. Its effects were just right, not overpowering, and allowed me to function during my work day both mentally and physically. To summate, it seems ridiculous to make this a schedule 1 drug. It has done wonders for me without any negatives added in my life and body. I am so happy to have found something that eases anxiety, pain, mood, and creates a sense of well being....but most importantly, without any side effects.

My name is Robert Feight. I first discovered Mitragyna speciosa (kratom) in two-thousand and four. After being not too particularly enamored with the tree leaf I disregarded it and mostly put it out of mind. But, every few years I'd feel adventurous and order a small amount to take the edge off (of being a hard-working member of society). Then, after developing a sensitivity to caffeine and alcohol I sought out something that I could utilize to increase my work productivity. That's when I rediscovered Mitragyna speciosa. Yes, that's correct: this plant can be an amplifier of productivity OR a pair of warm hands that push and churn those knots in your back/neck away.\n\nFor the past three years I've been fortunate enough to form an appreciation for this herbal gift from nature.\n\nMitragyna speciosa is not the kind of substance that you find in the hands of drug-addled, community-devasting addicts. It's a subtle, chamomile-meets-vitamin-B (not pharmacologicallynot sure if it actually contains vitamin-B) naturally grown tree that helps hundreds of thousands of productive members of society stay prolific (and safe from hard drugs).\n\nTo clarify, Mitragyna speciosa poses zero threat to society. In fact it betters civilization. It has helped me to work two physically and mentally demanding jobs and attend school full-time, all without the reliance of nicotine, coffee or any other form of caffeine. How many individuals can claim such a feat?\n\n\nBest regards,\nRobert Feight\n\n\n(Post Script: My legal name is Robert Cox, but I go by the name Robert Feight [my pen-name].)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17035","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Feight","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jamie, and am the age of 29, and a stay-at-home mother of two young children. \n\nPlease, please, please do not ban this natural plant, Kratom, that has been consumed safely for decades. Kratom is not a drug, but a regulated dietary ingredient. Kratom does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\n I was extremely ill for about four days before I went to the ER. I was in so much pain I was unable to walk. My husband had to carry me to and from where I needed to go. We got to the hospital and they decided to run a CT scan on me. The doctor told me I had a cyst on the tail of my pancreas, but he was not worried about it. He treated me for two infections I had and pumped me full of fluids. Four hours later, I was released. I followed-up with my Primary Physician and she urged me to have an Endoscopic Ultrasound done. This doctor took two biopsies from my pancreas, and it turned out I had Pancreatic Cancer. I met with an Oncologist and he performed two surgeries to remove the cancer and also removed my spleen and the tissue surrounding the Pancreas and Spleen. That was exactly four years ago. My daughter was two years old at the time and I never thought I would see her again. Now, I have a one year old son! The kind of Pancreatic Cancer I was diagnosed with was curable! It was a miracle! After all that, I still have a tremendous amount of back pain. The doctors say that might not ever go away. I was on Tramadol and Oxycodone for a year after that and didn't like the side effects I had. I constantly had migraines, the pills made me ill, and was always lethargic. I was always laying in bed. I started to get depressed because my daughter needs her mother and I knew something had to change. My husband heard about Kratom, and did some research on it and bought some. I have been consuming Kratom for three years now. I feel healthy and have so much more energy! A feeling of well-being! Yes, this plant aids in my back pain, but the pain is still there, just faint. I do not feel I need to take Kratom every day. It is not addicting to me. My children have their mother back!

Your efforts to curtail illegal drug trafficking actively improve our safety at home and the quality of our current and future society.

I am a college educated and full time employee of the US Government.  I am also a veteran of the US Army having served honorably for 7 years.  I barely drink and am physically fit.  I was injured in the Army and had my right knee reconstructed and also had back problems stemming from a training injury.  I've served in dangerous areas on three different continents and need to be 100% coherent and fully present in my day to day duties.  The US Army had a habit of feeding us soldiers pain and anxiety medication in a manner which led to forms of dependency which I found unacceptable.  One day I turned down the medication and decided from then on I would research alternative forms of medicine and physical therapy (acupuncture, suction cupping).  That history and journey is what led me to Kratom, an herbal remedy that provided some joint pain relief and anxiety relief.  \n   The point of my letter is to highlight that I am not a criminal, not a degenerate and feel that Kratom has legitimate uses as an alternative medicine and humbly request that my voice add to the others requesting you do not ban or place restrictive policies on how we can legally obtain this remedy for pain and anxiety.

I make the tea by brewing the dried and powdered leaves from the kratom tree.  I have never experienced any serious adverse side effects, nor have I ever been concerned about any potential \"overdose\"/death.  The worst effect (which I only experienced twice, it's unpleasant and I do not wish to repeat it) was vomiting after drinking too much of the tea.  I have read the DEA's claims of 15 deaths in recent years from kratom.  I do not believe that these deaths are attributed to kratom alone.  I believe it is impossible to overdose/die from kratom.  It does not repress breathing, as true opiates do.  Our stomachs will expel kratom if we consume too much. \n\nPlease see the attached document for my full comment.

I have taken kratom for over 4 years now and never had a single issue.. I still remember the first time i tried kratom-- i was scared because i knew i was about to face major withdraws from heroin and contemplated suicide and the only resource i had at my expense was the internet at the time.. i researched, found and bought kratom- when i took it i thought all of my hope was gone--  45 minutes i doubted it was real and decided get my gun ready because i lost all hope in everything.. Then out of nowhere i started feeling the effects of the leaf- i was so happy i cried for a solid 20 minutes.. After that day i've never thought to touch anything else. I do not even drink. Kratom  is why i am here and if you ban this i will most likely die.. i envision myself taking kratom for the rest of my life periodically (every time i get a craving). IF ANYTHING opoids need to be banned. Kratom is nothing like morphine and never will be- if it gets banned my future dramatically dims- a flicker of light overlooked until it fades into the darkness.

My daughter has fibromyalgia. Prior to her finding Kratom for her pain and fatigue, she was on several medications in an effort to keep her pain under control. On a bad day, she would have to take so much opioid pain medication that she could hardly function. If she didn't take it, she spent much of her time in bed anyway because her pain was unbearable. She works in the summer in her city's swim program running their special needs program. Without Kratom, she would drive herself to work, take half a pain pill, struggle through the pain as she taught these children, drive home, take a whole pain pill, and often a second and text her husband to let him know she wasn't able to cook that night. I never called her because I didn't know if I'd be waking her, knowing that she probably hadn't slept well or was having to nap because of the fatigue of fibromyalgia or that caused by her medications. She seemed suicidal on more than one occasion. \n\nThe difference Kratom has made in her life has been phenomenal! She is back to her old, talkative, happy self. She has been able to go off the medications with the worst side effects, including opioids. Kratom has given her pain relief well beyond what she was getting before. And it has done it without dulling her other senses. She is able to function again and is looking forward to expanding her city's special needs programs to other sports as well as swimming, which would expand the seasons she is able to work. She could not have even considered this before. She gets her Kratom from a reputable supplier, who does not cut other harmful or addictive substances into it. She does not feel that she is addicted to Kratom. She would be able to go off of it if she had to but doesn't want to because of the pain relief vastly improved over what she was taking before. She was terrified earlier this year at the prospect of not being able to get it legally. Her husband is a police officer so not only did she not want to break any laws but didn't want to put his career in jeopardy. I was terrified that I was going to lose my daughter again as she was forced to go back to the drugs that affected her so terribly.\n\nInitial studies on Kratom have shown that it affects the same pain receptors as opioids with very little affect on the areas that register a \"high.\" My daughter has said that if feeling like getting out of bed every morning is a \"high\" that's one high that she's happy to have. I have a niece and nephews who have gone through drug addiction and a couple who still struggle with it. I know what that looks like. That is not what I see when I look at my daughter. Not any more. Kratom has made a huge positive impact in her life, giving her a quality of life that was not possible with current prescription medications. \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5403","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kristina Mortensen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 46, in accounting.

I am just an average 38 year old citizen.  I have not done anything super noteworthy, positive or negative. I live pretty much a straight and narrow path. Sure, I have had my fair share of fun times in my teens and 20s. I am a college graduate (The Evergreen State College, 2000), a business owner of 12 years, a wife and mother of an amazing 10 year old girl. I garden, ferment foods, and volunteer at my kids school. I live a natural a life as possible, eat my organic vegetables and buy that small farm coffee.\nA couple of years ago I got an itch, I was bored and getting depressed. I needed something in my life. I found roller derby. It was simply amazing. I was using my body in ways in never knew possible. Pushing myself beyond any perceived limitations. I made friends for the first time in a very long time. As you might imagine, broken bones are a thing in derby. In June of last year I broke my leg. No surgery necessary. During my rehab I fell into a very dark hole. Maybe it was the opiates prescribed to me, maybe it was that I was cut off from my friends and the one thing I loved so much, maybe the lack of not being able to do a thing for myself, maybe it was not working, or being able to take care of my family. I got help rather quickly and picked myself up, with the help of a great therapist, and went back to derby. On February 2 I decided to scrimmage for my first time. I was on the sidelines stretching and someone just didnt see me, tripped, landed on my back&.and broke it in 3 places. I couldnt believe it. The hole I had just climbed out of just sucked me in again. Again, I was lucky to not need surgery, just lots of bed rest.\nI had joined a few mental health groups on facebook, and while venting someone reached out and told me about Kratom. She told me how it could help the depression and anxiety, as well as possibly my pain. I did my research. I was in shock. How could I not know about this wonder plant? The amount of natural healing books at my house is ridiculous. After all my research, I thought I had nothing to loose so I ordered some from an online botanical company. It REALLY did work. The first time, it worked. It didnt make me instantly happy, but it did ease my back pain, with no mind altering effects. As I continued use, it helped my mood and disposition, it made it easier to move, making it possible for me to work some while injured. I did not need any of the opiates prescribed to me once I had the Kratom. \nI continued using Kratom as a supplement to my healing for about four months on a daily basis. I am stronger now and no longer need daily pain management. I still use Kratom, but only as needed, maybe 4 times a week. I supplement with Kratom when any other adult would supplement with ibuprofen. I take absolutely NO other pain medication, prescribed or otherwise. Dare I say, not so bad after a broken leg and broken back in less than a year!\nI am writing this today, not for myself, but for all the people I have watched this plant help. I have joined an amazing community of people whose lives have been changed by this green leaf. My injuries are minor, they will heal, and honestly, my own dang fault. Others are not so lucky. I have seen, first hand, Kratom help friends with chronic pain, fibromyalgia, cancer, PTSD, depression and anxiety. Its not a cure, but it certainly helps. Many people will have only one other choice if this ban goes into effect, opiates. I know many people that have already made their pain clinic appointments in preparation. One more mother, father, caregiver, sister, brother& on opiates. Kratom is non sedative, people can FUNCTION while supplementing with Kratom. \n This ban will effect literally millions, locally, nationally and GLOBALLY. Indonesian Kratom farms are literally hundreds of years old. These farmers will be out of jobs practically overnight. So many of us will return to living in daily pain. Some of us will turn to opiates. The DEA has over stepped their bounds with this ban. It is a natural non-intoxicating plant.\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18110","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Heather Carroll fry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I ask that no one ban Kratom because it is not a drug in any way.

As you can tell from my address, I live in a state that has one of the worst records for addiction in the United States (West Virginia.)  I personally know 6 people, personally and tangentially, that have died as a result of pill addiction. But, I'm not writing you to talk about them; it's too late for that. I am writing you to talk about the people I've met that are alive and thriving thanks to kratom.\n\nI've studied and worked with kratom for over 5 years now. I've watched it grow online from virtually nothing. I was worried as it continued to help people in my state because I knew the government would be scared, confused, and not understand it, so they'd do what the government tends to do in these situations: ban it. \n\nI worried about it quite a lot. Why? Because of the people I've met that had their lives literally turned around due to finding this leaf. I've met a young heroin addict who started taking kratom to ease their pain until they no longer took heroin or kratom. I've met a woman in her mid-40s who had knee surgery. She told the doctor \"No opioids\" and he told her about kratom.\n\nI've benefited. With scoliosis, a little bit of kratom helps me mow several people's yards.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the uncertainty the DEA's caused over the last couple months, out of the over 100 people I've met in my state, about 5 who suffer from chronic pain have went back to opioids. Many of the rest I've met who suffer from chronic pain were almost or were crying because \"I don't want to go back to the way things used to be.\"\n\nThis is not a complicated fix.If you want to improve anything, just affect the branding. But, please, don't affect it's market place and ability to get to people. It's doing too much good. While the government was fiddling while our state was burning, kratom has been helping. People have hope again; don't take that away from them. I beg you for that little bit of mercy. And that's what it'd be, mercy.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18506","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Ornduff","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used Kratom for chronic back pain when other methods fail.

Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21825","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 21 year old female with severe diagnosed PTSD. I suffer from anxiety, depression, ADHD, insomnia, and general lack of motivation as a result. I suffered through a highly traumatic childhood, which involved rape, homelessness, starvation, and abandonment. I lived in over 12 foster homes, and wasn't adopted until I was 10 years old.\nWhen I was born, I tested cocaine-positive. My birth mother recently died of liver cancer as the result of alcoholism, and my doctor believes I am pre-disposed, so I cannot drink. Addiction runs deep in my family, so I cannot in good faith use prescription drugs to treat my symptoms.\n\nRecently, my doctor said I may want to consider getting disability benefits because I find it so difficult to find motivation and stay focused. I don't believe I should be held back from achieving my dreams because of my PTSD, so I've been treating with medical cannabis as often as I can. Unfortunately, it's expensive and without the perfect strain, I find myself focusing on the wrong activities throughout the day, not getting my work finished.\n\nCurrently, I work from home as a professional copywriter and budding entrepreneur. Since I found kratom, I've tripled my work output and have picked up several high-profile clients. Before kratom, getting out of bed was a chore, and falling asleep without cannabis was nearly impossible - to the point where I would stay up for 48 hours straight without trying. And when I could sleep, the nightmares continually kept me up.\n\nKratom has done nothing less than give me my life back. My relationship with my fiance is healthier, I'm keeping my home cleaner, my work is getting finished more quickly and is of higher quality, and my nightmares are now few and far between. Kratom also treats my back pain (nothing extreme, but I see a chiro every so often to have it re-aligned), so I can sit at my desk for longer without needing to take a break.\n\nKratom is a beautiful herb, and is proof to me that Mother Nature takes care of us if we choose her medicine over man made substances.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0219","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amber Crosser","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nMy name is Ryan and I live in Buffalo, NY.

This will make millions of law-abiding Americans into criminals for nothing more than eating a leaf to feel better.  Kratom is safer than alcohol, coffee and cigarettes and has zero recorded deaths related to its use.\n\nKratom does not make you high.  Kratom provides mild stimulation, and a calming, anti-anxiety effect.  Its effects are as strong as a cup of coffee or a green tea, but different.\n\nNo other supplement or drug has worked to help me with my anxiety without making me feel different.  Kratom is the only thing I can take for my panic attacks that won't make me feel high, robotic, or lethargic.\n\nPlease do not ban kratom.  It should be regulated like any other dietary supplement and available to purchase without a prescription.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21611","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Anon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Haven't used it but it needs more research before we ban, heard many good things from personal friends and family.

I once had a career in law enforcement and afterwards a career in child education. I worked with children in intervention classes that didn't know how to mentally be in a class of their own age. Many of these children grew up in a home environment with parents that used drugs and weren't giving their children a safe and loving and kindness that they should have. At a young age by now I believe they still don't know how to exist in society. Those are the statistics in which children were raised in an environment of drug use, always seeing parents taking pills that led their child to do the same. They were never taught to have resources of a more natural way of relieving stress, anxiety ect. Let's face it a child only knows what they're taught and this has led to the epidemic war on drugs. This is the number one reason for asking the DEA not to make kratom a schedule 1. My second reason, many people like myself chose kratom as a more natural, no side effects, we were with taking pharmaceutical's. When I heard of kratom, I fully researched to make sure of the safety and found no evidence of death with kratom alone. Only reading positive effects of kratom. I chose trying a more natural remedy to help myself with many symptoms of having Trigeminal Neuralgia known as the worst kind of pain known to mankind. Kratom has given me a relief of many of the symptoms associated with this brain disorder. I have less painful and emotional days. My mindset of everyday life has seemed to lesson. I didn't have any mind altering effects with kratom. That alone eases my mind and I have a better quality of life. I no longer have locked myself in my room. I'm able to socialize with family, at least a few hours rather than none. Kratom has never been a bad experience for me. After many times without kratom, I never felt any withdrawal, only the feeling of not having a sense of well being. I've chosen to not enter pain clinics as many neurologist have suggested. Too many people become an addict and those children I referred to pay the price.  I'd like to thank the DEA for allowing me and others to have a public comment. It doesn't go unnoticed that you've given us a chance, rather than making a rational decision. \n\nSincerely,\nElizabeth Hamlin ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7442","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Elizabeth Hamlin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it. \nKratom should be legally regulated, allowing for quality control measures and product labeling requirements.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2634","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cliff Wilkinson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This tea has helped me with my bleeding ulcer's and with chronic IBS in a way that no prescription drug has ever been able to accomplish.

I also have IBS w/diarrhea.\nAfter beginning Kratom, I noticed how greatly my fibromyalgia, back pain/spasms and knee pain symptoms were diminished. I was also very surprised at how much my anxiety had lessened. Over time, my depression was gone too! I had a new found energy that wasn't a nervous energy nor did I crash from it. I no longer wanted to sleep my day away. At night, I felt more relaxed and didn't have a problem with my mind racing all night with worry. I was feeling better, and my pain was decreased so much. I also noticed that my blood sugar was easier to control and I wasn't needing as much insulin. I am now able to clean my house, keep up with my active husband and daughter and our two dogs. I am leading my daughter's Girl Scout troop and playing a positive role in the lives of so many girls. All thanks to Kratom. I don't have to take Kratom every day. If I don't take it, I don't have withdrawals like I did with Hydrocodone and Percocet. I am happy! My anxiety and depression packed their bags and left! I hated the way opiates made me feel, and with Kratom, there aren't any of those awful side effects. I feel like since choosing to take this great herbal supplement, Kratom, I have my life back!

Soon after I discovered kratom and this plant has done amazing things for me since finding it. I'm in school with a 3.7 GPA, and I also work. Before discovering this plant I couldn't even get out of bed to clean my house, much less work and go to school. I thought my life was taken from me after my car accident. Sure, I survived, but I wasn't living a quality life by spending days on end in bed.  Kratom gave my my life back, it gave me my drive for life back.

I have been married for 7 years and am currently employed has a manager at an Italian restaurant in La Jolla, California. I began using kratom in July of 2015 after a coworker suggested that it might help with the pain I was experiencing prior to a root canal operation. He gave me a small amount and showed me an online supplier where I could purchase more. After doing some research online, I decided to begin taking about 3 grams in the morning before work. Though my tooth pain became less distracting, I began to notice other effects that were positive. For most of my adult life I have suffered from severe depression, and struggled with alcoholism. Over the years I have been treated with prescription anti-depressants and  attended counseling as well as alcoholics anonymous meetings. During the time I began taking kratom for tooth pain, I would regularly drink a 750 lm bottle of hard alcohol every day. Even though I wanted to cut back, I lacked the motivation to break the habit. Once I began taking kratom my craving for alcohol diminished considerably, and I found myself drinking much less than before. In the past I would buy alcohol every night after work. Even if I had some at home, the thought of not having enough to drink would cause me to buy more when I knew I shouldn't. It was affecting my marriage and every other part of my life as well. If I was not at work, I had to be drinking. When I started taking kratom I noticed that my compulsive drinking habit was changing and that I was drinking less each night.  Prior to taking kratom I would drink compulsively until there was none left and I would pass out around 3 or 4 in the morning. Once I began taking kratom I found that I drank much slower, more time would pass before I made another drink, and I wouldn't feel the urge to force myself to drink more than I should. I hadnt planned to use kratom to change my alcoholism, but it seemed to be doing just that. I began brushing and actually flossing my teeth before bed, when in the past I would just pass out often times with my clothes still on. It has been over a year since I began taking kratom, and the effect on my alcoholism is still positive. I have tried prescription medications for depression such as paxil, prozac, mirtazapine and wellbutrin, and found the benefits not to justify the side effects. I feel as though kratom has been far more effective in breaking the cycle of depression and obsessive behavior. I am healthier and happier than before, and it's difficult for me to identify any negative side effects. I feel as though listing kratom as a schedule 1 substance without medical value would be a mistake. It has helped me and I feel that with proper regulation the potential dangers could be minimized. Possibly one of the most dangerous things about kratom is how it is sold and labeled. I purchase kratom online and it comes in a big bag and looks a little like tea. The alkaloid content is not listed and there is really no way of knowing how strong it is, so dosing is done by trial and error. Perhaps if there was a regulation calling for the standardization and labeling of the alkaloid content, it would be safer for users and reduce the risk of mistakenly taking too much. I have learned from experience that taking too much kratom leads to nausea and dizziness. Unlike alcohol, one doesn't take more and more kratom to get \"higher\". The few times I have taken too much, I was sick to my stomach and very dizzy. However, I would not describe it as intoxicating or \"mind altering\" the way one would describe the effects of alcohol or other drugs that can severely alter one's judgement and character. I would describe the feeling from a reasonable kratom dose (3-5 grams) as an increase in energy and motivation, and a decrease in anxiety. I would compare these effects to a strong cup of coffee, but without the anxiety and edginess. It doesnt seem to affect motor skills, however in larger doses in can make one dizzy and drowsy. I would compare the drowsy effect from large doses to cough medicines and antihistamines such as benadryl. I am aware that kratom has been sold in a concentrated extract form. These may be more dangerous than the plain dried leaves that I use because it is easier to unintentionally take a much higher dose. I am not a doctor or a pharmacist, and it isnt my intent in writing this letter to give medical advice, It is to share the positive effect I believe kratom has had on me. I imagine it can be abused, however as someone who has abused substances, I dont feel as though the potential is very high; certainly not high enough to warrant a schedule 1 listing or for someone like myself to be seen as a criminal for using it. I believe with  proper research and regulation, kratom can effectively help many people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18155","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bretton Maybee","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Asking you please not to ban Kratom.

Two of our  family members drink Kratom tea daily; our daughter who is 27 years and our son 21. \n\nOur daughter is a full-time nursing student, wife and mother of two amazing boys of 3 and 6 years. Our daughter found Kratom through her doctor. Three years ago she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She has endured rounds of radiation and 2 surgeries to remove the disease. To add to her struggles, while recovery from her second surgery her right ovary ruptured due to a cyst. \n\nBefore finding Kratom  she was not  successful with keeping much food down or managing pain with traditional medications. Her doctor suggested that she try Kratom and after drinking the tea, she was been able to eat and keep most of her food down.  Her anxiety has been reduced and she has been able to continue her rigorous schedule. Since she has been drinking Kratom tea she does not need to take medications for pain or nausea. \n\nIn May of this year, due to the success that our daughter has had with Kratom, our son tried kratom to help with his chronic Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Our son has suffered with IBS since he was 9 years old. He has undergone many colonoscopies and tests to try to pinpoint what is his actual diagnoses . He has tried numerous medications and nothing has worked.\n\nOur son is a Pre-Dental student and is under a lot of pressure with college. His chronic IBS makes his studies all the much harder. In one of his more stressful periods his weight dropped 20 pounds.\n\nImmediately after starting drinking Kratom tea our son was amazed that he had found something that provided such relief to the complications related to his IBS. Further it was pleasing that the solution come from a natural plant and was as simple as drinking tea. He is now able to maintain his weight and he can work, study and have a healthy lifestyle alongside his friends and classmates. \n\nKratom has changed our family's lives.

It is a helpful herb with many beneficial properties that is safer by far then many other over-the-counter products and needs to be left to people's choice of use.  When used properly I have found something that actually helps the symptoms of my Pelvic Floor Disorder and Panic Disorder that is non-addictive.  I've also had several friends who were able to use kratom to kick opiods and are no more addicted to it now then they are tylenol.  \n\nAnything used to excess can cause problems.  There will always be people who over-do things or are allergic to them but the numbers of people who have been killed by kratom is so low this is obviously a non-issue related to more common things.

I was required to undergo coursework in psychopharmacology and have academically and personally investigated the positive and negative effects of the kratom plant. To say kratom use has no negative effects would be a lie, as such is also true for the use of alcohol, cannabis, or coffee; however, overall the positive effects of kratom use outweigh these potential negatives.\n\nThe responsible use of kratom assists in mild pain relief, motivation, energy, and mood elevation. The abuse of kratom leads to constipation, nausea, lethargy, and mild withdrawal effects (headache, bad mood, etc. for a short duration). Though such abuse can cause problems, it is not a serious threat to our society any more than people abuse caffeine pills; furthermore, the abuse of tobacco products or alcohol cause significantly more detrimental effects to our communities both health-wise and financially as a society. Kratom should not be made illegal, especially not in something as severe as schedule I, as it has both medicinal effects and mild abuse potential. I have used kratom for two years to combat joint pain from years of athletics that took at toll on my body. I also use kratom with my coffee in the morning to stimulate productivity at work. I have on occasion taken too much kratom, and the results were a stomach ache and dizzy sensation that required a short nap to alleviate the symptoms. It reminded me of having too much coffee, when I became jittery and dizzy.\n\nIt is my professional and personal opinion that kratom not be made illegal. In fact, I believe that if the DEA decides to schedule kratom, we as a society will see a worsening of the current opioid epidemic, as the research indicates the use of kratom as an excellent tool in the treatment of opiate addiction. Opiate addicts can use kratom to taper their opiate abuse and eventually get clean, due to the pain relief properties of the kratom plant. Although nowhere near as strong as opoid medications, kratom works on the same receptors in the brain, allowing these individuals to more comfortably and realistically reduce their opioid dosages over time.\n\nIn a day where accessible drugs like Tylenol kill thousands of Americans each year, plants like kratom need not be the priority of this administration. This substance is not a dire threat to our society, and although there are negative effects of abuse, just like with any substance (legal or illegal), the positives outweigh these negatives significantly. The DEA should focus their priorities on heroin and methamphetamine use, as these substances hurt our communities. Mildly mood altering plants with few downsides and minimal to no overdose potential need not be the priority of the DEA. Please keep kratom legal! I can't speak enough to the benefits of this plant, and in two years I haven't experienced any significant downsides outside of a stomach ache if I put too much in when making my tea. It would be a real shame to be a criminal for the responsible use of such a helpful plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2191","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Greer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a wonderful plant with many benefits and has helped me with all sorts of problems I was having like depression anxiety pain ect..

My name is Maia Nelson and I am a 31 year old single mother of two.  I have a full time job working at Macy's warehouse during the graveyard shift where I am on my feet for over 10 hours a day.\n\nI am opposing the DEA putting Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances because I use this plant as a medicine for many of my ailments.  It has taken the place of three prescribed medicines that I used to take.    I have severe allergies and over the counter allergy medicine does not work for my seasonal allergies, Kratom makes my allergies go away without any side effects.  It also has replaced my anxiety medication.   Because Kratom helps me with my heart palpitations when I am in a social environment I no longer have to take Xanax or other barbiturates that make me feel extremely drowsy and mentally foggy.  I also take Kratom because it helps my high blood pressure go down and I no longer need to take my prescribed blood pressure medicine when I have a normal reading of 120/80.  I take Kratom on a daily basis about every 6 hours, I have been doing this for 2 years now and I have no adverse side effects and I can think clearly and competently with no kind of \"high\" feeling.  Kratom also gives me energy throughout my graveyard shift and replaces the cup of coffee that I would normally need.  If I have pain in my feet or back which is often because I am always moving, lifting, reaching and bending down on my job then it also helps with that and I do not have to take an over the counter pain medication.\n\nAs a concluding point, please do not categorize this plant with other drugs that get people \"high\" or in a altered state of mind, it is not that what so ever.  This plant helps me in multiple ways, as an allergy medicine, anxiety and blood pressure medicine and it also helps with my minor pain and energy needs.  I never feel out of it or where I cannot think clearly while taking Kratom, as opposed to barbiturates for anxiety that make me feel groggy and not in control on a mental level.  This is a medicine not only for me but to many many people that prefer a holistic approach for help with everyday ailments.

My boyfriend has had a disk issue in his back for over 10 years. He has been offered opioid pain relieves by many doctors but as someone who is on a tight budget and who has been treated for drug addiction in the past opioids are a risky choice. We had not been together very long before he forgot to re-order kratom and had to go a few days without. He was an entirely different person irritable and couch bound. less than 30 minutes after taking his first dose of kratom I was shocked to watch his personality do a complete 180. All I could say was \"omg you're back!!\" over and over. Since then I have tried kratom for my own chronic aches and pains. I have back, knee and ankle issues all of which interfere with my daily life especially since I work in retail and food service which requires standing for long hours. We are young people who live in pain and who are not able to pay for prescription medication because pharmesudical companies charge crazy prices. My boyfriend would be home bound at 28 years old without some form of medication. For him and thousands of others kratom is a daily necessity. \nAside from my own personal experiences and observations I have done my research. Kratom helps people recover from opioid addiction which is an issues that has been declared an epidemic in this country. It helps people suffering from mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. If I were uninsured I would be paying hundreds of dollars in mood altering medications every month. These disorders prevent people from living normal lives and from earning the money they need to pay for their medication. The only cases when kratom is fatal is when it is used in combination with other drugs such as alcohol and benzodiazepines which regularly kills people regardless of what else is in their system. According to the original report proposing the ban on kratom, statistically more people are killed by refrigerators every year than the number of people who have been found with kratom in their system at the time of their death \"in the past few years\". The government is not only trying to ban it but they are also stating that kratom has no possible benefits and can't even be researched and placing it in the same category as anthrax. \nThe only reasonable conclusion one can come to when wondering why the government might ban a substance which has not been shown to kill but in fact improve quality of life and save lives is that the DEA would be seeing a financial gain. Funny that this is happening right after big pharma has synthesized the chemical compound isn't it? The idea that the government is willing harm its citizens not for their own financial gain but for the financial gain for a private corporation and that by doing so gives that corporation the opportunity to monopolize a life saving substance is disgusting.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22824","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"RE: Docket No. DEA-442W\n\nHello, I would like to express my disagreement that Kratom be placed on Schedule 1.

I am a 30 year old male who has struggled with various substance abuse issues for most of my adult life. These issues have had a very negative impact  on my ability to stay employed and be a functional member of society. That is, until I found kratom about 10 years ago. Previously I had been addicted to a variety of pharmaceutical drugs and alcohol. After trying kratom, I knew I had found a very special supplement. All of my cravings for drugs and alcohol were completely eliminated by taking a tablespoon of kratom a couple of times a week, and all of this without any lethargy or \"high\" and most importantly NO ADDICTION! I also work physically demanding labor jobs and it helps tremendously to be able to come home and take a safe, natural plant supplement to get rid of the pain in my back and at the same time staying completely coherent & aware of what I'm doing. Kratom does not impare my actions or judgement in any way. The main concern with opiods & opiates is the very dangerous respiratory depression they cause (which is why people die from these drugs). MANY studies have proven time and again that, uniquely, kratom does not share those dangerous properties at all making kratom CONSIDERABLY safer. This plant supplement has drastically improved my life. I'm not naive though & I do realize there are some mild dangers with ANY plant or supplement. What I would like to see done about this kratom issue is to see it regulated like a dietary supplement, implementing some form of quality control so that product is safe without any additives. And also I would like to see age restrictions & mandatory warning labels similar to alcohol or other supplements, so that people will be aware to check with their doctor before trying kratom, just as one would when taking any new supplement to make sure there are no negative interactions with any other medication one would be taking.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21130","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Derek Hofford","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please make kratom legal again in Alabama.

I am a hard working, tax paying American citizen. But long before coming across this plant it was a very long and rocky road for myself and the people I love most. When I was 18 years old my mother passed away from cancer and shortly thereafter i discovered how prescription pain medications made me numb to terrifying emotions i was feeling. The addiction to Oxycodone went on for 6 long years, doing anything and everything i could to keep feeding this disgusting life. I lost my job, my family, my friends, and my Life! No one knew me anymore, i didn't even know myself. It wasn't until nearly 5 years ago when i found Kratom that my life finally changed for the better. March 28th will be 5 years free from the grip of prescription painkillers that took me to a place nobody should ever be and I owe it all to this life changing plant. Kratom is very similar to coffee in the sense that it gives me energy and helps with my focus. It's been a very large part of why i have regained control of my life and been free of any pharmaceutical drugs for this long. I now have back my family, my friends, and my life! I'm afraid that banning Kratom will have a negative impact on my life with my sobriety and my overall well being. I have been drinking Kratom in tea form for the last 5 years. The people i share this experience with are also my support group. It brings us together in a social setting and we stand by each other.

Before using kratom powder I managed this pain with over-the-counter pain medicines during the day and alcohol at night.  These affected other areas of my health negatively, such as sleep and weight management.  A friend recommended kratom to me several years ago.  His back problems are similar to mine but more severe, and he had developed a dependence on opioid painkillers as a result.  With kratom he was able to break this dependence on opioids and is much healthier today.  \n\nMy own use has been limited to a dose of one teaspoon of kratom powder in the morning, and on some days a teaspoon after working hours.  I have followed this pattern for nearly three years without raising my dosage, and have noticed no negative side effects.  In this time there have been several periods when I was traveling and did not bring kratom with me out of concern for its legal status in the state I was visiting.  While my back pain returned, I did not experience any symptoms of withdrawal or distress.\n\nWhen the DEA sought to classify kratom as a schedule one substance with no recognized medical benefit, I was surprised and sought out evidence of the harm it could supposedly do. What I found was that the cases of toxicity or death seemed linked to a number of factors of which kratom was just one, and that there was not a case in which kratom was identified definitively as the sole cause of someone's death.  On this basis, banning kratom and hindering research by classifying it as schedule one does not make sense at this time, especially given the thousands of deaths attributable to legal substances such as alcohol and opioids every year.\n\nI urge the DEA to keep kratom legal for adults to buy and consume in the United States.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13311","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Barlow","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi,\n\n   I was listening to the Joe Roagen podcast and have been informed of the helpful uses of Kratom.

I've  suffered from extreme anxiety for the better part of a decade and  before I discovered kratom I was taking prescription anti-anxiety medication  that was prescribed by my doctor,  I was taking benzodiazepine pills.  This type medication has a lot of  negative side effects and it's very dangerous and addicting. I was very grateful when I discovered Kratom,  A very safe and non addicting natural plant that that relieved my anxiety so well.  I've been taking Kratom for about four years now,  i've never had any negative side effects from it.  If this plant becomes illegal so many people who rely on it  we're going to have to turn too dangerous and addicting medications to treat whatever they use it for.  Since drug addiction is running rampant in our country right now, especially opiate addiction,  I see this causing far more problems, I see more people participating in illegal behavior more people overdosing, more addicts being made and more people dying.  If alcohol is legal and can be purchased in all 50 states,  a substance that kills so many thousands of people a year from overdose, withdrawal and long-term symptoms from alcohol addiction,  then how can this safe plant become illegal??  I've read so many studies about Kratom,  how safe it is, how well  it treats pain, anxiety, addiction.  I don't see how in anyway it will be beneficial to take this away from people and  have them once again rely on dangerous medications like opiate painkillers,  benzodiazepines  even in some cases people will turn to street drugs like heroin.\nThank you so much  for taking time to read my experiences and opinions.

For the last several months I have suffered from restless leg syndrome, which has led to insomnia. Nothing over the counter has helped and I did not want to get on prescription medications, so I started searching online for home remedies. This is when I first heard of Kratom. I researched this plant for a few months before making my first purchase three months ago. Everything I read was positive. Kratom is not addicting, at least no more so than caffeine. No deaths can be directly attributed to Kratom, unlike many other legal substances such as tobacco, alcohol, and even Tylenol. Kratom is safe to consume, and has a very low potential for abuse as I, personally, have never experienced any \"high\" from it. I drink it as a tea two or three times a week, whenever my restless legs start bothering me. Kratom alleviates my symptoms within minutes. Kratom can also help people trying to come off of opiates, with the heroin epidemic in this country, it should be encouraged and not restricted. In conclusion,I truly believe Kratom should be readily available as it is very safe, I believe, will save many lives in the future.

First of all, I am 47 years old petite woman, with cardiomyopathy, heart murmur, ulcer, and PTSD. I think I got more diseases that I don't even know exist on my body. I never use any drugs that illegal even marijuana. When I got out of military life everything went to haywire. I felt like I don't want to live anymore because all this pain and depression I guess. I don't want to go to the doctor because I know all they are going to do is give me a prescription that will give me more problem in the future. I am drinking prescription medication like Coreg, potasium, lasix, you name it they will give all medication to make their money but I ending up thinking to end my life because I don't want to live this way. Suddenly, someone told me about this herbal name Kratom and gave me a sample to make a tea and I did.....and everything went upside up than down. First thing I did is went to the window look around and smile,,,felt amazing, all pain is gone and my breathing went so easy. Yes you heard me right. I can't do anything on all those prescription which I felt like waiting to die. But after so many years stuck on those medicine I saw hope. It's me again when I was young. I start going to the gym again and socializing again BECAUSE I don't feel any pain. I know I got more feel high on all those prescription than Kratom. Kratom is just give you calm feeling and relax with energy. NO PAIN. Imagine what will happen if I didn't discover this herbal tea, I might be dead now. So hopefully guys, please do something right. LET THIS ONE GO!!!!\nDont' worry on overdosing it. I did that because I forgot I drink already so I took it again but I just go to sleep, that is the worst thing. I been taking it now for more 5 years and no side effect and to be honest my doctor take away some of my prescriptions and lower the dosage of the rest because he said I am progressing really well.

I no longer drink or take pills and im finally in my normal weight range. I am healthy as a horse thanks to alternative medicine and the Lord Himself. I turned my life around and Kratom is what started that path. Aside from my assertive stance I graciously ask for you to please  do your part to keep the life saving plant kratom legal.  It is a solution for opiate addiction, pain, depression, anxiety, ptsd, hypertension, auto immune disease, obesity, insomnia, fatigue and more! More is in my upcoming book. The good thing about kratom is unlike most other medications kratom is non hepatic and it does NOT cause respiratory depression. Although it reaches the opioid receptors it is not actually an opiate. It is in the coffee family. Anyone who has died has had a mixture of illicit drugs in their system in addition to kratom. Never kratom alone and even those cases are scarce if you consider our highly populated earth. Im sure more die from fast food.  Many will join me but many will also die due to this ban.

Utilizing this herb has allowed me to be a productive member of society.  I work every day, own a home and vehicles and I am active in our local community.  When I was on five different prescriptions for RLS and pain, I was not able to contribute at all to our family or our community.  I was miserable and had horrendous side effects from the pharmaceutical drugs that required more drugs to counteract the side effects.  After joining  a support group for RLS, it was suggested to try the herb, Kratom.  I was referred to a reputable online store and purchased my powder.  Within 3 months, I was able to end all medications with minimal withdrawal issues.  Just that fact, ending opioids that I had been taking for many years without having major withdrawal is a reason to keep this herb available for public use and further research.\n\nI have found that this herb does not cause any euphoric effects.  It takes away the pain yet leaves one feeling normal.  It has stopped the RLS in a far superior manner than the dopamine agonists and without the side effects.  My blood pressure is back to normal.  I have lost over thirty pounds and hope to lose the last twenty pounds that I had gained while on the prescription drugs.  My overall health has and is excellent.\n\nThis is an herb that has the ability to help many, many people that are trying to get their lives back after having their lives destroyed by pharma and the medical community.

Way too many.  Do not take a supplement away that has the potential to help so many.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2769","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeanette Toombs","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"First off, I would like to start off by saying I am very grateful for you guys at the DEA to be taking the time and resources to collect more information on kratom, thank you.\n\nI heard about kratom from an online forum where people were discussing techniques to cope with and overcome anxiety and I found some comments in the forum where they were talking about something called kratom. I had no knoweldge of what it was and I had never heard about it until than so I went out of my way and did a little research on it. I found  out the basics of it, that it can be helpful to a range of things such as depression, insomnia, fatigue and the big one for me.. anxiety. \n\nI didn't only pay attention to the positive side tho, I also got a good perspective on the possible negative side of kratom like how it can cause withdrawals in some users, but my personal belief on that is that there can be withdraws from many things that we glorify today such as coffee, heck, sometimes I feel depressed and experience \"withdrawals\" from clearly healthy things like missing a run in the morning. So if the user isnt responsible enough yes there can most definetely be consequences but.. more people have died from caffiene consumption than kratom and we all love our coffee!\n\nSo I decided to give kratom a try and I purchased some \"green vein bali kratom\" and it was in a powder form and I started off by first trying 1 teaspoon ( a very small amount of the plant) I had to workout that day and after about 10-15 minutes I started to feel the effects come on. I took it immediately after waking up and as soon as it kicked in the morning brain fog started to fade. I didnt feel a \"high\" I just felt as if I had a cup of coffee without the jitters and more motivation. If I could explain how kratom effects me best, I would give this analogy: Off of kratom my mind, my thoughts, ideas, goals, everything that motivates me is like a pile of dominoes and on kratom all of those dominoes are lined up perfectly, allowing me to have more clarity and a better picture of my goals. I feel incredibly motivated on kratom and it is honestly life changing, I've had depression and anxiety most of my life and using kratom has been a miracle for those things affecting me. \n\nI've only purchased kratom once and I used it for 2 weeks until I ran out taking it 2-3 times a week, I still felt the incredible benefits of kratom that I have mentioned above even for days after it's use. I will continue to occasionally use kratom and will benefit greatly from using it as little as 2 times a week. \n\nAgain I'd like to thank you fine people at the DEA for giving me the opportunity to give my input on kratom! Happy holidays to you all :)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12413","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Austin Thompso","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me stay relaxed and maintain mental clarity.

I am 51 years old. I live in San Antonio, Texas. I work in construction.\nWhen I was 45 I began have health issues I relate to andropaus: insomnia and high blood pressure. I slept and average of 3 hours a night, was always irritable from lack of sleep and my blood pressure was constantly skyrocketing. I went to The Sleep Center of San Antonio and my general practitioner Dr. Jirka for help. \nDr Jirka could do nothing for me. The sleep center gave me a sheet of paper with a list of sleep hygiene regulations: (no coffee after 3PM, exercise, have a good bed, ect) and an option to use a couple of different sleep drugs. One had a time release and kept me down all night. I would wake up in the morning and have a hangover like an alcoholic. \nNeedless to say there was no effective treatment for me. My sleepless nights went on for about 5 years. Once a month I might sleep 8 hours in a single night. I was going crazy and did not like being alive because I always felt so miserable. My eyes were red and sore all the time. I hallucinated. MY ears rang. My fingers trembled. I was old and falling apart.\nI researched and tried many things. Melatonin cocktails. Mixtures of prescriptions with vitamins. Catnip. Aspirin. Nothing worked. My blood pressure was so high from stress caused by sleep that I I thought I would have to drink alcohol or consume sleeping pills all day just to remain calm.\nI found kratom through my own research. The first time I took it I thought it tasted gross and it was another lost cause. No. It worked! I slept and I woke up. What was this miracle herb that was giving me my life back? That was 2 years ago and I am almost in tears thinking how this plant has changed my temperament. \nBanning kratom is a very bad thing to do, people like me would go back to suffering physically and emotionally. The government that is supposed to protect me and my rights would be hurting me and all the good work I did for myself would be wasted. If the FDA regulated it I could never afford it along with the time and money it costs to go see a doctor. I know what strains work for me and how to consume it. I experimented and learned what is good for me. \nAnybody can learn how to take it. You cant take an abusive amount of it because your stomach will just throw it back up. I have never heard of any legitimate case where a new user or regular user had any type of medical emergency due to kratom. These stories we hear of people in the emergency room due to kratom are full-on fabrication. They are similar to a person drinking a bottle of whisky and getting his stomach pumped but then forgetting to tell the doctor he also inhaled a gram of illegal cocaine with the alcohol.  If a person ends up in the hospital due to kratom they were doing something else on the side with it. That something else caused the real problem but its probably illegal and nobody wants to talk about it. \nThank you for reading my letter. Please dont ban kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1222","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Roy Johnson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 45-year-old mother of three who has taught school in Georgia (at both the high school and college levels) for 20+ years.

I am a college graduate and have worked for the DoD for 28 years. Before I became ill, I was the most outgoing, fun-loving, positive, funny, optimistic person who would sing every day and enjoy life like I never wanted it to end.  \nIn April, 1997, I became quite ill with recurring nausea, weakness, headaches, sun-sensitivity and was eventually diagnosed with an auto-immune disease known as Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD). After numerous attempts to contain the illness, the doctors were finally able to control the disease with the medication Hydroxychloroquine, otherwise known as Plaquenil. During that time, I also learned I was at the beginning stages of osteoarthritis. Unfortunately, in January, 2015, I had to stop taking the Plaquenil as my eyes showed signs of Plaquenil Toxicity (a side-effect of Plaquenil) which, if left untreated, can cause blindness.\nApproximately three months later I began to experience severe, unrelenting, shocking pain in my muscles and joints throughout my entire body. The fatigue that accompanied the pain was debilitating. It was something that I have never felt before and I knew something was very wrong. It took months before I received an official diagnosis - Fibromyalgia and Gulf War Syndrome. At the time I knew nothing about the illnesses but found out rather quickly that this was not something I wanted to live with for the rest of my life... \nIt had been over a year and a half since the onset of these illnesses and with numerous types of medications, I had gotten to a somewhat, more manageable state; however, I was still reeling with many symptoms of these awful, debilitating illnesses to include Degenerative Joint Disease and Degenerative Disc Disease, and I was desperate to get my pain-free, old-self back. The illnesses had stolen so much from me. Leisure activities were non-existent. Plans could not be made as I never knew how I was going to feel on any particular day, especially on extreme weather days as the sun/heat made me very ill and the cold was brutally painful on my joints. The pain was so severe at times that tears would begin to fall as I tried to be brave and stay strong.  \nMy mood had become very somber; I was less-optimistic about my future. I had to seek professional mental health counseling for depression and anxiety. I was not accepting this way of life. I was going to find relief somehow, some way... I decided to find some Facebook friends who shared the same fate as me. I did a search and found a FB page for those diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. I was amazed at all of the people who suffered just as I did. From them, I learned how I could better manage my illness (foods, vitamins, etc.) and I learned about Kratom - the all-natural God-given plant that helps thousands and thousands of people who, without it, would greatly suffer on a daily basis. I was quite skeptical at first but the more I learned about it, the more comfortable I became. This miracle plant had literally saved lives! Not only did this plant help those with pain but it also helped with depression and anxiety. There were shared stories of heroin and narcotic addicts who became clean from consuming Kratom and it completely changed their life for the better. I was in awe over all the wonderful testimonies and stories. I decided to give it a try to see if it could help me like it helped so many others. As nervous as I was, living with this horrible pain, I was willing to try anything at that point. My fianc was extremely supportive of Kratom because it was natural herbal remedy and not some man-made chemical concoction. I took  teaspoon of the awful-tasting Kratom with some orange juice and waited to see what would happen, if anything. Right around the 20 minute mark I began to feel the excruciating pain in my lower back, neck, and legs begin to subside. The pain sensation became less and less and I began to cry, I became  emotionally overwhelmed by how well it helped ease my pain. I had finally something that gave me hope in getting my life back.     \nToday, I couldn't imagine my life without Kratom. If a ban would take place I would have to go back to living in pure agony as would thousands of others. A Kratom ban would truly be detrimental to recovering alcoholics, as well as heroin, opioid, and other illicit drug addicts. Please do not make Kratom a Schedule 1 substance. It is beyond my comprehension that our government would even consider trying to make a safe, all-natural herbal botanical (in the coffee family) that helps so many people in so many ways, illegal. With the current opioid epidemic we are losing so many people on a daily basis, it's time to start saving lives, not ending them. Kratom saves lives! Do the right thing and let this plant alone. It's not hurting anyone; it's helping everyone...\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6148","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\nMy name is Angie and i suffer from deppression, anxiety,chronic pain and nuerothapy from several medical conditions.

The site was created to ensure that all comments are being counted and that a independent count\n\nIn addition to your comments, the form asks for some basic information, such as your name, address, email and phone.\n\nPlease note that you can submit the form anonymously by entering the word \"ANONYMOUS\" in each of the fields for name, address, phone and email.\n\n The comment section is where you can share your experiences with kratom and your thoughts on why it's so important to keep this natural plant legal and unrestricted in the United States.\n\n\nWhat Should I Write in the Kratom Comments Section?\n\nWe encourage you to share your personal experiences as a kratom user. Just keep the 5,000 character limit in mind when writing your comments. (You can use the \"preview\" button on the bottom of the form to check the length before sending.)\n\nIf you're unsure of how or where to start, consider these points as you prepare to write your comments to the DEA:\n\n What first attracted you to kratom? Were you seeking a natural pain or anxiety reliever? Were you addicted to prescription painkillers or heroin and seeking something to ease the withdrawal symptoms? Do you suffer from chronic pain, but cannot afford prescription drugs? Paint a picture of what your life was like before kratom and what motivated you to try kratom. I experienced all of these.\n\n What has kratom done for you and your life?  Explore the benefits of having kratom in your life. Has kratom relieved your pain or anxiety? Has kratom allowed you to become a more productive person? Has kratom allowed you to overcome an illness or condition that you were unable to overcome previously? Does kratom make you a happier, more well-adjusted member of society? Explain precisely WHY kratom is important to you! Yes all of these.\n\n What would you lose if kratom was banned tomorrow?  Would you be unable to work due to pain or anxiety? Would your social anxiety prevent you from pursuing college classes? Would you be unable to care for your children effectively without kratom? Would your overall quality of life suffer? Paint a picture of what your life would look like without kratom. What losses you would you suffer if kratom was made illegal? I might seek pain killer opiods.\n\n Have you ever experienced serious problems in terms of a kratom overdose, addiction or side effects? Do you feel kratom is safe? Have you experienced serious side effects? Do you feel you're addicted to kratom? These are primary areas of concern for the DEA, so any thoughts on safety and addictiveness are important to discuss. Cheap Kratom would have a sulfur smell upon burping, but no side effects.\n\n\nWhy is All This Happening? \n\nOn August 31, the DEA announced its plan to make kratom's two main alkaloids a Schedule 1 controlled substance - a category reserved for dangerous drugs with no recognized medicinal usage, including heroin, LSD and methamphetamine. September 30 was the earliest this new classification could go into effect, making kratom illegal to possess or sell.\n\nThe DEA attempted to justify the emergency scheduling measure by calling kratom an \"imminent\" health threat. The DEA cited kratom's connection to 15 deaths (although 14 of those incidents involved other drugs in addition to kratom.)\n\nThe agency also cited the 660 kratom-related calls to poison control centers between 2010 and 2015, although just 428 of those calls involved kratom only. For perspective, over the same six-year timeframe, the CDC has received 23,203 calls concerning caffeine and a total of 66,300 calls concerning essential oils.\n\nThe DEA's plan to list kratom as a Schedule 1 substance drew significant objection from kratom proponents, many of whom use kratom to self-wean off dangerous opiates or to self-manage pain that would otherwise require opiate painkillers.\n\nIn fact, a DEA spokesperson named Melvin Patterson told the media that \"I have been with the DEA for 20 years and have never seen this level of public response.\" A number of lawmakers also spoke out, as did attorneys for The American Kratom Association, amongst others.\n\nSo in a rare move, the DEA has backed off its plans to list kratom as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, but now, your action is more important than ever! This public comment period is extremely important, as the feedback that the authorities receive from members of the public - people like YOU - will help paint a more accurate picture of kratom's real characteristics and benefits.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2111","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"john smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing this to ask that the DEA to please hold off on banning kratom. It has been a lifesaver for me and some of my family members, they are each sending their own comments but as for myself-\nIn 2003 I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and within 6 months time my doctor had me on morphine, Vicodin, tramadol and the fentanyl patch all at the same time. It was a complete disaster. After a year of that I went on suboxone to get off of all that medication and while I have never gone back to taking any of it I did wind up seeing a dr who prescribed subutex for me for over 4 years. I thought that was my miracle drug, no need to to ever increase my dosage, didn't get all looped out while taking it, thought I was fine. I did find myself thinking that I did not want to stay on it forever though and in time that dr lost his license and the decision was made. Anybody that has ever taken that medication for any length of time will tell you how excruciatingly painful it is to get off of and I can tell you, for myself, it was hell. \nFinally, about 3 weeks in and still suffering miserably, I found out about kratom. I researched it and learned about all the facts I'm sure you already have in front of you. It's related to the coffee plant, been used for thousands of years, is not inherently dangerous at all (in fact any deaths people try to use as evidence against it are deaths where other substances were involved.)\nKratom gave me my life back. After years of chronic and debilitating insomnia I was sleeping peacefully. Any pain I felt was managed without having to deal with the horrible side effects of narcotic use was gone and I felt like me again. Happy, motivated, productive...everything positive. Kratom does not make people high, does not cause hallucinations, or psychotic issues, it is simply a natural plant that grows on our planet and you can not overdose on kratom. Should someone ingest too much your body simply rejects it. \nI think we all know, whether or not they want to admit it, that the big pharmaceutical companies are the ones truly behind banning kratom because of all the people that are no longer taking their chemical narcotics. And I have never been someone to believe in conspiracy theories, so I am not just throwing that out there. Banning kratom would be a huge disservice to everyone in this country that has been able to take their lives back. I fully support regulating it, but banning it is completely uncalled for and should never happen.\nThank you for taking the time to read this comment and the thousands of others that you are receiving. I hope that the DEA will take the time to really investigate the realities of this miraculous plant and act accordingly. \nSincerely,\nLeisl Larson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7728","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Leisl Larson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\"My name is Scott Norquest and I believe Kratom should remain legal.\" I am living proof that kratom works and changes lives for the better, not worse. There are absolutely no studies that kratom and kratom alone has hurt or killed anyone. Any one person that ever lost their life or was badly affected by kratom was always using another drug aside from kratom and there is no proof or studies that say Kratom was the reason. I have had kidney stones and pass a kidney stone at.LEAST once every three months and sometimes more frequently for over twenty  six years. And recently in the past four years have started having really bad back pain. I have been taking prescription drugs for these  for the past twenty six years for this and have even become dependent on these and used these drugs illegally because of the addiction that comes under these exact circumstances and it has always been a battle for me. Since I started using Kratom in. Controlled doses I have neither needed or wanted any prescription medications that I've always needed in the past. Kratom has. Hanged my life enormously. The only bad experience I've ever had with Kratom is using a little more.than I should have and felt nauseous and sick to the point that I vomited and was then just find. It forced me to learn to.moderate and control my doses more diligently and ever since I have been pain free and drug free. How could anyone, how could you take this away from people like me that has struggled through life in pain and using pain meds to dictate my life and who I am. I am in control of my life now because of kratom and it can free so many more like me with the right guidance and understanding of this miracle plant. I am begging you to please don't send me back down the road I once traveled, don't set me up for failure. Let's learn about this plant and how it can benefit so.many people and take advantage of it. The doctors and pharmaceutical companies never cared what the bad or long term effects of these prescription drugs as long as they were making money. I am kratom, kratom improved my life and will continue to if you make.the right decision. Let's ban together and use this plant to help everyone that is in pain or addicted to pains meds or heroin or other hard drugs that actually do kill and destroy lives. Kratom has rescued many before they died or ended up in jail. Let's continue this great track record and  improve lives not destroy them. \n\nSincerely, M Scott Norquest","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17569","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Scott Norquest","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The herb in question is safely being used to help those with addiction problems.

I no longer use kratom but took it daily for 2 years as a herbal alternative to Methadone. I have nothing bad to say about Kratom and it helped me get off of the drug methodone, which arguably is worse than the pain medicine I was addicted to causing me to use Methadone in the first place. Kratom is a far cry from any other opiates. There's a natural ceiling that keeps abuse and overdose from happening that real opioids don't have. I could say a lot about its benefits compared to any real opiates but I digress. I mainly benefitted from kratom for its anxiety curbing affects which is the main reason I became addicted to afore mentioned opiates to begin with. I have yet to find a non-addictive alternative to kratom that helps me with my anxiety, despite taking several prescribed drugs to replace kratom. In the very least, more research should be done (and allowed for crying out loud?) because my experience with kratom was only positive and I'm not alone. It could be found that long term effects from daily use are problematic. However this is unlikely because kratom has been used daily by field workers in Asia for hundreds of years with no real documented negative health concerns.. much longer than any prescription drugs currently on the market today. Me and my family doctor who discussed the use of kratom with me at length can attest that the time I used it daily there was no negative effects. We did blood work and other tests because I wanted to be sure I wasn't hurting my body inadvertently and they too showed no negative effects. We were both very dissapojted at the potential ban but I wanted to be prepared for it so I stopped it's use. Now I take anti-anxiety and anti-depression meds prescribed at a much higher cost and with many side affects and am back to the daily struggle of not using addictive opiates without kratom to satisfy the cravings. I've taken many medications and have experienced no negative affects from kratom like I have on those approved substances. Now I'm taking numerous prescriptions to take the place of the one herbal supplement and they don't work as well. I hope the truth wins out and undoubtedly many, many will be helped out if it does, and I can quit struggling with addiction depression and anxiety. On a final note: The poison control calls don't seem like a solid case to build against kratom use. Nearly any supplement or substance intentionally abused will lead to people calling poison control. Kratom is no different, and again, it just causes a nervous and nauseous stomach and possible vomiting if one does over do it, much like caffeine. Also like caffeine this can be a panicky feeling and no doubt can cause one to think something's wrong. Especially children mostly who try to \"get a buzz\" off anything they can get their hands on. If this poison control thing is really the issue than why not simply put an age restriction on it rather than classifying it erroneously? There must be something else to this story because my experience and almost everyone else's is that kratom is harmless and beneficial, and it being some sort of health hazard is comical. Just my 2 cents.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5414","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We must KEEP Kratum","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3408","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Veronique Kovach","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern,\n\nI am writing this letter to share my experiences with chronic tendonitis and the current  treatment recommended by orthopedic doctors and surgeons.\nOnce tendonitis takes hold...whether it be in the form of tennis elbow, rotator cuff issues, neck and back, etc...it can take many months to heal.

I beg on behalf of myself and my family to keep kratom legal. I've been drinking kratom for 2 years now. I struggle with a chronic panic attack disorder having 2 to 3 attack in a day, every day. I've tried over 2 dozen different anti-psychotics, anxiolytic, and anti-depressants some prescribed at outrageous dosages yet I've never had any success at being treated or even relieved from my nightmarish condition. Kratom is the only thing that helps, it's not a cure and sometimes on really bad days it won't help. However the other 90% of the time, it's the only defense I have. It helps me be normal, a feeling that I had long forgotten. There is a ill-conceived notion that kratom gets you high or intoxicated. This couldn't be further from the truth. Kratom, as you know, is from the Rubiaceae family making it akin to coffea from which coffee is derived. Similarly, kratom helps boost cognitive performance which is the polar opposite of intoxicating the drinker. It is NOT an opioid or an opiate. Another poorly conceived notion due to the fact that it contains alkaloids that are selective full agonists of the -opioid receptor. However by this definition, that would indicate that vitex, also known as chasteberry, is also an opioid/opiate because it contains biochemicals that bind to opiate receptors (Journal of Ethnopharmacology ISSN: 0378-8741) yet Vortex can be purchased over the counter at Walgreens.  Remeron, an anti-depressant I currently take to aid my sleep would be, by the DEA's definition, an opioid/opiate as well for it also acts as a -opioid receptor partial agonist (British Journal of Pharmacology ISSN: 1476-5381)\n I see the doctor regularly and constantly take a variety blood panels and urinalyses. I have no physiological abnormalities. I am healthy in every way except my chronic panic disorder. Please, I've only recently gotten my life back, please don't snatch it away from me, there's so much I want to do and if you make kratom a Schedule I substance, it WILL mean the end for me.

I have tried many pain medications from doctors over the years: various NSAIDS, opiates, gabapentin, baclofen, muscle relaxers, and more. None of these medications helped me half as much as kratom has in managing my pain and allowing me to live a semi-normal, happy, and productive life.\n\nBefore I started taking small doses of kratom each day, I was unable to hold down a full time job and was limited to part time work, because I would miss so many days due to severe nerve pain and muscle spasms. As you can imagine, this was incredibly depressing and difficult to deal with. I had no energy, was always in pain, and felt generally miserable. Other medications left me feeling too foggy to be functional, too sleepy, or too impaired to be productive. Kratom allows me to have the energy to get out of bed in the morning, and brings me irreplaceable pain relief that drastically improves my quality of life and ability to contribute to the world as a productive citizen. I've been able to go to work consistently this year, and kratom is the biggest reason for this. I can honestly say that kratom has changed my life and maybe even saved it. I used to contemplate suicide from the pain I was in. These feelings will likely come back if I am unable to use kratom to treat my medical conditions.\n\nIf kratom is criminalized and I am unable to take it, I will lose my most valuable pain management tool and my ability to live a somewhat normal life. Not to mention, I would be treated as a criminal simply for trying to treat my pain and feel better. It is important to mention that kratom powder or leaf has shown to be very safe when used responsibly. There are no deaths on record that can be attributed to solely kratom overdose. The only deaths reported by the media, have shown that other opiates or illicit drugs were responsible for overdoses that the DEA has unfairly attributed to kratom. Meanwhile, according the CDC, \"from 1999 to 2014, more than 165,000 people have died in the U.S. from overdoses related to prescription opioids.\" There are thousands of Americans struggling with opiate addiction in the US, and kratom has been shown to be an safe and effective tool for weaning addicts off of opiates in addition to its various medical uses.\n\nIt is also worth noting that placing this drug on the Schedule 1 Controlled Substances list takes away a huge and valuable opportunity for scientists to engage in further study on kratom's active ingredients, and create promising pharmaceuticals for pain relief in the future. This would be a huge blow to the medical research community in America and the thousands of patients this research could help.\n\nThank you for your time, and I strongly urge you to consider the negative impacts that criminalizing kratom use could have on patients like me suffering from otherwise untreatable pain. I beg you not to take this medication away from me and thousands of others who have found relief and productivity from it.

He is a father, husband and sole bread-winner of the family. This is in response to the DEA's intention to make Kratom a Schedule I substance. It includes a great amount of information on what Kratom is and the what will happen if the DEA goes through with the emergency scheduling.\n\nThanks,\n\nJim\n\nDear DEA,\n \nPlease remove Mitragynine & 7-hydroxymitragynine which is in Kratom from becoming a Schedule I substance.\n \nI am 29 and suffer from a herniated disc, chronic neck pain, TMJ, arthritis in my neck. I support a family of four on a single income as a Help Desk Tech. I have been to many doctors with little success for treatment. I have found that Kratom improves my quality of life after a hard days work. It isnt comparable to any drugs, marijuana, alcohol or other stimulants.  Kratom helps to improve my quality of life that I suffer with chronic pain. Please dont make this herb illegal. Cervical injections, botox injections, chiropractic care, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, yoga exercises have not helped with my pain.\n \nKratom is a well-known, well-researched herbal substance drawn from the leaves of trees within the coffee family. The number of cases of documented harm from kratom use is remarkably low, both as an absolute matter and when considered against the extensive history of use of kratom, both inside and outside the United States\n \nMitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are two of the primary alkaloids of this plant. These two compounds are not synthetic and should not be lumped together with  \"bath salts\" or \"spice\".\n \nKratom has been used as a medicine by many people for thousands of years. It is a potent remedy for physical pain, anxiety and depression, and could be used to aid with opiate withdrawal by those who would like to quit using illicit drugs such as heroin. Kratom is NOT a hallucinogen and should not be classified as such. Adding mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as a Schedule I substance is rash and unjustified prohibition, resulting in a foreseeable increase in street drug-related crime, as well as a punishment to those who are currently using it responsibly to treat various ailments.\n\nThe reason that there are no deaths solely attributed to Kratom is because Kratom does not affect your respiratory capacity. It does not slow down your central nervous system. It's potential to do harm is virtually impossible.\n\nKratom has very limited recreational capacity.  The White House petition has over 100,000 signatures for the \"Please do not make Kratom a Schedule I Substance.\" \n\nThe federal government has invested significant resources to develop alternative pain management strategies. This includes a study funded by the National Institutes of Health in partnership with the University of Massachusetts and the University of Mississippi to investigate the use of Kratom as a remedy for opioid withdrawal. This study led the researchers to apply for a patent identifying the Kratom extract, mitragyinine, as a useful treatment for other addictive drugs besides opiate derivatives. The DEAs decision to place Kratom as a Schedule I substance will put a halt on federally funded research and innovation surrounding the treatment of individuals suffering from opioid and other addictionsa significant public health threat. Remember the DDear Colleague Letters of Senator Hatch and Congressman Mark Pocan.\n \nWe hope you realize the threat this scheduling causes the people seeking legitimate use of this special plant to improve our quality of life.

In June of 2010  I was injured in a MVA. My general practitioner prescribed me opioid pain medication along with a muscle relaxer for the hip pain following the accident. I  went on to physical therapy and eventually was diagnosed with si joint dysfunction. I went on to a surgeon who recommended fusion surgery. After the surgery I developed what my doctor said was radicular symptomatic dystrophy and sent me to a pain management doctor. I was giving high doses of the narcotic pain medicine oxycodone and a long acting morphine along with almost 2 dozen spine blocks and epidural injections. After all that my doctor recommended a nerve stimulator and/or a pain pump. I didn't elect for additional surgery, but was still given high amounts of the narcotic pain meds. I couldn't work, and had to quit my job. I became seriously depressed. Those drugs changed my personality and I no longer cared about anything. Then it came a point in time where the drugs no longer were effective. I literally was in MORE pain while taking the pills then I was without them. I t became very difficult to get relief with my current dose. I struggled with the dependency on the pills often running 3-4 days short every month. I finally decided to stop cold turkey. I was miserable for about 3 weeks, but I was free of the dependency. About 3 months later I found a job and went back to work, but was still in pain, I tried some kratom ( I had previously read about it for pain) and it worked!! That was a year ago and I have used kratom ever since. There were times I would run out while waiting for my order to arrive, and I had Zero withdrawal symptoms. The way kratom works is so different from opioid drugs, kratom doesn't interfere with the reward  part of the brain. It also doesn't give a crash once it wears off. No spike in pain, no strong urge to re-dose. I am a married woman with 3 children, I am 43 years old, and I work as a professional in the college school system. Kratom has given me my life back. I have also returned to college to seek my bachelor's degree in sociology. I hope to work as a drug councillor one day. I would love to help others who find themselves dependant on substances after being injured. Making kratom a schedule 1 will definitely impact my life and my ability to remain a functional member of society. My husband,children, and grandchildren will be negatively impacted as well. No matter what  I willl never take opioid pain relievers again, but my ability to work and take care of my family will be seriously affected, and my ability to support my myself. Pain pills cost me a job, my house, almost cost me my marriage, but most of all almost cost me my life. Kratom is a God send for people like me. I truly believe we haven't seen the worst of the opioid crisis. The effects of the crisis are far reaching. It doesn't take much for a person to be in it's grip. I feel only people who have had the experience can truly understand why Kratom is so important. I implore you to take what all of us kratom users are attesting to, and separate the few unscrupulous people who marketed kratom as a \" legal high\" and find that kratom in and of itself not dangerous. I believe this earth has given us this plant to heal and not harm. People who abuse drugs will find themselves disappointed with kratom because it will not get them high. Kratom is useful for opiate dependency IF the person wants to abstain from opiates. This plant is not a heroin substitute. It is hard to explain why Kratom works so well, there is nothing to compare it to. If you or your loved one were stricken with a chronic pain condition, wouldn't you want to be able to manage your pain and be able to get your life back? That's how crucial kratom is for me. It makes life worth living again. Keep kratom legal!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1280","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Unanimous Na","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hey, I haven't used this, but I listened to the joe rogan podcast and I believe this could be really helpful.

I was in survival mode. By the grace of God, I have overcome it. But there are moments where I think about getting some, and it would be easy. Basically I am saying DON'T ban it but REGULATE it.

My personal healthcare provider has prescribed me Neurontin and Norco for my pain. These drugs only hinder my work. Norco made it impossible to stay awake. I felt drugged up at work. Neurontin help my pain but it affects my brain. I started having trouble thinking and it was hard to problem solve. My HP tried other things but it was no use. I was at the end of my rope. But then I heard about Kratom. I was doubtful that it'll help me but I tried it. First off, I found out different strains help with different things. Some help better for pain while others help with depression and energy. The ones that help with pain work better than ANY narcotic I was prescribed. I've been able to work pain free without anything hindering my mind. Something I needed severely. I beg of you and everyone who's life is livable thanks to Kratom despite having chronic pain: Please keep this plant legal. Regulate it or something but please don't ban it.

I'm now 32 and am very healthy and successful businessman that works hard every day mostly 7 days a week 365..  I use to work in the construction field as a combination welder and found myself constantly on my feet in, awkward positions 70+ hours a week which, in itself led to back problems among other painful atrocities.. one of which landed me on the operating table for 4 hours and 80 thousand dollars shorter.. it was a shoulder replacement surgery which also, kept me outta work for 2 years..\n It was at this time of which my life as I knew it would take a turn for the worst.. I was put on pain pills to relieve pain and help me get through this tryant time when I wasn't even quite sure how to make ends meet or, what was really even happening .. I took the pills as prescribed and had little relief as I have a high tolerance for meds.. I've always been the type to have to take 4 Tylenol to get rid of a headache.. so, to my surprise 1 turned to a couple and, a couple to 6 and still had pain.. this went on for awhile and it began to get serious as, I would run out before it was time for a refill which led me to become sick and could not function without so I'd buy pills from whoever,whenever or, however I could.. if I had 50 dollars in my act, I'd spend 45 on pills because of fear of getting sick and, not being able to work or anything.. this is when I started to realize that, I had a problem.. and,that's when I really started to think,(I'm only 25 years old) what am gonna do spend the rest of my life living according to Wether or not I had pills?? I started researching for herbs and whatnot that would help with pain and, came across Kratom.. I was very skeptical to say the least but figured it was worth a shot so I made an order and have effectively been treating my pain along with my horrible anxiety/ panic attacks  every since daily,twice a day with no side effects whatsoever.. 7 years with no adverse affects with an herb that has little info (especially at the time) online??

I wholeheartedly oppose the DEA's proposed scheduling action because I and millions of others have experienced kratom's value firsthand, and making this valuable plant illegal will damage the health and livelihoods of perhaps millions of Americans.\n\nI started taking kratom during my undergraduate studies five years ago to help relieve the stress of academic life as well as manage depression and anxiety for which I have also been attending therapy throughout my college career.

If you prohibit Kratom more people who struggle with addiction could be criminalized, which is exactly the opposite direction drug policy should be going.\n In the meantime, given the now-widespread moral, political and scientific consensus that drug use and addiction are best treated as health issues rather than as criminal issues, there's no good reason for people who use kratom to be treated as criminals - especially considering how much we already know about prohibition's disproportionate impact on people of color and other marginalized communities.\n In fact, strict regulations are exactly what we need - such as quality control measures, product labeling requirements, as well as marketing, branding and retail display restrictions, which are long proven to reduce substance misuse and youth access.

As a federal agency, you are to protect and uphold what the United States prides itself in having; protecting the rights of citizens. Kratom has no place in the drug schedule list. Kratom helps addicts of both heroin and prescription painkillers quit their habitual use through relieving their withdrawal symptoms. Once they have made the switch to kratom, they are able to quit it easier because the withdrawals from kratom are far less debilitating. It also offers a safer alternative to dangerous drugs that relaxed the mind and body. The overdoses you have mentioned were all caused by a number of drug combinations and interactions. There has not been a single death attached directly to kratom toxicity. Everyone realizes this move is purely to protect the pharmaceutical companies profits. It became abundantly clear after Alabama made kratom illegal just how much it helps addicts, since the year after resulted in a 50% increase in opiate overdose deaths. I plead that you no longer intend to schedule kratom. For the sake of thousands of lives and not in the interest of profitable medications, reconsider.

Kratom is nowhere near as dangerous as heroin, cocaine, and mephedrone. Patients admitted to the emergency room with kratom in their system are there because of whatever else they took, not because of kratom. The effects of kratom in moderate doses are comparable to drinking a cup of coffee. Yet, no one in their right mind would consider banning caffeine after people who drank too much of it, or mixed it with other substances were admitted to a hospital or died.\nMost importantly, kratom could have many medical uses that will never be explored if it is closed to clinical trials. Personally, the way it clears up my seasonal allergies is incomparable to anything I've tried before and it doesn't have any negative side effects. I also use it to manage menstrual pain. Unlike NSAIDs, which is what I would take instead, I never have to worry about whether kratom will upset my stomach, taking away one kind of pain only to cause another. I feel better about taking a natural substance than something created in a laboratory. I don't notice any withdrawal symptoms if I don't use it.\nKratom has been used for hundreds, if not thousands of years in Southeast Asia, yet there is no epidemic there. \nPlease keep in mind that kratom leaf, by itself, in a reasonable amount, does not cause any problems, but rather solves them. Caffeine and alcohol have the same, if not greater, potential for abuse than kratom. Alcohol caused 88,129 deaths from 2006-2010, according to CDC's Ardi application (https://nccd.cdc.gov/DPH_ARDI/default/default.aspx). 15 \"kratom-related\" deaths, not due to kratom alone, from 2014-2016 are incomparable to that number. 660 cases of kratom exposure over 2010-2015, again, most likely in combination with other substances, does not compare to 2,200 DEATHS from alcohol poisoning each year, not just cases (http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/alcohol-poisoning-deaths/). \n\nI wish to thank you for allowing the public to voice our opinions on this matter. Please do not take this plant away from us. There are greater evils out there.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10984","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Leila Somogyi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep kratom legal.

Your consideration is much appreciated.\n\nI am a 39-year-old, responsible, happily married, classical musician, and mother-of-two who has been safely and moderately using kratom for the past two years to treat my lifelong struggles with anxiety and depression. I discovered this wonderful plant following many failed attempts to treat my mood disorders via pharmaceuticals prescribed by my psychiatrist. Kratom is the only thing that has consistently worked for me after twenty-five years of trying standard methods. In the two years I have been using kratom on a daily basis, I have experienced no increase in tolerance to its mood-improving benefits and have experienced no negative side-effects. Kratom does not produce a high (and I know what a high feels like, as I was prescribed Adderall at one point for attention-deficit issues). In my experience, kratom is safer and more beneficial than any prescription medicine; it produces a gentle (more gentle than coffee) increase in energy and mental focus and improves feelings of well-being while not causing any unwanted effects. Another miraculous aspect of kratom is that it does not lose its effectiveness over time as with prescription drugs and other substances; preventing tolerance is made possible by rotating strains of kratom, each of which has slightly differing alkaloids. My tolerance has actually lowered over the past two years from 4 grams a day to only 2 grams while enjoying the same results. There is no drug on earth that works as beneficially, as consistently over time and as harmlessly; thankfully kratom is not a drug. \n\nMy husband (who was at first skeptical) and my children have been thrilled with the help kratom has afforded me, so kratom has indirectly had an immensely positive impact on my family, and even my friends and coworkers. Please do not categorize this plant as an illegal, recreational drug;  to do so would endanger millions of Americans who rely on the health benefits that Kratom alone can provide.\n\nI appreciate your intention to ensure public safety. Thank you so much for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18660","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Coffee is more dangerous than Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15694","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Alicia Zvonar and I think making Kratom a Schedule I drug is a mistake.  I have several medical issues that cause me to have chronic pain.  I have several bulging and degenerating discs, bone spurs on my spine and scoliosis.  I also suffer from osteoarthritis that is continuing to get worse; some days I find it hard to tie my shoes, write or even type.  Typing is essential to me because I am in school to get my MS in Substance Abuse Counseling.  I also have a job in retail as well as a job cleaning corporate apartments for another company; being able to move is essential to me.  \n     My story begins back a little over 10 years ago, I began seeing a pain specialist who began treating my chronic pain with Percocet and Vicodin.  I believe he was over-prescribing me when I stopped seeing him.  I then began buying oxycontin on the streets.  Soon I was doing heroin to treat my incessant chronic pain.  I got help to get off the heroin with Subutex but the withdrawals were worse than the heroin withdrawals.  After consulting with my regular doctor, I went off the Subutex cold turkey with the help of beta blockers and Klonopin.  As I am sure you are aware, I could no longer take prescription pain medications due to my addiction.  I did some research on natural, herbal solutions to manage my chronic pain.  I found Kratom.  \n     Although Kratom does not completely eliminate my pain, it makes it tolerable so that I can do everyday things like work and cook dinner for my husband.  Kratom does not cause the euphoria that prescription pain medication or heroin did.  It only helps to manage my pain and the depression that coincides with that pain. I have never had a problem with taking too much Kratom.  I did, however, overdose on heroin once and Percocet several times.  When I am not in pain, I have more energy; I was even able to enroll into a Master's degree program to become a substance abuse counselor.  I am studying to be a drug counselor and Kratom is helping me to do that.  What kind of example would I set if Kratom should become a Schedule I drug? \n     There is a severe epidemic in this country of prescription pain pill and heroin addiction.  Making Kratom a Schedule I drug would leave some people no choice but to go back to prescription drugs and illicit drugs.  I wasted too many years of my life in a euphoric stupor to help ease my pain.  Please do not take away the only thing that helps me that lets me maintain a clear head and is not lethal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18109","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alicia Zvonar","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Just tried kratom like 3 days ago and it is really amazing how it helps with pain in my hand and my back I can't day enough about it..it is truley some amazing stuff God's gift to earth and everyone on it..","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10366","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"isaac auten","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Frank DeCaro and I am 51 years old.

I have been employed full-time as a technical support agent for a large communications company for over three years now. I make a decent wage, and combined with my fiance's, my household income is over 70k per year. I am also a recovering opiate addict, and I am writing to ask that the DEA to NOT schedule the plant known as kratom or any of its components.\n\nAfter many years of addiction to opiate painkillers and eventually heroin, and having made several attempts at getting clean through rehab and self-medicating with suboxone purchased on the street, I entered an outpatient methadone program. I took methadone for two and a half years, and after the long and difficult process of tapering down my dose, and then ceasing to take it entirely, I began using kratom to ease the severe withdrawal symptoms. After being clean for about a year I had a short-lived relapse, and again began taking kratom to ease the cravings - though not full withdrawals - that I had awakened.\n\nThat last relapse was over two years ago, and I have not consumed any type of opiate since. I have continued to take kratom regularly as I've found it has other beneficial properties, such as slight mood elation, greater focus of attention, and a generally more positive outlook. Most importantly, it has kept away any kind of desire to seek out opiates or anything that would lead to relapse (I also have completely abstained from alcohol during this time, something else I had abused though to a lesser extent). During these two years I have even been prescribed opiates (hydrocodone) legitimately following several dental issues and have left them all in the bottle, because a) I've found kratom to be a more effective painkiller, and b) I have no desire to risk falling back down that hole to addiction.\n\nScheduling kratom would turn myself and millions of others into criminals overnight, and further this country's failing, regressive, and almost universally reviled \"war on drugs.\" It would create a new criminal enterprise where there previously was none. Kratom is certainly worth more research, and perhaps regulation as a supplement to ensure a standard of quality and lack of adulterants. But taking the action of emergency scheduling kratom would be a drastic overreaction the the laughable evidence of 15 kratom deaths - only one of which being actually attributable TO kratom - and the infinitesimal 660 calls to poison control centers over a period of years. In this current opiate addiction crisis we need to make it easier to obtain alternatives to opiates, not harder. And as much as I appreciate the small but daily benefit I get from taking kratom, my concern lies more with those who use it for painful chronic conditions who would then be forced back in to a very real and much more life-threatening opiate addiction if kratom is scheduled.\n\nI do very much appreciate the opportunity to share my comments.

The positive and productive life that I live today in comparison to what it was like a decade ago, is stark. That time ago, I was a full-blown heroin addict, but thankfully found a way out through the peer-run, work-driven, residential rehab called Delancey Street in San Francisco. For two years, I worked on myself  and my future, and when I got out, I was hired because of the reputation of the program I came from. Everyday I am grateful for that place and the people behind it, but the only way I was able to get to the stage of long term recovery, was to go through a process that is quite terrible . . . opiate withdrawal. I tried everything. Methadone, buprenorphine, cold turkey, valium, all which perpetuated the same behavior, and rubbing elbows with other addicts that were on the fence like I was. If only there was something that could've helped me drop the habit and maintain my cravings in a healthy, time-tested way . . . like what people are saying about kratom. Though I have never used kratom for opiate withdrawal, I have found it to be a very beneficial plant for me. \nA little over a year ago, a friend had mentioned kratom just before I had a minor surgery. Not wanting to go the route of pills, I asked him whether kratom might help with pain. He said it might, so I tried it, and it did. I didn't need anything else. Not only that, but I found that it worked very well to help me focus at work when I returned a couple days later. Being diagnosed with ADD as a kid {a label I do not own, but a brain type I recognize}, I have tendencies that don't make a lot of the task management that comes with my job very easy for me. At the time, I was starting a new business, a cafe, while still managing the growers' market, along with other projects, and a lot was going on. When I got home, I still had to be fully present for my kids and wife, and kratom helped me do that.  In less intense periods of time, I have not had a problem cutting off my use. Kratom is DEFINITELY not addictive like heroin is . . . I can say this with confidence and experience. It's a beautiful plant, that grows abundantly in a region that has been using it for a long time safely. I believe that plants are intelligent medicine. When we start meddling with them and stripping parts of them from their source, we lose something, and we increase the potential for abuse. \nFor the tens of thousands {or more?} of people that are addicted to opiates in our country to have the option of an inexpensive plant support for weaning them off a destructive way of life, to veterans with chronic pain that don't want to get caught in the cycle to begin with, to 'regular' people like me, who can use some extra support sometimes, . . . PLEASE, don't make kratom a Schedule 1 substance! The examples of harm being connected to this plant compared to the other substances it would sit next to are negligible. At least give researchers a chance to study its risks and benefits before making such a harsh and swift switch. We have an opportunity with the capabilities of science to suspend our judgement in these matters and let the good data tell us whether something is beneficial for people. In the case of kratom, it seems pretty clear that there is benefit. Let's work together and allow all of the stakeholders to come up with a science and public health based approach that ensures we continue to learn about how to use the plant to its fullest, and keep it available for responsible adults to help take care of themselves with something as mild as kratom. I thank you very much for changing your stance and being willing to hear our voices before making a decision. I certainly hope that with the majority of people in our country now supporting the deregulation of cannabis, we may recognize that criminalizing plants is not the way of the future.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21559","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am more concerned about the public health ramifications that banning kratom will have.

I am writing to you on behalf of my father, who benefits from kratom. I, myself, have never used kratom but after my mother passed away last September I started looking for a way to help my father improve his life. After extensive research, I found kratom so I sent him a sample. Since then, it has helped him to survive the loss of the woman he loved and took care of for 36 years. Not only did it help him through that loss but he has been able to stop taking Paroxetine, hydrocodone and tramadol for chronic pain and post traumatic stress disorder. You see, he fought in the Vietnam war in 1965-1967 and experienced horrible mental trauma, as well as losing complete sight in his right eye. He has been on Paroxetine for his PTSD but has had trouble getting his prescription filled through the VA in the past year. My mother was always the one to handle those things and no one else in the family seems to be able to get through to the VA and get things accomplished like she did. My dad has told to me how much he hates the way the tramadol and hydrocodone make him feel and kratom has given him a way to stop using those.\n\nPlease do not place this remedy into Schedule 1. It hasn't caused my father any harm whatsoever and people worldwide have used it for thousands of years to make life bearable. We all know how horrible our lives can be and I would hate to see something that is so beneficial to those who suffer be banned. If you ban this remedy, the people who use it will lose the thing that has made their life almost normal again. I can't bear to see my father suffer any more than he already has, so please don't take this away from him. It has helped him so much. I feel that continued use of kratom will provide him a better and longer life and losing him so soon after losing my mother isn't something that I or my family can cope with.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11176","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paula Morton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nMy name is Jake Firmin, and I am a 26-year-old former student of University of California, Santa Cruz who now works in a law office in San Francisco. First and foremost I would like to thank you for allowing myself and others who have benefitted from kratom a chance to voice our opinions and concerns regarding the DEAs plans to make the two active compounds mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine schedule one substances. As a kratom user who was diagnosed with ADD at a young age I can attest to the fact that kratom works unlike any of the various prescriptions I have been prescribed to. Going on and off Ritalin and Adderall from a young age, I have always had a love hate relationship to the medications. While I love the fact that both of them can help me concentrate (something I am surely not the best at), I could never stand the agitation they brought upon me, or the ways in which they enhanced my social anxiety, and anxiety in general for that matter. \n\n\tFinding kratom has been a monumental experience in my life because it has provided me with a better and milder means towards achieving a state of enhanced focus without the strong psychoactive effects of prescription ADD/ADHD medications. What I cannot stress enough here is the fact that kratom has never given me a high. I have certainly felt such feelings with Ritalin, Adderall, and even coffee (when I drink way too much), but never kratom. Kratom has enabled me to feel like myself while giving me a boost of ability to remain focused. Throughout the four years I have used kratom it has helped me immensely, first in my studies at college, and now with my work in a law office, and I find the thoughts of a work life without it to be concerning. \n\n\tSince I have brought up the fact that I find kratoms potential unavailability to be worrisome, I must emphasize that I feel this way strictly for the ways in which my abilities in the work place could potentially suffer dramatically. I want to heavily stress the fact that kratom has never caused me to feel addicted in any way, shape, or form. During weekends, when I am not working, I go throughout entire days without even having remote thoughts about it. To find something that has been as beneficial as kratom that does not alter my overall psychological state has truly been remarkable. I am just one of many people in the U.S. that has benefitted from this remarkable and safe plant, and while my story is like many others, I still felt the importance of sharing it with you. My dad who suffers from chronic pain has also benefitted from it, and I am urging him to write to you as well. \n\n\tI will end this letter by thanking you once again for giving the public a chance to voice our opinions, and it is my hope that many others have come forward and shared their own personal experiences with this plant. Please remember that kratom is related to coffee and while it is understandable that it was initially compared to the horrendous array of synthetic drugs that hit our nation in a dramatic wave, such a comparison is totally unjustifiable. This is not bath salts, nor synthetic marijuana, nor any other crazy and dangerous man made chemical. This is a plant that has been used responsibly in our country for years, and in Southeast Asia throughout generations. Im sure you are aware of all this, and I urge you to think of the sociological repercussions of outlawing something that helps so many people abstain from hard drugs such as heroin. Since those are not my experiences I will refrain from elaborating further. I hope that my words are taken into account, and I sincerely hope that you will make the right decision.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJacob Firmin","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16882","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jacob Firmin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I suffer from infrequent but severe anxiety attacks that arrive with little warning.

America's medical researchers need the advantage of exploring the medical value of plants under the current IRB regulations. I've used kratom to make tea for headaches and symptoms associated with hormonal changes during menopause and I can attest to it's efficacy in reducing and eliminating the effects that interfere with working and day-to-day activities. If the kratom tea had not relieved the symptoms of fluctuating hormones, I would have had to seek much stronger prescription drug therapy, at a time when I did not have health insurance coverage. The time and cost savings of non-pharmaceutical treatment, i.e., eating salad to cure obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, early heart-disease, etc, and the broad-range of potentially life-threatening complications that arise from non-treatment or delayed treatment of easily-remedied disorders give good cause to classifying mitragyna speciosa as a dietary supplement, rather that a Schedule I substance.\n\nPeople who consume kratom as a dietary supplement (such as St. John's Wort, DHEA, melatonin, etc.) are not likely to continue to use it after their symptoms subside or if they experience unpleasant side-effects. Similar to 1 mg sublingual melatonin (as well as higher mgs of the same), kratom will simply not do anything for folks who don't \"need\" it. I've not experienced an allergic reaction to it, but I assume that a small percentage of people consuming it for the first time could have allergy symptoms.   Responsible American supplement companies (such as General Nutrition Co. / GNC) would be an excellent choice for measuring and capsulating the supplement.\n\nIn the competitive market of cutting-edge medical science, advances in technology are expedited when research opportunities are unhindered by additional regulation on materials. Advancements in communication have allowed Americans to educate themselves on dietary and nutritional uses of vegetables, vitamins, and fish oils, with surprisingly positive results that go undocumented, but which can be gathered by scientists, analyzed for accuracies and discrepancies, and then studied in detail by medical researchers.\n\nI, personally, trust individuals to make educated health choices for themselves and to use dietary supplements, essential oils, and nutritional information from doctors responsibly due to extensive public use of such readily available treatments, to date. I consider kratom to be another tool in the toolbox for self-care.\n\nThank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0633","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lisa McCracken","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"A SOLUTION, NOT PART OF THE PROBLEM (Addicts will always find some substance to abuse.)\n    I was on dr prescribed opiates for 14 years.  I never took them to 'get high'.   Not once.   I took them for chronic pain related to Lyme Disease that went undiagnosed for 5 years before being treated. \n     Enter the New Era of Opiate Phobia. ( \"Save an Addict - F*ck a Pain Patient\" ...or, as I'm now starting to realize was actually, \"Let 'Em All OD- No More Problem\").   But that's a whole other issue.\n     The very real threat of losing the medication that made it possible for me to get out of bed and actually do things like play with the dog, go visit a friend, etc, put the fear of God into me.  I didn't want to lose this medication 1. because I needed it, and, 2. suddenly, and without any assistance getting off it (as has happened to many).  But I was physically dependent.  \n     I attempted to taper over 5 weeks and it was A NIGHTMARE no one should have to go through.  But I was able to end the cycle of physical dependency  (taking opiates whether I needed it for pain or not, just to avoid the withdrawal,)  and just take it when I had a pain flair up.   \n     But then there was a long flair up, and I had to take the medication every day for 4 months.  Now I was physically dependent again.  The thought of 5 weeks of horror and the constant fear of losing my necessary medication had me suicidal.  \n     Then I read about Kratom.  2 weeks of Red Kratom and I was completely off the opiates.  No nightmare, no horror, just minor discomfort and the need for Imodium.  (and I never 'got high' from it.  Not once.)\n      I will have another pain flair up.  I will become dependent on the opiates again.  I'd like to be able to get off them again without a 5 week, life altering nightmare.  \n     WHY would you take away a solution to the life destroying nightmare of opiate withdrawal that keeps so many people chained to things like heroin?  You would be doing a disservice to all people in this country that are impacted by the opiate crisis.  KRATOM IS A SOLUTION, NOT PART OF THE PROBLEM.    Please reconsider. \n\nPS.  Addicts will ALWAYS find something to be addicted to.  Are you going to ban mouthwash, sugar, coffee, beer, blood pressure medication, anti depressants...........?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6281","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Peter Leavitt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using kratom as an aid to my chronic pain for almost 3 years now.

At low doses it also increases my alertness without increasing anxiety.\n\nI work on a 10 hour overnight shift but have a 7, 5, and 2 year old at home.  Sleep is a luxury.

I oppose the DEAs proposal to make the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, two constituents of the Kratom plant, schedule 1 controlled substances.\n\nI first stared using Kratom about a year ago after finding out about it through a friend. I was addicted to Suboxone for about 2 years and successfully detoxed from it \"cold turkey\" about 2 years ago now. After I stopped Suboxone, I started getting cravings for my drug of choice again, oxycodone. I was also suffering with mental illness and I was self medicating. I was also suicidal at times and was hospitalized for it a few times. Suboxone was not a good option for me and anti-depressants never worked.\n\nWhen I found Kratom, it was literally a life saver. Instead of getting back on Suboxone I liked the idea of taking something natural. Since I have been using Kratom, it has kept me away from oxycodone. It has also helped more with my depression/anxiety problems than any anti-depressant. If it wasn't for Kratom, I don't know if I would still be here. I probably would have died of an overdose or a suicide. Thanks to Kratom I am not on antidepressants or Suboxone, Methadone anymore but a natural plant. I am happy, sober, and a productive member of society today because of this miracle plant Kratom.\n\nI honestly believe that Kratom does not belong anywhere near a category Schedule 1. Kratom is not synthetic and it has very mild effects with little to no side effects. This needs to be available to the public and to the science community so we can study it. We need to keep this around as a natural option in the midst of the opiate epidemic we have in this country. I think Kratom has the potential to save a lot of lives. I KNOW it saved mine.\n\nSincerely,\nTravis Clark","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18058","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Travis Clark","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For the past 7 years I have been suffering from debilitating back and neck injuries.

I live in Florida.  I have been suffering from anxiety attacks since I was a teenager.  It's gotten so bad over the years, lost jobs,relationships,and opportunities.  I frequented doctors to try to get it in some kind of control and they persciped me Xanax and what a huge mistake that turned out to be.  After about 8 months I was hooked.  The withdrawals from the xanax gave me hallucinations and also increased my anxiety.  So the result I started drinking alot.  I received a dui for taking a Xanax and drunk driving.  I take full responsibility for my actions ,and I should not have been behind the wheel of my car,so I'm not blaming the Xanax but it did play a part.  A few months ago my friend introduced me to kratom.  I was skeptical about it at first I didn't want want to be hooked on another substance at all while trying to quit drinking.  I tried it ,it didn't get me high at all ,but alot of my anxiety started to leave me at that point.  The thing I love so much about kratom is that you don't have to take it everyday.  In the world of an anxiety suffering human you have your good days and then your horrible days.  On my good days I don't need to take it.  On the horrible ones I take it once or twice a day, and I can function fine at work or whatever I'm doing.  Now I understand it has to be regulated, but banning it would hurt not only the people that take it for PTSD,anxiety,depression, and addiction issues it will also put a hold on people that are trying to study this great plant.  I really don't agree how the big pharma industy is such a powerful pain selling presence in this country.  I also would not want it in a schedule 2 or 3, then they would charge mega money and continue to grow even rich and more powerful.

To claim that Kratom has NO medical application while Cocaine and Meth have SOME is absolutely ridiculous, and leads me to believe this move to schedule Kratom is not about FACTS. Surely if this was about facts - there is clear factual evidence through thousands of peoples experiences/testimony to show that is has medical value and warrants further research before jumping to such an extreme and senseless conclusion. \n\nI do believe it has some potential unwanted side effects (if taken in excess) akin to drinking to much coffee (headache) or drinking to much alcohol (nausea). I would not want children under 18 to be able to buy this at the store, but I can say from personal experience that this plant can be used safely by adults with very little chance for misuse/abuse or danger to others.\n\nI first used Kratom about 4 years ago. Since then I have found this plant to improve my quality of life in numerous ways. It helps me sleep, it helps ease my lower back pain, and most importantly Kratom's use does not create a dependency that negatively impacts my ability to be a productive, happy, and healthy human being. I use Kratom as needed, and do not feel any long term withdrawals/cravings.\n\nMy grandparents are both allergic to codeine, and have a terrible reaction to other opiate medications such as hydrocodone. They used Kratom 1- 2 times a day 3-4 times a week. It relieves their chronic back pain, while not making them constipated, bloated, or unable to eat. It relieves their mental and emotional stress, and gives them energy to seize the day as two 90 years young senior citizens.\n\nI believe this should be available for adults as any other supplement, and should DEFINITELY NOT be schedule 1.\n\nThank you, and best regards","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2775","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps addicts get over their addiction's to harder drugs like heroin and crystal meth.

Furthermore, the decision  to move any naturally occurring plant to a schedule 1 or any other schedule should never be done so quickly, without proper research. Our society, now so more then ever, with its need for around the clock news coverage, is constantly demonizing anything it doesn't understand. This type of hysteria of course isn't new but should never be the basis for any laws or the sole purpose of any government agency. The war on drugs is practically a form of modern day slavery.  Drug addiction as a whole needs to be treated completely differently (key word treated).  Finding new items to outlaw will not help this situation in anyway. If we are going to outlaw anything that may cause a negative reaction, when taken in excess, when combined with a multitude of other illegal and legal drugs, we will have too start with caffeine, nicotine, sugar and television. Everything that exist, when in excess, when used foolishly, is bad for a person. The mistakes of a few should not penalize the masses, especially when what we're dealing with may actually be beneficial to many people. I don't want to live in a society where laws are created out of fear. We should have evolved past that at this point.

Prior to that I was prescribed tramadol for some pain issues experienced as a result of a broken neck, and for severe RLS. initially, I was incredibly thankful for the tramadol. I could finally sleep at night and could actually relax instead of being restless and in pain but after a few months I started losing energy and experiencing a variety of side effects that were actually deteriorating my health. It got to the point where getting out of bed was an incredible challenge, although I always fought through because I have a family to provide for and take care of. Because I had no energy and total lack of sex drive at 31 I went to see a doctor only to find the my hormone levels had tanked completely, and several other issues were. Whining to creep in to my overall health.\n\nI felt like I needed to find a better solution and after much research I decided to try kratom. It didn't take long to completely eliminate the tramadol and replace it with kratom. I've felt far better without the side effects. I'm now exercising daily and being a more active husband and father to my kids. For me, kratom has been a blessing that I hope is not taken from me. I've never done any type of illegal drugs in my life, I've never even tried alcohol. Taking kratom is certainly not a recreational activity for me. I take it to live the best possible quality of life. \n\nThanks so much for taking the time to listen to my story and others. I do realize, that like almost every medication, there is a tolerance issue and therefore it's important to be responsible while taking kratom. That said, I believe it to be far safer than most medications taht are prescribed. And it's certainly far safer than drinking alcohol.  I stopped taking it for a couple of weeks when the initial ban was out in place. It wasn't easy to do but I was able to manage through it, although I had to take gabapentin as a replacement which left me feeling frequently dizzy and foggy. I hope that kratom will remain legal and available for use by adults age 21 or older.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8399","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christian Allen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a retired female, married, late fifties.

I have taken Kratom on a regular basis for the past 4 years.  Kratom is a 100% natural supplement made from the leaves of Mitragyna Speciosa, a tree related to the coffee plant. Kratom has helped me cope with an autoimmune disorder that causes severe and chronic pain, chronic fatigue, depression and overall ill health. This disease was previously debilitating but kratom has helped me get back to living a somewhat normal life. I am not just able to work but I have a successful career. I dont think this would be possible without kratom. I would most likely be unable to work and dependent on disability benefits or a burden to my family. Instead of being a burden on others, I am able to contribute to society through work, charity and volunteering. \nKratom has allowed me to not depend on opiate painkillers to relieve my pain. I fear that I would become addicted to opiates as so many that have chronic pain do.  It saddens me that there is an ever growing opiate epidemic and that so many people die from it when there is a natural alternative. That this natural alternative is possibly being banned is truly heartbreaking. \nEmotions aside, the DEAs move to make kratom a schedule I drug is rushed and baseless. There is not sufficient evidence that kratom is a dangerous drug, scientific evidence nor anecdotal. The studies that the DEA has cited as their reasoning have many flaws. The 15 deaths they attribute to kratom have all involved another substance that could have been to blame. The CDC reported that opiate painkillers kill 46 people a DAY. CDC Director, Thomas Frieden stated When prescriptions [opioids] go up, deaths go up. When they go down, deaths go down. Kratom is a natural alternative to these deadly pharmaceutical opiates. \nI should have a right to make the decision for myself of whether I want to risk my life with opiates or take a natural plant with little to no risk. This is not just about kratom, this is about the right to choose natural healing over pharmaceuticals. \nThank you for taking the time to read this. I hope that I have swayed you in some way to keep kratom from becoming a schedule I drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21189","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brooke Cooper","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I urge you to end any efforts by the DEA to ban kratom (mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine).

I started having issues with my back. Through a long and unbearable process, I was diagnosed with Degenerative Disk Disease. Immediately after I was put on a lot of narcotics to help me function in life. At the start I was prescribed Morphine and had my medications jumped around year by year. Oxycodone, hydrocodone, Tramadol. All these opioids began to catch up to me by the time I was 20. I was crushed by toerance issues aka addiction that, was completely sanctioned medications by legitimate doctors. Ended up on Methadone / Norco / Tramadol due to the large tolerance I had developed. Again, all by a legitimate doctor. Methadone worked well for the first couple of years. Yet, the human body adapts to the drugs and tolerance grows. By the time I reached 30 years old. I was so heavily sedated that my body at night had only 7-12 breathes per minute along with a resting heart rate at 25-30 bpm. My nervous system was literally near shutdown every night. Honestly in my opinion, I am lucky to be alive to even write this. During these years I could never keep a job. I barely functioned at all in society. I was lucky to have a wonderful mother to look over me. I was  very ill, not to mention sick of just existing. I began to seek alternative options for help with opioids and came across Kratom. Initially I tried to get off Methadone cold turkey. The withdraw process was just to extreme. I would go a solid week without sleep to start and little to eat, and my chronic pain was excruciating. Along with the myriad of the other classical withdraw symptoms. It just wasn't possible for me to kick even with the determination I had set in my mind. So once I found kratom. I tried it. To my surprise, it not only stopped all withdraw from the opioids. It took my pain to a minimal. After a month of no pills I began feeling human again. I choose to continue with kratom for several reasons. The three major ones were as follows: Pain management completely controlled, No urge to relapse at all, and  taking kratom I am not impaired or sedated. With pills one would be completely in a altered state. This is not the case with kratom. Its absolutely amazing that it carries such medicinal properties yet will not impair you like traditional opiates. Not only that, there is NO RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION (something I know all to well with where i was at). I have a sleep number bed that measures breathing and heart bpm to confirm this (which is also how I knew about the problems i had when on pills along with feeling like i had zero oxygen when i would wake). Since taking kratom my life began to get on track. I went back to work without issue. Stayed employed. I kindled relationships which was/is wonderful. I found my fiance through work and currently have a baby boy on the way come April. My life is finally together and not in shambles. This is in large part due to the ability of kratom to not only get me clean, it stops my chronic pain issues, and all without being impaired. It would be an absolute disgusting act to ban something that not only helps me, but so many others (especially considering associated nervous system depression so common with any other narcotic painkillers). To rip this plant from the hands of the people that constitutionally have the right to choose what they put in they're bodies. This is nonsense. It has no risk factor association. I would know. I have taken many strains over the past year since getting off narcotics. Not once have I never ever felt like I was in danger (not a thing to consider this a dangerous drug or control it). It would also devastate my life, with a family being built around me. I need to stay working. I need to be right-minded for my fiance and soon to be born son. Do the right thing. Don't add to the opiate epidemic in this country. It would not be right nor wise to make your fellow country men have to choose between living a life with painful/dysfunction conditions or have to choose the more destructive option to not suffer. This is my story of not only recovery, but having balance in life. May the sane choice be chosen and the people be heard loud and clear. You need not do this to people that are productive members of society largely due to kratom.\n\nSincerely, Nicholas Fox\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6948","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nicholas Fox","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I support the FDA's decision not to place Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I.\n\nThis compound has been extremely effective in helping my daughter cope with the pain associated with chronic Lyme disease.

I attempted several times this quit but withdrawal was so bad I gave up after a short time. I found out about Kratom through an NA meeting, I was skeptical but desperate. I ordered a small amount and was quite skeptical. When I was out of poison (drugs) I took a half tablespoon when I began feeling sick and in about 25 min my withdrawals were about 99% better.

It makes no sense to ban this non harmful plant. Too many people are dying from Heroin right now. Other drugs, yes, but the heroin epidemic is terrible. I have been clean since 2003 and never looked back. I beg you to keep this plant legal to help people who are struggling terribly. I have a great job, fianc, home and 2 great dogs. I have a life. When I heard about this ban I was confused and then angry. Please reconsider. This is a plant in the coffee family. Ban coffee as well if you ban Kratom. Coffee gives people energy they don't normally have, that could be considered a drug. Just know this has saved my life- you don't know me and you may not care about my struggle but please think about people who could benefit from this - if they truly WANT to stop- as I did.

It's absolutely life changing in so many ways. I wasn't an individual who used it to get off opiates, although I had an active addiction problem a few years ago. A friend introduced me to Kratom after caffeine and my antidepressants both cause heart palpitations, and I had complete lack of energy, motovation, and no luck with mood stabilization. I was all over the board. Kratom gave me the energy to and focus that i do not have naturally, it also gave me mood stabilization moreso than ANY prescribed antidepressant has ever given me. My family has seen a turn around in my lifestyle three times. Once when I went downhill during my addiction, twice when I recovered from the chaos and havoc I caused everyone during my active addiction, and now for the third time where I went from maintining a clean and sober lifestyle,but barely able to function past a part time job and an inactive parent on housing, to a full-time worker and a mom that keeps a roof over my kid's head, does things with them now, and do this without the support of housing assistance. Kratom has helped me further my progress as an individual in life. I've never once felt \"high\" off of it. In the two years I've taken it, it's done everything good....nothing bad like when I was in my active addiction. \nPLEASE CONSIDER WHAT THIS HERB IS DOING IN PEOPLE'S LIVES.

I am a 24 year old recovering opiate addict and Kratom has been a blessing as a supplement to stop the pain from my herniated disk in my neck and also opiate cravings. I overdosed on pain medication in the beginning of the 2015 summer and am thankfully I am still here to even be able to write this. I struggled greatly with overcoming addiction even after rehab, spending my whole summer in an outpatient program, and meetings. A ban of this natural supplement Kratom would literally be sending tens of thousands of people to their grave. I am opposed to this ban and making it a schedule 1 substance is absolutely ludicrous. I have a great psychiatrist who has been practicing over 30 years who is very supportive of me using it and also my chiropractor feels the same way. I asked them why the DEA would do this and both of them said their best guess is it comes down to money. If they are right then just tax Kratom like tobacco and alcohol already are.\n Please do not ban it and instead keep it the same or at least require someone has to be over 18 to purchase it. I finally have my life together and am finishing my bachelor's degree this winter and am expected to start graduate school next fall. Addiction is a disease and anyone in favor of a ban is literally sentencing addicts to death. It is not just people overcoming addiction being affected, but people with chronic pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia, etc. I do not understand how a supplement with no side effects, does not alter ones mind (like prescriptions, alcohol, marijuana), and has positive impacts on an enormous amount of people could be banned. The DEA is supposed to be against illicit drugs but when you ban a natural supplement you are doing the exact opposite and supporting illegal drug use. Thank you for your time and I hope you care about not only saving addicts lives, but also helping others with the many health benefits they use it for. I would love to hear back from someone with a real reason as to why they would even think about banning this supplement.\n\nSincerely,\nMichael Gallo","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21125","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Gallo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should remain legal due to all of the health benefits it obtains.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14776","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chelsea Hayes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dystonia has ruled my life by taking my energy, making pain unbearable, and mood is depressed.

Some of us can't use marijuana legally so this is something that we can take to help us without worrying about going to jail over it. It's a natural harmless leaf that has never killed anyone alone. It should be our right to choose what we want to put in our body. Freedom of choice and our constitutional rights. Banning Kratom and keeping marijuana illegal goes against our constitutional rights. Kratom should remain legal and regulated for people 18 and older. Save Kratom and save Americans lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1611","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Pueschell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing in response to the possible banning of Kratom by the DEA. It is my strong belief this action shouldn't be undertaken.\nMy personal story is this, I am a 52 year old Man, I don't use any drugs legal or illegal. But I did brink too much and was advised by my Doctor to stop drinking. I won't lie it was very difficult. I have a fairly stressful job and home life. I didn't think I was going to be able to do it. Then a friend suggested Kratom which I tried. In my case it was a huge success. I stopped drinking with help from Kratom. But it also helps me cope with the stress I feel almost every day. My health has improved and I feel better overall. \nI ask without all the sincerity I can muster please do not take the drastic action of banning this helpful plant. It is so much better than handling stress life throws at you by drinking.\n\nRespectfully yours, K. Hunt","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15894","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ken Hunt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a true believer we the people should have access to anything grown as an alternative to big Pharma.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14961","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin Taylor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Living in a community heavily affected by opiate addiction and death, a natural plant linked to zero deaths, I believe, should have more research done before made illegal. If there is a possibility of people able to find a true way of getting rid of a potential lethal addiction, I believe it should be studied like so many other substances and possibly used for the natural, positive properties that it seems to have. Once it is studied and possibly found to be lethal, then illegalization can be put back on the table. Guilty until proven innocent will not help anyone if this could be a possible way to save their life. Laws are to protect we as civilians but they cannot be blindly implemented or they can negatively affect the people they're supposed to protect.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11641","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin Stock","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a chronic pain sufferer. I found the herb Kratom , looking online to find all natural and healthy ways to treat my Sciatica. I was prescribed narcotic pain killers, always used as I was directed to by my pain management doctor, but over time, it no longer was working and I was in bed more and more with crippling pain. I adventually started taking the pain pills just to avoid getting sick. I wasn't able to care for my children, I lost my job, because I couldn't leave my bed. I ordered my Kratom for the first time from a popular, trusted vendor and within a week of no pain pills, only taking Kratom, I was able to get out of bed, start exercising, being more involved with my fantastic kids, I feel like I got my life back. It is by no means a cure, but it's a healthier, safer way to help ease the pain. I am not a criminal, I'm a law abiding citizen, who just like many others, wants to be free of pain and to do it safely.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14830","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Heather Dudley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps me with my migraines.
