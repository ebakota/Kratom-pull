I've been clean for nine years.  I started using Kratom two years ago when I had chronic fatigue so badly I almost couldn't work.  It impacted my life terribly, and nothing the doctor or naturopath could do helped.  I somehow found out about Kratom...I saw that taken in small doses it provides energy.  Well, I have been taking Kratom in small doses ever since, and haven't had chronic fatigue at all.  I have been able to live my life (outside of my bed--depressed) because of the Kratom.  Any substance can be abused...even caffeine and cold medication.  But please don't ban this herbal remedy for people like me!!  This has been the ONLY answer to my chronic fatigue.  I don't abuse it, and like I said, I'm in recovery from addiction.  I use it responsibly and have not had to increase my dosage over time.  I take the same amount each day.  This is a GOOD thing in my life and gives me just the right amount of energy to get up and do what I need to do.  The only way I can explain it is that it feels like the oxygen got put back in my blood -- the lethargy I used to experience was bone-deep...like my blood had no oxygen.  There is also the possibility for it to help people detox from opiate addiction, and we need all the help we can for that, with the opioid epidemic that has plagued our country!  Detoxing from opioids is extremely painful and difficult, so if there was something for people to use to help with this, why would the government try to stop that?!

I have a lovely family in which I find pleasure providing for. In 2001 I was on my way to work and I was in a truck with the cruise set on 75 mph and I dozed off into sleep. I awoke to find myself staring at an overpass (I was on the freeway) for it was about a football field away. I was in the median! I turned my wheel to the right, too hard in fact as I slid across both lanes to the other side of the freeway where the concrete embankment ramps up under the bridge. I ramped up it, slammed into the bottom of the bridge, and fell back to the ground, ended up with a compression fracture in my lower back! I was even wearing a seat belt. My back gives me problems all the time, pinched nerves, sharp pains, constant throbbing at times, most of which I have to just deal with because I have a family to provide for. I was on oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone every day for 13 years. I was killing myself with opioid addiction, even though I wasn't taking it to get high I was addicted. But in 2014 a friend came along and introduced me to kratom. My life changed around almost immediately! I didn't have the kidney pain from the harsh opiates, I quit taking my prescription pain meds all together! I will eat kratom 4-5 times a week now because it helps me. I feel like it's a lot safer too. This is a wonderful plant and I would like to say I think it should stay legal because it has changed my life for the better. I believe people should be responsible when taking something like this to help them but that goes with anything. This plant don't fog your head, it don't impair your judgement, you can't overdose because you will just get nausea and throw it up. I believe there are a lot of good uses for this plant and I believe we would be setting a lot of people back if it became illegal.I also believe there is so much to be discovered as it has many many benefits. \n\nIn conclusion, I don't want or think kratom should be schedule 1 because it helps so many. I think it should be available because people need to be able to get it, it can help people with a wide range of reasons. Thank you for listening to me\n\nSincerely,\nJoey Duarte","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9544","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joey Duarte","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't put restrictions on any further plants.

Once again the 100,000 dollars spent did not help them. One is 26 and the other is 22 and they are broken.

We will see what the future brings for these two but it looks a little brighter thanks to this plant. i do not want to see kratom become restricted to the people who can use it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16524","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cody Cannon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"When I was 22 years old, I started experiencing a widespread body pain. I had no idea what it was. I exercised, changed my diet, had a set sleep cycle, did everything in my power to try to fix it. I was not on any medication nor did I drink or do drugs. Perfectly healthy. I even danced for 11 years since I was young. I began researching natural remedies for pain, for besides this random widespread ache that I started getting, I also had kidney stones and a defective disc in my c2-c3 region. I was born this way and it started catching up to me. I could not enjoy everyday life anymore and enough was enough.\n\nI came across kratom and decided to try it out. I had always been into natural remedies and figured it couldn't hurt. This was about 3 years ago. At first I was unsure about it, but as time went on, it was a lifesaver. My physical job became easier, I had a clearer head, more energy. I just felt like myself again. I was still feeling pain, but the kratom was definitely helping. I was later diagnosed with a nerve disorder in my neck and back that triggered pain more often than not, and fibromyalgia. I am now on a regimen of gabapentin, Tylenol, and kratom, for I like to stay away from medications as much as possible because my body is very sensitive to them.\n\nI have helped so many people by suggesting kratom, and saved so many people. To get rid of this herb would be a shame. I have NEVER had any bad side effects from it, and think it is comparable to coffee, if not SAFER. I can get heart palpitations with coffee. Nothing like this has ever happened with my kratom consumption. I hope the right decision is made and at most, this unique, quality of life saving herb is regulated.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5523","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anon Anon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hey DEA. Please do something that's actually in the people's best interests. Haven't you learned anything from the prohibition of cannabis? Kratom is safe and absolutely does not belong on the Schedule 1 list of substances. You need to TRUST adults to make their own decisions instead of making a choice for everyone. Particularly one that can negatively impact so many people's quality of life. The uproar from the Kratom community and all these testimonials has to be more than enough to convince to step down. This is the wrong path. This creates criminals our of ordinary, honest and hardworking people. Folks who use Kratom aren't a threat to themselves or others. Let's move society forwards instead of backwards.\n\nPeople from all walks of life use Kratom. Mothers, fathers, sons & daughters, veterans, addicts, business professionals, you name it.. There's no logical reason to ban it. That decision comes from fear and misunderstanding. If it gets placed as a schedule one substance, it will take years to get any proper research done. Years where millions of people who could improve their quality of life, break addiction, and fight pain or anxiety will suffer. Millions.\n\nIt's irresponsible and downright dangerous to ban this plant. I've been taking it occasionally for years because of social anxiety and panic attacks. Anxiety that kratom helps relieve without the need for dangerous and addictive benzodiazepine drugs. I refuse to take them. If it wasn't for this marvelous plant I would have had a much more difficult time getting through college and breaking out into the real world. It helped me become a business professional, a contributing member of society. I've experienced virtually no negative side-effects, never gotten violent or sick, and don't consider myself addicted. I don't get cravings when I stop or withdrawal symptoms. The negative \"facts\" about kratom on the internet are greatly exaggerated. \n\nThe potential of this plant is greater beyond words. It would be a huge step for the DEA and for society as a whole. And honestly you guys could use some good PR. To sum up - please don't ban this natural, miraculous plant.  The ban would hurt millions of people. You'd be playing a sick joke with people's lives. And finally it expands the war of drugs; a destructive and endless war with no end in sight. A war that can't be won. So let's find a different solution. Let's evolve. Do the right thing. Please don't ban Kratom.\n\nThank you for your consideration","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21019","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Leo Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't think Kratom should be a Schedule 1 drug.

I have been supplementing with the plant on and off for around 5 years, and have yet to experience addictive properties, and health problems (at all, let alone related to kratom).\n\nI oppose the scheduling of kratom and its active alkaloids wholeheartedly. The plant has few, if any, recorded instances of causing harm to the user, unless mixed with drugs that could have killed or harmed the user without kratom being present. No reasonable source can claim strong evidence that the plant is detrimental to health at all, even when taken in large doses, regularly, over an extended period of time. The proof of harm and danger just does not exist, however it's benficial effects are well documented.\n\nFor me, kratom was a life saver. I had been a heavy drinker from the age of 15, first just on weekends, but later it became more invasive. It caused harm to my personal relationships, my health, and my legal standing. At 20, I decided to make a change. I slowly introduced kratom to my life, and watched as my desire to drink plummeted. As of now, I havent has a drink in 2 years. I managed this with little effort, and no outpatient recovery program at all. Some of that, of course, can be contributed to my desire to stop drinking, but having attempted to stop before, I am well aware that the kratom is what made it possible. Since then, I've started a small business, got married, returned to college, and my wife and I have bought our first home. None of this would have happened if I was still a drinker. I have Kratom to thank for getting me off the bottle, and I hope that the regulatory bodies considering it's scheduling will take my story, and that of countless others, into account when making a decision to forbid american citizens from having this option in the future.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15589","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sean Shepherd","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For ten years I've lived with the rare Guillain Barre Synndrome.

I was introduced to Kratom in 2010 while on a USAID mission in rural Southwestern China when I experienced arthritic pain following expeditions into caves as part of our water pollution research.  As no Western medicine was available, my Chinese hosts took me to a traditional Chinese herbal pharmacy where I was given a bag of crushed leaves and instructed to make tea and drink the bitter concoction.  To my amazement, the remedy was extremely effective at alleviating my pain while boosting my energy similar to a strong cup of coffee--without the jitters associated with caffeine or any other side effects.  I also noticed relief from diarrhea and an improvement in my digestive system.\nLater I learned that the botanical remedy was Mitragyna speciosa (Kratom) and that it was available legally in the USA.  This revelation meant that I could address mild to moderate pain, as well as other minor ailments, without dangerous and highly addictive opioids commonly prescribed by Western physicians.  I learned that the active constituents, mitragynine (MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH-MG) were tryptamine alkaloids whose chemical structures were completely unrelated to morphine and synthetic opioids, and that they exerted their effects through allosteric activation of mu- and delta- opioid receptors.  Furthermore, MG and 7-OH-MG do not cause respiritory inhibition which is the primary factor in opiod overdoses.\nFor the past three or four years I have used Kratom tea to effectively treat pain and GI discomfort.  I have experienced no adverse effects (except possibly mild constipation) and completely eliminated the need for powerful prescription analgesics.  When I learned of the eminent ban on Kratom, I stopped using it and experienced virtually no withdrawal symptoms.\nKratom is an effective and safe herbal supplement with the potential to combat the devastating opioid addiction epidemic.  Kratom should be sold over the counter alongside other, less effective and potentially harmful botanical supplements already available in retail stores, health food stores, and pharmacies.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22015","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rick Fowler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This saved my life.

As you are aware by now, it is a plant that grows in Southeast Asia. I am very concerned about the control that your office has over plants and herbal supplements, that would allow you to take away (or make illegal) a part of nature. This plant, in its natural state is not harmful and I myself can attest to this. It is amazing to see all of the hype and false claims regarding kratom, which are exactly that, False!\nNone of this makes sense unless one were to read between the lines. If the FDA or pharmaceutical companies want to make some sort of synthetic drug out of this plant for profit then maybe it all makes sense to them. I personally dont care what they do, or what profits they intend to make but I really do doubt that this plant can ever be duplicated in regards to the benefits it provides in its unadulterated pure form. It does make you feel well, it does give you energy, it does take away mild to moderate pain, it does provide motivation and focus...and I could go on and on but I am positive that you will read many stories of the wonderful benefits it has.\nWe are in a heroin epidemic in this country right now and at least once a year I hear about someone that I know or that knows part of my family that has died from heroin overdose. And daily about hundreds of people dying, whom I dont know.\nPlease, please focus on doing something to keep heroin out of our country. \nThis plant is not your target! This plant is helping people with the very epidemic we are facing at this time. Please consider the deaths from relapse that will surely happen if you were to take this plant in its purest form away. Please consider the loss of productive hardworking individuals, who would rather stay away from synthetic prescription drugs to get up and go to work everyday. Please consider the rise in unemployment and disability benefits. Please consider the suicide rate increasing from those in pain and increasing depression. Please consider the jobs that will be lost due to kratom vendors closing their doors.\nI agree that their should be age restrictions and possibly packaging regulations but not a ban. Thats just insane. \nThank you for your time and considerstion.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18867","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carrie Cogan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"kratom should stay legal. more financial support should be given to reduce the use of pharacuetical control of the american people","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16278","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"matt bates","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 72 years-old and have arthritic issues.

In 2013, his physician stopped prescribing this very addictive pain medication cold turkey, which left my husband in a terrible situation. My husband suffered severe withdraw symptoms that left him barely able to function at his very physically demanding job. He heard of a medicine that would alleviate these symptoms and was prescribed a drug that ended up almost ruining his life, Suboxone. In 2014, my husband's pain worsened and he was forced to see a neurosurgeon who said he would need to have cervical spine surgery to fuse damaged discs. My husband had the surgery, but was still not out of the woods. He was prescribed more pain medicine due to the surgery and was having a very difficult time getting off of the medication. Swearing that he would never take Suboxone again, he started researching natural pain remedies and found Kratom. Kratom has been a blessing to our family. My husband is back to himself! He is a hard working family man, who has a passion for life again. He has never had any ill effects from Kratom and has been taking it daily for 2 years. In my opinion, it's a miracle drug. It literally saved my husband's life and our marriage. You would never know my husband takes anything for pain. We are an upper middle class family, with a house, 2 children and 2 dogs. We are faithful people and law abiding citizens. Kratom is simply not a bad drug. I can't imagine it causing half the problems that alcohol & cigarettes have caused. It also helps with diabetes. I am diabetic and have toyed with the idea of taking it to see if it works, but am afraid that it would work and then it would become illegal.

My earlier life was significantly affected in late high school / early college by an addiction to painkillers. First Vicodin, then Oxycontin. This culminated with my dropping out of U.C. Santa Cruz for a quarter and narrowly avoiding arrest in SF at the intersection of Jones and Turk Street, otherwise known as \"Pill Point.\" The price was 50 cents per mg back then, around 2008. Incidentally, that arrest would have caused me to miss my Eagle Scout court of Honor.\n\nIt has been ten years since I last used an illegal narcotic, and I credit that to Kratom. I believe every human is born with a set of neuro-receptors which determine most characteristics that make us the people we are - and no person may choose their own genetics. I'm convinced certain individuals are born with combinations of receptors which predispose them to be addicted to opiates. It is not a character issue - it is a biological one, which manifests as an \"itch\" that needs to be scratched. Kratom scratches that itch without development of tolerance or serious dependency. Yes it is a stimulating and can be euphoric, but more importantly, it taps the receptors that provide satisfaction and eliminate the desire to seek opiates. I am successfully employed in a career in affordable housing, in a stable relationship relationship, and dedicated to my community and country. \n\nI see limited benefits from scheduling kratom, and tremendous costs. Kratom is never going to rival an Oxycontin high - EVER. But for those who truly wish to recover, it provides an viable substitute strong enough to live a happy, fulfilling, and STABLE life. And as a daily user of Kratom, I would be personally devastated and condemned to either moderate discontent or god forbid a return to synthetic opiates. Thank you for your consideration of this request. \n\nRespectfully,\n\nMark Ceraldi","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21355","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Ceraldi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Ryan Chalk, and I have used kratom for about 2 years.

I brewed it as a tea and sipped on it. Now, I am not one to try different medications, nor do I like feeling in any way 'out of control,' so I was a bit concerned about the effects. In reality, all the tea did was give me a feeling of calmness. I was not high. I did not become addicted. I had no horrible aftereffects. It just soothed my anxiety so that I was in a relaxed state - still able to completely function. I also tried a different strain when I had an upset stomach - again brewed as a tea - and within minutes my stomach uneasiness was completely gone and did not come back. Again, I was not 'high' and I did not 'come down' from any effects. I do not use this every day because I use it PRN. I find nothing addictive about this plant. Absolutely nothing. But it works for what I use it for. To make this drugs illegal, to classify it as a controlled substance, is incomprehensible. This is purely a ploy so that people are addicted to synthetic pharmaceuticals and the pharmaceutical companies rake in millions more. People 'addicted' to pain killers are customers for life and that is what I believe to behind this attempt to classify Kratom. It is a plant. Pure and simple. Nothing more. The DEA needs to do the right thing, which is to allow people to control their own pain and manage it the way they find appropriate. Unless everyone in the DEA who is pushing for this is a medical professional, they have no idea of the good this plant does. Stop trying to control every single person in this country. Go after real drug dealers if you must but leave innocent people who are looking for pain relief alone. This is such an invasion of privacy on a personal level for millions of people. I think the DEA's time would be better spent going after real drug dealers rather than people who just need relief from agonizing pain and discomfort.

Use enough for the desired effect and using anymore attempting to abuse it will lead to it leaving your body.\nI very sincerely ask that you reconsider taking this lifesaving herb away from me and the countless other thousands that have found relief with it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3659","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Arnold","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"When I found kratom I was able to treat my anxiety and depression effectively, more effectively than ever before, and eventually had no need for my anxiety medication.

While I am not a daily consumer, I know firsthand the hearing benefits this all natural plant can have. It stops my chronic pain in its tracks. It doesn't leave me foggy or sick, it doesn't leave my respiratory system in chaos. It calms. It helps. By scheduling this natural alternative therapy into a schedule I drug, you are taking away our rights to treat our physical ailments with alternative therapies. Kratom has been used worldwide for milenia as an adjunct therapy to help dozens and dozens of physical ailments. Unlike heroin or LSD, Kratom doesn't cause you to lose your house, your job, or your zest for life. Kratom simply is an acceptable alternative, natural therapy to assist a person to leading a full, healthy life. Kratom deserves to have the chance to be scientifically studied, and the people deserve to have access to all natural therapies while treating their physical conditions.  Please do not schedule Kratom into a schedule I; the ramifications of that action could be detrimental to a society plagued by opiate addiction.

I have never been in trouble with law enforcement and pride myself on giving back to my school and my community. I currently hold a full-time job as a sales associate for a firm based in St. Augustine and have been gainfully employed during my time as a full-time student. I am writing today to express my deep desire to continue to have the option of using kratom in my day to day life. Kratom has helped me be able to live the life as I know it now, one that allows me to be a productive member of society, one in which I vote and give back to my school and community. Having the ability to choose kratom for my ailments has allowed me to feel as if I have taken control of my life again rather than having the injuries I suffered during my military service as a combat veteran. My back and neck are not what they used to be prior to my service and often took countless pills to help deal with the pain I suffered. After finding kratom, all of that changed.\nToday I am able to run, climb, garden and bike all without the use of pills from big pharmaceutical companies that are more intent on managing pain as if it is a disease rather than cure it. I feel as if I need to have the option to use kratom in my life in order to continue to be a product member of society. Prescription pain killers is not something I want to use on a frequent basis. I understand their use in our society and know that they are important thad can offer relief to millions of people, yet they do not cover all the basis. They are inherently bade for your internal organs and if anyone reading this has ever watch the news, we have a serious opioid addiction in our country. People are becoming addicted and even sometimes overdosing on these prescription painkillers, and I feel that with a ban on kratom, that epidemic we are facing is only set to grow. Banning this natural plant that has never been found to solely cause an overdose is not the right path to get our problems as a nation under control. \nIt is shocking that some kratom companies market this botanical as a legal high. It is not. What it does do is provide reliefs to tens of thousands of people throughout our society, regular normal everyday people just like myself who are worried about what life would be like without it. Kratom has been around for thousands of years in use from the indigenous people of southeast Asia, however the plant itself is not well studied. Before our government takes this botanical away from good hardworking people, they should have some scientific reasoning behind it, not fear mongering. If the studies came back in favor of kratom's use then I am sure pharmaceutical companies could use it to help benefit people further. I believe that kratom is safe to use and that it has far less harmful side effects than do prescription opioids. \nIt is important to me that this plant be available for the years to come. I do not feel as if I am addicted or would go through severe withdrawals without it. What I do feel like is that if I didn't have access to kratom, I would go back to pain pills. I would suffer the side effect associated with those pills and would again be at the mercy of pharmaceutical companies that are just as interested, if not more so, in turing a profit for their shareholders than they really worry about someone being over prescribed and becoming addicted to their products. We need to step up in our society and not damn those things that are both naturally occurring and seem to help ten of thousands of Americans. I implore you and your colleagues reading this to consider my testimony and those of my peers before you ban something that has truly helped me live the life that I want. In turn, I promise that continuing down my path of becoming the best person for my friends, family, and community will be made all the easier by your decision to let me choose how to manage my life with kratom.\nI truly hope that my words as well as the thousands of other comments gathered will make the difference. It is important to me that it does, it would break my heart if kratom were to be viewed as heroine or cocaine.

It can be a real help to struggling addicts. I can't pretend to know it's use on anyone but me. I am far from prefect and I still have bad days. But before kratom I craved alcohol every single day to the point where I would drink every single day. Sometimes in excess. I have a family and it was important for me to change my habits. After starting taking kratom my cravings stopped. I lost interest in drinking and hardly ever think about it. Occasionally, I will partake in one to two drinks. By occasionally I mean twice a month. Even after one or two drinks I am not triggered to binge drink. I am satisfied. I am not a great writer but wanted to share how kratom can positively impact other struggling moms out there.

I am a patient who has been dealing with chronic pain and other health issues for many years. The prescription pain killers I was given for years not only exacerbated my health issues, but also took away my quality of life. Those who care about me were forced to suffer along with me as I was told I would suffer for the rest of mylife and opiate pain pills would be the best solution. Well this retoric gave me a deep depression and feeling of hopelessness that eventually ended by me self addmitting to detox and drug treatment. Now that I have overcome opiate addiction, this plant is how I choose to medicate and deal with my pain. The chemicals I was taking on a regular basis made my symptoms worse and did more damage to my liver and other organs which have already taken a beating. This plant does not give me any negative side affects after around 3 years of using it regularly. I still dont use it everyday but the days when I hurt the worst, this miracle plant comes to save the day. By scheduling this plant you are only going to push people back into the pharmacies for narcotic pain killers. You will only create more of a problem than we have already with opiate addiction. Instead of scheduling it, perhaps you should share information with the public about a natural alternative to opiates and other chemical pain relievers. I truly believe this to be a beneficial healing plant when used responsibly.

Since I've learned of Kratom 3 yrs ago my life has become significantly better. It has helped me control my pain and improved my life in ways that are hard to put into words. Kratom grows naturally in South East Asia and is related to the coffee plant. I find it to be a good comparison. Coffee uplifts moods and increases energy like Kratom.  When you quit using kratom it's a lot like quitting coffee. I find I get tired a little easier maybe a mild head ache. Its certainly not a synthetic drug made of dangerous chemicals. It is a plant. And tho it has been said that it has taken lives I do not believe that. I believe other things took the lives of those people. Science is proving Kratom to be safe. All the testimony provided with their results of taking Kratom successfully.  Thialand has used it for centuries and they have reported any related Kratom deaths. I trust Kratom to be safe. I believe that with the opiate crisis in america it would benefit the government to look seriously at kratom as a solution to this. It does help with withdrawl and lifts spirits. I understand the patents taking out on some of the alkaloids kratom has and if you want to try to make pill out of it I'm not against it but understand I feel as an american I should have the right to choose a natural plant of pharmaceuticals drugs and I believe kratom as a whole is what makes Kratom so good. It should not be banned in my humble opinion but studied. This shouldn't even have to be said but I do not want to become a criminal by choosing to use kratom to improve my life. If the government is truly out for the best interests of the citizens it will not ban kratom. Please reconsider your choice to put this plant on the most dangerous Scheduled 1 list where it would not even able to be studied. That is just wrong. Please don't take away my choice to choose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13605","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Denese Nelson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern,\nMy name is Carly and I am a 22 year old college student preparing to graduate in less than one month with a Bachelors degree in Sustainability and a concentration in Policy and Economy. Upon graduation, I am looking to accept a position within my local municipal government and get involved with other projects in my field. \nI strongly oppose the DEAs decision to classify the kratom plant as a Schedule 1 controlled substance. I have been using kratom for a little over a year when I began suffering from anxiety and depression. I had just transferred down to southern New Jersey after getting my associates degree and stumbled into a relationship that quickly turned unhealthy. I have always been independent and autonomous, so I was able to get out in the longest four months of my life, but I couldnt shake the negative thoughts and overwhelming edge that he would keep me on. I tried counseling, but I felt they didnt understand how I was feeling. A few of my friends have prescriptions for Xanax and Lipitor, but I knew I just needed time and didnt want to have to worry about upping the dosage or becoming reliant (I have a bad history with Adderall as a college student). My younger brother had asked me if I knew about kratom, as he had just been in a tragic accident that resulted in his friends death after being in the wrong place at the wrong time and was suffering from PTSD. I found a reputable distributor and decided to try it. \nFlash forward, my rebound guy ended up being the love of my life, and weve been together for a year and a half. Soon after we started dating, I found out hed been living with a heroin addiction for the better part of six years. He tried to go to rehab, but it was impossible without insurance. I realized after my last relationship, which I did not invest much into, the proper way to treat people that you care about and how to foster a healthy relationship. Together, we are getting through our issues and hes been clean about eight months, since we started living together. We could not have done it without kratom. In addiction recovery, every person is different in their mental fortitude and their confidence to get through it. Over time, the temptation to use goes from every 15 minutes, to every hour, to eventually a few times a week, sometimes never completely dissipating. After a user has built up their tolerance to a certain point, it no longer becomes about getting high but rather feeling normal. Not only does kratom take away the intensity of withdrawal, but it gives you the esteem to know you can get through the entire day without needing that extra chemical in your bloodstream. \nOne cannot know the pain of drug addiction unless they personally experience it, whether themselves or through a loved one. Unfortunately, there are millions of kratom users whose addictions stem from pain medications. Regardless of how we got to where we are, there are over 23 million Americans living with drug and alcohol additions throughout the United States. For too long, weve allowed ourselves into bed with Big Pharma assuming their intentions were good. I believe kratom offers the chance to change that.  Thank you for your time and please consider this in your decision to classify kratom as a Schedule 1 controlled substance. \nSincerely, \nCarly Griffiths","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13617","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carly Griffiths","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI am writing today to express my concern for the recent proposed ban on Kratom for schedule I substances.

At 19 years old I was told that I would be in a wheelchair by the time I was 30 and that my life would be managed with pharmaceutical drugs and physical therapy. Determined to change that outcome I set my life course to become as healthy as I could by eating right, exercising right, and using herbs and vitamins to control my symptoms and for the most part this worked well for me. For about 15 years I managed to hold off what doctors told me I couldn't avoid. But by the time I was 35 the disease had set in and was taking over my body. I began to suffer from debilitating muscle spasms in my neck and back and this would be the first time I ever took prescription pain pill to control the pain associated with MS, degenerative disc disease and spondylosis. Needless to say it didn't take long for the prescription opioid medication to take over my life. Within five years of taking my first pill I was addicted and just like everybody else began a course of abuse and dependence on the opioid pain medication. By the time I was 40, whatever left of my life that wasn't robbed by the disease was now under siege by the pain medicine and my life resembled no kind of living. I was merely existing to wake up, take pain medicine and go back to sleep. It would be another two years before Kratom was introduced to me and I would gain control of my life again. Kratom not only helps to manage the pain associated with MS, degenerative disc disease, and spondylosis but it also helped me break my addiction to the pain medicine that I thought I would be slaved to forever. I would later learn through my experience with kratom how bad my addiction to the opiate pain pills actually was and how the opiate pain pills contributed to the problem and the pain. Now I'm able to manage my symptoms, which range from pain, to issues with balance and, restless leg syndrome and anxiety with two simple teaspoons of Kratom each morning. In discovering Kratom's fantastic benefits it has not only given me my life back but I can afford to live as well. Where I was once unable to work and function in society I now hold a managerial position and work up to 60 hours a week at times because I'm functioning in life. My days are no longer consumed by countless doctors appointments and pharmacy errands. Kratom has returned the quality of my life to me and I shudder to think what will happen to me if Kratom is taken away or made unavailable or becomes ridiculously so expensive I can't buy it. This just can't happen. I also feel it's important to mention that while I was on the opiate pain meds my blood pressure had to be control with blood pressure meds because I could it get it under 165/99. Now my blood pressure is a steady 110/88 without meds to control it and all I take is Kratom. Before Kratom I was on 3 different pain meds, BP meds, anxiety meds, depression meds, nerve meds, and steroids! I've replaced all that with two teaspoons of Kratom each day and I am not only living but I am ALIVE! \n\nKratom is safe based on my 5 years of experience.

I was hit by a van wile rideing my bike at  the age of 15 and suffered Injuries including a broken arm clavicle shoulder blade and a ruptured disk in my spine. I became addicted to the narcotic pain killers I was on throughout my teens. Eventually I was cut off of my pain pills and had to stop. After withdrawls from my pain pills I suffered severe pain and long lasting post acute withdrawl symptoms (PAWS) the symptoms included severe fatuige crippleing depression and pain. I suffered through my early 20s with heroin addiction. At 25 I was able to stop using heroin and all other pain medication but I was a shell of a human, the pain depression and fatigue left me unable to work or be happy. Something beautiful happened after a year of living like that, I found kratom...I have been using kratom now for a year and have built a beautiful new life, I am happy hardworking and productive. No longer am I suffering from pain depression and fatigue. Kratom has done for me what anti depressants pain medication and heroin never could do, it has given me my life back...I don't ever increase my kratom intake unlike with other medications the effect is steady the benefits don't stop. This idea of you ripping this beautiful life from me makes me sick I try not to think about why you would want to do something so evil. The best case scenario if you take our kratom away is that I go back to a miserable unproductive life without it, the worst case scenario is I end up on heroin again and get myself thrown in prison or killed....This is so incredibly horrible what you are trying to do....If you care about Americans and want to help us you must stop this insanity . Kratom should be cherished and it's use should be encouraged to those suffering with depression and fatigue after quitting opoid drugs....It should be protected at all cost....You must not do this. If your intentions are to help people you need to leave kratom alone. Don't regulate it because if you do you will make it less accessible and affordable to the people who desperately need it...I will loose all hope in my government if something so horrible can happen in this day and age at the will of pharmaceutical companies.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1136","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David McNamara","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, \nI would first off like to say that I have been consuming kratom for just over 5 years now, I normally take it daily & have no issue stopping my use when needed.

I don't drink liquor or smoke marijuana (or consume any illegal drugs) I was shown kratom by a naturopathic doctor over 5 years back & I find that it helps me to relax in the evening much like my friends and family regularly drink a glass of wine or beer to help unwind. I do not feel that kratom should be listed as a scheduled drug that seems absolutely crazy to even fathom. Over my 5 years of taking kratom I have never once felt intoxicated but only a slight mood lift and relaxed feeling. In comparison the effects marijuana are about 20 times stronger, as stated before I do not regularly consume marijuana but when I have in the past I definitely feel intoxicated UNLIKE when I take kratom. \nI know this whole ordeal is in your hands now, I just feel that scheduling kratom would be a step backwards and completely unnecessary. \nThank you for listening to what I have to share...","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9632","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been taking kratom for energy (due to lack of energy from cancer/chemotherapy) and social anxiety.

Several years ago I had a shoulder injury and through pain management I was prescribed Norco 10/325 for the pain. This is the highest strength available. I ate these pills all day long for 2 years before my surgery and no longer have a script. They did the job but were addicting. Im sharing this to show my history with opiates. \nFor the past two years I have suffered from Psoriatic arthritis. I was employed delivering packages in Manhattan and was suffering in major pain in my ankles from the arthritis. I discovered Kratom and would put some in my tea and would be pain free all day. Now to compare the Kratom to opiate pain killers is a joke. They share no similarities as there is no \"high\" with Kratom. If you have ever taken opiates for pain you know what Im talking about. \nThe effect of Kratom is like a strong cup of coffee minus the jitters but with the benefit of relieving PAIN! There is no \"high\" associated with Kratom.\nI have since retired and no longer need Kratom but from what I have read it is working magic getting people off of Opiate addiction and Heroin. I understand the Pharmaceutical industry will loose lots of \"customers\"/ patients if Kratom remains legal but thats too bad. From what I've heard, there is a Heroin problem in my local High School and I'd love to talk to the superintendent about Kratom to help kids with Heroin addiction. \nListen, its time to do the right thing.

Additionally, I cannot fathom how it can be 'just' to write-off millions of Americans who are hard-working and tax-paying and reclassify them as felons quite literally with the stroke of a pen.

I would ask that you show genuine compassion for those who suffer and help put the US government on a path to genuinely caring for its powerless citizens.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0907","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Spivey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Do not place Kratom as a Schedule 1 Drug.

Since then, I've been in constant pain and have been through multiple doctors and every prescription pain killer imaginable. While most dull the pain, they completely destroy any ability I have to function -- you might as well be drunk while taking pharmaceutical pain killers. Kratom is the only thing I've found that allows me to function normally, while killing  enough of the pain to work. I've used kratom for a year now with no issues. After a year of pharmaceutical pain killers, I had every side effect imaginable, and was completely miserable to be around. The temper, mood swings, liver problems and what not are terrible, I could go on all day about how awful it is. With kratom, I'm not exactly what I once was, but it's leaps and bounds better than the alternative. Please don't take that away.

This is a full time occupation requiring both mental acuity,  adaptability and stamina. One cup of kratom tea in the morning has proven far more effective than any of a variety of anti-depressants I've been prescribed over decades, all with substantial side effects. I've stopped taking the kratom for a period of weeks and , other than missing its effects, I've experienced little withdrawal or addictive qualities. \n\nIn contrast, the latest pharmaceutical I'd tried to regulate anxiety and lack of sleep in light of this stressful situation was the antidepressant Mirtazapine. It was not only a disabling sedative, initially rendering me unable to think clearly and certainly incapable of driving, it also triggered substantial weight gain and was useless in its prescribed function as an anti-anxiety and anti-depressive agent. I've also used benzodizepines at times for anxiety and sleep, and their addictive qualities and potential for abuse are well documented, as well as their potential links to dementia and cognitive decline. Why wouldn't a seemingly safer alternative like Kratom be studied further and regulated?  Please do not ban this substance based on inaccurate or incomplete reports .. it has helped a of people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15910","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My wife suffered from chronic pain. Though we have found dietary interventions that have largely addressed this pain, she struggled and our family struggled for about 5 years. We tried pharmaceutical interventions, which did little to address her pain but she did experience side effects that lead to more drugs, substantial weight gain, severe anxiety, and appointments with specialists since they were unable to diagnose her devolving condition. At some point, we gave up on pharmaceuticals and I got my wife back, at least her personality. She still struggled with pain, and I was always searching for interventions that would help. Kratom was the most effective. It improved her quality of life substantially until we were able to identify and address her underlying issues.\n\nOur experience with my wife's health issues and my own has led me to believe that the ability to 'doctor ourselves' is sacrosanct. The tools to do so shouldn't be taken away from individuals and individuals have an obligation to their own health. I have no doubt, unfortunately, that there are people who don't take that personal obligation seriously and misuse kratom. Though the risk for chemical addiction with kratom is extremely low if not impossible, many substances with medicinal value have street value just the same. Ultimately, the public health risk is nonexistent, the individual addiction risk is very low, and the potential benefits to individuals who suffer from pain, anxiety, opioid use disorder, and other health concerns is substantial.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1850","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ben Donahower","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have had 2 back surgeries.

I just attributed it to arthritis, but it became so bad that I was basically bedridden for much of the week. I had no strength to attend family or social functions. I didnt  even have the energy to play with my 4 yr. old granddaughter. I could barely make it to work and had called off way too many times that I was in danger of losing my job. I was so depressed that I had no life. I couldn't do simple things like cleaning the house or making dinner. I hated myself thinking I was just lazy and I had even contemplated ending my life. One night my boyfriend and I went out to a nightclub for dancing. We used to tear up the dance floor but that night I was so exhausted that all I could do was just sit there, with tears in my eyes, watching everyone else have a good time. I knew then I needed to see the doctor. At my appointment, he immediately diagnosed me with severe fibromyalgia. He prescribed me Lyrica, but I wanted to try a more natural approach with herbs and supplements. Someone online introduced me to kratom. She explained that it was a natural dietary supplement related to the coffee plant and told me it not only helps with chronic pain, but also fatigue. I was skeptical. I have taken many herbs and supplements before, that did absolutely nothing for me, but I was so desperate so I tried it. I can't begin to tell you how amazed I was! Within ONE HOUR, I had absolutely NO PAIN, and had SO MUCH ENERGY!  I had NO side effects at all. Every day after became like a gift to me! I could now do all the little things I hadn'the been able to do in a long, long time. I can clean the whole entire house, make dinner everyday and still have enough energy and less pain that I take walks! After about 2 weeks, we went out dancing with my boyfriend and get this!....I danced till the place closed down!!! I  was so excited! I now had my life back and I owe it all to this simple supplement!\n I know you are being inundated with so many mails that sound exactly like mine, but please, I beg you to please do not take away our kratom. If you will investigate, you will find that it is entirely harmless. It is not addictive, it has NO side effects whatsoever and it's completely safe. There has been a lot of misinformation regarding kratom use. If you will investigate the rare cases of so called, \"deaths due to kratom\" you will find in their autopsies, there were also illegal drugs in their body such as heroin or opiates which was the culprit in their demise. Kratom is NOT a drug and it's very SAFE. It's an dietary supplement that has helped millions of people. I'm extremely frightened at what will become of me and the numerous people should kratom be banned.  Most of us will become disabled. We will no longer be able to contribute to society. We will no longer be able to work, forced to be bedridden (again) and have to live the rest of our miserable lives on welfare, costing millions of dollars to the taxpayers including yourself.\n  This is the future I see for myself if kratom becomes illegal and I'm so nervous and scared.\n I can't go back to that miserable life. I just can't. Please help me and all the others by not banning kratom. Again, please, investigate the REAL stories of how kratom helps us deal with our horrible and incurable diseases, without the use of dangerous pharmaceutical drugs that have many harmful side effects! Please let us have that choice.\n Thank you so much for letting me share my story and for taking the time to read my letter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17824","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laurie Weber","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think that Kratom needs to be researched more.

I think it would be a very bad idea to schedule this plant. I have ingested the plant, and worked at places that sell the ground plant in capsule form. The effects are benign. My customers purchasing it have mainly used it to relieve themselves from pain. Some even used it as they were trying to kick harder, dangerous narcotics. I rarely had younger people come in to use it as a \"legal high.\" I would have no issue with making the plant 18+, but to schedule this plant is moving backwards in current US drug policy. The country is moving more liberal when it comes to scheduling plant \"drugs.\" I believe the DEA should pu their finger to the air, and understand we are tired of locking people up for ingesting \"drugs\" that effect only the user.

First a little bit about myself, I'm 46 years old, I work 40-50 hours a week as a machinist. I operate state of the art CNC machining \nCenter's making tire molds for major brand tire manufacturers. I have perfect attendance and have never been tardy to work.\nPlease don't place kratom on the schedule 1 list! I strongly oppose this movement.  Thank you for giving us the opportunity to hear our comments. I began using kratom about 4 years ago to get me off prescrition medication's like suboxone and methadone. I would never use either of these medications again because they are super addictive and powerful. Very tough to ween off of and I missed alot of work due to withdrawls. That\"s when I came across an herb called kratom. It was all natural so I gave it a try. It has turned my life around. I was able to get off all dangerous medication's. I strongly believe ktatom can help millions of people struggling with addiction.  It's a safe all natural choice we as working amercan's should be able to decide to use at our discretion. Kratom is safe for consumers to use, I promise you. I don't believe that kratom is addictive or harmful to humans. I'm living proof of it's value to help for the treatment of addiction, pain management and mental distress. I think it's really got potential to save lives! So I beg you to please reconsider placing kratom as a schedule 1 drug. Americans should be able to have the freedom of choice and to not be made into criminals by the kratom ban. I have never seen anyone ever get hurt by this natural herb. It's only been beneficial from my own personal experience. I think people would die or go back to more harmful substances if kratom is banned.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8319","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Todd Kemp","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 59 years old with a hip replacement and degenerative back disease.

He has been on a life long search to find something natural that will help relieve stress and help with his chronic inability to sleep.  This has accomplished both for him.  \n\nI myself have used it for stress relief and pain relief and have had very good results.  I like the idea of this being a natural product, and not to have to take over the counter pain relievers.   \n\nKratom, in my opinion is not a drug.  Also, you do not get a \"high\" from it, so to speak.  The best way to describe the benefits would be to think in terms of having a bad day or a good day.  When you have a standard \"bad\"day, you feel stressed, or down.  Everyone has them,\nThe next day, you may have a good day.  You're up, happy and feel good.  This is how Kratom can make you feel.  Its a mild difference, and it doesnt affect your daily routine.  You're fully functional and clear headed.\n\nWhen reading about how much this has helped so many others, I would hate to see it banned by the DEA.  I think the government should concern itself with banning the yellow and red food coloring that companies use in our food, and other harmful additives that have gone into the items people consume daily.  Especially in foods that are marketed to children.  There are worst monsters out there to battle.

Six years ago, I had a migraine attack that has never ended. Some days are better than others, some weeks and some months. There is no cure for migraine disease. Im on a constant journey to find better ways to manage my pain. \n\nI believe in a mix of medication and self-healing measures, such as yoga and meditation. I also believe that its not good practice to rely only on one medication for pain management. My headache specialist and I have agreed that diversification of pain medication helps to reduce the risk of dependence on any one drug. \n\nThis summer a friend of mine sent me an article from Vice News about kratom (http://www.vice.com/read/why-banning-the-controversial-painkiller-kratom-could-be-bad-news-for-americas-heroin-addicts), a natural substance known for its pain relieving qualities. Could this be another way to manage my pain? Maybe this would replace or cut out other pain meds that I use. I took to the internet to obtain facts, check on addiction rates and understand how to ingest kratom. Here are some of the facts I found that made me decide that I would try kratom as one of many branches in managing chronic pain.\n \n\tIt is known to be a natural analgesic, muscle relaxer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant (https://www.kratomscience.com/kratom-legality). I currently three medications that address these issues.\n\tAccording to Kratom Science (https://www.kratomscience.com/2015/07/31/kratom-evaluating-the-perception-of-a-controversial-drug), an important distinction is that unlike other administered drugs such as oxycodone and morphine, kratom exhibits less dependency and addiction potential on the user. Over the last 6 years of using Percoset, I have only needed to increase the dose once to 7.5mg as my body had adjusted the prior dose and was not finding relief in a smaller dose of 5mg. As mentioned previously, I am very cognizant of not becoming too dependent on any one substance and believe that diversification with kratom can be beneficial to my pain management plan. \n\tVice News reports that it is used to wean addicts off of heroin. \n\tThose with multiple sclerosis, back pain, chronic fatigue syndrome and Lyme disease have reported relief when using kratom. \n\tThere have been a limited number of deaths attributed solely to kratom. Only 15 reported in the last 10 years. The majority of overdoses where kratom is present, other drugs and alcohol were all contributing factors.  Unlike opioids, kratom does not suppress the breathing function, which is an element of overdosing. \n\nThese findings led me to try kratom. After trying different strains and dosing, I can say that my pain level decreases with use. I have not found any medication that completely takes away my pain. Kratom definitely knocks my pain down a few levels and gives me about 4-5 hours of relief. I found that it gives me a little boost, allowing me to be more productive. I have been pleased with the results and it is a great addition to my pain management tool box.  \n\nOver 100,000 Americans signed a petition (including myself) to halt the DEAs two-year ban on kratom. During the temporary ban, the DEA would conduct studies on this natural supplement. To me, it makes more sense to conduct studies and then come to a conclusion on whether or not to ban kratom. It clearly helps at least 100,000 manage their pain in an era where taking any type of opioid is completely taboo. People with pain matter. Completely blocking access to kratom will have a direct impact on those who responsibly take pain medications to deal with a chronic medical issue. \n\nIn conclusion, I urge the DEA to halt the ban until further studies can be performed. I believe that I represent the majority of patients with chronic pain who use opioids. We are responsible and educated. Yes, there is an opioid epidemic in this country. However, taking away a natural supplement that could replace an opioid as pain management doesnt make any sense. \n\nSincerely,\n\nKatie M.

My friends treated me like I was nearly dead, and didn't come by to talk to me, fter a while they didn't even call. I got depressed, nobody wanted to be around me, I even felt like life was over. I got to a point where the psychological pain was a s bad as the back pain. I felt like an old man, which I am, I knew I had to try something different. So I talked to my doctor. He told me about Kratom, he said he couldn't prescribe it but told me I could get it on the internet. He told me that some of his patients had told him about it, and that he'd done some research on it and that it wasn't any worse than the pills he was prescribing and that I should try it. He told me there were others that were in the same boat as me and this had worked better for them. So here I am and I am better.

I represent parents in dependency cases, wherein their children have been taken from them.  And I represent children who have been taken from their parents.  I have lost two close friends to prescription opiates.  I have served as a justice court judge and as a criminal defense attorney.  I firmly take the position that criminalizing another plant will not make our society safer in any respect, rather, it will create simply another layer of criminality in our overburdened system.\nPersonally, having suffered from acute and unrelenting spinal and muscular pain for years, as the result of a minor car accident, I regularly consume speciosa as a tea for relief.  There is no 'high' feeling, all my other sensory perceptions remain keen, yet it helps take the edge off of the sharp pain.  \nThe mere fact that this remarkable plant has several chemical components to which humans are able to respond, alone, should keep it from being listed as a schedule 1 substance.  Medical value, research value, even its likelihood for abuse, should all be enough to keep it from being made illegal in the blanket form that schedule 1 results in.\nAs humans, as a species, we should be able to use the plants and materials which the earth and God have provided to us, to heal ourselves, if any healing propensity is offered.  To do the opposite, to relegate natural tools to a scheme which criminalizes their mere possession and use, dooms us to remain uneducated and ignorant, and to continue to harm ever greater numbers of people in the never-ending enforcement and this quest for ignorance.\nPlease consider the good that this plant does for so many people suffering from pain, as well as opiate addiction.  Please allow speciosa to remain legal as it has been for centuries.  Even if it were shown to be harmful in certain circumstances, humans should be allowed access to the plant, if for nothing else but for its medical and research values.\nSincerely,\nJohn Perlman","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6430","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Perlman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has changed my life.

With Kratom, these undesirable effects are, at most, annoying and uncomfortable; outside of this, they are of little consequence. With moderate usage, these negative effects can be avoided entirely. \n\n\nI do not support the scheduling of Kratom. There is no scientific evidence supporting its scheduling, and hundreds of thousands of hard-working, dependable contributors to society will be left without a safe, very effective option to manage their own pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue if it does become illegal to possess or consume.

I am 38 years old and work in the service industry and have done so for the past twenty years. I am a type two diabetic and suffer from nerve damage in my hands and feet resulting in moderate pain and discomfort, especially while I am working. I have been prescribed many different drugs to treat the pain with little relief. Year by year it has become worse, forcing me to work less and less. I was introduced to kratom about two years ago through an online forum while researching my options to treat my nerve damage and my life has improved significantly ever since. It allows me to get through a shift at work without suffering as much. Nothing else has come close to providing me relief. If kratom becomes a scheduled drug, there is little hope that research will continue that may lead to new, safer medications. I hope my testimonial will help to put kratom in a positive light. Without it, my life would be much more difficult. I oppose the scheduling of kratom, as do tens of thousands of other, hard working Americans. Please consider us as you move forward. It is a safe and effective option for myself and others seeking alternative treatment. Thank you for your time.

I have also never had an issue with getting sick as result of taking it, nor has any one side effect even come close to that of an opioid pain killer.\nKratom has been a great tool in my fight to keep living my life relatively pain free and with a positive attitude.

It will only cause suffering. Kratom is not dangerous. It cannot be overdosed on. It is far safer than prescription opioids of all types. \n\nWhy not help  fund studies of it? -  Allow citizens to make an informed choice to participate. I certainly would participate if offered the chance. There are obviously many scientists / researchers interested in studying Kratom. So now you want to make it impossible for them to continue? How does this help people? If your daughter were in pain and allergic to other opioids or just couldn't handle them or didn't like the side effects and found relief , benefits, no harm with Kratom would you want her LOCKED up for that?

I have never experienced any negative effects from kratom. I was definitely on a path to self destruction before kratom. I have not once had a craving or urge to take any sort of opiates since. I strongly believe that kratom could be the answer to the opiate abuse problem in America as well as the future of the treatment of pain.

Being frustrated with not being able  to even take care of my own house, cook &a clean for my household, I started to look for so,etching natural to help with everything else I was doing .  I brought every essential oil, tried all sorts of supplements , even ordered tea from china!  Literally!.   I never quit looking , eventually I ran across a post for kratom and once again gave something else a shot.   After a few days I noticed that while combining kratom with my daily routine of things, I was able to better cope with things, I felt it truly gave me a spark of energy.   There is absolutely nothing \"high\" about this plant.  It only has changed the way I live on a daily basis!  I cry at the thought of it being banned and going back to days being spent in bed.   Please don't ban this plant that has given me the ability to be a productive member of society again.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5498","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Jurgens","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W\n\nI am a 25 year-old Cornell Masters student and have been using Kratom for about a year now. A friend who has experience with the plant for many years first introduced me to Kratom. Originally, I would drink a bit after a night of drinking to curb the hangover and feel like a normal productive human again, but overtime I have found that Kratom is an excellent supplement in other arenas.\nI have ovarian cysts, which manifest into painful, debilitating periods. For years I would have to take a day off work or school because of the pain. Kratom is a lifesaver in mitigating the pain, and allows me to resume life as usual.  I no longer miss class, or a productive day of work due to period pains. I have about 4 grams of red-strain Kratom at the onset of pain, and in a few minutes it goes from debilitating pain to discrete and manageable. \n\nAs a professional and student my days are incredibly long, and tiresome. After a full days work, I need to change gears and study. Kratom is an incredible study supplement and helps me re-focus my brain, and utilize my time productively. Its subtle stimulating effects help keep me awake, without the negative side effects of taking a stimulant drug. \nLastly, and most importantly, I no longer drink alcohol the way I used to prior to Kratom. Instead of having a beer at night, I just take bit of Kratom to wind down. It was not purposeful; I just enjoy the way Kratom makes me feel (productive and relaxed) over alcohol (reckless and bloated). The effects have been amazing. I lost weight as a result of not drinking alcohol (I was 20lbs overweight last year), I spend less money (Kratom is significantly cheaper), and my days just feel more full and productive. \n\nThat being said, I, along with this entire community would feel robbed if Kratom is no longer available. As an American, I am proud of the freedom granted to us, and the ability to form communities such as this one. I believe the DEAs responsibility of reducing the availability of illicit substances is important, but not relevant, nor warranted in the case of Kratom. Further regulations are not only monetarily costly, but costly to the reputation and efficacy of the DEA. As an American citizen I expect the DEA to control substances that actually cause harm, not vice versa. If the DEA continues with scheduling Kratom than the organization risks losing its credibility and trust with this community, and greater American community.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12710","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 27 years old and I live with Fibromyalgia and Deteriorating Disk Disease. I wake up in pain, every morning and I go to bed in pain, every night. My only salvation has been Kratom. I did not take the decision to try Kratom, or any other medication, lightly. My past treatments have included pain medication, years of physical therapy and countless medications approved for Fibromyalgia. These medications have caused side effects that I am unable to live with. \nAfter weeks of research, I decided to purchase Kratom from a reputable company. This began my very first day of true relief. If you don't live with chronic pain, you cannot know how beautiful the experience of a pain free day is. I had gone from thoughts of suicide, due to overwhelming pain and helplessness to being a productive member of society, again. I was able to return to work, continue my passion of making music and starting being with friends and family, again. None of this would be possible, without Kratom. \nI understand, that some people have trouble with Kratom. I understand, some have experienced addiction issues. I also understand that people can become addicted to anything, coffee, food, exercise, etc. I'm asking that we do not take away from the many due to the problems of the few. There are far too many people who are still living happily on this Earth, due to the amazing effects of this plant. If it is taken away, too many will suffer in pain and too many lives will be lost to depression and PTSD.\nThe big question is, \"does the benefit outweigh the risk?\" The answer is clearly, yes. Sinply put, the risk is small and the benefit is enormous. To those of us in pain, this is one of the most important decisions of our lives. Please allow consenting adults to continue making this decision on how to treat their own pain. We will continue to stand up and fight for this right. Please, stand with us.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14547","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rose Katchmore","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"more reasearch","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18139","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Wesley Hoffman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I, like many Americans recently, have been frightened and paralyzed with the realization that we, the people, are being taken advantage of by corporations and by our government.

I urge you to think of it as the \"reverse coffee\", whereas coffee gives you a slight boost of energy, Kratom simply gives you a bit of relaxation without impairing judgement, motor skills, causing a \"high\", or any other hallmarks of dangerous drugs. \nTo ban a substance simply because it is not well understood is not the purpose of the DEA, they are in place to protect us from the kinds of things that destroy lives and not herbal supplements that simply improve mood. \nThere is also anecdotal evidence that Kratom may help with the withdrawal effects of dangerous opiates, and provide an out for those who are struggling with addiction, and in the face of the heroin epidemic that is coursing through our cities this may be a useful tool to repair lives and communities effected by opiates. \nIn short, it is not dangerous, it is not addictive, it is not cultivated by dangerous cartels, and it does not ruin lives. It should be legal just as caffeine, nicotine, ethanol, are.

I tried to get him into therapy but he didnt feel that was what he needed to help him although he desperately wanted out of his addiction. While searching on the internet he found kratom and started using it.  I can tell you that it absolutely helped him kick his heroin addiction. He has not used any opiates in more than a year. Sadly, he now has hep C from needle use.  I feel if he had known about kratom's ablity to ease pain before being introduced to heroin, he would have never used and would now not have hep C. I think about all the kids in our community who have died from heroin overdoses and how if they had only known of this alternative, they might be alive today. I have a coworker whose son died 2 months ago. I cant imagine the pain she is experiencing but realize how close i came to losing my own son. Please do not criminalize kratom.

I use no illegal drugs. Saying kratom is an extremely dangerous drug is absurd. I've had a worse time from drinking too much coffee. Kratom has a mild relaxing yet stimulating effect, and I've found it has helped at times when I'm depressed or using too much alcohol. In my experience kratom is not habit forming. \n\nMillions of Americans suffering from chronic pain, anxiety, fatigue, and depression have found that kratom has changed their lives for the better and allowed them to stop using prescription drugs. Many, many opiate and heroin addicts have been able to stop using because of kratom. In Alabama, opiate deaths doubled after kratom was banned. I KNOW there are people in America who will, without a doubt, resume using heroin if kratom is banned. In a nation where over 40 people die of opiate overdose every day, we should not ban a mild substance that can help these people. Scientists are already speaking out that banning kratom will stifle or stop completely ongoing research on the medical potential of kratom.\n\nThe DEA's attempt to schedule kratom a few months ago with 30 days notice shows that you have learned nothing from the failure of the war on drugs. Your notice of intent, published in the National Register, is full of lies and misrepresentations. You state that kratom poses an immediate and serious public health risk. This is false. You state that kratrom has been involved in deaths, overdoses, and increased numbers of calls to poison control centers. In every case, those who died with kratom in their systems also had: benzodiazepines, methadone, fentanyl, etc. in their blood! Hmm, was it the kratom that killed them, or, I dunno, the FENTANYL?? 660 calls related to kratom to poison control centers (per the CDC)- most were minor, and 660 calls consist of less than one hundredth of one percent of calls.\n\nPlease do not schedule this life saving, natural, harmless substance. It can help millions. I don't want my country going down another road of banning a useful and mild natural plant that can help people.

I was prescribed Ativan but made me so tired I wasn't capable of doing much other than sleep. I felt terrible about having to leave my job, and was sure I would need to apply for disability, which can take years to be approved. Since starting Kratom,  I not only got my job back but got promoted twice in the last year. In addition, I've been able to take charge of my personal life and finances. I can now live my life productively instead of wanting to hide from the world. Please don't take that away from me and the many others that now have a better quality of like because of this plant.

However, when I moved to Brooklyn and found myself surrounded with a legal and accessible way to feed my opiate addiction, all the hard work that I for had suddenly been reversed. \n\nI started making excuses to feed this addiction, the amount of Kratom that I regularly take exponentially increased, I have been unable to keep my finances in control, and it has had negative effects on my physical and mental health.\n\nI know people who do find benefits to using Kratom but I also know that there are people out there, such as myself, who had control and lost it because this substance is readily available.\n\nI  do not believe Kratom should be judged to have no use as a medication for addiction but there should be recognition that the substance is addictive.

I have been in my field for 18+ years as an Engineer and now leadership. I am a dedicated father, Grandfather, and Husband. I am writing you today to tell my story and to plead with your agency to not schedule Kratom. I am a diabetic and also suffer from acute gout and nerve pain. I started using Kratom about 6 years ago as I was heavily addicted to pain medication because of my issues that I suffer from. It was madness. I depended so heavily on the Oxy type prescription drugs 4-6 times a day to deal with my pain I suffered from. I did this for a few years till it started affecting my job, my family, my entire life. I was a zombie with the scripts. Very bad time in my life. I had to do something so started researching alternative medications 1. to kick the habit 2. to deal with my pain. I was introduced to Kratom and it has changed my life. I got off the prescriptions and was able to live a normal life because of kratom. I consider myself a successful middle class American who works hard 40-50 hours a week in a professional job. Im responsible for a team of 11 people in a very technical environment. I use kratom now full time and I couldn't do that on the Prescription medication. I have 0 issues today. Kratom has not only cured my pain but it has helped me live a healthier life. If Kratom was bad enough to schedule it I wouldn't be able to do the job I do. I would be the same brain dead person I was back when I was on the prescriptions. It can change lives and help people live normal lives. Im a true testament to this. Not only has it helped me but I have also helped others with Kratom who have suffered in the past like I was. \nIn closing if you schedule this  plant as a narcotic you will affect so many lives in a negative way. I appreciate your consideration and hope you see the true value of this medicinal plant.\n\nJames Turner","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6008","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Turner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been with my wife for 6 years.

It's a natural botanical like any other, very similar in taste and smell to green tea, that helps calm my nerves and relieve some chronic gastrointestinal issues from which I've suffered for years. Because of these health issues, I often have a hard time eating or, when I do, I feel ill afterwards, which drains my energy and makes it difficult to do my job effectively or engage in other activities like going to the gym. When I drink kratom tea, however, my pain goes away, I get a boost of energy and focus, and I'm like a whole new person--and there's not a single negative side effect that I've ever noticed!\n\nKratom has been so helpful, in fact, that I find myself needing it less and less, though I always keep it on-hand in case I have a flare up. All the way around, this natural botanical has been highly effective in helping me to improve my quality of life and overcome various health conditions from which I've suffered, and I know many others who have similar stories of healing. Kratom is a plant that grows in the wild, not a \"drug.\" It's a gift from God, and I'll be damned if an entity like the DEA tries to take it away from me under the guise of \"protecting the public.\"\n\nWith all due respect under the law and the Constitution of our land, the DEA does not have the authority, under God or heaven, to prohibit this or any other plant from being grown or used by free Americans. So I urge you to stop this witch hunt against kratom, in the spirit of individual liberty that our forefathers fought so hard, many sacrificing their own lives, to protect. If this really is the land of the free, and our rights granted by God above as opposed to government, you will cease this crusade on behalf of not only the millions of Americans who rely on kratom, but for the sake of upholding your duty as protectors, rather than transgressors, of our Constitutional rights.\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17310","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern;\n\nAs someone who has seen the epidemic of opioid addiction, to hear that there may be a very helpful solution gives hope to so many people.

My name is Rebecca Prince, I am turning 21 in 3 months, and I am a child/senior caregiver. I have had Osteogenesis Imperfecta type 1 since birth, when I was younger the aches and pains from many fractures and sprains were easily  subdued with AdVille and homeopathics like Arnica. In November 2012 I started becoming weaker, I developed anxiety, chronic fatigue, depression, I stopped enjoying other people's company, so I began to stay at hone more my symptoms became stronger and stronger as time went on and I eventually became hospitalized for a blocked airway.  In the next 3 years I had 7 surgeries to open my esophagus, and in march of 2015 I received a diagnosis of Wegener's Granulomatosis. Immediately I started treatment, a daily high dose of steroids, and 2 infusions (Rituxan and 1000ng Steroids) 2 weeks apart, the treatment caused higher levels of anxiety, irritability, chronic fatigue, etc.. A few weeks after the treatment My cousin, while researching an alternative to coffee that doesn't have the crash, came across kratom. He shared it with his father, my uncle, a retired sheriff in Union county NC who was run over and injured on duty in a hit and run in '91 and never accepted narcotic pain medication, since he and his wife began taking taking kratom 1 year ago they are both peacefully leading pain free lives. Since I began taking 4-6 grams daily I no longer feel like the entire world is on my shoulders, arthritis  pain is rarely noticeable up to 4 hours after taking it.\n  \n          If the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine of the kratom plant are placed into schedule 1 controlled substances, my family will be faced with the decision to either retreat from the  pain free life they knew so fleetingly, or to become a criminal, a felon in the first degree.

After 2 years of using pain medication I became dependent on the drugs and I had to take more of the medication to have any relief,  besides gett8ng sick, I started to get sick when I ran out of my pain medication,  due to taking more. I heard of Kratom via social media.  Now after using Kratom for a year I feel great, no pain, and.mo withdraws when I run out of Kratom. Kratom smells like tea, it's even in the coffee family. Kratom should not be illegal,  in my opinion it's no different than someone drinking an herbal tea sold at a grocery store. There are so many herbal teas to help people sleep,  diet,  concentrate,  and even increase their sexton drive.  So in my opinion Kratom is no different.  Please leave this herb alone, it affects people differently just as prescribed drugs do. If people don't like it then they don't have to use it, and it's impossible to get high off of, I tried just to see if what people have said is true , I only got sick and puked and wasn't high. So if it helps people to get off heroine or opiates then great! Let people make their own choices, people don't need laws and government to protect them from their own choices. Keep Kratom legal!!

I have found kratom to be an irreplaceable aid to the symptoms of acute withdrawal, post-acute withdrawal syndrome, and its related symptoms such as anxiety and sleeplessness. If kratom is banned, that would leave millions of former addicts no choice but methadone, suboxone, or the most likely scenario, a return to the street drug heroin which many use to alleviate their withdrawal suffering in the first place. I personally was lucky enough to discover kratom 3 months after abstaining from methadone, and suffering from 27 days without sleep. A ban on kratom would, in itself, present a MAJOR crisis in public health because people would have no real alternative but hard narcotics, and street drugs.\n\n3. Several articles I have read indicate that many pharmaceutical companies plan on manufacturing the psychoactive substances in kratom for distribution as a treatment for withdrawal and other conditions which fundamentally voids the DEA's argument that kratom has no effective medical use at all. Kratom presents an affordable and safe alternative for maintenance therapy and a host of other conditions. Banning it would not only present a HUGE social burden on the public, but also cause former addicts and others to seek out more dangerous, expensive, and less available and/or effective treatments. \n\nThank you for your attention and consideration.\n\nSincerely, Scott A.

I suffer from multiple caused chronic neck/back pain stemming from stenosis, cervical and lumbar arthritis, degenerative disk disease, and more. I inherited this condition from my Mother. It is chronic and never ceases. Through the Pain Management group in my insurance (Kaiser Permanente) I was placed on a regimen of opioids that ended this last summer with 50mg Fentanyl dermal patch, and Percocet. The Fentanyl stopped working and I was told that is all I would get, and it will have to work. No real resolution or policy at all. Just fear and confusion from them. I chose to hard detox off the two opioids which I have been taking for over 10 years. It was a brutal month of July, and included a trip to the ER in the midst of it all. After that painful and awful experience I looked for any replacement pain medication and found very little. UNTIL, I found Kratom in an online search for alternative pain medications. I found a vendor and tried a small amount. The relief was almost immediate and immersive, with no discernable side effects. Period. I learned how to use a correct dosing and have been using it as my main pain medication since August this year. It is the ONLY actual substance, herb or otherwise, that has worked on my pain, AND anxiety. I have absolutely no side effects other than pain relief that encompasses every place I have pain on my body. My goal is to sincerely request from the DEA and other governmental agencies who have control of this substance to please look at testimony from many many people like me - voting Baby-Boomers who were thrown to the street by their insurance health systems if using an opioid with no replacement offered. Bad medicine and policy do not solve any crisis. This herb should be left alone and stay classified as it is - a helpful herb. Do not take it from a needy American public.

Back in late August, I was hit by a car while I was riding my bike from work. The doctors prescribed me Hyrdocodone for the pain, however i refused to use it due to the potential for addiction as I have a tendency to form habits with things like this.\n\nI turned to Kratom to help treat my pain, and it made it possible for me to go to work and do my job as a meteorologist with little to no hindrance to my work as a meteorologist.\n\nA close friend of mine who suffered a debilitating addiction to Oxycontin has been prescribed Suboxone to mitigate withdrawls. However, he is now trying to ween off of Suboxone and is struggling. In response to his struggles, he has begun using Kratom to help with the process to great success.\n\nI understand your concerns of addiction potential with this substance, and I am goign to be honest there is potential. However the addiction/withdrawl to this substance is mild compared to most other legal substances/illegal substances and is not at all life threatening. When I found myself forming a habit out of it similar to my coffee habit, I ceased use for a couple of weeks. The only withdrawls I suffered were mild insomnia and mild irritability that went away in a couple of days.\n\nFrom the research I've done the only time serious issues ever occured in anyone is for those who were abusing Kratom that had been concentrated. These people were not looking for a means to quit pills, but rather a new method to get high. Unfortunately this is something that the American People that are looking to get high will alway have. Making it illegal and criminalizing addicts will not at all help these people, but rather make things worse.\n\nFinally, the war on drugs has been a complete and utter failure. Marijuana has become mainstream and will continue to do so as more and more states realize the antiquated Federal laws no longer reflect the will of the people.\n\nIn short, prohibition has not, and will never work as evident by the 1920's/1930's, and the recent surge in legal marijuana. People will always find a way to get high no matter what you put on paper. What you will be doing by making this herb illegal is turning addicts to harder drugs and taking away a powerful medicine for those who actually use it for its intended purpose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15417","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zachary Savage","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped my mother with her chronic illnesses and physical disabilities.

While i served i injured my left shoulder.  I have had 3 shoulder surgeries to try to fix the issue so needless to say I have been on many different types of prescription pain killers.  Over the past 5 years I was on and off pain killers,  I eventually developed a dependency for them.  It got to the point where the pain pills werent even taking care of the pain I was in.  A friend told me about Kratom so I tried it and to my amazement, it eliminated my pain!  Not only that but helped me get off of the narcotic pain killers.  It didnt make me feel loopy or groggy like the pain pills did either so my quality of life improved drastically!  With Kratom I am able to work my job, play with my kids and do my daily activities, pain free!  If youve ever had extreme chronic pain you'll understand what a relief it is to not be in pain.  If you schedule 1 this amazing PLANT,  you will not only be making a huge mistake,  but you will be making the already terrible opioid addiction problem in this country even worse!  I believe more research should be done on Kratom before you allow it to be put in the same category as heroin and cocaine.  Youre supposed to serve the American public and keep them safe from dangerous drugs and I applaud each and every one of you and thank you for your service.

I have noticed that the more energetic strains of Kratom gently focus my attention without the ramped-up feeling of coffee, ritalin, or adderall.  I find it very useful when doing repetitive house chores, tinkering in my workshop, and while (computer) programming.  I experience none of the side-effects that I experienced from my prescription medication.\n\nI occasionally use the relaxing strains of Kratom recreationally in place of alcohol.  It is relaxing and mood enhancing without impairing judgement or reducing inhibition.  I experience no hangovers the morning after taking it nor do I experience any addiction-cravings if I go a week or two without taking it.  From an obesity perspective it's nice as well.  Alcohol and associated late night food gorging can lead to quite a bit of weight gain over time.  Kratom doesn't induce food cravings and it's essentially a calorie-free teaspoon of green tea mixed with orange juice.\n\nFrom a legal / criminal justice standpoint, our prisons are already full of non-violent drug offenders.  Surely our taxes would be better spent helping to rehabilitate the unfortunate few who become addicted rather than futilely trying to keep a relatively benign substance out of the hands of the masses.  We all know where prohibition leads; drug cartels, turf wars, unsafe adulterated product.  Today there are clean, reputable, respectable small businesses selling Kratom.  Taxation and regulation is a much safer way for the government to influence behavior than outright prohibition.\n\nI sincerely hope that you will not schedule Kratom.  This is a wonderful plant that helps countless people in many ways, without so many of the nasty side effects of the legal alternatives.  If you are going to schedule, please ensure that it is not Schedule I.  It clearly has many medical uses and these should be explored at the very least.\n\nThank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22827","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Kozak","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do enough research before banning another plant that can do good for many individuals.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12074","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kristopher Torres","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am not a user of Kratom user myself but the opiate epidemic is destroying many lives and families across our country and any possible alternatives we have needs to be thoroughly and seriously recviewed and considered.

My husband died four years ago from cancer. He was diagnosed April 20th and passed September 7th. I have a seven year old son who I raise by myself. When I was a teenager, I was first diagnosed with anxiety and depression. The doctors placed me on Xanax, Welbutrin, Paxil and Prozac. Each had their own reasoning why they didn't work, some even made me feel worse. The side effects from these pharmeceutical drugs were devastating. I gained large amounts of weight, was constantly tired to a point I would only stay awake to work or go to school, the anxiety worsened with some and stayed the same with others, I was a walking zombie. I made the choice to stop taking any prescriptions and my depression continued. I thought how I felt  was just going to be a way of life. When my husband passed away I went into a tailspin of deep depression. There were days at a time I couldn't leave my bed. My parents were caring for my son, who I tried to be strong in front of, but my heart was broken and my mind couldn't begin to function like a normal person. Time passed and I slowly started to put myself together. I went on a journey of herbal and homeopathic options for my imbalance. This is the point I found kratom. The overall feeling of wellbeing unexplainable and I stress wellbeing, not to be mistaken with a recreational high. I don't use it daily, just when I feel anxious or that creeping feeling of sadness that I am used to. There are no side effects and no withdrawal if I don't drink my tea. I gave doctors years of chances and genuine effort to produce results, not one pill worked for me. This herbal alternative did. Taking away a responsible adults alternative to prescriptions is tyrannical. I have used kratom for 3 years with zero negative side effects. I know first hand how helpful this plant is.

This happen because they fear the DEA and their state medical boards.  Kratom is being used to treat pain in people that have been refused relief by their doctors, who seem to have forgotten that relieving suffering is part of their oath to patients.  As I understand it, placing the plant extract in class one requires certain conditions to be met.  Number one, it must have no medicinal uses.  It does. Number two, it is required to have a high risk of abuse.  So far, it has not shown that property, either.  In fact, there is no reported addiction to the substance.  Many have used it to get off of opiates that they had become addicted to.  It has been used without any deaths, and few side effects.  As a past pain management practitioner and, now a pain patient,  I ask that you reconsider the temptation to classify this drug, placing it into a category that it does not belong.  Have pity on those of us that suffer at the hands of doctors afraid to treat us.

I have been following recent developments around the DEA's decision to classify Kratom as a Schedule I substance.  I find Kratom to be an interesting substance in the greater conversation around harm reduction, and I also find it deeply troubling that in the midst of an increasingly out of control overdose epidemic, there is support behind the tightest restriction of controlling a substance which has been shown to reduce the risks associated with opioid use. We are concerned about heroin, carefentinil, or U-47700 humans have continuously sought out opioid receptor activation in the pursuit of some sort of relief.  Law and interdiction have never been shown to produce outcomes which show health improvements, and only seem to net financial gains for law enforcement.\n\nWhy I am troubled, is complex.  I believe strongly that the continued involvement of law enforcement as a way to combat substance use has had limited efficacy in the promotion of safety in the US.  Folks have used illicit substances for the duration of our nation's history and use greater and more varied novel agents, likely due to the criminalization of more standard drugs of abuse.  Individuals who are addicted to opioids continue to find themselves with fewer pathways to harm reduction, and illicit heroin/fentanyl (you can barely separate the two anymore) production continues to increase in risk to customers in that market at an alarming rate.  The plant, Kratom, has been used for thousands of years in south east Asia, and remains a common social, medicinal, and performance enhancer in such countries as Thailand and Malaysia.  Use of this plant as an alternative to illicit and pharmaceutical opioids has been shown much less adverse effects on breathing, and is unlikely to cause overdose.\n\nI am by no means advocating for kratom to replace medication assisted treatments like methadone or buprenorphine or other evidence-based interventions, but I certainly think that if someone can transition off of riskier drugs onto something like kratom, I would support it whole-heartedly.  Many of the newer synthetic agents we are seeing in street drug use carry much higher risks.  When compared to fentanyl, heroin or even pharmaceutical opioids, Kratom does not come close in terms of risk.  We have people who have been electing to shift from a dangerous, unpredictable, and increasingly uncertain illicit drugs, as well as those choosing to self-manage pain as access to pharmaceutical sources have become more expensive and tightly regulated due to fears of misuse.  \n\nRegarding the 660 poison control cases: An average of 110 cases a year may sound like a lot, but it's not. It represents about 0.004 percent of the 3 million or so calls received by poison control centers each year. By comparison, exposures involving analgesics accounted for nearly 300,000 calls in 2014, while cosmetics and personal care products, cleaning solutions, antidepressants, and antihistamines each accounted for more than 100,000. This does not mention that two-thirds of the cases were deemed \"minor\" or \"moderate,\" while only 7 percent (eight per year) were described as \"life-threatening.\" The CDC noted a single death in six years, \"reported in a person who was exposed to the medications paroxetine (an antidepressant) and lamotrigine (an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer) in addition to kratom.\n\nRegarding the 15 deaths: The DEA's list of other kratom-associated deaths primarily described polypharmacy as a factor in those fatalities, many of which involved benzodiazepines, sleep-inducing hypnotics such as zopiclone, and opioids such as fentanyl.\n\nKratom results in microscopic rates of poison control calls compared to OTC analgesics or household cleaning products.  This drug which, when (and only when) combined with known killers in and of themselves such as fentanyl, alcohol, and benzodiazepines, has resulted in 15 deaths in a 2 year period. This drug holds the same possible side-effect profile as most non-classified, common drugs which many of our patients, family members, friends, and ourselves take regularly.  Caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and acetaminophen each pose a greater public health concern\n\nThis action will drive self-managers back into more dangerous markets. The expense of trying to access buprenorphine services in can be cost prohibitive and is more difficult to withdraw from. Treatment providers as a community have taken many great steps to address the risks associated with opioid use.  It is a dangerous mistake to disallow people the liberty to make reasonable decisions on their own behalf.  There is no evidence that kratom is contributing to overdoses, or that children are suddenly more at risk for opioid use or dependence.  The treatment community is far more concerned with heroin, fentanyl, and pharmaceutical opioid use.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0419","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Hogan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe that Kratom as a non lethal substance has no business being illegalized. \n\nI think it is irresponsible to keep free citizens from exploring substances as long as they are not infringing on the right of others, especially if said substances could even remotely have a health benefit or therapeutic effect.\n\nThe American People Deserve Extensive research and education and the right to vote, before anything is decided to be not allowed by the peoples government, furthermore Americas decisions effect the world and its future.

Though I was raised by parents with high moral standards, I fell victim to drug addiction during my freshman year in college at the age of 18. To make a long story short, after years of battling with opiates, doing poorly in school, and going to rehab several times, I found kratom. I am happy and proud to say that it has helped me get my life together. I have a degree in biology, and a degree in chemical engineering, graduated top in my class, and now hold a job and am looking to get married. It sounds like a fairytale but it is true and I thank god and kratom for bringing me here. After discovering kratom, I conducted my own supervised research under a professor at my school, and we found the plant to be very benign and not toxic to tissues at all. Although we did not perform psychoactive tests with it, it is commonly known amongst kratom users (like myself) and the scientific community, that the effects of kratom do not resemble a \"high\". It just fills the void in my brain which has been either genetically predisposed or damaged by previous drug use without causing a craving, high, or painful withdrawals (the withdrawal is nearly non-existent if using plain natural leaf). I believe the current push to ban Kratom will only hurt America more. this is due to many points. First, kratom is used by many to wean off of or stay off of opiates. This is the biggest reason why a kratom ban would be bad in that many people will turn to fill the void with more harmful substances (such as oxycodone or heroin). This will directly result in an increased presence of criminal drug trafficking and associated crimes (murder, theft, etc). Not to mention the hit to the labor force, when good people turn into addicts or go to jail because they turn to other things. That leads directly to the issue of overpopulated jails with people that are not criminals. As a country of the people, by the people, and for the people, our founding fathers would have frowned upon the degree of control certain laws have over the basic lifestyle choices of an American citizen. Most people use kratom as a source of medicine. Some battle with chronic pain, depression, anxiety, addiction, and the list goes on. Others like myself have found a safe haven in kratom to treat our ailments without needing pharmaceutical products. Many of the pharma products either do not work, or have adverse side effects including addiction (oxycodone, amphetamine, xanax). Kratom is in no way on the level of these deadly drugs. How can we schedule a benign plant which helps millions reasoning that it is a public health threat? Can we all see the evidence that this plant has indeed acted alone in harming or killing anyone? How about we compare the harm that many other legal products cause when considering giving kratom schedule 1 status. This really is so illogical to classify kratom with such vigor as to resemble it to heroin. I would just like you to ask for credible evidence from the DEA as well as evidence from other respected scientific institutes before we come to such a harsh decision. When the people and country suffers as a result of these policies, the blame will be on the lawmakers. The DEA has crossed the line with this tyrannical style of policing. They need to review the facts themselves, and let the people have their say as well. As a citizen of the country I demand to be shown the facts, and the pro and con arguments before a decision is made. Making biased decisions that affects the lives of many sounds a bit anti-democratic if you ask me (or any other person). I would highly appreciate it if you took the time, and better yet took some action for the right cause. Thank you for reading my story.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nKarl Sola","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10211","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Karl Sola","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you DEA for letting me tell my story and what kratom has done for me. \n            First off I was diagnosed with epilepsy 11 years ago when I was 21. I also injured my ankle doing forestry work at 19. I found a Dr. that prescribed me a pain medication that was listed as nonaddictive, and after taking this medication I found out that this was inaccurate, well before the pharmaceutical companies confirmed this.\n            Anyways, I was put on other medications by other Dr's that were suppose to help with the addiction from pain medication, but did not, and eventually I found out about kratom. I was finally able to get off of those controlled, addictive, substances and kratom made this possible. Not only this, but many of the medications prescribed by my Dr's made my epileptic seizure symptoms worse. As soon as I started taking kratom my epileptic symptoms practically went down to nothing. It has helped with my depression, anxiety, and my anxiousness. \n              I know lots of other people, friends, family, and stories of people online, that have had similar experiences with kratom, and the help that it offers.

I have been using kratom for two years. It helps me get through my day which requires hard physical labor. I also workout so my back and joints are really bad. I've had close people in my life lose their lives due to opiate overdose. No one has overdosed from kratom. I understand there have been 15 or so deaths with people who had kratom in their system, but none of them overdosed strictly on kratom. It doesn't cause a person to be high or impaired, it just helps take the edge off by elevating mood, alleviating pain, and lessoning anxiety. It will not totally 100% make mood, pain, and anxiety become perfect, but it helps enough to get through each day without turning to other addicting drugs that lead down a darker road. No one is asking you to keep something legal that is harmful, we are asking you to do research on this plant and find out for yourself. You have the resources and power to determine that. If alcohol, tobacco, and pain killers are legal, kratom is nothing as far as they are concerned. It doesn't even deserve to be considered in the same class. Thank you for your time, I really appreciate you taking time to do proper research to help so many people that steer clear of drugs and alcohol and use a natural plant. Your decision to postpone the ban shows a lot of understanding and proper usage of power on your part.

I began using kratom to relieve withdrawal symptoms. For the first time in years I was able to get through the dreaded first week of opiate withdrawl. I was able to eat, hold down fluids, and get must needed rest. After 10 days free from opiates I stopped kratom and can say I did not have withdrawals. I am living a drug free life today because of this Miracle herb. If I would not had kratom I would still be using. I noticed while taking it less is more. If I tried to get \"high\" while using it, it would only make me tired and have little effect on my withdrawal symptoms.  The only reason I can see why kratom would become controlled is because it takes money out of big pharmas pockets by putting a large dent in the opioid epidemic.  People are finding their freedom from dangerous chemical drugs with this herb. If substances such as alcohol are not only legal but widely advertised, why would kratom be banned? Coffee is addicting but yet sold on supermarket shelves. Multimillion dollar company's pedal tobacco which kills uncountable people every year... yet it's my right as an American to light up whenever I want.

A friend of mine told me about Kratom. It didn't make the process easy, but it did make it manageable. I actually kinda disliked Kratom, and didn't find it \"rewarding\" at all. But it does profoundly reduce opiate discontinuation symptoms. It enabled be to step away, without cravings, and not get terribly sick. Period.\n\nI was able to drop the use of Kratom, in a very linear fashion, over a very linear amount of time, to a tiny amount. And then I stopped. The color returned to life. My love for my hobbies and family came back.\n\nI don't consume Kratom recreationally. For me, it was a helping hand.\n\nIt took nothing, and gave me back everything.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9110","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"J ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is not a time for further prohibition.

I have used the dietary ingredient kratom for about 2 and a half years, and I feel it has benefitted me tremendously. After being prescribed opiate painkillers numerous times for a variety of injuries, it became addictive to the point where I would go to the doctor even if I didn't actually need prescription level pain relief to aquire them anyway. After being recommended kratom by a coworker, I tried it and found it helped with the cravings completely, negating the drug seeking behavior I had started. I don't actually feel intoxicated as I do with the pain pills, but it seems to fill the emptiness that a lack of opioids created after long term use. I think if people taking methadone and seroquel tried this all natural remedy instead, it could help them become independent of pharmaceutical companies completely. Please, do not ban this 'life-saver'. I have no doubt that many current users may relapse back to their previous 'drug of choice' be it prescription drugs or street drugs. Creating an epidemic of illegal drug use and possible overdose would be directly contrary to the very purpose of your agency, as I understand it.

I had several sports related surgeries as a teenager, and as a result of over prescribing of pain medication, I became addicted. I came from a middle class family with no history of abuse or addiction. I then turned to the streets and was purchasing drugs illegally. After much struggle, I gave up on my life and began doing heroin. I really wished that I would accidentally overdose and die. I was ashamed of myself and my choices, and angry that I had trusted doctors who helped create my problem. After going to an in-patient rehab and struggling to stay clean, I found kratom. Kratom keeps me off the streets and helps me manage any cravings I may get. I work a full time job and have a part time job which is my hobby. I would not be able to do this without the support of kratom. Kratom has been very helpful to me in ways that suboxone and other maintenance drugs have not been. Kratom is not a threat to the public or hazardous to peoples health. Kratom helps people who want to help themselves, and is a blessing to society and individuals.

I even wrote a senior thesis for my Economics degree that involved kratom, as a subject in underground economies. \n\nJust a side note: my primary possession in my thesis was the enormous benefit that the public would have from a public health position should Kratom be thoroughly researched as an alternative for opioid addicts, Alcoholics, PTSD victims, treatment resistant depression, and more. Also the forecasted tax revenue for States/ Federal institutions should this be added to an Alcohol/ and Tobacco type of tax classification. \n\nI am a small business owner, consultant, and on The Ohio State University young economics society advisory board and I am a responsible Kratom user. \n\nI have used the plant since 2011. It started as means to stop using pain medication. I underwent 4 foot/ ankle surgeries from 2010-2011 from a very bad wakeboading injury. I separated every major ligament in my foot, and nearly resulted in amputation. \n\nFollowing the operation, I was heavily reliant on pain medication, with a disturbing amount of encouragement from my orthopedic surgeon, as well as the entire medical community who worked together to help rehabilitate my injury. \n\nThis left me addicted to opioids. I was a person that I hardly recognized. I had thoughts, and urges towards the medication that was spiraling out of control. It wasn't until I was on the edge, and close to resorting to Heroin that I discovered this incredible plant.\n\nI used Kratom to wean myself away from opioids, with very minimal discomfort, and mental tourture. This saved my life. I still to this day use the plant 3-4 times a week when my foot pain is too much to bare. If not for this natural remedy, I would still likely be reliant on pain meds, and with the addictive tendencies I had towards that never ending \"dragon\" I would likely be dead. \n\nI have stopped using the plant for weeks at a time with literally no side effects/ or withdraw, except for a mild runny nose. There are times when I still crave pain medication to the point of torture, and Kratom completely alleviates those urges. I can carry on with my life, and producing to society without this metaphorical gorilla on my back that is opioid medication. \n\nI firmly believe this plant can cause a HUGE public health revolution in helping addicts everywhere. \n\nOne more note: I am from rural southern Ohio, where along with KY, and WV the opioid epidemic is unreal. Most of my classmates, and community peers are addicted, in jail, or dead. Every person that I have reached out to with intentions to help them with their problem by educating them on Kratom has been a huge success. \n\nAt first, the idea of people I know is \"oh sweet, just another high\". They soon realize there is no high, rather just no desire for Heroin. I have helped over 10 people in my community go from jobless, unhealthy junkies to using Kratom as little as 1-2 times a week when the urges come on, to productive members of society. As well as parents. \n\nMost use the plant for a short period, and eventually find they don't need it at all. I have never once had a craving for Kratom, in the 5 years that I have benefited from the plant. \n\nI also have had tons of lab work, fecal matter analysis, and closely monitored endocrine analysis and there has never shown to be a single negative impact from using this plant responsibly. \n\n\nPlease, I urge you, don't take this from my, and countless others who need this gift to avoid the devil that is pain medication/ opioids. I beg you. \n\nSincerely, \n\nJordan Glenn Dugger","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18691","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jordan Dugger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 35 year old, married, full-time employed mother of two, and I have been taking kratom to help with chronic pain and depression for about 4 months now.

If kratom is made illegal, thousands of people who can't afford healthcare, or who weren't getting help from  prescription drugs will be left with no alternative, or worse, committing illegal acts to still get the kratom.

I have been using kratom (Mitragyna Speciosa) regularly for about 2 years.  My use of kratom began as a result of my MDs urging me to make significant lifestyle changes and in particular, to reduce my consumption of alcohol, make significant changes to my diet and increase my levels of physical activity.  In addition to these issues I had been suffering significant neck and back pain due in part to stress and posture while spending long hours in front of a computer.  Researching possible solutions to back pain as well as alternatives to alcohol, I found kratom. \n\nUsing kratom not only curbed my use of alcohol and significantly diminished my back and neck pain, but served as a catalyst for my making necessary lifestyle changes which have seen significant improvement in my overall health in the last two years. I will not ascribe my improvements in body weight, metabolism, and mood directly to kratom.  However, my substitution of kratom for alcohol has substantially cut my caloric intake.  Kratoms pain-mitigating effects have contributed to my inclination towards increased physical activity and exercise. My mood and outlook on life have improved markedly since my use of this plant. \n\nPerhaps more importantly, and less subjectively, is that due to my prescription for cholesterol-lowering statin medication, I routinely undergo blood panel tests which include liver enzyme measurements in addition to lipid levels.  My most recent panels have had excellent results, in addition to improvements in my blood pressure and other indicators of good health.  In short, I conclude from this data that at the very least, kratom has not had a negative effect on my health.\n\nObjective data from numerous sources has demonstrated that the DEAs original charges against kratom were disingenuous and hyperbolic.  To date there has been not a single recorded death attributed to kratom. The 14 deaths cited by the DEA were instances of poly-drug abuse which included kratom, among far more injurious substances (themselves likely lower than the Schedule I suggested for kratom).  \n\nI feel that kratom should be classified as an herbal supplement, available to responsible adults.  To this end I would welcome measures of reasonable regulation, to include quality control and prohibition of the sale of kratom to those under the age of 21.  By cutting back on irresponsible marketing and distribution, significant potential harm can be reduced while allowing responsible adults to benefit from this plant.\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8662","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Johann Pautz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm writing to ask that the DEA not take Kratom away from those who need it by scheduling it as a controlled substance.\n I have personally experience that kratom  can be a great benefit to those suffering from opiate addiction.\nI have personally experienced that there are almost no negative side effects beyond what you get in a cup of coffee.\nPlease do the compassionate and right thing by leaving kratom unscheduled.\n\n Thank you for your consideration. \n\nTyler Limburg","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11962","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tyler Limburg","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\nI have never felt compelled to write an official letter to the Government until now.

I am not taking it now, because the availability seems to have take a nose dive since the proposed scheduling.\n\nHowever, I must say that Kratom helped me a lot with my depression and anxiety.  I just took a spoonful a day, and it seemed to calm my nerves and give me a brighter life outlook.  I was never intoxicated off of it, in fact, I don't think that is possible.  Just helped me to have a feeling of contentment really.  Nothing more, nothing less.  To be honest, it is a rather weak effect.  I can't imagine that someone could take enough of this to be dangerous, but I suppose anything can be dangerous in the right amount- even water.\n\nI didn't have any problems stopping Kratom.  I just stopped and started taking anti-depressant medication instead.  But I would prefer to take a natural supplement rather than pharmaceutical drugs, and to be honest, Kratom seemed to work better than the pills do.  \n\nI would like to supplement with Kratom again in the future, but not until all of this fuss dies down.  I started to feel like I was doing something wrong by using it, even though I don't really think I was.  I was shocked by the DEA announcement, because if you have used Kratom before, you know know how absolutely harmless it is.  I started to think \"I could go to jail for this??? That didn't make sense to me and after that I started feeling like I was doing something wrong by using it.  I didn't like that feeling.  I'm just your average every day 40-hour working middle class American.  I don't want to be involved in any illegal activities.\n\nIN conclusion, my opinion is that this is a natural supplement not unlike Kava, or coffee.

I would like to urge you not to schedule Kratom as a schedule 1 substance which would completely eliminate the possibility of further research into what is quite simply a miraculous plant. Kratom unlike other traditional synthetic opioids does not cause respiratory depression, which means that it is almost impossible to overdose from the plant itself. In the midst of a opiate epidemic, it would be irrational to ban a plant that has less negative side effects than traditional synthetic opioids while at the same time providing the same amount of pain relief. For Americans that want to tamper off from synthetic opioids this plant is as good as it gets. For addicts that are addicted to Heroin and other diverted pharmaceutical drugs this plant is as good as it gets. It is non mild altering, has a low potential for abuse and has several medicinal properties from my perspective over the course of a year of use.\n\nMy story pertains to head pain, I have gone through almost the entire list of medications from OTC to Dr. prescribed drugs including hydrocodone and nothing has worked better in my experience than kratom for severe chronic headaches/migraines. This plant allows me to function normally within society. I have a B.A. in Political Science and I'm in the pursuit of a second B.A. in information technology. This plant allows me to attend school pain free and function normally without suffering from impairment or intoxication that other synthetic opioids might cause. For me there is absolutely no euphoria yet it has the pain killing effects of some of the most restricted opioids. \n\nBanning this plant and the active compounds within the plant will no doubt cause direct death to many Americans in the United States as people use this plant as a safer alternative to more dangerous synthetic opioids and illegal narcotics such as heroin. Statistics are showing that although the DEA is making opioids much more restrictive and limiting the production of opioids, more Americans than ever are turning towards illegal narcotics such as heroin due to the fact that it is extremely potent and cheap throughout most of the nation. Comparing Kratom to Heroin is a travesty as it is not nearly as dangerous as the illegal drug Heroin.\n\nI urge the agency to seriously re consider a milder, safer, alternative to synthetic opioid medication. The potential for researchers and pharmaceutical companies to create a safer medication than the current opioids on the market must not be ignored from this plant.

I had been addicted to opiates/opiods for 30+ years. Up until Aug of this year I was on pain management using morphine,oxycodone,and fentynl until finally going on methadone for one year. I was tired ALL the time,gained weight,and had no motivation.  Then in late August I discovered kratom. I did much research not this plant before deciding 'what did I have to lose'? So I bought some and started my detox from 60 MG of methadone a day (down from 105mg). I found immediate relief. Though I still suffered minor discomfort ie.chills and sweats, I found it both tolerable and somewhat energizing. It took approximately 7-10 days before I was completely detoxed but I felt amazing. I published several youtu.be videos describing my progress. It is now November7th and though I still take a quarter of a teaspoon of kratom day,I feel that this plant changed my life. Not only did I not suffer horrible withdrawal symptoms but kratom has also helped I think my anxiety and bible polar disorder. I have noticed ZERO tolerance or withdrawal from kratom and the only 'side effect ',if you want to call it that, is for the first time in my life I have regular bowel movements! This has truly been a life saving plant. It also helps with chronic pain. Please research this amazing plant before taking it from the thousands of people it's benefiting!

I was recently introduced to Kratom while reading an online article about the proposed scheduling back in September. The article talked about the perceived benefits users of Kratom had, from pain mediation to weening themselves off of drug addiction. The issue was undeniably important to many people, so I decided to investigate the issue further and try Kratom for myself to see if there were any harmful effects. I obtained Kratom and tried it in a variety of dosages and times, to see how I would be affect and to see if I had cravings or possible health complications. I experienced none of these concerns.\n\nWhen I think of drugs that are already on class one scheduling, I can see the immediate harm they cause to users, their families and friends. That is the criteria I use when judging if something should be scheduled. Kratom fails to meet that criteria to be scheduled in my mind, and doing so does not do a service to Americans who find Kratom a relief in their life. I feel that Kratom should be researched more without a stigma of schedule one and I feel this would be more helpful than the current plan of scheduling it.\n\nI greatly appreciate the additional time the DEA has taken to review comments and concerns from the citizens of the United States.

I was put on hydrocodone. Within two weeks, I realized that while part of me enjoyed daily opioid use, it was not healthy, practical or sustainable. I was googling \"herbal alternatives to Vicodin\" the next day, read the testimonials for Kratom, and purchased the herb the next week.  It helped to relieve the pain, but left me with a much clearer head than the hydrocodone did.\n\nThe arguments against it are, simply put, bunk. Say there have been 14 deaths from people recklessly (and needlessly... High doses don't make you more \"high\", just sick) using Kratom. That's a generous figure.  In 2014 alone there were 14,000 deaths from prescribed opioids.  The DEA is citing an average of 100 calls to the cdc's poison control regarding Kratom per year (5 year period). If that doesn't seem like much, it is because it isn't, particularly when you consider there are 1,000 calls placed PER MONTH regarding the ingestion of laundry detergent pods (how is that possible!?).\n\nThe former attempt at scheduling was just another example of greed and corruption (big pharma) ruining our political process:  So... We hear you've found an alternative to the $$$ prescriptions that have killed 165,000 Americans in the past 15 years?  No problem... We'll just have our friends at the DEA confiscate it. \n\nIf you want to take steps to regulate kratom, I would understand prohibiting the manufacture of pills, the sale of kratom \"drinks\", tinctures, etc, and placing clear age restrictions, but outright prohibition of the plant itself is senseless and not at all commensurate with the minimal harms posed by this substance.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\nEd McCourt\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9812","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ed McCourt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is jodi and I am a kratom user.  4 years ago, I was a very lost alcoholic who wanted to die.

I am a professional in the health field and have been suffering from severe depression and anxiety for years. I have been very close to suicide multiple times. I am still able to work but the disorder is extremely debilitating and I can understand why people stop functioning or commit suicide. \nI have been on several different types of FDA approved medications and therapy for years. I get mild improvement but continue to spiral downward. My brother had introduced me to Kratom a few weeks back and I reluctantly started taking 1 tsp in the morning. I am not saying that this is a miracle \"drug\" but I noted that I suddenly felt clearer and hopeful and actually elated. My husband has noticed a huge difference in me. I am smiling and actually laughing and feeling love for my family and profession. I cannot believe the incredible fast response, without the side effects of these darn SSRI meds that I am on.\nI am aware of the close call with the withdrawal of this plant from use. I don't understand where this is coming from. I live in a state where marijuana is legal. Alcohol, tobacco is also legal, and I can imagine the thousands of deaths that have been caused by these legal drugs.\nI hope that the recent awareness of this supplement, may can start a discussion of researching the benefits of the plant. I know now there are many studies about marijuana and its benefits.\nPlease, please, PLEASE reconsider your decision and really look rationally into the benefits.

Kratom isn't A drug or A opiate. Kratom is an herb native to Southeast Asia related to the coffee tree. According to A poll, the average Kratom user is over the age of thirty and uses Kratom tea as an herbal remedy to help with managing pain. Other uses for Kratom are to  help people manage anxiety, depression, insomnia, acne, Increased sexual performance, Calming of opiate withdrawal, Anti-oxidant cell protection, and Overall immunity boost. Kratom users are responsible American citizens that pay our taxes and vote. We are generally over the age of thirty and use Kratom tea to help manage pain, anxiety, insomnia, depression, et cetera. In A society that has A legal market for alcohol and tobacco that kill 580000 annually in America alone. I believe that it is fair and reasonable to allow kratom users access to A legal market to buy kratom. I personally use Kratom tea to help me manage pain from sport injury, help me focus, reduce my anxiety, and help me sleep, and reduce my urge to drink. I used to be an alcoholic that could drink more than A fifth of 80 proof liquor in one day. I have been diagnosed with insomnia, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. I used to take dangerous addictive medications like adderall, and xanax. I have been able to get off all my medications using Kratom with guidance from my doctor. My doctor thinks using Kratom tea to help me manage my anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, insomnia, and reduce my urge to drink is safe. I trust my doctor best when it comes to my own health. Before I started using Kratom I was an alcoholic that struggled finding and keeping work. I ate an unhealthy diet and almost never exercised. My sleep was poor, and I often woke up half way through the night at three am with about four hours of sleep. After I started using Kratom I was able to tolerate my alcohol withdrawals so much better I was finally able to quit drinking entirely. I started to eat A healthier diet, and started to exercise very seriously. I was able to cut out cable television, video games, movies, steaming services like Netflix, and pornography almost entirely out of my life. I let go of my ties to toxic neurotic people in my life. I now run marathons regularly, eat A really healthy diet, work fifty hours A week at A warehouse, sleep like A baby, have my anxiety handled, and am able to focus crisply without distractions on one task for long periods of time. I credit Kratom for helping me make many life changing transformations in my life. Kratom needs to stay legal and available for people like me that have had addiction problems in the past. For the wounded veterans that struggles with pain management, and uses Kratom tea to help him manage his pain. For the heroin addicts that can overdose on the growing more popular fentanyal laced heroin that is really easy to overdose on because fentanyl is about one hundred times stronger then heroin. For the people that have bad anxiety and are on strong medications like xanax to medicate their anxiety. I was one of those people. I used to be prescribed xanax for anxiety. I have quit using xanax, and only use Kratom to help me manage anxiety. For the people that struggle to juggle three jobs with children. Kratom can be A lifesaver herbal remedy for someone that has to work three jobs and take care of their kids. For the hardcore insomniacs that can barely sleep at night. Kratom can help them without all the risks and addiction potential of benzodiazepines and ambien. Kratom is an amazing, beautiful, miraculous, benign herb. It helps too many people, and is too safe to be taken off the legal market for responsible adults. A lot of us use kratom, myself included to quit hard addictions to drugs such as alcohol, or opiates. It would be A true travesty to make Kratom illegal or make Kratom alkaloids scheduled narcotics when alcohol is very clearly I would say one hundred thousand times more dangerous then kratom. I was an alcoholic for ten years. Alcohol retards your brain, alcohol is unhealthy for your liver, can sedate your breathing to the point you can overdose and die, You can die from alcoholic withdrawal if your body's homeostasis with alcohol is disturbed enough, alcohol can debilitate sexual performance, alcohol reduces the quality of rapid eye movement sleep, alcohol contains cancerous chemicals, alcohol can increase risk for high blood fats, et cetera. Bottom line alcohol is A very dangerous drug that our society treats like it isn't A hard drug. Kratom is A miraculous herb that helps the three to five million kratom users in America. I believe it to be unfair to ban Kratom when alcohol is legal and available. Alcohol is poison. Kratom is an ancient plant. I hope you understand where I am coming from. Please, whenever you do work on kratom live your life to your highest values, and honor your highest self. I'm confident you will.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4897","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Barnes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This plant has been used in Asian medicine for thousands of years on a wide variety of ailments.

I have been taking kratom for the past few months and have found it to be very effective in lifting my mood and alleviating my depression, without negative side-effects. Prior to trying kratom, I had been unable to find anything that provided this to me without other serious side-effects or risks.\n\nKratom's effects, for me, have been mild. I do not experience euphoria, and do not believe that this product is in any way similar to recreational drugs.

These compounds, and the plant from which they are derived, have shown promise for weaning individuals from opioid addiction and for non-addictive management of pain not resolved by non-opiate medicines. I am aware that instances of poisoning due to overdose have been reported. These have been small in number and mild in effect when compared to the many reports of overdose due to opiates including legal prescription opioid medications. Placement in Schedule 1 without solid scientific data will make research on effects and medical uses of this plant much more difficult, as it has for derivatives of cannabis species. This will likely make control of the plant and derivatives more difficult, as it has with cannabis.\n\nI have heard much cynicism about DEA's use of an FDA review of medical uses of cannabis and derivatives as cover for refusal to reconsider Schedule 1 classification of cannabis. It's widely reported that DEA's original scheduling of cannabis was politically-motivated and premature. Placing cannabis in Schedule 1 drastically complicated and research on effects of and therapeutic uses for cannabis and derived compounds. Because of this, relatively little research has been done. Thus, FDA found little in the literature because studying the plant is so difficult - due to Schedule 1 classification. Meanwhile, FDA has approved generations of opioid compounds for pain alleviation despite the addiction and overdose risks. Addiction to legal opioids has become the addiction curse of our times. FDA may fall back on the clinical studies generated in support of these drugs. Real-world use has shown that the potential for addiction and abuse is huge, and the need for alternatives very real. Plainly numerous states and individuals disagree with the Schedule 1 classification of cannabis, and would argue that cannabis is less dangerous as a drug of abuse than FDA-approved opioid pharmaceuticals. \n\nMy advice: go slowly. Another instance of declaring a plant and its derivatives as \"no recognized medical uses\" despite all the anecdotal uses reported will only tar the reputations of both agencies further, and create further cynicism about the way that DEA classifies plants and their derived compounds. Let some pharmacologic data be generated before you make the final decision. At least then the medical/scientific community will be behind you. There are real dangerous drugs out there - cocaine, heroin, oxycontin... Save yourself the trouble with kratom until you know for sure you have to go after it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0454","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dennis Roscetti","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Greatings,\n\nI know that the government has nothing but safety in mind, however in this case Kratom is the safe option as opposed to other prescription drug that quickly build tolerance and lead to addiction.

I only use it when I need it, and I never have any problems if I run out, or stop taking it. Compared to morphine, it has none of the narcotic effects, but all the benefits I was looking for to control my chronic pain. Please, do some research before you make any legislation that could potentially have a negative effect across the nation.

I am a 34 year old wife and mother of 3. For years I struggled with pain so great that I couldn't work, I couldn't be active. Whenever I did have a busy day, I'd be down for days afterward. The Dr's had me on so many meds to treat my fibromyalgia, arthritis, spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease and depression. I always felt \"foggy\" and never really had relief from my pain. I always felt guilty, because I couldn't contribute to my family financially, and because I couldn't do things with my kids the way I wanted to. I was always saying, \"no, mommy can't, I\"m too tired\" or \"I hurt too much today\". I was always sad. \nI was told about Kratom in an online pain support group. After 15+ years of constant pain, I was honestly willing to try almost anything. Lord knows I wasn't getting any real help from anyone. So I ordered some, and I immediately noticed a difference.  I could literally feel the pain just seem to melt away. It was amazing! It also gave me a boost of energy. I got so much done around the house in the weeks and months following. One at a time, I weaned myself off of every prescription medication I was on (which I believe I was at 6-7 at the time I discovered Kratom), and I still felt better than I have in years. I finally felt like I was well enough to look for a job. I have now been working at that job for almost a year and a half now, and haven't missed a single day. I have been able to go on walks with my kids, and take them places. I'm not saying I never hurt, but it is SO MUCH better. I feel like a normal person again. The depression I fought so long with, is gone. I am HAPPY again! \nI can't even begin to imagine going back to that sad, painful life again. I want to continue to be a productive member of society, and the mother my kids deserve to have. I want to LIVE! If Kratom gets banned, so many people like myself, are going to suffer greatly. This is not a drug. I've never felt even anything close to a high. Just relief. Relief from the excruciating, CONSTANT pain I was in, for so, so long, and energy. I beg you. Please do not take away this plant. I do believe that if this is made illegal, it will have devastating consequences for this country.

Because of my uniformly positive experience with taking kratom, I am writing to voice my opposition to the DEA's proposal of placing kratom on the list of schedule I substances.

For years, I was prescribed various prescription medications, none of which alleviated my symptoms. In my mid-20s, I began to research alternative approaches to dealing with my symptoms, as they made it nearly impossible for me to work and go to school. After reading countless stories of peoples' success with using kratom to manage anxiety and panic, I tried it myself, and almost immediately I was able to begin functioning again with no adverse side effects. I have now been using kratom for seven years, and it has literally changed my life. Instead of being unable to get out of bed or leave the house, I can now live my life normallywork, sleep, spend time with friends and family, deal with day-to-day responsibilities, and enjoy everyday activities that had been lost to me due to my crippling symptoms.

The daughter of a friend of mine who had been through radiation and chemotherapy for esophageal cancer was able to quit taking dilaudid with the help of kratom. Her father, with the help of kratom, was able to quit hydrocodone he had been using for pain for 10 years. All of these people were able to avoid the difficult withdrawal symptoms that come from stopping opiates.  \n     Kratom, I believe, needs to stay readily available to all adults who wish to make use of the plant, and our country needs to foster more research into its benefits.\n     Thank you for hearing us out. \n      \nSincerely,\n     Lucile P.

I went to a reputable liberal arts university and was at the top of my class, but by the time I graduated I had very severe anxiety. \n\nI was caught in a bad cycle after graduating from university. I was only working low-level jobs, because my anxiety made it difficult (nearly impossible, even) to pursue something more challenging even though I knew I was otherwise capable of doing far more. Because these jobs didn't offer insurance and I didn't have enough money to pay for it myself, I was stuck without a viable solution.\n\nI sometimes turned to alcohol, though the effects the day after always negated any positive anxiety reduction and loss of inhibitions.\n\nA friend recommended kratom, but when I looked into it I was initially skeptical. I was reluctant to try anything that was associated with opiates, as I knew how destructive that class of drugs tends to be. \n\nEventually I decided to give it a shot because the anxiety was so persistent and I wanted anything that might alleviate it. I was surprised not to full a 'buzz' or anything of the sort when I first gave it a try.\n\nWhat I noticed instead was that it helped me to not fall into my anxious thought cycles. I felt healthy and motivated, able to socialize and accomplish tasks and work toward being my best self.\n\nI now take kratom 3-4 days per week, and it still helps me immensely. I run my own very profitable blog and also do freelance writing and business consulting on the side. This is a huge change from where I was even a few years ago, and I can attribute much of my success to kratom helping me overcome mental hurdles.\n\nIt is not by any means an intoxicating drug. It has helped me to focus, contribute to society, cultivate better friendships and romantic relationships, and be my best self. I genuinely fear what might happen if I no longer have access to this plant. Please consider the very real consequences this would have on people like me before you take the plant away.

Natural herbal supplements should kept legal unless proven without a shadow of a doubt to have grave and deleterious consequences throughout our soceity. Kratom has not only not met that standard but preliminary findings have shown it to have a positive effect for some people when dealing with pain and/or addiction. The only reason to rush to prohibit this plant seems to be to protect the interests of big pharma and the opiate/painkiller industry, which ironically, has been more effecive at creating addicts and has done more damage to our country then any drug dealer since Pablo Escobar. Our country is in the midst of an opiod epidemic the spans the legal market as well as the black market. If theres even a chance that Kratom could relieve that epidemic in any way then it needs to be thoroughly explored, not banned. Banning it will only make the illegal blackmarket dealers that much stronger and will push any legitimate scientific tests that much further back. History will judge you harshly if you put the interests of corporations over the interest of people, honesty and science. Thank you for reading this and thank you for the good work you're doing in protecting our society from the real drugs like cocaine, meth and heroin that have been proven to be without any positive use or value to our country.

Some may have combined it with other risky chemicals, but any harm incurred was caused by the chemicals it was combined with, rather than the kratom itself.  It has helped many people with many things as other herbal ingredients have, not to mention the benefits of coffee.  It is no more harmful to public health than coffee.  There is no potential for abuse.  People using it are productive members of society and the benefits of this herbal substance aid in their being so.  I had used this in 2013, and it would help ease tension and anxiety of daily living and it would also help me feel more motivated to get things done around the house and with my life.  This herbal is very unlikely to be any sort of gateway drug any more than coffee.  There are way more common and even legal 'gateway drugs' available, such as alcohol.  When I think of other legally available medicines or substances, the terms like abuse, dependence, or gateway drugs, seem very contrived, as many items available that actually do harm, like acetaminophen, alcohol, chemically infused cigarettes, are all readily available.  If someone is in chronic or frequent pain, do we say they have an ibuprofen dependence, habit, or are they abusing it?  People should have the choice to possess or use a harmless plant if it gives them relief or helps them function.  There is a health care crisis in this country now and an opiate crisis as well.

I have been going to a therapist and a psychiatrist on and off through the years and been on many different medications. \n\nSome of the medications that i started in my teenage years were highly addictive and on top of the issues that already made life difficult were made more complex by a substance abuse and dependency to the very meds that were suppossed to help me. \n\nI then later developed addictions to street opiates and then Suboxone. This combined with the benzodiazapines for my anxiety and the amphetamines for ADD made it impossible to live a normal life. I developed a psychosis and lost touch with reality. \n\nDuring my psychosis i would kind of black out and not remember days at a time. I also developed a fascination with fire and started lighting fires in the woods around my town. Eventually in one of my black outs i burned down a really big church in my town and was arrested. \n\nI spent 2 1/2 years behind bars, got 10 years of probation, and have to pay almost 8,000 dollars in restitution for what their insurance would not cover. Luckily the parishioners were forgiving of me and we have been able to move on and i helped them do a lot of work with the new building.\n\nWhen i was released from prison i knew i would still have my mental health problems to deal with but i could not take the addictive medications that got me where i am now. Then I heard about kratom. I bought some from a friend's recommended online vendor and i made tea with it. \n\nIt helped me in ways that i could cope more effectively with my illnesses. I am still on some Rx meds for my illnesses but none of the addictive meds that i was on before. It is not a replacement or treatment for my illness but helps me enough so that i no longer have the need for addictive drugs and i can start putting my life back together.\n\nIn the last year and a half since I was released from prison I started going to school for graphic design. I have been passing all my classes with A's and B's. I started making music again and just about to release a record. I have an interest in gardening and study exotic plants that I also run a website on. I draw again. I participate in life where before i could not function to do any of these things. \n\nI can't say enough how kratom has allowed me to put my life back together.

She then began to tell me about this plant and some of the things it had helped her with. These included Fibromyalgia pain and dealing with stress and anxiety.\n  After doing some independent research I decided to give it a try. It has helped me with my anxiety as well as alleviated some chronic knee and back pain. I particularly noticed that it helped with these things without any ill side effects. I ingest around three teaspoons a day, one teaspoon three times daily. I have gone off it from time to time just to see how I would feel without it.

I would like to share my experience with kratom.\n\nMy health is a very complicated issue. I have two autoimmune disorders and a spinal injury that causes chronic pain. I was also left with a painful birth injury along with postpartum depression after the birth of my first child. \n\nI was dependent upon opioids to function for many years of my life. In 2012, I was forced to leave a very successful career due to my declining health, a career that took almost 13 years to build. \n\nThe next few years after that are somewhat of a fog due to the strong painkillers that I needed to function. As time went on, the depression grew worse and I almost lost everything. Suicide was something that crossed my mind on a daily basis.\n\nAfter several surgeries and changes to my diet, I recovered partially and I learned to live with the pain. That's when I found kratom. With the help of kratom, I was able to discontinue opioids and I got my life back. I no longer struggle to function in an opioid fog.\n\nKratom isn't the dangerous substance that some make it out to be. It has never even made me feel that my mind was altered and it has none of the side effects that traditional opioids have. Kratom is just a supplement, a herb that is an effective tool in the fight against chronic pain. Kratom certainly doesn't belong in a schedule with heroin.\n\nScheduling kratom is a mistake and it would affect the lives of too many responsible Americans. If kratom is scheduled, I will likely have to go back to medication that I do not want to take and more importantly, my kids will only have an incomplete version of their mother. Please do not schedule kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21266","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been drinking kratom tea every morning for over a year now.

The back pain is so intense that I can't exercise much or sit too long. Sometimes I cannot sleep very well and the pain wakes me up early in the morning.   \n\nBecause the oxycodone that is prescribed to me is so tightly restricted and short acting, it has not been very effective in treating my pain. The half life of 3.5 hours is not enough for activities like exercise and walking that put a longer-term strain on my back, and the sedating nature makes me too tired to do exercises in the first place. Because of this, I encountered kratom while looking for something less restricted, less addictive, less intoxicating and longer lasting.\n\nKratom is therapeutically a miracle drug for me, because just a teaspoon of powder is enough for me to be able to walk more than 4 miles without having any back pain at all, and lasts more than 6 hours. When I use kratom for my pain I can function and perform daily activities without being too intoxicated or drowsy, and can focus just fine, enough to exercise and try to keep my sick body healthy. In fact, kratom also has anxiolytic properties which is very helpful for my anxiety. This is the reason that it is VERY important that you (the DEA) reconsider the scheduling from schedule I (high risk of abuse and no medicinal value) to a lower schedule, for example III or preferably schedule IV.\n\nJust because kratom is an opioid agonist doesn't mean that it is too abusable to be therapeutic. Recreational doses are very likely to cause nausea and therefore discourages abuse, while benefiting those who need relief from pain. The past week that I've used kratom has been the best experience in the recent part of my life and it would be a shame for this miracle cure to be stripped from myself and others who rely on it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12962","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ana Espinosa","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom's active ingredients bind mu-opiate receptors in the brain.

I was in horrible pain severely depressed quit school and  was barely able to take care of my four children. Quitting fentanyl by myself I would have killed me alone due to certain health problems, I felt like I was stuck on narcotics, I felt dirty kind of like a criminal. One day I was looking online for Alternatives in order to quit taking the medications and stumbled upon kratom I was very reluctant to try it didn't think it would work. Not only did it work,  but I haven't taken a pain pill in a very long time, I don't have as much pain as I used to, I'm able to walk up straight, and I'm back in school to finish my degree. I don't know what I would do if kratom   became  illegal or scheduled it would be devastating not only to me but to my family, and many many other people.

My name is Christy I am 40 years old a professional in mortgage business a wife and a mother of three. I was in a serious almost fatal car crash years ago and have suffered with pain since. I have had several surgeries including spinal surgery. I also have arthritis in my spine as well as all of my joints. I was basically in and out of Drs offices for years and was given narcotic pain medicine to help deal with the pain. Over the years my meds kept increasing and was put into pain management. I had so many different doctors for the different conditions and all of them continued to \"fix me\" with more medicine to deal with the pain. I couldn't get through my day couldn't even start my day for that matter unless I took those narcotics. Again over time the dose that was working before was no longer working so dose had to be increased. I thought well no one really knows I'm on this medicine I'm normal. It got to the point that normal actually was to me seeing someone getting up and doing something with their family or enjoying their day was hard for me to imagine how they did that without taking one of these little pills. I had lost so much weight and my family finally looked at me and said you've got to stop you are killing yourself I just didn't look heathy. So I started researching a natural remedy for my pain to get off the chemically induced pills that the Drs were prescribing and I found Kratom. It has saved my life not only has it helped me with the pain, but has actually healed me in some ways like I can crack my back and move my joints more than I ever could before. The worst and best thing was when I told my daughter I stopped taking that medicine and am using a natural remedy my daughter looked at me and said yes I can see a huge difference. You don't lay around on the couch all day and get up and do stuff with us. I cried because all along I thought I couldn't do anything without the pills but the truth was I wasn't doing anything because of the pills. I thought my children have no idea I'm taking this medicine, but they did and my daughter said yea I prayed you would not have to take those anymore. Please do not ban Kratom it has saved my life my family's life. I don't have to be weighed down taking all that medicine and continue to have to take more and more I take a little  Kratom and is all I need I don't need to take more and more because of it not working like the pills and I'm back heathy again I have a life and can't imagine what ill do if it is taken away from me because I can no longer go back to taking those pills that were killing me if I don't have Kratom I will not be able to enjoy my life with my children it is not harmful it's not chemically made and it truly heals from the inside. This is not a drug that kids are using to get high this is a plant that is needed for people like me a 40 year old professional mother of three that can barely walk because of the pain without it and was being killed by all of the horrible narcotic pills that are legally given by Drs. Thank you again for taking the time to read this...Kratom again has absolutely saved me please please don't take it away.  Sincerely,\nChristy L.

This herb has amazingly helped both my husband and myself to be more productive in our work, home and community. We both have degenerative issues and deal with severe pain daily. Opiates are not productive since many make you tired or too woozy to focus. Since taking kratom, usually once a day, at most two times, I've been able to put in more work hours, care for my elderly mother and help with community fundraisers such as church functions. I can't tell you how much this helps. I don't get \"high\" or loopy. It helps lessen the pain so I have a bit more energy and clarity. \n\nIf you do not have a chronic illness or live with chronic pain you can't begin to understand how much it interferes with your ability to function on a day to day basis. It feels like every nerve is on fire. People say \"just push through it\" and we try, but it's absolutely exhausting. You can't think straight, you make bad decisions. But with just a little of this herb in tea I can now work again. I worried what would happen if my 94 year old mom needed me and I was too sick to help her. I have more confidence now that I'll be ok. And when I'm in less pain I can work out more, have the energy to eat healthy meals, and do more to keep myself busy. \n\nBe aware that the only problems I've read about with this herb are individuals who were already on other opiates and then tried taking mass quantities of kratom. There will always be people who will take too much of anything. Alcohol is a much much more serious drug... it skews focus, distorts reality, eats at your liver and brain and there are no regs on alcohol. \n\nPlease keep this helpful herb in the marketplace. There is a good article in Scientific America and the possibilities of using kratom to help get people off addictive drugs. The state can tax this herb if it wants and reap the benefits of its popularity. \n\nThank you, Joan & Mark Stone, Statesville, NC","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20263","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joan Stone","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Andrew Rinne-Mignotte, I'm 30 years old and live in Burbank, CA.\n\nI'd like to voice my opposition to the DEAs Intent to Schedule the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which would make kratom a schedule 1 controlled substance with no medicinal value. This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\nI was once prescribed 240 (that's two hundred forty) oxycodone per MONTH by Kaiser Permanente (where I was also an employee).  Their plan was to keep me on this medication and increasingly stronger medications until I turned 65 when they would do a full knee replacement surgery.  Needless to say this was a horrible action plan and I let them know that it was a horrible plan, as that would have been 40 years of increasingly stronger opioid pain medications.  When I asked what happens when I build up a tolerance to the strongest one, my pain management doctor at Kaiser Permanente told me that they would then start rotating and COMBINING different opiod medications.  It was a dreadful plan that I was able to release from due to kratom. \n\nBecause of kratom, I was able to ween off of the oxycodone.  I no longer take it at all and I only use kratom to help with my knee pain.\n\nThe oxycodone was causing quite a few side effects, including lethargy, severe constipation, decreased sexual function and I was hopelessly addicted as well.\n\nThe kratom also has helped me with my social anxiety and depression and I am no longer on *any* prescription medications for any of these ailments (as of three years ago).  \n\nI've never felt better in my life.\n\nScheduling kratom is an irresponsible and hasty move.  There are no known incidents of harm/overdose from taking *just* kratom by itself (any evidence of death or overdose has always been in combination with multiple other substances that all interacted dangerously with each other).  \n\nThe human body will tell itself if too much kratom has been ingested because the person will get nauseous and possibly throw up (I personally got nauseous a couple of times while I adjusted my dosage to figure out exactly what was right for me, but it was a minor price to pay for the incredible relief kratom offers me daily). \n\nKratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. Im asking you to please sign the Pocan/Salmon Dear Colleague letter in support of kratom.  \n\nI fear this action by the DEA--which has been irresponsibly made without any public comment period and without any serious review of the available scientific data on kratom--will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic. I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without kratom and I do not know how I will continue to work in my new career of diagnostic ultrasound without either taking kratom or taking absurd amounts of dangerous prescription pain medication.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nAndrew Rinne-Mignotte, RVT\nandrewrinne@gmail.com\nMobile: (818) 398-1375","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20737","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Rinne","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I first heard about Kratom from the news reports back in September 2016.

I am a 39 year old female, US Army Veteran, mother of 2, full time Assistant Lab Manager at a small Neuroscience Research lab, and fianc to a wonderful man. I am writing this to respectfully request the DEA/FDA not place any of the alkaloids found in Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) on any Scheduled drug list. \nDuring my active military service, I was involved in a training incident that left me with a lifelong chronic back injury that I will always need pain relief for in order to function as a productive member of society and have the quality of life we all deserve. I was medically discharged after 2  years of service. A devastating blow since I had planned on a career in the Army. I was studying to be a helicopter pilot, hoping to continue in a medivac unit like the one I was in. \nA recent MRI has shown Osteoarthritis, Degenerative Disk Disease, bulging disks, spinal stenosis, multiple internal hemangiomas and a Tarlov cyst in the right SI joint. From this I often suffer from pain over my entire back and hips, sciatic pain in both legs, pulled back muscles and am now nursing a shoulder injury. I have been on and off of many pain medications for the last 20 years. When I was young and more resilient, I could go significant lengths of time without medication, but still suffered several instances of complete back failure, where I was unable to work or function without physical assistance for a week or more at a time. I was lucky that I had an excellent support system. As I age, however, my ability to rebound has been significantly reduced. My pain is constant. I was prescribed Hydrocodone/APAP 5/325 about two years ago from the VA. In that short time, my tolerance has nearly quadrupled. I feared where it was leading me. I dont want to be a statistic. I dont want to be tethered to synthetic opioid medications that are known to be addictive, damaging to the liver/kidneys, and potentially deadly. The thought of that being my reality for the rest of my life is terrifying!\nI heard of Kratom a month before the DEA announced its intent to emergency schedule it. I was intrigued but skeptical. I work in the sciences, so I studied it, trying to figure out what would indicate the need for emergency scheduling. I was unable to find one significant concern. When the Intent to Schedule was reversed, I took a leap of faith and ordered some. I cannot sufficiently describe how glad I am that I did. Since starting with this simple, natural plant product, I have reversed my opioid intake back to my original levels and plan to taper off the remaining doses over the next two months. I have had no withdrawal symptoms other than RLS from the sudden reduction in hydrocodone. My pain is minimal though still present, and my OIC is no longer a problem which is a bonus I hadnt expected. I have never experienced the high that the DEA claims it causes. The one time I took too much the sensation was unpleasant (dizzy, shaking, wobbly eyes) and definitely not something anyone would intentionally go looking for, but I never feared for my health or safety like I did with opioids. With the right amount of Kratom, beyond pain relief, Ive regained a clear headedness and energy level that the prescription meds took away from me. If a medication causes exhaustion and lethargy when it is supposed to be improving ones quality of life, it isnt really doing its job and its time to find something that will.\nThe risks that Kratom poses are minimal when compared to other legal substances. There has been no loss of life from Kratom alone and a relatively low number of calls to poison control centers when compared to products like alcohol and tobacco. Even soap pods are more dangerous than Kratom if you are going to use that as a measure for risk assessment. Of the deaths where the individuals had Kratom in their system, it is unfitting to suggest Kratom was at all involved without knowing the exact levels of all compounds found. It may just suggest that they were trying to get off the drugs that ultimately killed them by switching to Kratom and had a relapse. If true and they had been off for a while, it is reasonable to suspect that they took the same amount of their drug as they had previously, which could absolutely cause an overdose. The worst that can happen if too much Kratom is ingested is vomiting, which will remove it from the system leaving you with nothing more than wasted product. As for the addictive nature of Kratom, while I have not tried stopping it, anecdotal evidence suggests it is typically no worse than caffeine withdrawals. That is a risk I am willing to take.\n It is time for our government to start letting the American people manage our pain and health as we see fit. Please do not ask me to go back to that life on legal drugs that I despised and feared. Please keep Kratom legal and available for all.\nSincerely,\nAmanda Newingham","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4679","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amanda Newingham","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a miracle plant that helped me transition off of medication and live healthy.

I have been on antidepressant for over 15 years, and have had horrible withdrawal symptoms every time I've tried to stop them. My daughter was in a car accident in 2004 which crushed her pelvis and she has been on opioids for chronic pain, she decided it was time to try to get healthier and have a better quality of life and started doing research. Thus, she and I were introduced to Kratom. I weaned off of my antidepressant and began using kratom occasionally for stress reduction. I take a very low dose and have found that it keeps me calm and helps with the withdrawal symptoms and depression.\nOn the other hand, my daughter has a new leash on life, she is using kratom for pain and withdrawal from opioids, I have witnessed her being able to be out of bed and interacting with the family! She isn't curled up in pain, she for the first time in many years feels like she might have a future! It is a blessing and a miracle that I attribute to kratom!

What always made me relapse are the terrible withdrawals that come after one quits taking the pills. I would get maybe a couple days into detox and not be able to take it anymore and just relapse, almost without even thinking about it, like it was automatic. \n\nAt a loss, I began doing research into Suboxone and Methadone. Before I was able to find a place to go to get these meds, I stumbled upon Kratom on a self help addiction website. I looked into it, saw that it seemed relatively safe (when compared with Fentanyl, Norco and Percocet, Methadone/Suboxone) and it was pretty affordable too. Plus, it was just a leaf powder, from a tree. I prefer the more natural side of medicine, so I decided to give it a try. I flushed my stash of pills down the toilet the day the Kratom arrived in the mail, because I knew if I didn't I would never get sober. I took my first dose of Kratom about 6 hours after my last pill, and within minutes I began to feel better. There was no high, none at all, but there were no withdrawals, either; and that was that, I have been using it ever since and have not had a single relapse. That was two years ago, and I am still as healthy as can b expected for an ex pill addict. The Kratom doesn't cause any constipation or itching, no high to speak of other than a light coffee-like lift first thing in the morning. All in all I can't really say anything bad about it, a few of my friends have begun using it and it works for them too. We can hardly believe that a leaf from Asia could be our salvation but it is  and we are so, so grateful. \n\n\nI ask that you do not ban Kratom because in this time of massive opioid addiction I truly believe we should be considering our options, not banning them. SO many people, including me, will be negatively impacted by a ban of Kratom. I know in my heart if it was banned many, maybe even me, would relapse and eventually die of an overdose. I know it is popular among chronic pain sufferers as a natural method of managing pain symptoms, and I think that is great! The fewer people on the pills for pain, the fewer pills on the streets killing people and causing people to get addicted. Most of the people I know who are addicted to pills got that way because they were prescribed them for a real pain issue, me included, I broke my hand and was prescribed Percocet and later Norco. Had I of known about and had access to Kratom maybe things would have been different for me. For all of us. \n\n\nPlease do not ban this valuable medicine. Regulate it, fine. Monitor it, Ok. But an all out ban would hurt a lot of people and make a bad situation much, much worse. Kratom saved my life. Please do not take it away from me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5910","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Mencis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":4,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please see attached comments submitted on behalf of the Botanical Education Alliance (BEA).","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22898","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Botanical Education Alliance","postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 24 year old male who has recently graduated and am currently starting in the workforce. I am a productive member of this society and have good values. I have a loving family, friends, and a life that is better than anything I could ever ask for. This is what I am thankful for this holiday season. During the last years of being in high school, I hung around friends in the inner city who, as I look back at my life, should have not been around. This coupled with the fact I was uneducated about opiate drugs and come from a family who always told me to just say no, I found myself overweight, unhealthy, and addicted.  I did not know my purpose in this life and needed guidance. I decided to get away from the situation and move to Ohio University to start college. After three years of seeing doctors, therapists, and being prescribed suboxone, I knew I needed more natural ways to help with my problems. I am constantly reading online so it was rather quickly I noticed kratom being mentioned frequently. I decided to give this a try. From the experiences I read about I knew the transition to a healthy life would not be easy but I stuck it out threw the sickness and forced myself to eat healthy, exercise, and work hard to change myself. During this time I felt almost like an epiphany happened to where I knew I was on to something that will help me to change my life for the positive. I lost over 60 pounds, stopped smoking tobacco, exercise daily, and now am even getting the ladies attention which feels so good that I cant even begin to describe. I made it threw college studying hospitality and restaurant management all while working 30 hours a week and have a support system that always will be there for me, I am completely honest to my parents about my struggle and they know the impact this journey has done for me. I am thankful for the fact that I found this and know it does have the potential to help with the opiate epidemic our country is facing. This herb has not cured me by any means, but rather helped me on my transition to becoming a better version of myself. I still struggle daily but now have a glimpse of hope and confidence I am moving in the right direction. I do not think children should have access to this in the same way I do not think kids should be able to purchase huge cans of energy drink poison. I want to thank the DEA for reconsidering its intent and hope that science will guide in the right direction.

I am a 35 year old white female. I am a traditionally published author (fantasy fiction). I have worked in the past, full-time, for a multimillion dollar online clothing company as their Editor-in-Chief. I handled all social media, blogging, and creative needs. I started using kratom over three and a half years ago because of anxiety. I've dealt with depression and general anxiety for as long as I can remember and I have never been able to find anything that has ever worked, except for kratom. When I initially heard about the potential ban, I cried. I've tried every drug on the market ... nothing but horrible side effects, weight gain, expensive bills (I don't have insurance because I'm a freelancer) and now that I *have* found something, the DEA is taking it away??? Why? This makes no sense to me. I use it responsibly. I've never used drugs in my life. I've never even had a speeding ticket. I abide every law. I love my children, my life, and this country. I thought we lived in a free country, and in a free country, it should be up to its citizens to decide what they put into their bodies. This is a natural substance. Marijuana has just been approved for recreational use in several states, but the DEA is about to ban something that is harmlessly being used to HELP people combat things like mild anxiety?? It's as harmless as valerian root. St. John's Wort can be dangerous when taken with SSRIs, but it is still allowed on the market, but kratom posses a problem? This is heartbreaking. I don't mean any disrespect, but the evidence that is being put forward in order to ban this substance (it is not a drug) is a joke at best. It can synthesized into a drug, but as of right now, it's an old remedy that's been used for thousands of years, and that's the extent of it. \n\nPlease, please don't do this. I don't generally beg for things. But you're going to risk lives by taking this plant away. I don't use it to keep from using drugs, but there are thousands of individuals who do. I know a great many from interactions on forums who do. Alabama's recent death toll is a great example of this (I'm certain someone has linked to the articles on this). Don't let this become a nationwide tragedy just because a few people had a panic attack over some misinformation. The war on drugs has proven an international failure. Europe is already pushing to end it. We're already on the verge of freeing ourselves of the countless deaths that it has caused since its inception. Billions of dollars of American taxpayers' dollars are being spent incarcerating men and women needlessly, instead of building programs to help educate and rehabilitate drug addicts. Please, don't further the problem by banning yet another substance and creating yet another black market. Kratom will continue to be sold and used in the united states. You are giving the cartels more weapons by doing this. You are handing them inventory. They will celebrate this. I'm not trying to be rude or derogatory. I'm trying to be as realistic as possible. Forget lobbyists. Forget the politics of this. Forget the mainstream media and the social media of this, ask yourselves as human beings, do you really think, personally, that this is going to do anyone any good? Is this plant as evil as it is being made out to be? I could go out to my backyard and find no less than thirteen plants that could induce hallucinations, seizures, a coma, or even death (my husband and I also own and run a commercial landscaping business--we know plants). If someone wants to 'get high' from a plant, they are going to do it. You can go from one plant to the next, from now until eternity, and you will never outlaw stupidity. What you can do, is put your time and effort into providing free rehab programs, free drug counseling, etc. Look at ending this war, not continuing it. \n\nDon't ban kratom. Don't continue this madness. Too many people are using this to keep from using dangerous synthesized drugs that they started taking because of other natural substances that the DEA have already banned. Just, stop. Look at solutions. Don't simply say 'no.' Don't just come to the public with problems. Come to us with solutions. Right now, all the DEA does is come to the public when they see that the public is doing perfectly fine, they take away whatever is making them perfectly happy, then leave them with a huge problem that the public is left to solve on their own.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20112","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I personally do not use kratom, but after hearing Chris Bell's talk on the benefit's of this natural plant, I think it is crucial that we keep it legal!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15022","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern, \n\nI wanted to share a little bit about my positive experiences and outcomes related to oral kratom consumption. I first tried kratom when I was about 21. I had struggled with mild substance abuse in my past, including substances like marijuana, painkillers, and alcohol, yet felt no desire to use kratom on a ritualistic basis. I could simply take it as needed, and leave it in my closet for weeks or months without thinking about it. I would use it on and off from that time until the time of writing this when I am 25. So far, the benefits I have seen are extraordinary. I can't stop telling my friends and loved ones how much potential it has, but I am becoming worried about its future. \nMy dad, my sister, and myself all suffer from extreme allergies. We are constantly blowing our noses, with tissues always stuffed in our pockets and lying about the house. Once I take a small dose of kratom, about 3 capsules worth of around 2-3 grams, my allergies completely subside for the majority of the day. I have tried so many different allergy remedies and none have provided me any relief remotely close to what kratom does. I am continually astonished to realize it is no coincidence. My sister has noted the same effect. I only wish my dad were around so I could have given him some. \nFurthermore, I suffer from some pretty erratic digestion issues. I often used to have to go several times a day and the consistency of bowel movements were often irregular. I notice that whenever I take kratom, the bm's become much more regular and healthy. \nAnother effect I noticed is that it is an enjoyable high but one that is mild and does not beg for me to keep taking it. I have found it is most enjoyable in low doses, where my concentration is improved so I can work on my college coursework. I am able to complete daily tasks without worry of being heavily debilitated. \nLastly, I have noticed how it addresses anxiety issues within myself. I am a very shy and introverted individual that struggles to make simple conversations with people. I do not believe in dangerous pharmaceuticals to aid me with this struggle. Rather, when I can turn to a plant instead and only in times when I deem necessary, I immediately notice a relaxation that helps eliminate worry that could get in the way of me communicating my thoughts in a smooth and friendly manner. Even when somedays when I have an anxiety pit in my stomach and it persists throughout the day, once the kratom starts to kick in it remarkably vanishes.\nI have heard countless reports of how many lives have been positively affected by kratom usage. I think its important that people begin to take another look at not only how it can help people, but at how much better and safer it can be than more conventional medicines or highs. I urge the DEA to truly consider what the people are saying and conduct research to help us all find out what this remarkable plant has in store and if it really possesses anything to warrant the extreme accusations the DEA made when first proposing an emergency scheduling. Thank you for listening to this one man's voice.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21167","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jared Walker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"kratom has allowed me to get off powerful prescription opiates and it is a safe alternative to treat pain.

It eases any cravings I might have for opiate pain medications. It seems counterproductive to restrict a substance that has little possibility of addiction, or harm.

Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\n\n2. If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\n\n3. Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n\n4. Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n\n5. Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n\n6. Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\n7. (and politically important) Since no-one really knows how Kratom actually works, or why, or if it causes non-trivial harm, pre-emptive banning of Kratom just looks like the DEA is pandering to Big Pharma to conspire to eliminate actual and potential competition to Big Pharma's commercial position with its drug products. This will only inspire more distrust of Government. Since the DEA has already lost most trust and credibility, can the DEA really afford this?\n\n8. (and perhaps most important) Kratom may not actually be a \"drug,\" in that like Cannabis it is not a mono-molecular chemical with one simple metabolic action. Kratom may be more of a psychedelic with complex interactions with multiple metabolic and psychological processes, with outcomes as much or more dependent on user-preconditions than on the \"drug\" itself. Perhaps this kind of nuance and complexity is outside the ability of the DEA's operating paradigm to grasp, in which case the DEA should revise its conceptual basis and enter the exciting new world of dealing with complex non-linear open systems with emergent properties and events.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14880","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alexander Carpenter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\"Hello my name is Dakota.

I work from home raising my son and writing freelance articles and novels. I struggle with scoliosis, tendonitis (in my wrists, from typing), and depression. I've taken many steps to remain healthy. I dip my hands and wrists in paraffin wax at night, and use an ergonomic mouse, keyboard, and desk chairs. I exercise at least twice a week at the gym, and rarely drink alcohol. When the pain in my back, neck, or shoulders becomes too much, my doctor typically prescribes me Hydrocodone, Tramadol or Naproxen. It helps a little bit, but it also makes me feel \"out of it\" and woozy, and worried about functioning properly.\n\nOver the summer, I tried Kratom for the first time. I typically mixed a teaspoon or two of the powder in with my fruit smoothie. The results have been terrific. Not only does the pain in my back, neck, and wrists go away--enabling me to write with full strength--but it helps with my anxiety and depression, as well. On the days that I don't take it, I have never personally experienced any unpleasant withdrawl symptoms. The only side effect I've noticed from time to time has been constipation, which I treat with magnesium supplements. Otherwise, Kratom has been a complete blessing in my life. It doesn't make me feel \"high\" like the prescription opiates do. I feel capable, relaxed, and pain-free. \n\nI was very distressed to learn that the DEA may ban this plant outright without further research. Its consumption has greatly improved my quality of life, and hasn't harmed me in any way. I have not heard of anyone overdosing on it--from what I understand, it's impossible to do so. (source: https://www.kratomscience.com/2013/03/18/can-you-overdose-on-kratom-in-short-no/)\n\nFrom what I've read, it is far less dangerous than prescription opiates, and cannot accurately be categorized with them (source: https://www.zamnesia.com/blog-kratom-vs-opium-n425). Based on the opiate epidemic in this country, I truly believe that anything that might help prevent deaths from opiates, or help addicts taper off those drugs, while at the same time treating everyday people's pain in a safe manner, is well worth keeping legal.\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to read my comment.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSarah Skilton","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3307","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Skilton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom.

I'm physically handicapped from a accident 12 years ago and live with pain everyday. I'm prescribed morphine to manage my pain. I have been using prescription pain medication for years and have been addicted to opioids. I began using kratom 3 years ago and it 100% helped me manage my pain without prescribed opioids like morphine.\n\nI have detoxed several times since my accident, from multiple prescribed opioids before I learned of kratom. I finally got off prescription medication for good this year 2016, with the use of kratom. It definitely helped with the process of withdrawal. \n\nFor me, the difference is noticeable. Kratom has lessened my daily pain. Yes, I still live with pain, but it makes everything just a little more tolerable. I feel like I'm closer to living right. I have been using kratom multiple times a week when my pain cannot be ignored. \n\nIn recent years, Americans consumption of opiates has risen to epidemic levels. In 2012 alone, an estimated 259 million prescriptions for painkillers were doled out to patients by health care providers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, the CDC estimates 46 people die from prescription painkiller overdose every day in the United States.\n\nI believe access to kratom will significantly lower opioid overdose mortality rates. I feel kratom can help people overcome the negative side of opioid use with few side effects. \n\nThough more research is needed to form a solid conclusion, it's becoming more evident that for many individuals kratom can both alleviate painful opiate withdrawal symptoms and provide a safer alternative to dangerously addictive prescription painkillers.

My wife said \"I know. It just makes you an addict \" The prescription went away but the addiction did not. My sister told my wife about Kratom. This was in the year two thousand ten. My wife was able to overcome her addiction to opiates using Kratom. She also has passed multiple kidney stones and has used Kratom for that pain management too. \nOne of our sons broke a leg. His insurance ran out right before he could get a permanent cast. With zero insurance and zero pain control he started down a path that took him to eventually shooting up heroin. It's been a couple of years now that he's been off heroin and Kratom has helped immensely. You must reconsider this ban on yet another natural remedy. Please do not take this healing option away from us. It's not right and it's not fair. It's all about control and profits for big pharma.

It is a harmless plant that has not only done a lot of good for me, but many other people I know. I am a 43 year old health fanatic and am very cautious about what I put in my body. Also, I run my own business and experience a lot of stress and anxiety in my work day. Kratom is something which I have consumed for the past 2 years and it has been a blessing in reducing stress and anxiety without any negative side effects. I have also never experienced any addiction to it. Whenever I stop drinking coffee for more than 3 days I have terrible withdrawals and headaches. I have never had any withdrawal symptoms like this from Kratom. It has been a blessing in my life. I believe alcohol has 1000 times worse effects on my body than Kratom. Since I began taking Kratom, I have not had to increase the amount I consume to get the desired effects and I have really appreciated that. In the past, I used to reduce stress/anxiety by having a glass or 2 of wine a few times a week...but with alcohol I always experienced negative side effects like depression, increased physical pain in my body, hangovers next day, and even slight addiction to want more. When taking kratom, I have never felt any side effects like this. It has truly been one of the most positive things I have consumed. I barely drink alcohol now. Also, Kratom has been a complete blessing in reducing pain in my body. I herniated my L4-L5 vertebrae in my back over 15 years ago, and the pain can be excruciating some times. In the past, I have been prescribed opiates to help with the pain. Whenever I took them, I pretty much stopped immediately due to the negative side effects: such as nausea, extreme tiredness or lethargy, fogginess in my brain and bad constipation. I was also always concerned with their strong addictive effects, so I stopped taking them immediately. I have seen friends and family members get lost in opiate addictions and ruin their lives. When I started consuming Kratom, it reduced my pain significantly, while also lifting my mood. Its effects were just right, not overpowering, and allowed me to function during my work day both mentally and physically. To summate, it seems ridiculous to make this a schedule 1 drug. It has done wonders for me without any negatives added in my life and body. I am so happy to have found something that eases anxiety, pain, mood, and creates a sense of well being....but most importantly, without any side effects.

I'm currently at a stage in my life where I feel content with life and its current trajectory. However, it hasn't always been like this. I owe part of my success to Kratom. I really believe it to be a small miracle and that there is no logically-valid justification for it to be listed as a controlled substance - only to be, at best, regulated and gated by medical professionals.\n\nKratom is a substance that is barely dangerous by any stretch of the imagination. I've read that there is no respiratory decline on even high doses and I've experienced the same results in my taking it. Even if it were somehow dangerous why would it be any different than cigarettes or alcohol? Those substances are legal yet they kill millions. The response to these things being dangerous isn't prohibition but treatment and public knowledge transfer (ex: commercials outlining the dangers, etc.) How is it ethically or even constitutionally okay for a government to regulate what a person can and can not do to their own bodies? It is a victimless act. A victimless act that if the DEA has their way will become a victimless crime. Having a large amount of Kratom could be punishable on the same level as having large amounts of methamphetamine which I'm reading could be on the same level as murder (first degree in Ohio). That can't possibly be right. Large amounts of Kratom in just a few short months could damn a person on the same scale as murder.\n\nEarlier in my life I was addicted to Vicodin. I was arrested (July 2009) and given a felony because of that addiction. Thankfully I was given the option of treatment in lieu of conviction to 'seal' my felony from my record. In the immediate aftermath I was diagnosed with bipolar depression and anxiety. I was prescribed a few medications, completed intensive outpatient therapy, and attended AA / NA meetings. I still haven't touched illegal opiates since then.\n\nEventually I was able to graduate from college, land a great job, and finally move out and live on my own. I was achieving these major milestones in my life and you would think I had become a well-adjusted and happy young man, but I still found myself resorting to old behavior with something different - alcohol. Eventually that old behavior caught up with me and I was arrested again but this time for disorderly conduct. It was then that I realized that not only can I not legally use opiates and live a life that is potentially ruined by legal ramifications, but I can't drink alcohol because I act like an idiot when I do.\n\nFast-forward to a few months ago when I learned of Kratom. I actually only learned about it when the DEA made an emergency scheduling. I thought, \"what's the big deal? I've never even heard of it.\" I was fascinated by the stories I had read about the countless lives it had reached and saved. I researched its potential benefits and its potential detriments. I eventually started asking questions in one of the many friendly communities devoted to its existence. Soon enough I had to see if it could potentially help me and my situation.\n\nI ordered a small amount and instantly knew how life-changing it can be for me. Here's a substance that allows me to deal with the emotional turmoil I suffer from every day. A legal alternative to the potential crucifixion I would receive by reverting back to illegal opiates. I no longer felt the need to drink, and I haven't drank since my discovery of Kratom. I wake up every morning and go to sleep every night feeling safe in knowing that it is currently legal, and that it is helping me lead a more successful and productive life. It isn't treating anything. It isn't fixing me, but it sure as hell is helping.\n\nKratom has been a very positive and powerful influence in my life even in the short time I've been acquainted with it. With it I feel like things aren't so bad. I use Kratom daily and I'm hoping to continue to do so. Please do not schedule it. For some of us it is our last hope at leading normal and happy lives.\n\nSincerely,\nChristian Coleman","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13050","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christian Coleman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it may concern,\n\nI wish to take this moment to express my concern over the doubt and concerns of the government over the natural sustenance known as Kratom.\n\nI won't waste your time by stating the multiple facts of it not being a drug or it's natural properties.

I don't want to get bogged down in backstory, so suffice it to say that some of these treatments seemed to help a bit, but the relief was always fleeting; the black cloud of depression was always looming around the corner.\n\nWell, you can probably see where this is going.  For the past six months, I have actually not been depressed for the first time I can remember.  My regiment is as follows: lots of exercise, a reasonable healthy diet, and three to four grams of kratom daily.  I am not a doctor, but here is my interpretation of how kratom has alleviated my depression.  A low dose of kratom provides a gentle feeling of stress relief and motivation, and allows me to be very productive.  When the effects of the kratom have worn off, I am left with a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment after a productive day.  I work in a very stressful job (I know, who doesn't?) at a young start up company, and my self-perceived levels of productivity can make or break my mood.\n\nAnyway, that is my story.

I have seen her go from an nervous and depressed individual back to the person I have always know - full of life and with motivation to move ahead and take care of her family.

The Kratom helped in several ways. It took all signs of withdrawal away and I was able to come off of long term strong amounts of narcotic pain meds relatively easily. Kratom then continued to help ease my chronic pain condition. That's all I wanted but it did more. It gave me a mild feeling of being happy, more energetic but mild and less anxious. \nI was able to discontinued my antidepressant and Xanax prescriptions.  I don't see how kratom can even be considered a scheduled 1 drug when the effects are very mild, no chance at overdosing  on it alone, or dependency  any worst that quitting coffee. If kratom is be illegal than why not kava, cbd oil, shilagit, ashawanda, phenubut  and many more natural herbs  or remedies. \nPlease do more research before making a final decision, try some yourself. You will be pleasantly surprised that this is no harmful drug.

I am a responsible, taxpaying citizen who is a homeowner and employed full-time.  I personally discovered kratom after online research and have found it to be a safe and natural supplement to ease my chronic pain due to osteoarthritis and also as a remedy for my ongoing anxiety.  I have never had any ill effects from it and have finally been able to walk without pain and enjoy a better quality of life because of this supplement. \n\nI write to urge the DEA to please reconsider its intent to add the components of Mitragynaspeciosa to the Schedule 1 controlled substance list.  I am confident that a ban on kratom would have devastating effects on American citizens who are sufferers of chronic pain, our veterans with PTSD, opiate addicts using kratom to ease withdrawal, and people with anxiety who use this safe and natural cousin of the coffee plant to better their lives.  I fear that suicide rates will increase, addicts will turn back to opiates and overdose, and people suffering with chronic pain will be forced to turn to opiates and perpetuate the countrys growing, deadly painkiller addiction epidemic.\n\nPlease know that kratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life and the lives of thousands of others.

I did not use it to treat pain, but I mainly used it for energy in a low dose in place of coffee. I prefer kratom over caffeine because I do not experience the jitters or the crash. Kratom feels much more smooth and has mood lifting properties as well. It makes my thoughts and intentions much more cohesive. It could almost be considered a nootropic or smart drug. This is very helpful to counteract the adverse mental effects that medical cannabis can have, especially among new users, so as to increase productivity while medicating. I should point out also that at no point did I feel addicted to the substance (I only took it 2-3 times a week, as opposed to several cups of coffee per day like lots of people). I also never experienced withdrawal symptoms. \nNow think about all the people who benefit from its pain killing properties and opiate withdrawal treatment success.

I believe that there is little to no evidence that supports the DEA's banning of Kratom. \n\nI began using Kratom about 2 years ago and my life has been on an upward trend since then.

I am lucky in that I have never turned to hard substances to cope with these feelings, however some are not quite as lucky as I. I have found Kratom to be one of the most helpful tools in my arsenal. When I feel myself becoming overwhelmed, kratom gives me the opportunity to relax and avoid breaking down into negative feedback cycles. Kratom is a tool to help those in pain both physically and emotionally. It allows those struggling with addiction to opioids to find a release without having to sacrifice their sobriety. \n\nKratom has helped me get my life back on track, I went from failing out of college twice to being a straight 'A' student over the past two years.

It was created by nature and its uses are numerous. It has helped with my ADHD and social anxiety. It has also helped with my various bowel disorders I experience. There is no such thing as overdosing on Kratom because unlike some of the other substances, Kratom won't kill you if you accidentally or even purposefully take too much. It's not a substance you can get high on either. Its effects are best described as similar to the best cup of coffee you have ever had. To schedule Kratom is to ignore all of the wonderful things it has done for people for the last couple thousand of years, and will only serve to make the corporations pockets a little bit bigger. There is no public threat, and you would be banning a substance that stands a real chance of reversing the opiate epidemic.

When I was 16 years old, I was in a car wreck that injured my back. I was left with 2 herniated discs in my lower lumbar region. For years, I battled through physical therapy, going through prescription pain killers just to be able to stand up and make it to class. As a graduate student, and now as a professor, I spend a lot of time sitting for research and writing. Of course, as an academic, I need a clear head to do my job. I can't do proper work under the influence of narcotics, and yet the pain I suffer can be even more of a distraction.\n\nWhen I first discovered kratom, I had no idea the profound positive effects it would have on my life. Taking this herb a couple times of day provided me with even better relief than narcotics and with far fewer negative side effects. It's easier on my liver and kidneys, it's not nearly as habit forming, and there is no negative stigma associated with it either. Yet.\n\nThe ban on kratom would require that I go back to taking narcotic pain killers and would have a negative impact on my quality of life. I am vehemently opposed to this action which I feel is nonsensical and misguided at best, and a clear sign of corruption and corporate interests influencing the DEA's policy making decisions. I would ask that kratom remain legal as it has helped many people get off of pain killers, therefore assisting the DEA in their mission to solve this epidemic.

This plant has beneficial and important role in my life. I use it to lower my anxiety levels and blood pressure.  All of this has been documented in studies done on this plant. It has tremendous value for helping people manage pain and get of opium addictions (something as you know is a major problem in our society helped brought on by the big pharmaceutical pushing pain killers on doctors who push it on people). Society is looking for better and more natural ways of managing our own health. With the help of science, we are seeing the benefits of using natural remedies when applicable to help people manage/improve their own health. We need to look no further than medical/recreational marijuana as a similar case study.  We are seeing more and more medical and societal benefits of decriminalizing this natural plant (used for centuries by traditional cultures for pain, health, and social benefits). Kratom is another plant that has tremendous potential to help people and create jobs and tax revenue for society. I have read some of the testimonies on Kratom, some people claim the drug \"killed\" a loved one who used it.  There is no data that supports Kratom is responsible for killing someone. Most families who have suffered a tragedy/loss of a loved one and associate Kratom to the death, their loved one was also abusing other substances at the time as well, i.e. heroin, alcohol, meth just name a few.  People know little about this drug, its not popular, but when its mentioned in a death, its easy for people to fear it.  To date, studies (that are limited due to federal regulation on Kratom testing) show no evidence of issues.  Drug rehab centers hype this up to promote more business.  Tell people they are addicted to something and they can help them, you get people in the door to pay you.  Reminds me of the old west snake oil business promised to so many. You taking away this natural remedy for me to freely decided to use and control and improve my health, pain and function in society is not right. There are no risks with responsible usage of this plant.  Education on it is what matters, not criminalizing another plant that people are in need of, desire to use to manage their own lives. Forcing me to support big pharma is not okay.  I want the DEA, FDA, CDC, and Congress focusing on the real issues we face. Heroin, prescription pain meds, meth, and other synthetics to be taken on.  Use our funds for major and real problems hurting families, straining social services (I am a teacher, I see the impact alcohol has on families daily), filling our jails with people who are not criminals.  Marijuana is bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for states, its opening up people to being educated and responsible with it, hurting terror groups funding like the cartels, freeing up jail space and the strain of prison costs on society. Criminalizing of this drug will only add to the issues we face.  Regulate and educate, bring in revenue, allow people the choice to manage THEIR health.

A short definition of this disorder is that the bodys natural internal clock runs backwards. Whereas the normal clock is being tired at night and awake during the day is something impossible for someone with DSPD to achieve. Our brains produce sleep/awake chemicals backwards to where night chemicals such as Melatonin are being produced during the day, leaving the day chemicals to be produced during the night. With my natural internal clock, Im am absolutely unable to fall asleep before 6am-8am. Leaving me awaking around the hours of 2pm-4pm. Imagine a normal person being forced to lay in bed all day, and then also being forced to stay awake all night. That is my life but vice versa. When I say during the day Im tired I dont mean I need a cup of coffee tired, I mean I have to force myself to move or get dressed, unable to even make it through a conversation without my eyes closing tired. All of my life, all day Ive forced myself to stay awake through this just so at night when Im wide awake, I can fail horribly at forcing myself to sleep, which always resulted in a lot of laying quietly, in the dark, alone, and watching the alarm clock for hours.\nMy education, my employment, my social life, and my relationships were all affected by this one disorder. Not to mention once I had a child, sleeping during the day was no longer an option, there were many days I went with no sleep at all. With the crippling effect this took on my quality of life; my mental health was extremely affected. I sought help from counsellors, therapists, psychiatrists, and doctors. The end result was a lot of medication with little relief. With several pills I was able to sleep at night but nothing could combat the tiredness during the day. I tried many medications to try and treat this tiredness but they all ended with side effects that I were unmanageable. Such as Wellbutrin leading to a lifelong seizure disorder. Causing me repeated seizures, even after discontinuing the medication. I still have seizures to this day and must take a seizure medication now and for the rest of my life. There were other medications the doctors had tried for my tiredness that had countless short term adverse effects as well, such as hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, increased anxiety, headaches, fogginess, memory loss, I could go on and on. \nAfter professional help ended with more negative than positive effects, I experimented with harder drugs for relief. For a while I thought that this was the answer, until the symptoms of drug addiction really took root. I lost my familys trust, love and acceptance, every penny I could get my hands on, my self-worth, my home, my sanity, and I became a thief, a small time criminal. Most importantly I lost my son. I was deemed an unfit parent and& I was. Long story (not so) short, I decided enough was enough and after years of dependency I suffered cold turkey withdrawals and checked into rehab. Once I completely kicked the habit, I spiraled into an even darker state of depression because not only was I controlled by my disorder again, but I also had to deal with the reality of everything the addiction robbed me of. \nI spent some time doing a little online research and I came across an herb called Mitragyna speciosa. After dealing with this disorder for 28 years, there was finally a glimmer of hope in my life which Id all but given up on ever finding. It helped with my sleep disorder, my constant depression and anxiety. It helped, and it didnt consume my entire life. I was able to stay awake during the day giving me the motivation and physical ability to get a normal 40+ hours a week management position at Petco, caring for animals. I was able to have friends again, go hiking, climb mountains, go camping, everything I had only dreamt of doing. Since having such a better outlook on life, Ive gotten the inspiration to go out and actually meet people, leading to me happily married for over a year now. Most importantly I was able to break through the blinding darkness and start (which is now almost complete!) my case plan to get my son back.\nI want to be able to say that Kratom has given me my life back, but before Kratom, I truly did not have a life. Kratom literally gave me life. I now have a better outlook on a life that I had all but given up on. When I heard of the ban they had planned, my heart sunk as I realized it might all be over. I cant go back to the place I was in before Kratom. I just cant. Im unable to comprehend that the people who are there to protect our lives and our families, would put me into such a dark place again. If this ban goes through, my life is honestly over. Kratom has become my last chance at life, and the best option for my quality of  life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6472","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Heather Murray","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't take kratom away from me and many other tax paying law abiding citizens. It is not anything to criminalize people for. I take kratom everyday before and after work for over 2 years now and it hasn't caused any problems. It helps me feel good and perform well. Like why the fuck do you care if I take kratom? Seriously. Alcohol is legal and you want to make something that is way less potent and mind alternating illegal, how does that even make sense? It doesn't.\n\nI'm not gonna lie and claim it helps me with chronic pain because I'm perfectly healthy and do not NEED kratom, but I like it. For people that do have pain it works wonders without all the adverse side effects like prescription pain pills have. The absolute best thing about Kratom is that if you take it then prescription pain pills or herion is not effective at all ,it doesn't get you high anymore if you've taken kratom within approximately last 24-48 hours. So basically you can throw the fear of it leading to prescription pain pill addiction of heroin/other opiate addiction out the window. Kratom makes people not crave opioids and be able to live a normal life.\n\nIf you are a male and want to rock your women in bed take some kratom within 8 hours of having sex you will last longer and it is great. Trust me \n\nBottom line kratom is not dangerous compared to weed or alcohol it does basically nothing so to make it illegal is absolutely assanine","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8259","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"CJ Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hey guys. So I just want to quickly share how kratom has helped me turn my life around. As with many in my generation I succumbed to recreational opiate use which led to inevitable addiction. This lasted for years, thuearing down my life as time went on. I then came across something I  an article I was reading online about addiction and how to take it on. Kratom was a little known substance back then so I didn't know anything about it. I got my hands on some and decided to give it a shot, since the previous attempts to quit always led back to the opiates. After a few attempts with Kratom I was finally successful in beating my addiction. I now have a successful job as a manager of a popular restaurant and have a wife and amazing son. Kratom absolutely changed my life. It is an amazing tool for people who deal with addiction, pain, depression and anxiety and should absolutely not be banned. Thousands of people including myself use this plant everyday to combat such symptoms and would suffer greatly from its banishment. It is a safe, natural remedy that people should have access to if wanted. Please do not place it under the controlled substance act, especially as schedule 1.

I have mild depression / anxiety and was able to stop using Paxil by using Kratom. Kratom is not addictive to me and when I use it, it has a mild stimulating effect akin to what I feel after I have drank a cup or two of coffee. I personally haven't experienced any extreme sensations from the supplement, even at higher dosages. I do not believe that Kratom has any reason to be added as a schedule one narcotic and feel that the DEA was on the verge of making an epic mistake. I hope my comments help convince you to leave Kratom alone as I like not having to take Paxil on a regular basis. I like that Kratom is not addictive and I can use it just when I'm feeling depressed, unlike Paxil which requires me to take it every day. I also like that I can use it without a DR prescription and that it doesn't leave me feeling disconnected like Paxil.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21160","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paul Romero","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 51 yr old woman who INSTEAD of NARCOTICS I prefer to use Kratom for the daily inflammation.

I am 31 years old and have been working as an architectural Illustrator , CGI animator, and architectural photographer for an architecture firm in the city of Pittsburgh for the last 8 years.  \n\nI have been using kratom for 2-1/2 years and it has drastically increased my quality of life due to a number of issues that it helps me with that other medications, such as tramadol and extra strength naproxen, were unable to accomplish without a number of very negative side effects.  These prescribed medications were taking a very negative toll on my life, and the physical and mental cost of seeking relief was not working for me anymore.  \n\nI am not making any medical claims...I am just giving my personal testimony of how kratom has helped me.  I suffer from a badly curved spine and simple things such as walking around grocery shopping or anything that requires me to be on my feet for more than 20 minutes results in extreme pain in my back, knees, and feet.  Also, my job requires me to be at my desk just about all day, everyday and whether sitting or standing, my back pain just becomes too much most days.  It is crippling and often requires me to avoid doing these basic things in life or suffer through the pain.  I also have gerd and a hiatil hernia that makes eating a proper amount and processing food a very difficult challenge due to the digestive pains that result.  Kratom has dramatically eased these pains and actually made digesting and passing food a much more consistent and normal process.  Also, taking the previously mentioned medications (tramadol & naproxen) only made things worse due to how taxing they were on my stomach and digestive system.  I also suffer from fairly severe anxiety and depression and was prescribed paxil, and that medication almost ruined my life in so many ways.  I do not say these things to demonize modern medicine as I think they have an important role in helping a lot of people that are suffering various illnesses, but a lot of people do not need such strong medications and kratom is enough to have a good quality of life.  Taking this away from people, would destroy a lot of good, productive lives as they may have to turn to other medications that haven't worked or have negatively impacted their lives...or have to deal with life altering pain, anxiety and/or depression.\n\nIn closing, I would like to thank you for opening up this comment period and hope that our testimonies will aid the effort into researching  this plant so that people can continue to use it safely.  Please do not keep us from a quality of life without pain...this ban would hurt so many people that are just seeking relief so that they can continue to live normal, productive lives.  Please keep kratom legal and easily accessible to those that need it.

Cost alone would make any drug more appealing. Heroin is by far cheaper and easily or relatively easily obtained. Kratom is more like a natural way to relieve anxiety, mood, or just be. This is not a drug of addiction. It's more of a relief FROM addiction. \nThe benefits from Kratom are small compared to any other form of drug. I'm 50 years old. Kratom would be on my list of drugs for excess numbered 1-10, maybe a 2. It's not habit forming, and just helps enough to provide some relief from opiates and helps pain. Most notably my back and stomach. It helps lower my pain. And it doesn't have all the mind numbing properties of opiates even at high doses. \nIn conclusion, take away a low form of addiction relief from people struggling with opiate addictions would not be a grand move on anyone's part. People are struggling and know the dangers of opiates. Kratom is not a replacement, simply a plant that lower opiate withdrawals and helps people. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3224","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Fred Jones","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please reconsider scheduling a plant as a narcotic.

This would put \nKratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown Kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\nI am an educated, responsible adult consumer of Kratom. This plant has given me my life back, safely, without risking addiction to dangerous, narcotic prescription pain medications, Anti-Depressants and addictive Anti-Anxiety medications and alcohol. I have not taken ANY pharmaceutical medications or alcohol since March of 2015, when I researched and discovered an amazing plant, Kratom. I consume Kratom for Chronic Pain due to diagnosed Spinal Disease (Degenerative Disk, Sciatica, Herniated disks), Severe Depressive and Anxiety Disorder and PTSD. I had been battling these issues for over 15 years and have finally been able to live a clear headed, productive and virtually pain free life, since discovering and consuming Kratom in March of 2015. Prior to finding Kratom, I was basically housebound and unable to function due to the side effects of the prescribed medications. After a period of time, the narcotic pain medications became ineffective, and required me to consume more and more of the dangerous, addictive \"medicines\".  I was so afraid of becoming another statistic... and accidentally overdose on these medications and die! I am a Mother, I have a wonderful family and had been developing a start up business. I don't want to die. I want to continue to live and be my happy, productive and creative self! I quit taking the pharmaceutical medications and then (out of physical and mental desperation) began to self medicate with alcohol. Of course, this did nothing but make things worse and rendered me unable to function... just as the medications did. I eventually went back to the Doctor and got back on the medications... again. It became a vicious cycle... until I found Kratom. I got my life back! I am an active, productive, happy member of society and my family! My business is taking off and my future has never been brighter! \n\nKratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. I fear that if Kratom, in it's organic, pure form, is taken away from those of us that depend on Kratom's medicinal value, will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic, maybe even my own. I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without Kratom.

Since I was 15 years old and in high school here in Las Vegas, it was significantly easier for kids my age to access opium-based drugs. Nearly every one of my friends had a parent, sibling, aunt/uncle, or similar family member who was taking, or had left-over opiates. We would take them recreationally the get the euphoric feeling that ensued. I was not one to partake typically since they made my stomach ache, but soon I had friends who were taking 2-6 Lortab/Norco/Vicodin (hydrocodone), OxyContin/Percocet(oxycodone), and eventually morphine in various forms. By my Junior year of high school, I had 3 friends expelled for unsubscribed prescription drug possession and  a friend so addicted to opiates, 6 lortab pills would not achieve the high he intended. He began stealing his mother's morphine patches (she was on her death bed with cervix cancer) and was expelled from school for smoking one of these patches in the bathroom during lunch. Another friend was in and out of rehab since the age of 17 and died of heroin overdose at the age of 21. The fact that these prescription pills are made, distributed, prescribed and sold as the only effective form of pain relief in the United States is absolutely disgraceful. They are thrown around and given to any patient with the slightest pain and lead to ever increasing, easily avoidable deaths ever year.\nIn 2014, deaths from opiates are as follows:\n\t47,055 deaths from opioid lethal drug overdose, 18,893 of which were known opiate addicts.\n\t10,574 overdose deaths from heroin.\n\t467,000 adolescent NON-MEDICAL users of unprescribed opioid pain relievers, of which 168,000 having an addiction to said drugs.\n\t28,000 adolescent heroin users within the past year and 16,000 of which were current heroin users.\nThese statistics are increasing at an exponential rate every year and these surveys barely scratch the surface of the problem.\nThere are proven testimonials from addicts who claim to find a moderate or complete form of relief from the urge to take opiates when they consume Kratom (mitragyna speciosa). Instead of funding research for a plant that could change and save millions of lives, the DEA has put a ban on this \"drug\". 15 deaths have been connected to Kratom and 14 out of those 15 were found with other drugs in their system.  Even if 100 people died a year from Kratom mixed with other drugs, thousands more would likely be saved from its medicinal benefits.\nI have personally tried Kratom and it is excellent for production and focus for school or work, but in different dosage, is a tremendous sleep aid with no grogginess. There is no other product on the market that has these two drastically opposite, yet useful remedies and can be grown in one's house or backyard. Please do not take away another cheap, life-saving drug from the American people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4320","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thomas Gentile","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\nMy name is Zachary Osborne and i oppose the DEA's proposal to make the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine a Schedule 1 drug.

Because of my job (i believe) i have been diagnosed with 2 herniated discs (L4 and L5) and it has caused me severe chronic pain from my lower back to my toes and sometimes affects other areas of my body as well. I was put on at least 4 types of pain killers, among other medication, before finally being prescribed hydrocodone. At that point, i finally had a little bit of relief but was still in pain on a daily basis. After becoming addicted to the hydrocodone i was having trouble with the doctor who would not prescribe me a higher dose. I was having trouble at work, and most importantly i was starting have serious relationship issues with my then-fiance. That's when i decided to make a change. I found kratom and with some skepticism ordered my first small amount to try it out. Since the first time i tried kratom i had almost immediate relief. I was literally in tears for having forgotten how it felt to NOT be in pain. Since then i have used kratom almost every day and i have my beautiful wife, my great job, and my pain level is at bay in a way that i didn't think was possible. I have even gone a week without kratom and endured the pain to test whether it was addictive and i had no withdrawal like i did with the painkillers. Kratom has saved my life and so many others' lives as well. There is no way this amazing herb should be made a schedule 1 along with heroin, ecstasy, meth, and more.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1870","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zachary Osborne","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nMy name is Brandon Manchego and I have had a chronic sciatic nerve issue starting in my early 20s up until now which I am 35 years old. Prior to finding Kratom I had been in a vicious cycle of taking prescription pain killers, muscle relaxers, methadone and most recently Suboxone. These are very dangerous drugs for many reasons as you know. I have had to come off of Methadone and Suboxone and it is one of the worst times of my life. Luckily I found an alternative for pain management and that is Kratom. It has been a life saver for me and my family. It provides the relief that I need without all the side effects including drowsiness, numbness and agitation that incurs with taking prescription pain killers. I plead that you leave Kratom off of any list let alone Schedule 1 as I have seen first hand how wonderful Kratom has been for so many lives. It's a natural alternative that is so needed for so many people. Thank you for taking the time to read our comments and our stories. We appreciate your efforts in all of this.

In fact Kratom is in the same family as the coffee tree (rubiaceae).\n\nPersonally, the Kratom plant has helped me tremendously with depression and anxiety. I haven't had to go back to expensive Rx meds, which havent fared well for me in the past (side effects). Kratom on the other hand hasnt given me any side effects, and it is NOT addicting. I often go weeks without it, and only use when my depressive moods flare up.\n\nI used to struggle with crippling depression (my Dad did too). It would halt any productivity on my part. It was impossible to do my best quality work for my boss. I tried a few Rx meds but the cost was killing me, and instead making me feel good, they just made me feel like a sleepwalker. Not depressed, but simply emotionless.\n\nKratom on the other hand has been a godsend. I feel a nice steady spark of curiosity and excitement to get things done, no side effects, no sense of losing control.\n\nWell enough of my story.\n\nFacts to remember:\n\n-- Kratom is no more habit forming than coffee see recent article by the cato institute, www.cato.org/blog/addiction-problem-case-kartom\n-- Kratom has been safely used for thousands of years as a medicine\n-- No one has ever died from taking Kratom alone\n-- It is impossible to overdose on Kratom\n-- Tens of thousands of Americans can attest to the beneficial properties of Kratom\n\nAlso Florida, Georgia,  Oklahoma, Iowa, and Kentucky recently considered, but decided not to ban Kratom in the end\n\nMedical literature has proven Kratom and its constituents to be quite useful and safe. This plant that has been used for thousands of years without incident.  Kratom does not present a significant threat to human health or safety, especially when compared to other legal substances like alcohol, tobacco.\n\nThank you for your time and wisdom","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13948","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Horst Horst","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I just wanted to share my input.

I have been using kratom for over 3 years now and before using kratom I would have a TERRIBLE time getting up in the morning. Now mornings are one of my favorite times of the day. I have NEVER used or tried any illegal drugs in my life and to think that if this scheduling were to go through, something that has helped me have a better life, would be illegal blows my mind!

It helps those who have had substance abuse problems get off of hard drugs such as heroin or opiates with out needing detox meds like suboxone and methadone which are equally addictive if not more addicting. We have a opiate addiction epidemic on our hands as a country. Banning a natural safe alternative to those opiates is obsurd. Alabama banned it not too long ago and they have had a large increase in heroin and opiate overdoses since. Which the rise is not a coincidence. This herb can help with anxiety , depression, chronic pain for those that suffer. I'm asking to not have it banned because I am genuinely concerned for those who use it to manage their everyday pain.

In addition, it helped me quit smoking once and for all after trying and failing to quit for 10 years.

Here I am making a third comment.  I wish I did not have to make this one due to recent circumstances.  I have spoke before of my experiences of how Kratom played a role in potentially saving my life.  Now I have a family member who suffers greatly due to being smashed five times by an overloaded front end loader in his younger years.   I witnessed this accident before my very eyes at the age of five.\n\nThe accident crushed every bone in my father's lower body, including his pelvis and lower spinal column.  This was in 1986.  Although his body healed to a major degree, now as a 62 year old, he can barely walk due to his debilitation.  Even though his injuries were surgically reconstructed, his body remains in significant pain, agony and debilitation and depression.\n\nI recently found that his pain management doctor not only has him on his regular pain medicine, and medicine for his neurological phenomena, but he has been given additional prescriptions of morphine as well.  This has me afraid for his life.  As I write to you now, I am concerned with the quality of the remainder of his life, and so is he....he still should have the right to take this on naturally with effective herbal supplements if he so desires, which he has expressed his interest to do so.\n\nMy father knows my story on how Kratom saved my life from my prescription withdrawal, as well as helps me with my MS/neurological related symptoms.  He is willing and wants to try Kratom as well, because he grows tired of being heavily medicated on strong opiates and benzodiazepine meds.  I would like to see my father pain free and sober.  He would too.  This is his ticket to some peace in his life before he passes on.  He is confident, and my wife and I are confident kratom will help him get his life back as it did mine....as well as the thousands of people and counting who petitioned, and who are willing to comment on Kratom's behalf!\n\nPlease keep Kratom legal and do not schedule it.  I want to see my father live longer than he thinks is in his future.  He knows it helped me, and now he wants to let it help him which you know and I know it will.  \n\nPlease do not rob my father, me, or any of us our dignity in life by taking away our rights to utilize this unique and very effective herbal supplement.\n\nI have said this before and I will say again, peoples' lives hang in the balance of kratom's legality.\n\nWhatever your cause to ban Kratom is, whether it be public health concern, being the CDC and big pharma's strong arm, agency self justification, or just out right ego, PLEASE EDUCATE YOURSELVES ON THE NEGATIVE IMPACT A KRATOM BAN WILL BE TO THE PEOPLE.  You are supposed to be on our side, working in the best interest of us, not against us.  This is a big reason why the war on drugs has not fared well to say the least.  I kindly and respectfully ask that you please take our comments seriously, and understand that these are real people in real pain.  We do not deserve to be criminalized because we are in pain and we don't want addictive drugs being strong armed into our lives and our only other alternative is to just suffer in silence or become criminalized.  This is what it amounts to, and this is out right cruelty if the ban is forced on us.\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14048","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dustin Barr","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a wonderful thing.

I started researching many natural approaches to treating chronic pain and came across numerous testimonials, studies and information on the benefits of Kratom in small doses for not only chronic pain and depression, but helping get through the withdrawal symptoms too. I have been taking kratom along with other vitamins and supplements for the past month and a half and I am finally Me again!

I am 35 years old and a photographer. My life has been improved (maybe even saved) by kratom for the past two years. I vehemently oppose the DEA's proposed restriction of kratom in any way, shape or form. \n\nAt 17-years-old, after a nightmare few months  the worst time in my life  I was diagnosed with clinical depression, general anxiety disorder and panic disorder. The doctor immediately put me on a regimen of SSRI and Xanax. The panic attacks subsided after a few weeks of treatment, but the depression and general anxiety didnt budge. On top of that, the drowsiness, numbness and loss of excitement and motivation for life from the pharmaceuticals considerably lowered my quality of life. \n\nBut I kept on going, because what else was I supposed to do. \n\nThen, in 2014, after years and years of Lexapro and Xanax and living life like a zombie, a friend in an anxiety support group in Seattle suggested I try kratom. I did my diligent research and learned it is a safe, natural leaf used for millennia by Buddhists and farmers in Southeast Asia, and that no major side effects or illness from drinking a tea made with the leaf had been reported. Word of the benefits of the leaf had started gaining momentum, especially in Seattle, so I was able to test a sample relatively quickly after research. The impact upon my mental health was swift. For the first time in my life, my baseline level of heightened anxiety (from GAD) had waned. My mood had brightened. I actually wanted to get out of bed and be productive and enjoy life, a feeling I had all but forgotten! \n\nOver time and with daily use of kratom, I was able to lower my Lexapro dosage and completely get off Xanax. For the first time in 20 years, I felt alive, unencumbered from the symptoms of depression and general anxiety. My daily dosage is 20 grams and I did worry about experiencing some sort of withdrawal when I first began seeking help from krato, but that never happened. Ive gone without the plant for weeks on end (most recently on a trip to Thailand, where it is unfortunately banned due to tax disputes from the turn of the century) and didnt experience anything worse than I do when I go without coffee for a few days: an infrequent, minor headache and some fatigue in the morning for the first day of no kratom use was the only noticeable difference. Every other time I go cold turkey from the natural substance is the exact same: no noticeable adverse symptoms. \n\nOn top of that, I remain healthy and active and have annual physicals. In fact, Im healthier than at any other time in my adult life, according to the physicals my primary care physician has conducted on me (including blood work) since I began kratom. Of course this doesnt imply causation; but it certainly shows that, as far as my case goes, kratom has not exhibited any harm on my body. In fact, the positive effects it exhibits in my mood, brain and perhaps even in regards to sports pain has likely lead to a more active, happier lifestyle which has in turn improved my holistic health.  \n\nIts not hard to finish the picture for you, from my perspective. If the DEA decides to take away my right to access and use the plant as I see fit, my life, as I know it and currently enjoy it, will be taken away. Kratom is the only thing that has ever worked for me in combatting mental illness. Without it, Ill have to return to a prescription stupor that only partly masks depression and general anxiety with a thick fog that trickles over into the rest of my existence. Please refrain from scheduling kratom or regulating it in anyway so that I  and countless others around the country  can remain productive members of this great nation.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21108","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathan Higbee","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a very safe and beneficial alternative to addictive pain medications.

I first came to learn about Kratom from my husband. We were in a very bad place in our marriage.  My husband had been fighting what seemed like a loosing battle with addiction to opioid pain medication.  We were at our breaking point.  I didn't think I could stay if things didn't change and he didn't have much to live for if me and my daughter left.  Then he found Kratom. He started to take it and It was helping with his pain, depression, anxiety, mood and energy.  For the first time in a few years I had hope again.  It's almost been a year now and he is doing so well.  I can honestly say Kratom saved our family and my husbands life. I have even tried it myself. I suffer from migraines and have had a few sinus surgeries and when I get my migraines they r so bad nothing helps.  I was crying in pain and I finally tried it myself for the first time and couldn't believe that the Kratom helped to take the pain away.  And so I take it every now and then if I need it and I don't have to worry about side effects or getting addicted to it.  Its a natural and safe product that has been around for thousands of years. I pray that all of these comments and all the scientific data will show that Kratom is not a harm to responsible adult users.  And how many lives will be ruined if Kratom is taken away from the over a million people that rely on this amazing supplement.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDiana Reina","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9219","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Diana Reina","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"DEA-442W\n\n\nPlease stop considering Scheduling 'Kratom' as a schedule 1 substance! Better yet don't schedule it at all for that matter! \nI have taken kratom for 3 years, every day, 2 tsp 2 times a day. I recently had a physical from my PCP (Primary Care Physician) who informed me that I am healthier than I have ever been. My blood and urine levels are normal for a healthy adult in their 30's. I am proud to have kratom as an alternative to the opiates that my PCP wanted to put me on over 3 years ago. Debilitating cluster migraines brought me to that same PCP 3 years ago and his answer was to put me on Oxycontin. OXYCONTIN!? People with Stage 4 cancer take oxycontin! I may have been in constant pain but I knew better than to accept a life of addiction to a highly addictive and dangerously strong opiate! \nI am 32 and I have never found anything as helpful and wonderful as the herb called kratom. Once I found kratom I quickly got my life back. I am not saying, in any way, that Kratom treats, cures, or prevents any disease BUT I am saying that it helped my over-all health & well-being immediately.\nI have stopped taking kratom 3 times over the past 3 years. For about a week each time. And I must say, from experience, that I had no 'withdrawal' as the DEA/FDA tries to imply. It was a slight nuisance at best. Like someone who has consumed coffee, several cups a day for several years, and then stops drinking coffee; they are going to be agitated. But for anyone to state that there is a \"withdrawal\" from kratom, is something that seems preposterous to me now that I've personally done it several times. I imagine that coming off Oxycontin after 3 years might be a bit different than not taking your herbal kratom powder! I've heard that detoxing from Oxycontin is like dying. \nPlease consider all of the available research on kratom with open eyes. If there are 15 alleged deaths caused by kratom then why did all 15 individuals have other substances, like other opiates or other schedule 1 substances, also found in their systems- and why is the DEA/FDA only focusing on the kratom? Kratoms toxicity is nearly non-existant compared to that of, say, Fentanyl? (Smith-Cline studies performed in the 1960's proved this fact) So why would kratom be the main focus of an individuals death when that person also has large amounts of fentanyl, or other controlled substances, in their system. Kratom is a legal and helpful herb/botanical that is being demonized for no real reason. \nAmerica is in the middle of a Doctor prescribed opiate epidemic and if an all-natural herb can help save American lives from the grip of an opiate epidemic then why is the FDA/DEA/Big Pharma trying so hard to make it unavailable?  \nPlease stand with Europe & Canada, and see the positive research\n and results from all available kratom research & studies. I live in a state that, in 2016, has independently made kratom legal to those who are 18+ years of age. My state has seen that there is no Imminent Threat! My state has seen the research and determined it to be a benefit to its citizens. Why won't you? See all the good that kratom does. It helps millions of people maintain their health & well-being. Thank you for allowing us this Lawful & Legal public comment period. We thought the DEA/FDA was going to do something unethical by scheduling kratom without regard to the law!? But, after much outcry from Congress and the Senate, you've shown us that you are not above the law and you are willing to do things by the book.

I was treated with physical therapy which worked well over time. In the meantime, I was prescribed multiple anti-inflammatory medications. For the pain itself, I was prescribed tramadol and vicodin.  Tramadol did little to decrease the pain and vicodin worked for pain but made me so nauseous/motion sick, I could not work or function effectively.

It would be best if this plant was left to be used freely by responsible adults, for uses medical or otherwise.  I know people have had much more serious medical issues that have benefited from the use of this plant. There are people who have probably used it for more minor issues, but as the plant is very safe and has caused no death (without complications of other drugs or alcohol), it should be allowed in those cases too.

I started taking kratom after doing research about natural herbs that may help with bothersome anxious thoughts and sadness/low mood/low motivation.I had never even heard of kratom before, so I sought out advice from people and articles on the internet and learned about the various strains and the ways in which kratom works on the brain and the body. \nI would consume kratom via the powdered leaf form, but people consume it in tinctures and teas or simply mixed with other liquids or in smoothies as well. The fact is, kratom is literally a tea leaf. It is related to coffee and has been used for thousands of years like coffee. It is a natural plant that grows from the ground and is found in Southeast Asia. Kratom has helped me cope with my anxious thoughts and has provided a very mild mood lift when I would consume it. I have never felt dependent on kratom and have been able to stop taking it numerous times-including the last month-with no issues whatsoever. I feel that it is a very safe and valuable substance that the American people can benefit from taking.\nYes, it is concerning that there have been some horrible companies marketing kratom as some sort of drug-of-abuse, because that is certainly not what it is. However, banning the plant completely and placing it into the most restricting schedule (I) of the Controlled Substances Act is completely counterproductive, with all due respect. It would completely halt scientific studies on the plant. I believe that kratom helps a lot of people deal with their issues such as anxiety and low mood and pain. It is a very helpful dietary supplement just like Asian Ginseng or Kava Kava-both of which are legal dietary supplements that can be obtained in health stores along with other supplements. There is no pressing or \"imminent public health threat\" involving this plant and there never has been. I want to know why hundreds of thousands of people have never even heard of kratom before if it is such an imminent danger to the public's health. Since the intent to ban was announced in the first place, I've actually heard of thousands of people who have expressed interest in learning more about the plant that could help them cope with various issues. People like to be able to take natural products if they can help it, and this ban would be a huge disservice to the American people. We should have the option to take natural supplements if we wish. Banning this plant would create a dangerous black market and would only invite tainted and actually-dangerous derivatives into this market. The deaths the DEA said were caused by kratom actually involved polypharmacy, which means that kratom cannot be solely blamed for all of them or even any of them. More research needs to be done.

Forty years of marijuana prohibition has been a failure on both a public health front and as a law enforcement issue.

Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.  As opioid addiction becomes an even greater problem, banning or scheduling kratom will only serve to make the issue worse.   Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now we run the risk of any scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment being shut down.  Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose. As marijuana legalization is gaining popular support (as well as support from the medical and scientific communities), now is not the time to take a giant step backward.  Allow kratom to be used and studied, it is a medicinal plant, grown in nature  and not manufactured in a lab - it is less harmful than pharmaceutical opioids and its benefits far outweigh those of drugs from the pharmaceutical industry.

I guess I am just going to tell you my story. I am a 36 year old mother of four and a wife. I was born with a disease that causes my knee caps to  dislocate on a daily basis. I have had 7 knee surgeries starting in 2004. With every surgery the problem got worse and I was told there was nothing else they could do, I would have to live with the pain for the rest of my life. I was in pain medication for years but I just couldn't take it anymore and against my Drs advice I stopped taking all the medication. The side affects of the medication  were to much to bare. I was so tired and depressed so Drs prescribed me antidepressants to help with that issue. The antidepressants caused me to develops serotonin syndrome and now I cannot take any medications that could possibly trigger seizures. I just wanted to find a safe natural way to treat my daily pain that wouldn't cause all the horrible side affects of prescription medication. Then came Kratom, I found this wonderful plant through extensive research. I was hesitant at first but I just  wanted my life back. I wanted to be able to play with my children again and be able to do normal activities that I use to love like hiking, going to the gym and play with my children. Painkillers took all of that away from me. When I took my first small dose of kratom I noticed a difference in my energy levels as well as some moderate pain relief. But most of all I noticed that I was starting to enjoy my life again. I couldn't imagine going back to the way my life was before, I never want to suffer like that again. I have been taking kratom for a year and a half now and I have never suffered any side affects from this amazing plant. If I run out the only noticeable change is my energy levels are a little lower and I feel my pain more. Please keep kratom legal for adults. Please allow myself and other kratom supporters/users continue to thrive and be healthy, allow us to keep LIVING. Because kratom has saved lives and it has helped so many people to become happy, healthy, productive members of society. \n\nSincerely, \n\nChauni Culver","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4920","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chauni Culver","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't classify kratom as schedule 1 - instead allow kratom to be studied and tested. \n\nWe need more options for pain management and kratom may be a good alternative to opiates.\n\nWe'll never know if we can't study it.\n\nThanks for your consideration and your work on this issue.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19607","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be scheduled.

I am educated, law abiding, hardworking and have a family. I strongly, vehemently oppose the DEA making Kratom a Schedule 1 drug, and banning or restricting it's use at all. I started using Kratom 7 years ago. I had chronic back pain and had been prescribed painkillers. I started to feel dependent on them and I became very worried about it, as I never wanted to depend on any pharmaceutical. I stopped taking them and it was tough on me physically and mentally. A woman I worked with told me about Kratom and said that she had been taking it for years to help with anxiety and pain related issues. She let me try it and I knew I had found something very special. I began using Kratom in a moderate dose on a regular basis to deal with my pain, and also found that it helped with any anxiety, mood swings or pain that I would have during my menstrual cycle, which were quite severe. I have been a regular user for 7 years and have had no issues with pain or mood that I have needed to deal with by using pharmaceuticals, something which had been recommended to me by doctors for years, even though they came with a slew of negative side effects and the high risk of dependancy. It has added benefits for me such as focus and natural energy which I can't find in any other natural supplements that I've tried. I believe that this plant is 100% safe and 100% effective for a variety of issues and you would be doing a huge disservice to many if you banned it. With the huge epidemic of opiate abuse and opiate related death, banning this would contribute to the problem as some may turn to drugs, pharmaceutical or otherwise, to try and deal with these impairments. Please don't ban Kratom. It isn't hurting anyone and is helping so so many, myself included. It has recently become illegal in my state, which is terribly upsetting, and making it federally illegal would only cement that status. Please hear out the good citizens who are benefiting from this plant and take their pleas into account before making a rash decision with little information to back it up. Thank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14108","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Allie Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is basically the same as coffee.

My life has been defined by hard work and as a result I have developed arthritis in several areas of my body including my knees, back, hips and my right shoulder.  I am in constant pain without some kind of pharmaceutical relief.  I have been prescribed opioids in the past but can only take them for short periods, then go through a withdrawal period which is always accompanied by depression, during which my pain is more extreme than ever.\n\nAbout 2 years ago I found kratom and began taking it regularly.  It did as much for my pain as any opioid but during the times that I did not have it, the withdrawal was almost non-existent.  Tolerance to kratom does not increase like opioids either.  I have to increase my dose by about 10% every 6 months.  Even when increasing dosage, long pauses of kratom use do not increase the severity of withdrawal.  Withdrawal usually lasts for about 1 week, and is very mild, almost unnoticable toward the end of the withdrawal period.\n\nI personally have \"over-dosed\" numerous times by taking too much kratom on an empty stomach. Over-dose symptoms in my case (and everyone I have talked to) are marked by minimal dizziness and vomiting once; after which there are no other side-effects.\n\nIn my experience there is no safer pain management available and I'm happy to pay for kratom without a prescription.  This is not an opioid but I have known kratom users who use the leaf to overcome opioid addiction including methadone and heroine.  \n\nI'm asking the DEA to at least make an informed decision about kratom.  If you've done your research and you still believe it's dangerous to the public, I'll agree with your decision; but, if you make an ignorant decision to ban kratom or classify it as a schedule 1 substance simply because \"people use it to get high\" then might I suggest you also ban the Oprah television show and pepperoni pizza; at least then all Americans can be stripped of our right to live happily.

During my life I have been diagnosted with depression, PTSD, and fybromyalgia.  Kratom tea helps me deal with the symptoms of these conditions, and scheduling it would absolutely have a detrimental effect on my personal well being.\n\nThroughout my life I have been through the full cycle of doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, and have been prescribed all types of medication for depression and pain management.  The side effects of these medications are too extreme for me to be comfortable with taking them on a regular basis, and being physically or chemically dependent on them is not a solution that I consider rational or sustainable.  Since taking Kratom I have stopped drinking alcohol completely, and have not had the desire to use any synthetic drugs at all.\n\nEven if I was not a personal user, I would be opposed to it being scheduled.  It is currently and for the foreseeable future legal in Canada and Mexico.  Scheduling it here will just create another black market for the cartels in Mexico, and organized crime like the Hells Angels in Canada.  The hundreds of thousands of people that use Kratom responsibly will still want it even if it becomes restricted.  If the leaf itself is difficult to import, the home made extract business will thrive in its place.  This type of product would just serve to further deregulate what is currently a healthy, self-regulating market.\n\nScheduling it will also effectively cancel current research on it.  If it can be shown to be effective at treating drug addiction or depression, it could save countless lives across the country.  It is definitely worth looking into considering there is a growing opioid epidemic.  Banning a healthy and safe alternative to classic opioid medications is only going to lead to more deaths and abuse of synthetic opioids, which nobody wants.\n\nThank you for reading my thoughts.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17513","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Aaron Bush","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me tremendously!

When I am struggling with the depressive state that comes on from PMDD, I use kratom to help improve my mood and improve my ability to function. Before, I used to be wiped out for days at a time, sometimes unable to elevate my mood enough to use cognitve behavioral techniques. But, with kratom, I can temporarily improve my mood enough to push through the depressive state brought on by PMDD much faster, helping me utilize the behavioral techniques I've learned in therapy, saving myself and my family from the heavy emotional damage that can occur from long PMDD episodes. I use kratom as an aid for my therapy for a lifelong disorder and, without it, I'm afraid I will struggle to cope.

After rehab I finally got completely clean for the first time. I maintained sobriety for over a year with lots of Narcotics anonymous meetings and moving to a new place.  It wasnt easy but I stayed focused. After a year or so I ran into Kratom from a friend. For some reason when I take Kratom my thoughts of using completely go away. I do feel like I depend on it as someone would depend on coffee. I like to take it in the morning and it enhances my mood and gets me going. I buy it off the internet and it comes to about 3 dollars a day. Before when I was hooked on pain killers I wasnt able to hold down a job and was always in legal trouble from the full time job it took to come up with the money an opiate addiction demanded, stealing, doctor shopping etc.. . Today I spend 3 dollars on Kratom have a full time job,  a car, and im renting a home with my girlfriend. Before I couldnt even maintain a healthy relationship with anyone not even family because of my obsession with an expensive habbit. Kratom suppresses my urge to use and im able to be a functional memeber of society. The thought of it becoming illegal scares me on a daily bases. I will try my best to stay clean either way, but Kratom makes it much easier and im scared my mind will always be on using again if i am not taking kratom.

I am a 30 years old and  work for the US Army Corps of Engineers in Omaha, Nebraska. I am married and have a 3 year old daughter and 2 year old son. I have absolutely no criminal record (I hold a clearance) and have never been in trouble with the law. I consume Kratom daily for two reasons, one for anxiety (specifically social anxiety) and the other for stomach ailments. Social anxiety controls my life and I've never been able to overcome it. Whether it be a meeting, gathering, sporting event, etc. I am constantly nervous and feel surrounded. I've seen doctors over the years who have tried to control these feelings with SSRIs, but they make me emotionless and feel empty inside. Kratom makes going out into public bearable and does not take away my emotions.  That nervous feeling I get everyday knowing I have to go out into public and interact has been lowered tremendously with the help of Kratom. Taking Kratom and 10,000 IUs of Vitamin D daily  gave me a life I never thought I could have. It makes me feel like a normal person. The days of wanting to be at home all of the time are over. \n\nI also take Kratom for my digestive tract. I've had IBS since I was a teenager. I've tried many different prescription and over-the-counter drugs with little help. The only drug that's helped is Imodium AD, but it does have negative side effects. I've noticed it can make me very constipated and make my stomach hurt. My doctor did not recommend I take it daily, but if I don't I am constantly using the restroom which makes being in public even worse for me. I have quit taking Imodium AD and have no more digestive issues thanks to Kratom. It slows my digestive tract down without the stomach pains. Also, by taking the right dosage I do not suffer from constipation. \n\nKratom has helped me tremendously with the two issues that I have struggled with a majority of my life that I never thought would go away. I think it could help so many other people like me with social anxiety and IBS. \n\nPlease do not make Kratom a scheduled drug. It has given me a life I love living. Without Kratom I am an antisocial, that impacts my wife and kids and their lives. They love when their Dad can take them out to do fun and exciting things rather than playing around inside of a house all day because their dad can't handle being in public. \n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11993","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Simpson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like for Kratom to remain legal to help those in need and also to allow for additional research on potential applications.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15241","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephen Pickens","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nMy name is Brian and I am an Army Soldier soon to be medically separated or medically retired.

This plant is especially crucial for a person in chronic pain that does not wish to become addicted to pharmaceutical opiates that currently result in massively problematic side effects and thousands of deaths from overdose every month. As a physician this plant is nothing short of exciting.   While we face an epidemic due to opiate addiction this plant can offer pain relief and has the ability to be utilized by people who want to discontinue the use of opiates they get from the local pharmacy.  This plant is very safe, effective, cost effective, and can treat pain and anxiety just as well as opiates and benzodiazepenes only with far less side effects and risk potential.   The only reason to make this plant illegal is to ensure that americans are held hostage by the pharmaceutical industry who systematically ensure that the only options for treating health problems are the options then sell through the drive through window at the local grocery store pharmacy.   Keep kratom legal!!  If you want to make a harmful drug illegal start with Oxycontin then adderal both of which see more harm and cause more destruction of life in one month than any herbal remedy from the local apothecary has in 100 years.  The laws should be written for the people and at the peoples choice not by way of fear tactics and monopolization we see as a result of the massive economic and political power the pharmaceutical industry has that has been given to them by the DEA and FDA.   Make kratom,  a plant that has been used succesfully by people for hundreds of years   illegal because it poses a risk to the public that has not been shown with statistics and facts, while synthetic heroin and pure amphetamines in pill form that have piles of statistics and data about massive harm both physically , mentally , and economically  are legal and daily prescribed to 12 year olds and soccer moms is an idea that demonstrates a complete disconnect in this country with what is good for the patients health and life.

She uses kratom  to help get  relief from the constant pain, fatigue and depression that she lives with everyday . She was taking  prescription medications that gave her horrible side effects and eventually got to a point where they did not provide much relief for her symptoms. Before she found kratom she was confined to bed and could barely function during the few hours she was awake every day. Prescription pain medications effectively gave her a zombie like existence and a poor quality of life in general. In February 2016 a friend in her fibromyalgia support group suggested that Kratom may help her and that is when she started taking Kratom. Within less than a hour, she was able to get out of bed and actually function as a person again. She is now able to take part in our family instead of being crippled by fatigue and pain, and also she has been able to keep her full time job as a Sr. Software Engineer. Kratom has allowed her to break her dependency on taking  prescribed  drugs to manage her  symptoms. Kratom doesn't cure her illnesses but it does give her a better quality of life that traditional medicines are not able to provide and does this with no adverse side effects like her prescription medications. Please don't make Kratom a Schedule 1 controlled substance.

Kratom just happened to be in their body along with several, actually harmful drugs. Another example is the 'Krypton' samples listed in the DEA letter of intent, these samples of 'krypton' contained tramadol (O-des), which is another prescription drug that is more harmful than kratom. Its not fair to ban a plant, because of some unscrupulous vendors spiking their products with the more dangerous pharmaceuticals. It would be like banning a blood pressure medication because some batches were contaminated with the wrong drug. That would never happen, the companies that have sent out contaminated, FDA approved drugs, are still in business, and this is with the oversight of the FDA. The beneficial medicine itself would never be subject to banning because of the actions of a few individuals/companies. Ive reviewed all the toxicology reports of so called 'deaths' related to kratom, and still I haven't seen one where somebody died from kratom alone. As usual, its the pharmaceuticals (as with krypton) that are causing the problems.\n\n  Its backward and draconian to ban kratom at a time when its needed the most. People would definitely rather get kratom from a regulated source, as long as its still affordable, but no agencies are willing to help with this task. In fact placing it in Schedule 1 prevents this from happening. Just because something becomes popular (no doubt because of the media) does not mean its a public health risk. In fact its more like a big-pharma crisis since kratom cannot be patented, and it really appears that this move is merely to help big pharma retain its profits, which are ill-gained by keeping America hooked on pharmaceuticals. This is backwards and should not be this way. Concerning the fact that the alkaloid content cannot be guaranteed, again the plant itself should not suffer because of this. Its no different with Kava, anything coming from nature cannot be guaranteed to have the same exact alkaloid content every time (as with 'bad batches' of pharmaceutical drugs). People are willing to accept these fluctuations because the benefit of not letting painkillers control ones life is worth the variation in potency. Even with these variations, kratom is still not very harmful. With the support of the Agencies (FDA/DEA), we can assure a more knowledgeable doctor base as well as a more stable alkaloid content coming from vendors. We need to help these vendors meet regulatory requirements, and we need to help doctors and laboratories continue to get more knowledge about these natural medicines. Alcohol is still a bigger threat to the public than kratom will ever be.\n\n  Another important fact to look at is the states that considered banning kratom, but decided against it. This would not happen if kratom truly was the scourge its purported to be. No State Government would allow a dangerous drug to continue to be sold, after examining it, during this era of RC's and bathsalts. Yet this is exactly what has happened in quite a few states concerning kratom. Thats because after reviewing the evidence that is available, its shown kratom is not as dangerous as was thought. I realize that 'technically' there arent enough US studies done on kratom to determine thats its totally safe, but placing it in schedule 1 just guarantees this outcome. If were going to refer to science as the reason, we should let science do its job un-obstructed by Public and Private interests. Its not an emergency, therefor should not be put up for an emergency ban. 600+ calls to poison control is a very small number, aspirin gets more poison control calls in a year. This pre-emptive war on kratom flies in the face of American values of Freedom and Liberty, not to mention the generally accepted culture of open-ness in science, as well as free market values. If the people are demanding it more and more, that alone is not a reason to ban it. Yet reading the DEA letter of intent, it seems kratoms popularity is the sole reason for its banning. Referring over and over to how much is seized, and how many people are reported to have 'abused' it, is not evidence that it should be banned. Its evidence that the American people have spoken, and they are saying they want a way out of the pharmaceutical trap that has been created for us. The fact that kratom is so popular is more a reason to allow it to remain, rather than banning it. Lets practice safe habits of harm reduction, education and knowledge, and open science, and safe vendor practices. We don't need others to make medical claims, so sure, let shut down those vendors, but the last thing on earth we should do as a Free Nation is ban the plant in its entirety.\n\n  Now passing a law making it 18+ would of course be very reasonable, probably the best option for everyone.\n\nThanks for your time and sincere consideration of the facts.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22659","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a physician that regularly prescribes opiates for pain control, which is quite a vexing problem for prescribers in view of the prevalence of chronic pain in our society & the high abuse potential of opiates, as well as other psychoactive medications. I have many patients who use kratom for chronic pain &/or the depression/anxiety that often accompanies chronic pain. In some cases, patients who use kratom have been able to reduce or even eliminate their use of prescription opiates. Kratom appears to be a relatively safe alternative to opiates & other mind-altering substances that are available either by prescription or on the black market. I'm concerned that if kratom is outlawed altogether, the use of other more hazardous substances to help control patient's symptoms will inevitably increase over time. I believe that more research needs to be performed on the risks & benefits of kratom use before an outright ban is implemented. Sometimes measures that are intended to protect public safety have significant unintended consequences.

There is no call, no solid reason to exacerbate the situation by expanding it to include kratom.  Kratom is said to be very helpful in treating opioid addiction. I myself have no experience with kratom, but even anecdotal evidence that people are using it for good cause should be REASON ENOUGH to not turn it into a crime-and-punishment matter. The nation is weary and fed up with the entire premise of prohibition. Everyone with a clear head and eyes to see has declared it a failure. If your agency moves to 'schedule' kratom as a 'controlled substance', there will inevitably more arrests and incarcerations as a result of more black market activity. Criminalization will eliminate effective uses at least as much if not more so than harmful ones. And it will hamper or end scientific study into medicinal applications. We made a huge mistake with marijuana and ended up with the most people in prison anywhere on the planet, and an unreasonable restriction on research into one of the most effective treatments for numerous conditions.

I am a clinical psychologist and have served on Active Duty in the United States Navy.  I am also a student in psychopharmacology and am currently obtaining a Masters Degree in Clinical Psychopharmacology.  My experience and education has provided me with multiple lenses from which to view Kratom.  \n\nSince hearing about Kratom a few years ago, I was at first skeptical but have learned overtime that it does not appear to have an adverse impact on my patients that use it.  In fact, those who have started or have been using it seem to improve and/or remain stable. Most significantly, my patients who suffer from combat related PTSD have seen major improvements in their relationships with friends and family.  Usually, when a patient presents with PTSD they have withdrawn from family and friends and are extremely anxious and depressed.  I have seen patients not respond to traditional  pharmaceuticals and then use Kratom and ultimately see considerable improvement in their overall symptom profile.  In addition to PTSD patients, I have seen many chronic pain patients during my career.  These patient usually end up addicted/dependent upon opiate pain medications and they ultimately end up extremely depressed and unable to come off their opiates due to the psychological withdrawal that causes a very long period of depression.  I have seen a couple of these patients stop using their opiates and have now started using Kratom.  At first I found this to be alarming and saw it as just a replacement but then I noticed something different.  With my opiate patients their dosages just seemed to keep increasing, while with the Kratom patients, they continued to have the same effect without increasing the dosages.  Additionally, my opiate patients often appeared \"high\" or \"out of it\", while patients that had used Kratom that day appeared completely lucid and coherent.  \n\nIn my own research on Kratom it appears to have different aspects to it than do more traditionally used substances that usually cause addiction.  Kratom appears to have a \"ceiling effect\", meaning even if you increase the dosage, the effect of Kratom does not increase.  Similar to caffeine, when you consume too much caffeine the effects are not visible and/or become uncomfortable.  But I think a lot of people agree that 1-2 cups of coffee get them going in the morning.  They also will tell you they are not addicted to it, but if we made coffee suddenly illegal I guarantee there would but a very large uproar and people would appear that they were addicted.  You can really like something and its effects withoutt it being addictive.  This is very important when it comes to the addiction cycle and the Dopamine Reward System.  Substances that \"light up\" the dopamine reward system in a fast way are more likely to be abused.  This is why \"crack\" cocaine is so highly addictive as is \"shooting up\" heroin.  These substances hit the dopamine circuitry so quickly that the \"reward\" and feeling of pleasure is overwhelming and hence make these substances highly susceptible to addiction and abuse.  Kratom likely has some effect on the dopamine reward system, just like tobacco and caffeine,  however it does not appear that it \"hijacks\" the system such as cocaine, alcohol, and opiates.  There is also research showing that certain strains of Kratom can have an effect on the serotonin system which could account for its anti depressant, anti anxiety effects.  \n\nI am urging you to not schedule Kratom as I have seen it to be very beneficial for a great number of people.  I have not, up to this point, seen anyone have an adverse reaction or  addictive response to this substance.  It scares me to see my patients have to stop using Kratom.  I fear that banning this substance will actually cause great harm to my patients.  I fear that some will start using their opiate medications again, or worse, they won't be able to obtain their opiate medications and will turn to street available drugs such as alcohol or heroin.  There is something very unique about this substance, please do not ban it.  Please allow scientists to research so that they might be able to synthesize medications from the plants useable molecular backbone.  I do have significant fears if this ban were to actually happen.  Thank you for your time.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nAnonymous","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21243","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have a family member who drinks kratom tea to safely and naturally manage her chronic spinal arthritis pain; this herbal supplement significantly improves her quality of life and should remain available on the consumer market rather than controlled as a Schedule 1 substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22972","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steph Piscitiello","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I seriously hope that you reconsider the ban!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1101","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dee Tadlock","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom this may concern,\n\nI am a 31-year old woman with Multiple Sclerosis and Degenerative Disc Disease.

I've since followed various online communities including the r/kratom subreddit as a matter of professional curiosity.  What strikes me about these communties is that there is no undercurrent of death.  This is the only opioid-abusing subculture in modern history that isn't delineated by a numb acceptance of senseless, avoidable death in its midst.  I don't know why, but it appears that kratom doesn't kill people; not even heavy, habitual users who combine it recklessly with other drugs.  Everything we know about opioids says some death should be inevitable, but it apparently isn't because there's not one fatality on record which can be attributed to kratom with certai.  In my limited experience and observation nearly all of the heaviest kratom users have a history of addiction to other opiates, and many have happily and successfully given them up with the help of kratom, a drug which they successfully self-prescribe and self-manage without expected complications such as overdose or escalating tolerance.  In the face of the current opiate crisis, this makes it something like the holy grail.  It goes without saying that understanding how kratom works could revolutionize pain and addiction management and save countless lives.  Scheduling kratom will have the immediate effect of driving many of the most vulnerable users back to heroin, pills or other opiates and some of these souls will die preventable deaths as a result.  Furthermore, for the DEA to burden researchers by placing kratom in Schedule I (making it the law of the land that kratom has no medical value) before there can even be an honest clinical assessment of its medical potential represents dereliction of the Agency's mission to protect the public from those opiates which are actually killing people in America like never before- many of which have already been ruled as safe and effective by the DEA.

Since 2005, I have received 3 DUIs, I became homeless and struggled to find work, or the energy to even want to be a part of society again. I do not use illicit drugs.\nSince discovering Kratom in early 2016, I have completely been able to stop drinking, no cravings whatsoever. My mood is stable. I was determined to find work, and I  finally had the energy to do so. I am happy to say I have been hired at a job after showing my dependability at a temp agency, and again have stable living arrangements and most importantly, HOPE.  I am  even volunteering in the community. I have always found it important to give to others, but I was so depressed and sad I was completely unable.\nKratom does not get me \"high\", I simply feel like I used to feel before life happened. Taking \"more\" does not make me feel any different other than nauseated, so I don't. Some days I feel great anyway and I don't take any, but the fact that I have it to take when I need it has been a life saver for me. In addition, I pay for my own health needs out of pocket, I am pulling my own weight and not burdening society in any way.\nPlease do not take away the ONLY true relief I have found in years and years. I cried when I found out about a possible ban, My only hope is that this public input will be seriously considered and a ban avoided. Please allow me to continue to rebuild my life without the threat of criminalization. I have too much to give and everything to lose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14240","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Beth Van Nostrand","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 52 year old female and a full time hairstylist.

I feel like it has helped save my life; in the sense that had I continued using street drugs, I would probably have overdosed and died by now. \nIt should certainly remain avaliable to any and all persons wanting to use it. If it's not, the opiate epidemic will almost without a doubt intensify and get much, much worse. People are dying out there. Don't take a plant with thousands of years of recorded use (not one death attributed to kratom alone) and ban it. It's a great alternative to traditional opiate painkillers and it is so much safer. \nPlease think this all the way through. Think about the people who's lives could be improved by getting off street drugs and onto kratom.

Moreover, kratom is a critical option of recourse for pain patients, including many who are currently trying to quit opioids or might otherwise become addicted to opioids.

Thousands of years of the use of kratom has yielded no evidence that the herb poses any such risks. To deny my daughter and millions of other Americans coping with numerous mental health issues access to kratom would constitute an injustice of monstrous proportions, create a massive black market of illegal kratom commerce, and inordinately tax the resources of the DEA -- which I hope, as a tax payer, has more important battles to fight.

I just want to voice my opinions on and experience of using  kratom (mitragyna speciosa). I have been taking kratom off and on for roughly five years. Which is to say I will take kratom for several months then stop for several months. I use it to help alleviate severe anxiety and depression and find it helps me to \"deal\" with hard situations in life. Such as recently when my mother was diagnosed with cancer. I am unable to take most prescription anxiety medications due to the side effects such as lethargy and severe shakes. Kratom on the other hand alleviates my anxiety with virtually no side effects. In my opinion there are two things that make kratom superior to prescription anxiety medications such as Xanax. Firstly, when kratom is taken as directed, as an herbal supplement, it does not induce lethargy and an inability to function in daily life when enough is taken to alleviate my anxiety and the same can not be said for Xanax. Secondly and probably most importantly is I am able to take it for several months and stop \"cold turkey\" with no physical side effects. The first and last time I used Xanax to treat anxiety I only used it for a 2-3 week period. At the end of that several week period I experienced what I believe to be withdraw symptoms caused by the Xanax. I was unable to sleep and felt very uncomfortable physically for 3 or 4 days. Kratom has never had that negative effect on me and I expect it never will after 5 years of use. The fact that the DEA has determined there are no medical uses for kratom but there are medical uses for Xanax and other worthless addictive prescription anxiety medications is pure insanity.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3167","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeffrey Elliott","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have never tried Kratom, but in the interest of freedom, I am in favor of keeping Kratom legal","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17640","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nalin Nair","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't make Kratom a sched 1 substance.

I am writing to express my deep gratitude that I have found a treatment for my physical and emotional issues in Kratom. For most of my life, beginning at age 14, I have had chronic and severe depression, anxiety and developed a substance abuse problem that destroyed much of my life and ultimately hurt my children and family deeply for many years. I also almost died several times from Opiod overdoses as I lost many friends to it. I was able to enter recovery 7 years ago and have been clean and sober ever since. However, my original issues of depression and anxiety have remained something that has caused me continued pain and discomfort and maladjustment to life. Pharmaceutical drugs often made the situation worse or did not help at all. I started using Kratom about 3 years ago for my depression and anxiety and substance abuse issue and have found it to be a wonderful medicinal plant which bears many benefits with virtually no side effects. It is not something I \"get high' on, rather it has rendered my depression and anxiety to being non existent any longer and I have been able to adjust to a healthy and productive life where I provide support for my kids and show up as a \"clean and PRESENT mom\" for my kids. At the very worst if I take a bit more that I need I get a little nautious. And I have stopped cold turkey and experienced very mild withdrawl effects that are comparable to a bit more than coffee but not much. And it completely takes my cravings for Opiates away and allows me to keep my life on track. Please do not put the active ingredients in Kratom as Schedule 1 substances, that is not the appropriate place for them. Doing so would hurt millions of people who use this plant responsibly and depend on it for safe pain relief and the safe relief of a myriad of medical issues. It clearly has numerous medical benefits with very little risk, certainly the risk is nowhere near the horrendous side effects and risks associated with pharmaceutical drugs. We as a people have a right to choose a natural treatment that works for us and use it responsibly without being criminalized. Virtually any substance can be misused by the few and immature irresponsible users that do so. Please do not take something of such great value away from us. Please allow it to remain available for us. \n\nEarnestly,\n\nAllisun Sturges\n661-496-8899\nallisunsturges@allisunsturges.com","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16101","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Allisun Sturges","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not place kratom on the list of scheduled drugs.

I am a 49 year old woman, an artist, a professional painter, a mother to two spectacular college students, a law-abiding American citizen, and a kratom user.  I use kratom as part of my daily health regimen.  It helps with the aches and pains of my very physical job as well as the occasional anxiety that comes from being a single mother trying to raise the two best human beings I know - my son and my daughter.  I vehemently oppose the scheduling of the herbal supplement kratom, and believe this healthful herb should remain obtainable and available to all those who wish to benefit from it. Although I would be beyond disappointed if I were unable to lawfully utilize and enjoy my kratom tea, it is not for myself that I am most concerned.\n     Since the DEA first threatened to emergency schedule kratom, I have watched dozens of video testimonials at #iamkratom, #kratomsaveslives and #keepkratomlegal. Many have been very effective and memorable, but none have been so heartbreaking as the numerous memorial videos of the lives that have been tragically lost to opiate overdoses. Photo after photo after photo of beautiful people - mothers, fathers, sons, daughters. Children the same age as my children, on the brink of adulthood, the victims of one misstep that cost them everything.  The loss is staggering and the tragedy overwhelming.  Kratom, a simple botanical, helps to alleviate the agony of withdrawal and seems to help many addicts to resist the cravings for opiates. I have seen this with my own eyes, not to mention the anecdotal evidence of hundreds of such success stories that I have read online. I believe that adding kratom to the plethora of prohibited substances would contribute to the already unfathomable numbers of tragic and needless overdose deaths.\n     Here is a better scenario:  substance abuse management through harm reduction.  Scott Kellogg PhD (past president of the Div. on Addictions of the NYS Psychological Assoc. and clinical assistant professor in the New York University Dept. of Psychology), in his article in the publication The Influence, entitled \"Addiction Treatment Should Be the Work of Liberation\", said this - \"Harm reduction has been on of the most astounding success stories of the past 30 years, saving the lives and health of untold millions of drug users, their families and their loved ones\". I am personally aware of several addicts successfully breaking free from the crippling prison of addiction with the help of kratom. Simply by including kratom in their daily regimen, they are able to get healthy once again, to see and think clearly, to work productively, to live and love again, with minimal or negligible side effects.  theinfluence.org/addiction-treatment-should-be-the-work-of-liberation-but-what-does-such-a-model-look-like/\n     From the same article by Dr. Kellogg, he defines freedom. From the slavery of addiction to liberation. Freedom is defined in 3 aspects.\n  1.)  the ability to live a life of both internal and social complexity and multiplicity.\n  2.)  the possibility and the power to choose from an array of options.\n  3.)  the ability to consistently engage in purposeful and meaningful goal-oriented behavior over an extended period of time.\n     I can say without reservation that this liberation defines my life. And kratom only enhances this liberation.  In viewing the countless videos at #iamkratom and the others, you can see this freedom, and the heartfelt plea to keep kratom available to ensure the continued liberation of the users of kratom. And, above all, if the harm reduction that is made possible through the choice to include kratom in a healthful regimen, remains an option to all those suffering from addiction to opiates,  then the benefits of kratom's continued legality does far outweigh any negatives.  By far. \n     My name is Susan. I am a woman, an artist, a mother and this is my testimony for kratom.  I am kratom. \n\nSincerely,\nSusan Justin Hoak","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17894","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"susan hoak","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Don't ban kratom. \n\nNo more prohibitions!

I live in Denver, CO. While I reside in a state where I could smoke weed legally, I choose not to do so. This is because I have found something much safer for pain, kratom. For 7 years I lived in chronic back pain and the doctors had me on Percocet, Dilaudid, Valium, and Exalgo. I felt terrible every single day. Finally, about two years ago, I told the doctors no more. I will no longer live in a fog. I took myself off all my medications, began meditating daily, visualized myself as a person living pain free, and healed my back! A back every doctor said needed surgery to heal, I healed by sheer will and determination alone. I have suffered from migraines since I was 7 years old, so for almost 30 years now. I used to have 3-4 a week, but now I am down to 2-4 a month! I am using the same techniques I used to heal my back. While I am constantly improving, I need kratom to help me function on the days the migraines do come. Perimenopause at my age is rare, but it does happen, and for those of us with migraines, they increase during this time. \n\nDoctors only want to give me antidepressants (which I don't believe in because I've seen the benefits of meditation and limitless thinking), Topamax (which causes kidney stones), or medication for bi-polar disorder (which I do not suffer from). As a forensic investigator, I obsessively research everything. All these drugs are dangerous, kratom is not. Anytime I can take a plant over a synthetic drug, I will do it. Anytime I can meditate vs. popping a pill, I will. \n\nWhile I do everything I can to take a natural approach, there are times still in which I need assistance, and kratom has helped me so much in my healing process. I'd like you to know that I have taken all the \"safe\" big pharma drugs for pain, and nothing has worked as well as kratom. I don't live in a fog when I take it, I can safely operate a vehicle, and I can continue on with my day instead of suffering in bed. I run my own business and I need to be able to function. Please don't take that away from me. \n\nRealistically, we know that alcohol is the most dangerous of all the drugs, yet it remains legal. We know big pharma kills thousands upon thousands every single year. Kratom has not killed anyone. While some may have had kratom in their system, those 16 people who have died also had something else in common, they had big pharma meds in their systems as well. In a state where almost everyone smokes Miss Mary Jane, I see how just how much safer kratom is in comparison. Marijuana is much safer than big pharma drugs, and kratom is even safer than that.  \n\nThank you for your time, and please allow those of us who choose holistic and natural approaches to continue to live the lives we choose. \n\nSincerely, \nAmanda Gardiner","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1272","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amanda Gardiner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Based on all my research on Kratom and it's long history of medicinal uses by native peoples, I'm very concerned about the prospect of this plant becoming illegal.

This plant is more closely related to coffee than tea is, and it works about the same. It gives you a feeling of peace and well being, a better mood and outlook, and it gives you a little bit of energy. Now all of this is subtle, its nothing like a narcotic or like the pills the doctor gave me when i cut my toe off. Those pain pills knocked me out, made me feel sick and nauseas, and pretty much incapacitated me. Kratom, on the other hand, does none of those things and is only helpful no matter how i look at it.\n\nI also have ran out several several times and I want to rebuke those who claim there is withdrawal symptoms. The only symptom from kratom 'withdrawals' has been that i know i didn't take kratom. You don't feel bad at all or anything, and i never even got caffeine headaches from quitting/running out of coffee. I compare it to coffee a lot, and i take it early in the morning with my coffee. So running out of kratom is about the same, but not as bad, as running out of coffee as far as withdrawal symptoms. No headache, no stomach problems, no anything accept the knowledge that you didn't take kratom. i.e. the energy isn't there, and that ever so slight and subtle feeling of euphoria isn't there. No mood problems with or without it that i've noticed, and I and my wife take it together with the same reports on it all.\n\nI hope that you would reconsider making a plant that is natural and has been used for hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years. My wife has degenerative disk disease and she used kratom to get off the horrible pain pills the doctors tried to keep her on. They were keeping her sick, destroying her liver, and just are not a viable 'long-term' option for pain management. She'll never get better, her back won't ever heal itself, the disks are fading to nothing in her spine, and this has been the only thing that lets her get out of bed, go to work, bend over, and live a normal life that she can stay on indefinitely.\n\nPlease don't take any more of our freedoms away. Marijuana was made illegal for so long, and now its legal in like 14 states. Alcohol was illegal as well, and no longer is. So what is the point of making anything illegal, expecially something like kratom that is NO WHERE NEAR AS BAD as alcohol, or other elicit substances. Not even close. not even on the same page. not even in the same book. Thank you for your time and consideration and I hope you have a most wonderful day.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3609","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"STP Helps & PC Doctor","postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"joshua seal","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep this legal.

With prescription drug addiction being a huge problem in our country I don't know why we would try to make something illegal that is working for people. It seems to me that the DEA may want to make it illegal because it is actually working and the less people that are drug addicts then the less they can justify their organization. Putting drug addicts in jail supports a lot of people in this country. It pays DEA agents, judges, cops, lawyers, private prisons, and many more. I hope keeping people addicted is not the reason to try to make kratom illegal but it sure seems like it. Also kratom seems to be working wonders for people with chronic pain and I am sure the pharmaceutical industry is not happy about people not taking their pills and getting addicted because they will loose profits. If people can find a way to manage pain without taking opiates it seems to me that we would be praising this instead of trying to ban it. I think before anything is done more research should be done. If it is banned now people using it for pain management will have to turn back to opiates and drug addicts will have to go back to taking drugs. If this is what you want then I guess you will ban it anyway. I think we should start to put people's well being ahead of company profits.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15735","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Melvyn Belcher","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban Kratom.

I friend of mine recommended that I tried Kratom as he found it provided some much needed energy when needed. I am a 53 year old husband and father of two lively boys ages 10 and 7. I am also an IT System Analyst at a Fortune 500 company. I typically use about 3-5 grams of powered leaf before breakfast and 5-8 grams before dinner. I find that I have more energy and greater focus at work when I use Kratom. I am certainly not high or impaired in any way. To the contrary I am simply more productive. My late afternoon Kratom allows me to be more engaged with my family than I otherwise would be able to. I describe Kratom to friends as just a better form of coffee. While it does have analgesic and anxiety relieving properties which I appreciate they are not my primary reason for using Kratom. I have once in my life been prescribed oxycodone and Kratom isn't close. Remembering my brief experience with prescription opiates I'd put it this way. If oxycodone is a 10 on a 1-10 scale, coffee being a 2, then Kratom is a 3 or 4.  It certainly helps me be more engaged and productive and as I said is just s better, less jittery, alternative to coffee.\n\nI'm hoping that the DEA/FDA will reconsider the scheduling if this benign plant. Our prisons are already full enough and we don't need to make criminals of millions of ordinary, productive citizens overnight. Considering that in the next 24 hours probably over 10x more people will loose their lives due to alchohol related causes (~250) than have ever been recorded as related to Kratom I think it is just ridiculous to even consider scheduling this plant.\n\nI hope you will reconsider. \n\nSincerely,\n\nDouglas Steckel","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4681","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Douglas Steckel","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am sure you have heard all the great testimonials.

I was too young and the opiate epidemic was still little known to the general public and I didn't advocate for myself and ask enough questions to the doctor. That was my mistake. I should have acted out of a now commonplace stance that you can never trust your doctor. I do not begrudge doctors. They were being fed invalid information from the Purdue pharma and for that reason I cannot in good conscience hold them at fault. However, over the course of the next decade I became what I now refer to as \"hopelessly addicted\" too piste based pain killers. I lost many things on the process. The degree I was pursuing in Aerospace Engineering eventually had to be abandoned. My relationships with friends and family were put under impossible strain to the point where they had to just let me go. I hurt many people in pursuit of my addiction and it's empty promises. I eventually ended up at a place of total surrender. I could not go on like I had been but to move forward and live sober seemed impossible for had I not tried that very thing so many times before? This time I sought help in the very place the problem began, a doctors office. I was prescribed a medication called Suboxone. Though it proved to not be the real answer I needed it did provide a temporary respite from the insanity from whence I came. I stayed off pain killers and all other drugs and alcohol for 3 years with the help of Suboxone. At that time I began to feel compelled to get off of Suboxone. A friend recommended a little known herb at the time called Kratom. I began to mix a teaspoon of this herb into my tea each morning in place of my usual Suboxone dose. The result was truly miraculous. In a few short weeks I was completely off of Suboxone and had escaped its powerful withdrawal symptoms. That was just about 2 years ago now. About a year ago I decided to stop taking Kratom daily and started managing the lingering pain I was feeling through other means. Occasionally I will invest some of this in the form of tea when my back is feeling particularly strained. Through my access to Kratom I have been able to have a good and free life. I've gotten married and started a family. I also started a business and I find I'm able to support myself and my family. These may not sound like miraculous achievements to the average person but to me they are unbelievable. I never thought I could get out of the cycle of addiction. With the help of Kratom I did just that and so much more. I am actively involved in several voluntary recovery communities in my hometown where I know scores of individuals who have reached freedom through the exact same means. To take Kratom off the market would be a death sentence to many addicts yet to come. This plant is so innocuous in its effects and so mild in its stimulation that to force government action to remove it from the market just seems asinine. Don't take my word for it, go try some yourself. You will quickly see that this substance has hardly a chance to hurt even the most susceptible among us. \n\nWhat we need is regulation of its distribution. I have read of a few cases(rumors) online where Kratom was ordered over the Internet but was actually cut with some unknown substance that caused much more aggregious side affects. Thankfully I never had this happen. If the ingredients in the Kratom distributors products were tested and verified this issue wouldn't exist. It is my sincere hope and prayer that someone, somewhere involved in our DEAs decision to ban or to not ban this substance reads this letter and understands my words. Our fellow Americans are dying of opiate addiction by the tens of thousands. We need to have access to a way out alternative to just taking different pills. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7472","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joel Santora","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"A drug that is being used for medicinal purposes, to relieve pain, or elevate someones well being in another form, that does not endanger the lives of other humans should not be illegal.

Although in my area the predominant type of OD we see in the ER is stimulant-related, opioid overdoses are not unheard of. I believe that kratom potentially has an important medical use, specifically for those trying to wean off of opioids or those abstaining from opioids. Additionally, it is not known to cause respiratory depression. We desperately need to study this property further in order to isolate its mechanism. This could open the door to new analgesics without adverse respiratory effects.\n\nAll substances have a dose at which they become toxic. Additional study of kratom may allow us to learn the mechanism of its toxicity, and potentially develop an antidote. It will also allow us to document its adverse effects. For example, does it cause constipation like typical opioids? If not, I can see it being a treatment alternative for chronic pain patients.\n\nI would also like to point out that the potential for abuse is not known. However, this is testable and I would like to see scientific evidence documenting the potential for abuse of kratom before classifying it as Schedule I. I understand that it has been involved in 15 drug-related deaths over the past 2 years, but that 14 of those cases involved polypharmacy. Going by those numbers alone, (since the total number of users does not seem to be available) it seems far safer than any opioid on the market or on the street. Again, more science documenting the relative safety or danger of kratom is needed.\n\nFinally, I hope you consider the ramifications of scheduling these substances on our justice system. Many kratom users are just people trying to deal with chronic pain, addiction, or withdrawal. Enacting this proposal will either turn them into criminals (because they will still be using it) or it will force them to use opioids which may have more risks. I do not believe the punishment for carrying a Schedule I substance fits the \"crime\" in this case.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0082","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe that kratom should be legal for three reasons.\n\n1) Kratom has been imported to the United States (and sold for therapeutic purposes) for over thirty years, which would .\"grandfather\" it under the regulations pertaining to dietary supplements.\n\n2) Kratom has been proven to provide relief to the symptoms of many medical issues, and provides critical support for those individuals who suffer from pain and other maladies.\n\n3) Kratom is a reasonable, natural alternative to opiates, and could in the future be used to treat addiction to pharmaceutical pain killers.\n\nThank you for your attention.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9420","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Phil Anderson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has changed my life drastically.

Please do not make this plant...herb ...tree a scheduled 1 controlled substance. I use many natural supplements and feel safe using this as well. As an adult I like the freedom to choose what I put into my body. I have seen the negative affects of smoking and alcohol .... both of which are legal substances and I choose not to consume either....my adult choice. Please know that there will always be people that abuse everything and some that do not. Choices are freedoms. Kratom does not harm anyone it helps millions. Please let it be available as a personable choice...like coffee, wine, alcohol, and tea.

Today, I have 5 months clean, so I am relatively new in recovery, but my recovery is a testament that Kratom can be used to help struggling addicts come off of heavy opioid based substances. I think that the biggest problem in helping our society become free from addiction is that a major belief in the clinical realm is that alternative treatments such as the use of suboxone and methadone can be effectively used to manage these addictions. Coming from a past of opioid addiction, ranging from pharmaceutical pain killers to heroin, I can honestly say that attempting to transition to suboxone or methadone had no real effect on my addiction. Contrary to medical belief, seeking help from these clinics only resulted in exchanging one addiction to another. While suboxone and methadone did not yield the same \"high\" as pain killers, it was still similar enough that it was not long before I began abusing both suboxone and methadone with each attempt with the substance, and my addiction to suboxone and/or methadone began to affect my daily life as bad as my addiction to pain killers had. When I found out about Kratom, I was seeking to quit taking suboxone, and I was highly skeptic as to whether trying it would be once again switching addictions, but I did not recieve a \"high\" from kratom, but it was very effective in reducing my withdrawal symptoms, and after 3 weeks of daily use of Kratom brewed into tea twice a day with approxiamately 4 to 5 grams per tea, I was able to stop ingesting kratom with no withdrawal symptons. Furthermore, I have been able to keep Kratom around as an emergency back-up i nthe case of uprising pain killer cravings. Whenever I get these cravings, I can brew some tea, mix in the Kratom, and it helps with curbing the cravings, without any subsequent craving to use the kratom after that day. Kratom has been wonderful in helping to restore my life and allowing me to return to society as a functioning and contributing member of society, and I strongly believe that incorporating the use of this herbal supplement would be in the best interest of our society in further healing the wounds of addiction in others' lives.

He is a father, husband and sole bread-winner of the family. This is in response to the DEA's intention to make Kratom a Schedule I substance. It includes a great amount of information on what Kratom is and the what will happen if the DEA goes through with the emergency scheduling.\n\nThanks,\nDonald\n\nDear DEA,\n \nPlease remove Mitragynine & 7-hydroxymitragynine which is in Kratom from becoming a Schedule I substance.\n \nI am 29 and suffer from a herniated disc, chronic neck pain, TMJ, arthritis in my neck. I support a family of four on a single income. I have been to many doctors with little success for treatment. I have found that Kratom greatly improves my quality of lifeand allows me to work. It isnt comparable to any drugs, marijuana, alcohol or other stimulants.  Kratom helps to improve my quality of life that I suffer with chronic pain. Please dont make this herb illegal. Cervical injections, botox injections, chiropractic care, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, yoga exercises have not helped with my pain.\n \nKratom is a well-known, well-researched herbal substance drawn from the leaves of trees within the coffee family. The number of cases of documented harm from kratom use is remarkably low, both as an absolute matter and when considered against the extensive history of use of kratom, both inside and outside the United States\n \nMitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are two of the primary alkaloids of this plant. These two compounds are not synthetic and should not be lumped together with  \"bath salts\" or \"spice\".\n \nKratom has been used as a medicine by many people for thousands of years. It is a potent remedy for physical pain, anxiety and depression, and could be used to aid with opiate withdrawal by those who would like to quit using illicit drugs such as heroin. Kratom is NOT a hallucinogen and should not be classified as such. Adding mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as a Schedule I substance is rash and unjustified prohibition, resulting in a foreseeable increase in street drug-related crime, as well as a punishment to those who are currently using it responsibly to treat various ailments.\n\nThe reason that there are no deaths solely attributed to Kratom is because Kratom does not affect your respiratory capacity. It does not slow down your central nervous system. It's potential to do harm is virtually impossible.\n\nKratom has very limited recreational capacity.  The White House petition has over 100,000 signatures for the \"Please do not make Kratom a Schedule I Substance.\" \n\nThe federal government has invested significant resources to develop alternative pain management strategies. This includes a study funded by the National Institutes of Health in partnership with the University of Massachusetts and the University of Mississippi to investigate the use of Kratom as a remedy for opioid withdrawal. This study led the researchers to apply for a patent identifying the Kratom extract, mitragyinine, as a useful treatment for other addictive drugs besides opiate derivatives. The DEAs decision to place Kratom as a Schedule I substance will put a halt on federally funded research and innovation surrounding the treatment of individuals suffering from opioid and other addictionsa significant public health threat. Remember the DDear Colleague Letters of Senator Hatch and Congressman Mark Pocan.\n \nWe hope you realize the threat this scheduling causes the people seeking legitimate use of this special plant to improve our quality of life.

From my education and training in pharmacology and pathophysiology in conjunction with my years of professional experience, I have seen nothing but positive results from kratom use.  I see patients every day in my ER either in severe withdrawal or having overdosed on potent narcotics such as heroin.  Every single day, I see the effects of serious opioid addiction and abuse on both the individual and their community.  Then kratom started becoming more well known to the general public, and I have even had several former patients come in for a non-opioid related medical condition state how using kratom has weaned them off of their harrowing heroin addiction.  I have seen patients with chronic pain from numerous conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis to malignant cancer state the benefits of kratom in allowing them to return to their regular activities; no longer are they hampered by the severe pain that once governed their lives.  I wish to unequivocally state that I never, not once seen a patient that has overdosed from kratom and required life saving interventions.  Never, nor have any of my colleagues.  In short, banning kratom would be banning something that has almost nothing but positive use in the community.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5673","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Hartman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 23 year old mother of 2. I have a 2 going on 3 year old son named Harrison Marshall and a 4 month old daughter named Evelyn Rose. I've always had a job. I've had jobs ranging from restaurant server, cake decorator clothing store manager & even a full detention aid at the juvenile justice center. I've always had a great work ethic, and received many acknowledgements for my work ethic. I was a college student majoring in psychology with a 4.0. \nAfter I had my son, I went on steady spiral down with depression and anxiety. I went and got some help from a therapist, that I could see with healthcare USA at the time. I really invested and it did nothing for me, except get harder and harder to get out of bed every day. Once some of the postpartum hormones leveled out after having my son, I was still depressed and anxious but could function in society at a minimum. \nFast Forward. I was a full time online student, two jobs, 1 toddler, pregnant and Fiance was an over the road truck driver. I handled it well for a while. Then my depression and anxiety got worse. I started by quitting one job. Then it turned into quitting one job and dropping out of school. (Acquiring a bunch of debt from losing my FAFSA grant and no degree.) I've always been determined to finish what I would start, and I couldn't do it. I wanted an education to set an example for my children and to be able to provide for them better, and I dropped it all only 1 1/2 semesters from an Associate Degree in Psychology. Then it turned into Quitting one job, dropping out of school and then only working 2 days a MONTH. So what did I do with all this new acquired time? I laid in bed all day. I would not go downstairs in my townhouse, because there was too much Iight. would only feel \"comfort\" in my bed with all light blocked out and my door closed. I would hear cars routinely drive by outside my house, and just hearing them gave me so much anxiety my legs would go numb, my heart would palpitate and my breath would become rapid. If someone would knock on my door, I would harbor the exact same anxiety and cover my head under my blankets.  I never could answer my phone. I only answered my phone for my fianc. I couldn't talk to my own parents or siblings unless I built myself up for it for days. I always had anxiety of what people were thinking of me, and couldn't hold conversations. I would literally just shut down. People would ask me questions and I would just sat and there staring at the ground. The saddest part? At this point I still had my son witnessing this. He saw it so much that when he woke up, he automatically brought his toys to my bed and played in my bed all day until my fianc got home. I tried. I really, really tried and I couldn't be a good mom to him. After taking care of his necessities: eating, diapering, bathing, clothing, I felt so depleted. I cried every night. I suffered from insomnia at night from anxiety & fighting sleeping all day because of my depression. My illnesses robbed my son of a mother. My fianc switched jobs and Found something local so I wasn't alone. It didn't help my depression and anxiety. So I asked my obstetrics doctor for medication. I tried celexa. I almost killed myself. It made me suicidal and made my self worth feel at a zero. I told my doctor and we stopped that medication and didn't get anymore.  Then I had my daughter, still suffering from my major anxiety and depression. Then from my delivery, something happened to my sciatic nerve and I suffer from sciatica. I tried to get more help for depression and anxiety after I had my daughter. My ob prescribed me some Prozac, and it yielded the same results. Now I have fallen through the cracks. Unmarried, no sole income,  so no insurance. I couldn't get any other form of Medicaid because Chris makes $45k. After taxes and our kids insurance he brings home  approx. $800/week. He works 60 hour weeks every week. We can barely make ends  meet as it is. So I can't afford full price for any treatment.\n\nThen comes Kratom. Kratom saved my life. It gave my children their mother back. It gave Christopher his fianc back. It gave my family their daughter/sister back. It helps my sciatica to where I can walk. I can answer my phone, the door and I can even go on walks and go to grocery stores. I don't stare at the same four walls anymore. I open the blinds and the curtains. I clean my house. I am happy. My family is happy. I can play with my kids. Do you know how amazing that is? To be able to take your kid outside with the sun shining on you listening to his innocent laughter, and encouraging my fourth month old to roll over and talk, and to show her new things. I don't want to lose that. I don't want my mothering to be stripped back down to nothing from depression and anxiety. My diseases took away everything else for me. My family and God is all I have left, and I can't lose my family too.  I just wanted to let you know what impact Kratom has had on my life. God bless.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5041","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Delissa Coureton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is not a synthetic drug.

I understand that the current regulation states that Kratom is NOT to be used for human consumption, but if anecdotal evidence is clearly recorded to not be dangerous, perhaps we need more research to justify the use of the plant. If people can safely medicate with a plant against regulations, can't we consider different regulations and studies to show people should be allowed to consume it?\n\nTruthfully, it will be a blow to freedom to take this plant away from the American public. Adults should have the right to put in their bodies' what they choose, please keep this plant legal. Keeping this plant legal will also prevent the use of even harder drugs like full opioid agonists.\n\nIf an FDA approved pharmaceutical (fentanyl, morphine, oxycontin) is legal and has medically accepted value, then a plant which is not even a full opioid should also have accepted value since it's not as dangerous, and can be proven to be so.\n\nHowever, the anecdotal evidence shows great promise for medically accepted value, so I'm sure it wouldn't be hard for Kratom to also be scientifically proven to be beneficial for the sick.\n\nWe need to not let this go unheard, and the sick should be able to choose which medicine they want to use.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14546","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom saved my friend's life.

I am an entertainer, an entrepreneur and a financial coordinator for several Nonprofit Organizations in my community. As a tax-paying, voting, active member of my community, I am universally and unequivocally opposed to the prohibition of Kratom in any form.\n\nFrankly, my reasoning could be solely founded on the violent and costly ongoing failure that is the war on drugs in this country or on the cognitive dissonance created by a patriotic organization that prides our country as the \"land of the free\" while aggressively moving to infringe on the freedoms of people they have been charged with protecting. I would be remiss if I had not mentioned those larger issues as they relate to the Kratom discussion, but ultimately they aren't pertinent to this letter specifically. The focus of my remarks today will be on my own experience with this innocuous plant.\n\nI have been suffering from widespread and severe chronic pain since I was a child as a result of injuries I incurred from birth defects and the surgeries conducted to repair them. The pains I have today are the same as the ones I had when I was a child- except worse now as the nature of my condition is permanent and degenerative. I was classified by the government as legally \"disabled\" when I was a minor, but was unable to obtain said status as an adult due to administrative conditions at the disability office and the expensive legal hurdles it would require to circumvent them. As a result, I have had great difficulty obtaining medical care AND pain management services throughout my adult life.\n\nAfter having seen physical therapists and pain management specialists for years, having been prescribed prescription narcotics, I eventually was unable to afford these things out of pocket. Also, the prescription narcotics were both expensive and after a short while ineffective.\n\nFinally, after I had run out of money and options, I came across Kratom. It was about six years ago. After trying it out, I discovered that it was an effective supplement to my dietary routine that SIGNIFICANTLY lowered my pain. I have experienced no side effects and have been able to use it in moderation with ZERO problems involving dependency or addiction in over six years of usage.\n\nKratom is one of the most important components of my daily regimen. It is instrumental in helping me to maintain a normal life and provide for my family. I can't think of one good reason that I or anyone else should be deprived of unobstructed and affordable access to this monumentally helpful plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3165","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Miles Bosworth","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\"Please do not place kratom on the list of Scheduled drugs.

But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.\"\n\nHe was basically saying that he cant exactly define what pornography is, but he absolutely knows it when he sees it. That is the exact common sense logic that can be used in regards to drugs and chemicals. What really defines an illicit \"drug\"? Coffee and alcohol both totally qualify under certain definitions, but most people would never call them an illicit substance. But cocaine, PCP, and heroin? EVERYONE would agree that these are substances that cause terrible societal issues. They know it when they see it.\n\nThe effects of kratom are very analagous to coffee. Slight energy, slight mood elevation, very subtle. You'll often forget you have even had any. It is exponentially less potent than alcohol.\n\nI lost three friends to heroin and prescription drugs. I have several friends that occasionally use kratom. They all have great jobs, great familes, great health, and bright futures. A couple of those friends are former drug abusers that used kratom to effectively cycle off of heroin. Kratom literally helped them kick one of the most addictive and lethal drugs that plague our society.\n\nAmerica is a land of freedom and opportunity. People want to be able to make their own choices and choose their own destiny. Banning every natural plant that people use for minor relief from their daily pains and struggles is a pursuit that does not make our country greater or stronger. It tears us apart. There are genuine problems and societal concerns to address. Kratom does not appear to be one of them.

However when I have period cramps that basically cripple me from moving a small amount of kratom relaxes my muscles just enough to get me through the day without feeling the pain or being unable to drive from taking a pain medication. I am also able to work through a normal work day with a clear mind and no blurred thoughts. Again I do not use kratom recreationally  I do use it occasionally for pain management. \n We have several thousand customers that we serve with our online company and I get emails and comments from them daily with success stories of getting off of opioids or other drugs or even alcohol or other prescription drugs by getting kratom. We also have many people that are looking for an all natural alternative for pain management after surgeries and such and the government SHOULD OFFER AN ALL NATURAL ALTERNATIVE SUCH as KRATOM. I can totally see getting rid of some vendors that add unnatural things to their kratom but not banning the natural companies. Maybe even potentially licensing a couple as natural medicine companies.

In my twenties, without knowing exactly what I was dealing with, I developed an addiction to opiates. Though I have not let addiction destroy my life, periodic exposure to opiates would always mean difficult times. I still deal with depression and anxiety related to this time in my life, but having the option to use Kratom has been a welcomed relief when options to use opiates arose again. I find I am able to decline these opportunities, while using only very small amounts of Kratom. In fact, while I used Kratom daily at first, my consumption has declined to intermittent use. However, banning Kratom (I have never heard of nor experienced negative side-effects) would keep a viable and safe alternative treatment to those wishing to conquer opiate addiction. It seems like a recipe for filling jails, tearing families apart, and selling more \"legal\" drugs.

Lots of drug money has been spent to be sure that Kratom stays out there on the \nmarket.\nIn the summer of 2013, my 36 year old son, Guy Garcia, began using Kratom to help with depression. He later told me that \nhe became addicted to it after taking it ONLY 3 TIMES!\nHis life deteriorated after that & by the fall his wife had kicked him out of the house & he was living with his step-father and\nme. \nHe tried narc-a-non, but could not work the program. We were paying for private counseling for him to kick Kratom & get his \nlife back on track. We did not realize that he was still using.\nOn the evening of December 24, 2013, after what I believe was his last ingestion of this \"harmless herb,\" he had a grand-\nmal seizure in our home.  Needless to say, it was horrific. His 3 year old son saw the whole thing! The seizure was very long \n& when it ended, he had no pulse & no respiration. My husband performed CPR until Paramedics arrived. When we \nmentioned Kratom they immediately knew it was a possible overdose. They finally got his heart beating after long work & \nleft for the ER at Denver Health Medical Center. His heart stopped again on the way to the ER & they got it beating again.\nOnce in the ER, his heart stopped again. The Doctors were told of his Kratom use & treated him as a possible overdose.\nAfter about an hour, they stabilized his heart beat & did a C.A.T. scan on the way to I.C.U. They tried to give us hope.\nHe was kept on life support until December 16, since he never regained consciousness. They did the tests to prove brain\ndeath. He was brain dead & on the morning of December 17, Donor Alliance took him away. The only good thing that came\nout of his death was that he saved 5 lives with donated organs.\nThe coroner determined that his death was due to an \"apparent acute Mitragynine toxicity.\" \nTo us (his family), it was not just apparent, it was surely any overdose. I know he had been desperate to feel better, \nDesperation drives people to do bad things to their bodies.\nI have read many testimonies singing the praises of Kratom. In my opinion, the benefit is getting your \"fix.\" This is a \ndangerous chemical that should not be readily available to ANYONE.

I was unable to quit cold turkey so i turned to something i found called kratom, and i started to take that instead of the tianeptine to ween myself off and it worked incredibly well with minor side effects.

I also have endometriosis, an incurable condition that causes intense pain on an intermittent basis.  For the past three years, kratom tea has helped me cope with the symptoms of this condition without the use of opiate painkillers.\n\nAddiction and drug abuse are rampant and escalating, which is just one reason why it's absolutely counterproductive to ban or restrict an herbal supplement that helps to support people's health and well-being, in turn reducing the use of prescription drugs.  Without kratom, which helps to soothe and ease the extremely painful symptoms I experience with endometriosis, my choices would be very limited.  I would have to either take prescription opiates, which I am adamantly opposed to using, or undergo a hysterectomy at the age of 34.  Aside from the negative effects on my health, a hysterectomy would also be emotionally devastating, since I'm hoping to have a second child.  I am not exaggerating when I say that kratom is what is preserving my fertility, albeit indirectly.\n\nThe existing research is overwhelmingly in favor of the safety of kratom.  While there have been some negative reports, those reports are remarkably few, especially when compared to the number of negative incidents involving everything from energy drinks to over-the-counter medications to other common herbal supplements.  Furthermore, nearly all of those negative incidents have involved at least one of the following factors: adulterated or contaminated products (https://academic.oup.com/jat/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/anatox/35.4.242); combining kratom with multiple other substances; and modified kratom products, meaning the plain leaf (normally crushed or powdered for use as a tea) was converted into a concentrated extract or tincture.\n\nThis does NOT mean that kratom should be banned or \"scheduled.\"  Instead, those who have studied kratom extensively are in favor of regulation that would require vendors to test their products for contamination and purity.  Indeed, the reputable vendors already do this.  We absolutely desire and recommend these kinds of quality-control measures, which could prevent the majority of negative experiences.  Most kratom is already sold in plain leaf form.  If we had regulation requiring that kratom products be sold only in plain leaf form, the sales of modified or concentrated products would be reduced even further.\n\nDr. Walter C. Prozialeck summarizes this quite clearly: \"After evaluating the literature, I can reach no other conclusion than, in pure herbal form, when taken at moderate doses of less than 10 to 15 g, pure leaf kratom appears to be relatively benign in the vast majority of users.\" (jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2588524)\n\nSurely we are beyond pretending that banning substances actually makes them disappear.  By \"scheduling\" or banning products, our government isn't actually controlling them; on the contrary, they are abdicating control.  They are simply handing the regulation of that product over to the black market.\n\nPeople have been using kratom responsibly for many years with no negative effects.  Making kratom a controlled substance would cause irreparable damage to me personally, to thousands of others like me, and to our economy with the loss millions of dollars in legitimate sales and commerce (https://www.botanical-education.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BEA-Economic-Impact-Report_V3-1.pdf).  Please don't rob us of our choices and our freedom to make our own decisions about how we manage and support our health.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18140","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jane Botvinnik","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a Veteran and Traumatic Brain Injury, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

We all know what happens when we try that drug I became addicted after the first use. I struggled with alcohol and meth and was in and out of rehab for 10 years. I felt like I was never going to be able to live life the way it was meant to be lived. I lost my kids, I lost my job, was homeless, sleeping on the streets and had no money. I would go to rehab and be successful while in rehab, when I got back out in the real world it didn't take long for me to relapse. I usually would relapse within three months.

I felt defeated became very suicidal and felt like there was no reason for me to keep living.

Kratom has given me a little bit of my life back, I am no longer stuck in bed most of the day, I can walk better and have better balance, I can sit or stand for more then 5 minutes without having severe muscle spasms, I don't have to run to the bathroom every 5 minutes, my mood is better and I actually have a bit of energy, and I am no longer in constant pain.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9116","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tammy Joy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is not a harmful or addictive substance in the least bit.

I was using codeine products to control the pain but I had to keep increasing the dose to control the pain.  I became addicted to Percocet and was unable to control the pain.\n\nA friend suggested that I try Kratom and I  used it to wean myself away from Percocet.  I was able to slowly reduce the amount of Kratom I was using to one-third the amount I needed to stop taking Percocet and my pain level was under control.\n\nAfter the ban on Kratom I returned to my doctor and tried another form of pain control but was unable to use it due to conflicts with my other medications.  I am now taking Tylonel with codeine and I feel like i am back on the path that I started back in 2006\n\nBefore my doctor would give me another medication he wanted me to be free from Kratom.  It took me 2 weeks to taper off,  I was in a lot of pain but did not have to go through the discomfort of withdrawal,\n\nI believe that Kratom is an acceptable method of treating chronic pain.  It does not make a person feel as high as marijuana and does not cloud my mind.

I usually keep to myself but I need to tell you my Kratom story. I was in a car accident in 2012 and needed a 4 level cervical fusion surgery. I was loaded with pain pills, vicodins, oxy's. I was taking so many that I needed them to function. I had become addicted to them. I wanted to get off of them and my doctor put me on Suboxone, a substance that is just as hard to get off than oxycontin and other narcotics.\n\nI discovered kratom and started using it as a maintenance drug. It helps me with my daily pain I have from having spinal surgery and it also keeps me away from oxycontin. It's a much better maintenance drug than suboxone or methadone. That stuff makes you a slave to it. I wake up daily without needed a dose of kratom to function.\n\nKratom has been given a bad name because it's been sold in pipe stores next to synthetic marijuana \"spice\" and sold in flashy packages. The media has tied kratom in with spice and other drugs saying it will make you hallucinate and OD. You can't OD on kratom, if you take too much you might get a stomach ache. It's not a substance that should be tied in with Schedule 1 drugs like LSD and PCP.\n\nPlease do your research before you try to ban a substance that helps millions of people stay away from oxycontin, heroin and other man made opiates. This is a plant, just like Marijuana and has medicinal qualities. I think if enough research is done on it you guys would realize that. \n\nIf Kratom becomes illegal people will lose their lives by going back to the harder drugs that kratom keeps them from. As someone who's in pain all the time I would have a really hard time if kratom became illegal. Please keep Kratom accessible to people like me who need it. AS the DEA I believe you should be putting your focus on harder drugs that people are dying from daily.

I have fifteen years of community-based service experience, for the past seven years having worked at a non-profit mental health/ housing agency.  My caseload of 25+ clients, have both an Axis I diagnosis, as well as a history of homelessness.  Many also are dually-diagnosed, having both a mental health diagnosis in tandem with a history of substance abuse.  \n\nLike many social workers, and those in comparable fields; I was drawn to the profession because of my own mental health struggles. I was first diagnosed at 19 with social anxiety disorder, and subsequently diagnosed with depression, and attention deficit disorder.  For this reason (among many others) Ive dedicated my life to helping others determine an amenable means to their path to recovery.  Recovery, however, is an ongoing, individualized process.  There is no cure, and no panacea.  With this recognition, I remain open to multifarious range of plausible tools, some of which have proven to be viable means of overcoming our challenges and struggles.  \n\nI have retained psychiatric care for more than 20 years, during which time I have been prescribed an array of medications.  I currently am prescribed two psychotropic medications via my doctor.  I likewise consider each of the prescribed medications a tool, and part of my overall regimen with the goal of sustaining wellness and wellbeing.  \nI was first introduced to kratom approximately two years ago, via a lifelong friend who is similarly diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.  Having already been administered countless psychotropic medications throughout the years (many involving intolerable side-effects) I was willing to try kratom.  I have since used kratom as a supplement to ease my anxiety, and depression.  \n\nMy professional role can be highly demanding, and the pay is less than lucrative.  My clients problems are complex and often seem insurmountable challenges.  I also spend the majority of my time working in some of NYCs toughest neighborhoods. \nIve therefore utilized Kratom as a means to curtail chronic anxiety, and successfully attenuate my dependence, and frequency of use of benzodiazepines (which are well known to carry a host of potential dangers and side-effects). \n\nMitragyna Speciosa, a simple leaf (which unlike many prescription medications, has entailed no notable side-effects), but has augmented the tools I have at my disposal.  Kratom has profoundly aided in my personal recovery, thus carrying forward my capacity to fulfill my professional duty in providing aid to others.  I should note that my clients problems are often complex, and can weigh heavily upon me (this is referred to among social workers as vicarious trauma).\n\nPlease dont take this useful and versatile plant away from us.  The dangers of kratom purported by the DEA, and the cause for implementing its ban currently lack justification (i.e. 500 calls to poison control over the course of several years, and 7 kratom-related deaths).  More than half of my clients smoke cigarettes and many others are addicted to illegal as well as legal drugs.  However, by comparison, any feasible dangers posed by Mitragyna Speciosa statistically pale in comparison.  Rather, the benefits provided by this plant, having aided countless people, cannot be discounted.  The benefits significantly far outweigh any plausible risks.\n\nI appreciate your consideration regarding this urgent matter. \n\nSincerely, \n\nDaniel Ray, LMSW","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15030","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Ray","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not add kratom and other alternative meds and supplements into the schedule 1 class of drugs.

I mean the effect are so much noticeable and helps relieve pain completely and if it doesn't for severe pain it will dull it down so you can continue with your task at hand. I would recommend this to anyone who is look for a better solution to treating pain without having to deal with pills that will overtime destroy the liver. Honestly I'm am for this. Please, please, please do not ban/illegal it. It has helped me so much to get through my days.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11302","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adam Martinez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To all whom this concerns,\n\nI have not lersonally used Kratom, but taking something away from someone that you have never met, nor know the infinite torcher chamber that they live with on a daily basis is inhumane.

I strongly oppose the DEA's attempts to place the active compounds in kratom, Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, into Schedule I. \n\nWithout a serious scientific investigation the DEA intends to subject anyone caught with kratom to long prison terms and mandatory sentencing. This DEA action threatens to halt all scientific investigations into kratom's medicinal benefits in part because it will become illegal to import the kratom needed for research purposes. \n\nI started using kratom over a year ago. At the time, I was at a Mayo Clinic hoping to get answers to the painful neuropathy I had endured for 7 years. At 17, I was hospitalized and given an antibiotic that likely caused the neuropathy. The doctors at Mayo Clinic didn't have any suggestions that I had not tried already. For 7 years my doctors had given me SSRIs, dopamine agonists, anti-convulsants. The fact that none of these medicines helped but rather gave me horrible side effects made life worse. There were two times in those seven years in which I seriously considered suicide. Neuropathy almost took my college scholarship as well as my job due to the pain and inability to walk for more than a few minutes. Through online chronic pain support groups, I heard about kratom. The first time I tried kratom, it worked. I did not feel intoxicated or loopy, no hallucinations or euphoria. It simply took away my pain. \n\nBecause of kratom, I can work full-time helping people with disabilities. I can exercise and spend time with my family. I can give back to my community because of this wonderful herb. While my husband drinks coffee to start his day, I take some kratom on the days that try to beat me down and find that I get to feel normal again, ready to endure the pain again. Kratom should remain legal, accessible, and available because I cannot be a useful member of society without it. Kratom is not an addiction (rather, many have used kratom to get clean), kratom is the herb that allows me to tolerate a condition that I will likely have the rest of my life. There are many similar to me. If banned, many of us would be forced to leave our jobs, apply for disability, become \"criminals\" even though we are law-abiding citizens who seek a life that gives us occasional relief from our horrendous medical conditions. \n\nKratom and its active compounds must be kept legal and available for the purposes of research and utilization as an herb. \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8849","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\n     I would like to strongly discourage the scheduling of Kratom and it's active alkaloids to schedule I.  I am urging you as a pharmacist and healthcare professional from Ohio.  Everyday I see first hand the effect that heroin, prescription drugs, and alcohol addiction has on my patients. I can tell you with great confidence that the data currently does not support this emergency scheduling.  \n     Being a pharmacist I base all of what I know and practice on evidence based medicine. Currently the evidence does not show that Kratom is an imminent danger to the public.  The negative affects currently known are relatively mild, and less severe than alcohol, which is readily available.  People using Kratom long term may have some withdrawal, but it's relatively mild.  Even withdrawal from heroin is less dangerous than alcohol withdrawal, which can actually kill a person. Many many people use Kratom responsibly and a high percentage use it just to be able to function in daily living.  Whether it's for chronic pain or to help with opioid dependency. Please don't take ways this plant for them to use.  Of course if something is available a small percentage will abuse it, as is the case with alcohol or coffee. But as history in this country has shown, prohibition doesn't work! Making something illegal doesn't make it go away, it just makes it less safe.  Kratom will still be around on the black market if it is banned and there it has a higher chance of being adulterated.  Not to mention the thousands of otherwise law abiding citizens that will become overnight felons if this ban goes through.  I'm asking you, the DEA to allow more research on whether or not this plant truly is dangerous or medicinal before taking action. Only after several independent, peer reviewed journals and research has been published will we know for sure.  \n     As of right now no deaths have been attributed to Kratom alone so there is not a strong reason to ban it yet.  The same can't be said for alcohol which we know kills thousands every year and is responsible for billions in healthcare costs.  I'm not saying we should ban alcohol because we already know that doesn't work.  But how can you make a case for banning Kratom and pretend like alcohol is ok.  It just doesn't make sense.  Kratom has no reason to be banned in its natural plant form.  Perhaps the extracts and purified isolated compounds could be dangerous, but not the plant or its leaves.  Please think strongly about this before making a decision.  I recommend taking example from the state of Illinois who was facing a similar ban.  They decided rather than ban it, to just control it sensibly by passing the Kratom Control Act. http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=5526&GAID=12&DocTypeID=HB&SessionID=85&GA=98\nThis type of legislation has my full support.  Rather than ban it and make it unsafe, control it and make it safe for the adults that get benefit from it.  Restrict sale to only adults similar to tobacco and alcohol and ensure that no adulteration happens to the supply.  If you ban it, you will be doing much more harm than good.\n\nThank you for your time,\nAnonymous Pharmacist, PharmD, RPh\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19969","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Pharmacist","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Iv known people that take this and enjoy it are by no means addicted and its nit a threat!!

I am also a kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) consumer.  I believe that kratom (and any of its alkaloids, including mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine) should NOT be regulated by the Controlled Substances Act or the DEA in any way.  Kratom is a safe plant that does not pose any threat to the health and safety of the public.\n\nMy personal story with kratom starts about 10 years ago, when I first discovered the plant.  I was looking for a natural/plant-based supplement to use to combat chronic pain.  I have various autoimmune conditions that contribute to inflammation, arthritis, and pain.  Prior to finding kratom, I mainly took NSAIDs for the pain, but as my condition progressed, and my pain became more chronic, I started looking for alternatives to the NSAIDs to avoid the risks and side-effects that go along with chronic NSAID use (I also wanted to avoid turning to prescription opiates for pain given all of their side-effects). Kratom really helps with my pain yet doesn't give me the gastrointestinal or other side-effects that I used to get with NSAIDs.  I am also much more comfortable with the risks associated with long-term use of kratom than with the risks associated with long-term NSAID use, especially considering the much longer history of human use of kratom.  I have been using kratom on and off for the past 10 years to combat pain, but more regularly the last couple years, and I have experienced no negative side-effects.  It has only been beneficial in relieving pain.\n\nAnother area where kratom has helped in my life is with my autoimmune thyroiditis and related symptoms.  A few years back, I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.  I really try maintain a proper diet, exercise, etc, and I take a low-dose regimen of thyroid hormone and keep tabs on all my levels.  Despite my diligence, I still deal with many symptoms from the disease.  Some of the symptoms of the disease that kratom really helps me with include chronic fatigue, joint pain, muscle pain, depression, and anxiety.  Kratom helps with my energy levels while decreasing my pain and helping lift me out of the Hashimoto's-induced fog.\n\nMy wife has also benefited greatly from kratom.  Before she started using kratom six months ago, she was desperately trying to quit drinking alcohol.  She has struggled a lot with addiction in her life, and she was very addicted to alcohol.  It was slowly destroying her, physically, mentally, and emotionally.  Despite many attempts to quit, she was unsuccessful.  She was so desperate to quit, but the physical and mental dependence was too great and cravings were too strong to conquer it on her own.  With kratom, she was able to get past the cravings and the withdrawals.  She was able to break her dependence on alcohol because of kratom.  She doesn't know how she would have done it without kratom.\n\nIn addition to my story and my wife's story, there are so many other people out there that have very similar stories, many thousands of which are leaving public comments in support of kratom, just like this one.  Please heed the call of all of these comments and DON'T make kratom illegal for the vast majority of people that stand to benefit from it.  Kratom and its alkaloids, including mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, should NOT be regulated by the Controlled Substances Act or the DEA.  By my experience, Kratom is actually a boon to the health and safety of the public, not a threat to it.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20155","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Aaron Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been on a many different pain medications over the years for many different physical ailments that I have acquired over a career in the United States Marine Corps.

I spoke with my mother, who is from Thailand, and she mentioned kratom, has a tribal pain relief a long time ago, before it was restricted in Thailand. When I found it wasn't illegal in the United States, I decided to try it out for myself. I was able to get off of my pain medications from the VA and my family has told me that I seem like my 'old self' and they are happy that I seem much more happy again. These prescription opiods likely have their place but they also likely play a major role in why veterans today are committing suicide in greater numbers than previous generations as well. Kratom has helped me and I have passed this information and helped other veterans to transition off of their opiod medications when they asked me how I did it. We have families that have all noticed a great difference in our daily moods and our abilities to function. Kratom, like anything in general, to include water, can be dangerous if used wrong, but it has a greater benefit of doing good. It has helped addicts stop drinking, stop heroin, stop other drug addictions. It has helped me and other veterans get their lives back and get off these prescription opiods that have left us in a daze and have been hurting our livers, kidneys and stomach linings. Kratom has helped my IBS, by allowing my to get more fiber in my day. I do not get 'high' off of kratom, I doubt one actually could without consuming pounds of it. I believe it should not be banned and I don't believe it should be restricted. I believe it should be classified in the same was that glucosamine is as a supplement to support joint pain and positive balance. Please don't make it more difficult for people who have found a natural way to relieve their pain without harming their bodies or altering their mental state. Don't take away something that has done more good than harm. The outcry the came out in September was for a reason and the we the people deserve a say in what we put in our bodies, especially if it grows naturally and does little to no harm to us.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3381","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"DENNIS GILBERT","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern, \n\nAs a sufferer of Charcot-Marie Toothe, a form of muscular dystrophy, I chronically suffer with pain.

It soon took over my life and nearly cost me everything I hold dear. I was an A+ student in high school and I have a BBA in Marketing. I have worked and supported myself since I was about 16. I didn't use drugs in high school and was not a trouble maker. Opiate addiction eventually turned my behavior to the left. I found Kratom over two years ago when I was at the lowest point in my life. IT CHANGED AND SAVED MY LIFE. I was able to get AND REMAIN sober since the discovery of Kratom.  I am now back with my wife and kids and living a successful and fulfilling life. 3 years ago, I never though that would be possible. I take a small dose of Kratom twice a day and it relieves both pain and anxiety for me. I could never be where I am today, without Kratom. Please don't take this miracle plant away from so many people that need it. The opiate epidemic in this country is vastly understated and ever growing. Kratom can help to change that.

I am 39 years old and I am employed as a finish carpenter. I have been using kratom for five years. When I heard about the proposed nationwide ban I was shocked. -Alcohol and tobacco remain legal and yet both of these are very dangerous and addictive. Kratom is non-addictive. It is a natural and very mild substance. The proposed ban states that kratom does not have any useful benefit. I can say from personal experience that this is untrue. For years I had struggled with anxiety and depression and found my job to be in danger because of the number of days I had to miss. I heard people say that kratom was useful for these conditions so I started taking it. I have found over time that both my problems have improved to a large degree. I very rarely miss a day now. I do not suffer from debilitating anxiety or depression any more. Not only have I held down the same job for 13 years, I have also found the energy in my spare time to start a business of my own. If kratom was dangerously addictive as the DEA seems to be implying I certainly could not have done either of these things. I want kratom to remain legal because it has really helped me. As I said before, alcohol and tobacco are very dangerous and yet they remain legal. Kratom is safe and has been a force for good in my life and in no way do I think it is a threat to our country or to anyone in it.

I do not use narcotics. However, I do consume various teas (e.g. coffee, chamomile) which aid me to function as a positive contributor to society. Kratom is a tea that I consume, albeit seldomly. It does not provide any narcotic effects as touted by those (grossly misinformed) who are for its banishment. This plant is useful for when my joints are sore and I would like some form of relief without committing to the potentially deadly addiction that comes with the prescription of today's leading analgesics (i.e. opioids). Kratom provides a minimal amount of relief, such that I can go about my normal routine without any sedation or confusion due to the consumption of the tea - no surprise to anyone who is familiar with the differences between tea and narcotics.  \n\tFor lack of a euphemism - the credibility of the DEA is declining. Is it the best thing for an agency under public scrutiny to lead the crusade against a harmless plant? Use 15 examples of 'fatalities from kratom' which upon closer examination are examples of people who had one or more well-known lethal drugs in their system or had other medical indications at the time of their passing. This is a fateful move to say the least. I propose a tangential move that would not degrade the public image of the DEA and would also provide plenty of money-making opportunities. Kratom is sold by some very reputable vendors (who should maintain their rights to conduct the honest business that they have been conducting for some time) and kratom is sold by some very non-reputable vendors.  These non-reputable vendors are the ones who most likely started giving kratom a bad reputation in the first place. This is because what they are selling is not kratom, but it is kratom laced with some unknown mix of scheduled or unscheduled narcotics. Laced kratom is no longer benign like the unaltered plant matter. These shops selling laced kratom are sure to be making considerable profits because their product is likely to be highly addictive. If the DEA focuses on preventing these potentially lethal additives from reaching the market, the advantage is twofold: the DEA will save its public image on this matter and plenty of profits will be seized from these non-reputable vendors.  \n\nKratom is not the euphoric recreational drug that it has only recently been labeled as.  This herbal tea has been sold in the U.S. legally for over thirty years.  I am not surprised that the DEA would like to add another benign plant to its portfolio of money-making schemes disguised as calls for public safety.  Look at the past, look at the present; you can continue to oppress people for your benefit, but the number of oppressed is starting to reach critical mass. There are non-oppressive ways for you to make money. Please treat others as you would like to be treated and do not put kratom on any schedule, only prevent dishonest vendors from selling laced kratom.  \n\nGod Bless the honest, hardworking people who make positive contributions to society.\n\nExodus 23:1  \"You shall not bear a false report; do not join your hand with a wicked man to be a malicious witness.\"\n\nP.S. In case no one in the DEA has reviewed the overwhelming body of scientific evidence about the nature of addiction: addiction is a medical condition, not a crime. No matter how many people you arrest, this will not change.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10813","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\nI have been using kratom for 7 years without any harmful side effects.

I have a knee injury that is inoperable. Because it cannot be surgically fixed, the injured knee has become degenerative. Though I am in my mid-thirties, I have arthritis in the knee. This causes me severe pain. Before Kratom I was faced with very few choices. I was not able to live an active lifestyle - no sports, no outdoor activities, nothing that put strain on the knee. I was given opioid pain-relievers to manage my pain. This was an untenable course and left me on the edge of addiction and loss of quality of life. \n\nAfter researching options to get away from the destructive result of frequent opioid usage, I discovered Kratom. It has given me a new lease on life. I do not feel like I have to take it like I did with pain pills. I am able to take it when I need it for pain relief. I am able to be active again and I suffer no negative effects from taking Kratom. It's mental affects are minimal at best. It's like drinking a great cup of coffee. I am able to function like a normal human being and that's so very important. \n\nTo simply criminalize Kratom is illogical. The idea that the DEA, with the stroke of a pen and in the face of over-whelming evidence, would make hundreds of thousands of Americans criminals is unthinkable. I urge you to abandon this effort, keep Kratom legal and fully available to the public.

I made the mistake of unfortunately selecting an irresponsible surgeon to do my initial work, and subsequently, that surgeon prescribed me an extremely strong dose of opiate-based painkillers. This surgeon did not make it clear that, to get off of these painkillers after the surgery, would create not only a lot of discomfort, but a life altering detoxification. A good friend mentioned kratom to me as a natural remedy to the effects of withdrawal, after the doctor refuse to do anything to help   Without crate them.  Without crate him, I might still be hooked on painkillers today. I now recognize that crate him is an herbal alternative that helps people free themselves from the chains of addiction.

Not only has it aided with my anxiety and depression, it has saved my fiance from heroin. 3 years ago, after many deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, my boyfriend was diagnosed with PTSD. In order to numb his pain, he eventually began using heroin regularly and became addicted. Luckily, he found help before it was too late. He was prescribed Buprenorphrine, a very strong and heavy synthetic opiate in order to overcome the withdrawal symptoms. He was very depressed while on this drug. He was in terrible mental, physical and emotional states. Although heroin was out of the picture (thankfully), he was not living a happy life. He discovered Kratom through reading online. He decided to ween himself off of the synthetic opiate in order to improve his well being. Slowly but surely, he weened himself off completely with the help of Kratom. He uses Kratom daily. He is no longer moody, angry or depressed. He tells me how Kratom saved his life. If it weren't for this miraculous plant, he swears he would have gone back to heroin... I have Kratom to thank for saving the man that I love. \n\nAs for me, Kratom works as an antidepressant and aids in my anxiety. I've struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life. I was prescribed many anti-anxiety drugs that eventually made me feel worse than I ever have. I decided to stay far away from pharmaceutical drugs.

The number one benefit I've received by taking kratom is that I no longer drink alcohol to cope with my psychological problems. I visited a counselor that was provided by my employer, but refused to take any antidepressants or prescription drugs having seen the instability such medications have caused my loved ones. Kratom has allowed me to strengthen interpersonal relationships, advance in my career, and build myself into a better person. It has allowed me to become more social and enjoy my life. It has stopped the crippling depression that used to take a hold of me and render myself incapable of living my life normally. I have not been tempted to use any actual drugs, I am not addicted, and I am living a normal life while taking a daily dose of Kratom  (about 3 teaspoons) without experiencing any negative side effects. I am a productive, law abiding citizen who proves that kratom is not similar to any addictive recreational drug currently listed as schedule one substances. It is a calming tea leaf that helps people with many different problems and should not be banned.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1665","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nate Hathaway","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would highly recommend not banning kratom.

For a few years now, I have ingested kratom daily as a tea and/or by mixing it with water, and have found it to be immensely helpful in alleviating back pain while at my desk job.  Kratom allows me to perform my job pain-free, while keeping my head clear and my mind sharp.  I am no longer dependent on taking over-the-counter pain relievers.  As a result, I have become a happier and more productive member of society.  Moreover, I believe that kratom has been extremely beneficial in helping me to live a cleaner, more healthy life.  Whereas I used to drink three to four cups of coffee a day, I now drink two to three cups a week.  In addition, I have decreased my consumption of alcohol and have strived to exercise more.   My social anxiety has also curbed since beginning to take kratom.  \n\nAside from the benefits that I have experienced, I personally know someone who has been able to ween off of suboxone and kick their opiate addiction by supplementing with kratom.  The comments submitted to date appear to lend credence that kratom can be used to effectively and safely lessen or alleviate certain symptoms of opiate withdrawal.  \n\nI believe kratom to be an incredibly safe herb with multiple potential benefits. Along with the anecdotal evidence provided by people like me commenting on this issue (and literally thousands of years of anecdotal evidence derived from other users around the globe), the literature published to date confirms the safety of the plant, with not even a single fatality linked to kratom use alone.  I have experienced little to no adverse reactions while taking kratom, even at what some might consider high doses, and would put the risk of ingesting too much below that of drinking too much coffee (while both can cause an upset stomach, kratom, from my experience, does not cause your heart rate to increase like caffeine does).  Importantly, kratom does not make me feel \"high,\" and thus, I cannot imagine that it has any recreational use or risk of abuse. \n\nToo often in our history, we have banned safe, naturally occurring substances and plants based on misguided fear of the unknown.  This has been hugely detrimental to society, effectively turning productive, law-abiding citizens into criminals.  I urge the DEA to not repeat the mistakes of the past, and to cancel its proposed scheduling of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragyine.   \n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14428","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew McCranor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This plant is extremely beneficial to me feeling good on a daily basis.

I had tried all of the traditional ways, rehab, AA, suboxone, methadone, religion, etc. None of it was enough for my long term health. I still struggled with extreme physical cravings even months after being clean. I still struggled with severe back pain and always ended up going back to opiates. 6 years ago I was introduced to kratom. 6 years ago was the last time I ever used any opiate as well. Kratom took away all physical cravings and I had zero withdrawal symptoms from heroin. Kratom has allowed me to maintain a sober life while taking away all cravings for any opiate as well as completely taking away all back pain. I am able to work a full time physical labor job while kratom takes away the majority of my pain and gives me the energy I need to wake up at 4am and go to work and have a clear focused mind and body. I have had zero negative side effects and have never abused this magnificent plant. Kratom  has saved my life. I am very fearful that if it is taken away from me, I would possibly go back to opiates. I finally have a life, have no more pain , and am in no legal trouble, which was the path I was on while being an addict.

I'd like to begin first, with a short introduction of myself.\n\nWhen I was a high school freshman my doctors informed me that I had two precancerous tumors growing in my chest. After a successful surgical procedure had been performed to remove the tumors, I was prescribed a month's supply of the prescription painkiller OxyContin 20mg. In less than a month's time, I had developed a severe addiction to prescription painkillers like OxyContin (oxycodone) and Vicodin (hydrocodone); all of this before my 15th birthday.\n\nFor years I struggled to overcome my addiction -- both throughout my high school career and beyond. Unfortunately, nothing I tried could keep me clean for longer than a few weeks or (rarely) a month. Unfortunately for myself and others like me, addictions that are developed in childhood and early adolescence are far more difficult to overcome than those that develop later in life.\n\nDesperate to find an answer to the problem that had caused so much pain to myself and my loved ones and that had controlled the entirety of my teenage life, I decided to look for safe alternatives to prescription opiates (lest I turn to heroin).\n\nThat was when I discovered a plant that originates from the South East Asian countries of Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia known as \"Mitragyna speciosa\" (but is more commonly referred to simply as \"kratom\"). Kratom is a member of the coffee family and has been used as a natural pain reliever and medicinal plant for thousands of years in Thailand. However, it wasn't until the rapid increase of US cases of prescription opiate dependence that an ulterior use for kratom was discovered:\n\nThis plant was found to act as an agonist to the opioid receptors in the human brain. It is about as addictive as coffee and the symptoms of withdrawal are no worse than those for caffeine. It offers people like me a second chance to turn their lives around without having to worry about chasing highs.\n\nI have been using kratom daily for over a year and have never once felt the urge to seek out dangerous narcotics of the kind I had once been dependent on. Without it, I fear I may go back to using the dangerous substances that once had had full control over my life. \n\n Kratom has been shown to have very few negative side effects and does not cause respiratory depression (the leading cause of death from synthetic opioids).\n\nKratom has never been documented to have caused a single death where it was the only substance to have been found in the victim's system. \"Association\" and causation are not the same.\n  \nKratom is not a heroin substitute. It is a medicine.\n\nLastly, I would like to thank the Drug Enforcement Agency for doing the right thing by allowing kratom users and medical doctors to submit their comments and input. \n  \nSincerely,\n\nNathan L.\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14407","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nathan LaChance","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I first want to thank you for opening this issue up to the public, researchers, and industry stakeholders.  It was the right thing to do.  That said, I am 100% opposed to the ban or any scheduling of kratom.  I am not a regular user myself, but I have tried it on occasion in the past and can say from personal experience that it is very mild in effect.  The thought of it being scheduled next to lsd and heroin seems absurd to anyone that has actually used it.  I was first introduced to kratom by my younger brother.  He was a longtime worker in a tire warehouse.  The job was grueling work and did a number on his body.  Due to the pain and nature of his job, he was turned onto opiate pain pills to get him  through his work weeks.  Naturally, that turned to addiction and his tolerance increased over time.  Eventually, he was able to ingest amounts of Oxycontin that would  and has on many occasion, killed people.  His quality of life was in a downward spiral, each day depending on more and more of this harsh opiate drug.  Then he discovered kratom.  He was able to ween himself completely off of any pharmaceutical drug with its help.  His life has improved dramatically.  I have seen more than a handful of friends and people that I have grown up with die from overdosing on pharmaceutical opiate drugs and was very fearful that my younger brother would eventually wind up doing the same.  That fear is no longer for me or for him and its all thanks to this wonderful plant kratom.  This is just one example of how this plant has helped people.  There are thousands if not millions more.  Our nation is supposed to be the land of the free.  We as responsible, law abiding adults should have the right to choose use all natural plants and herbs if we desire.  So in closing, I just want to reiterate that I am completely opposed to the ban or any scheduling of the plant kratom.  It will cause the death and destruction of thousands of American lives if initiated.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0689","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Franklin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA,\n\nI am a 28 year old wife, mother and dental assistant by profession.

So, I have seen first hand that drugs like suboxone do not work, & just keep people addicted.\nI was lucky to find a non-narcotic alternative to addictive opiate medications. \nI still use it to this day. My quality of life has improved. The pain management offered by my rheumatologist is inadequate due to the heroin/opiate epidemic.\nWhy would anyone take a non addictive plant off the market that is commonly used by people trying to stay off of opiates, or people trying to get off of heroin?\nRemoving kratom from the market will result in more heroin related deaths. \nPeople like myself have been forced to apply for disability due to this hasty action. I have been left with no choice. \nWe will not forget. Putting kratom on the scheduled narcotics list will not yield any positive results.\nQuite the opposite.

For the longest time, I just dealt with the pain, holding onto any opiate that had been prescribed to me from my many surgeries for when it got so bad that I couldn't stand it.  My family members would even hold onto their extras for me if we were taking a trip to Disney World just so I could actually enjoy our vacation.  In 2001 I fell off a 4 story building and damaged a lot of my body, but after 6 months, I was able to walk again.  Long story short, I have pain below the knee all the time, and some days are worse than others.  Kratom has been an effective way for me to manage my pain, and without many of the bad side effects I used to see from other opiates.  It has really improved my life, and since I found it recently, it would really sadden me to lose it.  I thought when I found it that I could finally have a worry free/pain free life again like I used to before my accident.

I am currently employed as a sales manager for a local business.  I began using kratom approximately 3 months ago after hearing about it from various friends online.  I have been diagnosed with endometriosis and suffer from pretty constant abdominal pain, back pain, and an overall lack of energy.  I looked into kratom after being told that I will have to deal with this pain until I have children or go through menopause (I'll reiterate, I'm 29, that is a really long time!).  Now I can make absolutely zero medical claims for anyone else, I can only tell you what kratom has done for me personally.  After using it I have finally found something that provides pain relief without all the mental fog of pain meds.  I'm able to get back to life and go about my daily life without being in a constant fog from a prescription medicine and it has none of the unpleasant side effects such as nausea and constipation which I experienced with the various pain medicines I was prescribed.  Those prescribed meds caused me discomfort and left me feeling uncomfortable even doing small things like driving because I felt inebriated.  With kratom I can take it and I'm 100% myself and I don't feel \"altered\" in any way, shape, or form.  I am simply relieved of the pain and discomfort that I have been living with for over a decade now.  I also don't have to worry that one day I will find myself dependent as so many pain patients do, unable to get by without their doctor prescribed script.  \nI personally disagree with the call to ban kratom as there are far too many possibilities for this plant in daily life that could help so many people.  I also feel that there hasn't been sufficient research done to ban it wholly and call it a done deal.  This plant has been used for a very long time overseas for a variety of things and I feel there is a lack of sufficient evidence of ill effects that would support making it a schedule I substance - on par with crack cocaine, heroin, and meth.  Those are highly dangerous and lethal drugs, kratom is a plant.  Those substances have caused thousands of deaths and injuries and kratom does not have that sort of history.  I feel the DEA should really look into further studies and research before placing a blanket ban on kratom.  Again I cannot speak for anyone else and do not attempt to make any sort of medical claim but I do know that using kratom has given me my life back essentially.  I don't have to either sit on the couch writhing in pain or spend my time doped up on narcotics that dull the pain but leave me completely devoid of the ability to get out and live my life.

I also just had a disc replacement surgery  on Nov. 22nd. I've been under the care of pain management for 4 years, and it got out of control When I realized that I had opioid induced hyperalgesia and wouldn' get any relief after surgery, I detoxed myself off Lyrica, Robaxin, Fentanyl, Trazodone, and a couple others that I can't remember (because there were so many of them)-- it was two weeks of hell. I actually checked into a medically- assisted chronic pain program to get off of oxycodone. I was taking 300-360 mg every day, and of course, it only worked for about an hour. Another two weeks of hell. Then a friend of mine introduced me to kratom. The pain levels that were spiking to 8-9 were 3 at the worst! I had my surgery and the doctor prescribed 10 mg. Hydrocodone. It did not work as well as I thought it would, so I started using kratom and my pain levels don't go above a four (and that is going into the sixth hour of the dose). My surgeon wrote me another prescription for Hydrocodone, which I can refill but I don't think I will. Kratom has literally saved my life from being  miserable and in constant pain to actually walking my dogs on the beach, shopping and feeling alive again. It is not something I will take every day, but I know it is there if I need it. Please do not ban it--it's a wonderful plant that helps thousand of people like myself.

In my experience, kratom has helped me with chronic pain, depression and anxiety. The downsides are that you can feel a little nauseas if you take to much (much like opiates) and the only withdrawal I've ever felt from it is that I get a runny nose if I haven't used any for a couple days. All I'm asking is that the proper research is done. Not just yank it away from the millions of people it helps because \"big pharmaceutical companies\" or whoever want to take the two alkaloids from it and make them into something they can sell for a rediculous price. If they want to do that fine. But that's no reason to make everyone suffer or in my case,  and many others,  have to go back to opiates. Just do the right research and if the FDA or whoever, finds that it's not safe for some reason then do what you have to. But I've been using this plant for years and it's done nothing but help me. I'm not on opiates anymore where I have to see a Dr every 3 months and if I take an extra pill here or there then I gotta suffer insane withdrawal for a few days because God forbid they give out a script a couple days early. It doesn't make you \"trip\"  or get you \"high \" does it elevate your mood? Yes. Much like a good cup of coffee does. But it also kills pain.

Communication and expression of ideas and knowledge is a fundamental element of our government.  \n\nNow, I wont bury the lede any longer; I am adamantly opposed to Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) placing Kratom on the list of Schedule 1 controlled substances. \n\nMy name is Scott Elingburg and I am a 36 year old software engineer. I work on a project that ensures our veterans receive their VA benefits in a timely and efficient manner. \n\nI use Kratom several times a week as part of health regimen that includes diet and exercise. And Kratom has improved my life in more ways than I could imagine. \n\nI used Kratom for the first time approximately two years ago while suffering from a debilitating bout of depression and anxiety. I was treated for depression and stress-related anxiety when I was 23 and was able to breakthrough with a combination of therapy and medication. However, two years ago, at the age of 34, I suffered a psychotic break and could not find a solution to lift the depression. As it turned out, the medication I was currently taking (escitalopram) no longer worked (an event literally called the poop-out effect) and I struggled terribly just to maintain a semblance of balance until learning about Kratom on a mental health discussion board online. \n\nAs I said, I take Kratom every week to help reduce anxiety, stress, and depressive thoughts. It is not my sole resource in the ongoing battle against depression and anxiety, but it is one tool that I use. This plant makes me a better husband, friend, father, worker, and person. I would never consider Kratom to be an addictive substance worthy of Schedule 1 inclusion and am deeply opposed to this proposed action by the DEA. If Kratom were no longer available, I would have to work twice as hard to keep my mental health in balance and would likely have to supplement with additional medications such as benzodiazepines that are known to have addictive properties and are classified as schedule 2 drugs. \n\nThank you again for this period to comment and express our views on Kratom. I do believe that, as long as it stays off the scheduled drug list, it will come to be seen as a safe, responsible alternative to prescriptions medications of all kinds.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18129","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Scott Elingburg","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\nI am 60 years old and using Kratom, been using it since forever.

Like all things (particularly alcohol, cigarettes, and to a lesser degree, caffeine) - kratom in moderation has been a wonderful thing in my life. Having been a smoker for twenty years, I remember that quitting was an unbearably difficult thing, so I do know what strong physical dependency feels like. That being said, Kratom does not seem to possess even a fraction of the addicting potential as alcohol or cigarettes, let alone that of any of the stronger substances out there.\n\nMy use of kratom is, admittedly, for recreation - I take it much like a person who might have a glass of wine at the end of a night. Yet, I do believe there are people in the country who are in far worse need of this medicinal plant; for them to lose access to it would be extremely unbearable. It really is a wonderful plant.\n\nWhen I was a younger man, I admittedly tried many different substances, and whether that was right or wrong, I do know firsthand the consequences of ingesting such drugs. To place kratom in their category - of such drugs as the severely prohibited heroin and LSD - would be drastically unfair.\n\nThank you for considering my comment!   \n\nSincerely,\n  \nF. in Alabama","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7541","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Six months ago I decided to try Kratom after hearing it was an excellent supplement for pain relief without the negative side effects of narcotic pain medication. For the last 8 years I have been unable to work because of debilitating spine and hip pain caused by several autoimmune diseases. Once an avid runner (5 miles/day), at age 42 I was forced to stop running because the pain in my lower spine and hips was so debilitating. This pain progressed into an even worse spondylitis pain that was so severe I couldn't stand up or even walk on some days. After six years of going from doctor to doctor in search of a diagnosis and hundreds of tests later I finally was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, non-diabetic neuropathy, degenerative disk disease, rotation scoliosis and finally Lyme disease with several co-infections - all very painful and debilitating conditions. Aside from the infectious Lyme disease party, I was told the autoimmune conditions   \"couldn't be cured\" only the symptoms could be treated. Treatment for these involved immunosuppressants and narcotic pain medication. At age 46, I found myself unable to work and chemically dependent on oxycodone then morphine. I gained 30 pounds, had no quality of life, my marriage was in trouble and I lost many of my friends because I could no longer do the things normal people do. My life revolved around being seen by the doctor every 30 days in order to get my narcotic script so I would then be able to stand  in the line at the pharmacy praying they would have my medication in stock so I wouldn't have to go into narcotic withdrawals. By age 48, I decided my life had been ruined enough and I would no longer allow myself to be controlled and humiliated by a drug. I decided I would rather be in debilitating pain then to die that slow death so I quit cold turkey. I had been living in that debilitating pain again when I heard about Kratom. With little expectation, I tried Kratom and for the first time in 8 years, I was able to physically do things I hadn't been able to do without the aid of steroids and pain medication. Because of kratom I can now exercise moderately, I can work in my yard and do household chores again, I can enjoy some of the activities I previously had to give up and do them all with a clear mind - not foggy brained and stupid like I was on narcotics. I no longer feel fatigued like I once was when I was chemically dependent on narcotics. I've regained some creativity and I'm trying to find work once again. kratom has been a miracle for me and has restored the quality of my life. Because I feel absolutely no euphoria or mind alteration from kratom, I don't understand why its being classified similarly to something like heroin. If it's banned, I have no idea what I will do because I will never again allow myself to become dependent on narcotic pain medication.\nI'm also going to be a grandmother soon and I fear I will not be able to help care for my grandson without the pain relief I receive from Kratom. I'm afraid I will not be able to join in family activities, to work and become a productive member of society again. Please allow for further research on the benefits of this naturally growing plant and give hope of clean and homeopathic pain relief to the millions of people suffering from chronic pain. Thank you.

I think it would be very unfortunate for many, many people. This is not a drug. It doesn't cause people to feel high or anything. It helps alleviate certain symptoms in a more natural way. Please do not pass this ban. It's a plant that has helped people for a very long time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5053","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Miriam Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\nI have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder.

I have never felt any side effects once I stop taking it, nothing like taking hydrocodone or oxycodone for 3 weeks.

I am a 45 year old successful business owner in Atlanta. The stress of running my business contributed to anxiety for which lead to a long struggle with alcohol and doctor presribed Benzodiazepines. A friend told me about how they had stopped using alcohol by utilizing Kratom. I went online and found many stories about former alcoholics who found success with Kratom. I decided to give it a try. To my amazement I was able to stop drinking and using Benzodiazepines almost instantly. No withdrawal symptoms from the alcohol or the Benzodiazepine medication. In the past I had experienced terrible withdrawal symptoms even under doctor care while attempting to stop these substances. I have been using Kratom twice daily for 6 years now and have not used alcohol or Benzodiazepines since. The extreme anxiety has also gone away. I got my life back on track thanks to Kratom. I don't get HIGH from kratom or experience any lapse of judgement etc. My mood is stable and my brain function is sharper than ever. I believe that once this plant is studied, you will unlock a very powerful tool to treat pain, anxiety, PTSD, depression, substance abuse, and many other conditions.

I myself have benefitted greatly from responsible use of this plant medicine to treat severe anxiety and mood disorders like depression, and chronic pain due to fibromyalgia as well as treat my issues of insomnia which further complicate these other conditions which have seriously detoriated my quality of life and ability to function and work to support myself.

I had a bad back to begin with and the accident made it worse. Throughout the whole recovery process, i was prescribed hydrocodone on a regular basis. Over time my body acclimated to the pills and i needed more and more to get by. One day my doctor told me he couldnt prescribe me anymore because he didnt want me to get addicted. This was after over 4 months of daily use. Too late, I already was addicted. By then i needed pills just to function, so i did the worse thing possible and started buying them in the street. This continued for almost 3 years until i finally had enough. Getting off of pills was one of the hardest things i have ever done in my life and i do not wish that on anyone. During my detox i came across Kratom. It was proven to ease withdrawls and at the point i was at the time, i would have tried anythign but more pills. I credit two things to my recovery, one was my significant other who took care of me and the other was Kratom. Because it eased the syptoms of withdrawls, i honestly believe that without it, i would have relapsed because it was that hard.\nAs of today, i have almost a year and a half off pills, but continue to be plagued by cronic pain. Instead of taking pills, OTC or otherwise, I take a natural plant with benifits, Kratom. If it wasnt for the Big Pharma companies peddling pills at all costs, Kratom can be used for a number of different ailments. My personal use for kratom has helped me pain, sleeplessness, anxiety, anti-diarheal, and just a relaxing tea after a hard days work. it would be an absolute shame to take something thats god given and make it illegal. This plant has saved my life, my familys life, and countless others who Im sure you have read about so far. Please do make people go back to pills when a healthy alternative is there.

For many years, I have been plagued with chronic pain due to a back injury while I was in the US Navy.   In addition to this condition, I also have great pain due to injuries to my neck and knee as well as experiencing pain and numbness due to neuropathy in my feet.  While I have received great care from the VA, most of the available relief has been though pain medications.   I was talking various muscle relaxers, as well as pain medications ranging from Hydrocodone and Tramadol to large amounts of Ibuprofen and other NSAIDS.  I was also taking various medications for my neuropathy pain management.  In short, I was taking many types of medications several times a day just to keep my pain under control.   That is until I began taking Kratom about 8 months ago.\nI was very tired of all the pain, tiredness, and poor quality of life that I had.  I had a strong desire&a need&for a healthier, less pain filled life.  I began looking for alternatives to all the medications I was taking.  This was not only in the form of herbal remedies, but also changes in lifestyle and exercise habits.   I found many references to Kratom, but I was also concerned about some of the negative stories I saw about Kratom.  As I continued my research, I discovered that many of the negative stories and claims were not well founded.  \n\nI recall stories regarding to the death of a person that was said to be Kratom related.  This was very concerning to me, but as Paul Harvey once said&theres the rest of the story.  In every case I looked into, while the person was taking Kratom, the actual cause of death had nothing to do with Kratom and was often due to other severe addictions things like Heroin or other horrible drugs.  A couple were even auto accidents that family members said were because their loved one was taking Kratom.  That is really akin to blaming coffee for an auto accident rather than the real reasons cited such as heart attacks or being far too tired to drive responsibly.\n\nTo make a long story less long, since taking Kratom, I have a profoundly better life.  I take 2-3 grams in the morning and again in the afternoon.  I occasionally need to take some NSAIDS, but I no longer need to any of the other pain medications.   Additionally, with far less pain than I had, even with all the other modifications, I am much more active.  Kratom also gives an energy boost like to caffeine and I am no longer living on coffee and pop to counteract the pain medications tiring effects.   This has culminated in not only living a healthier lifestyle with far less pain, but I have also been able to exercise more.  I joined the Sanford Profile program and was able to lose over 75 lbs. in the last 7 months.  I feel great!\nNow, with the DEA trying to put Kratom on the list of a Schedule 1 drug, I am greatly concerned I will slip back into the need to take the pain medications again and go back to the painful life I was leading.\n\nThank you for your consideration on this matter.\n\nMichael Wayne Hayes","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21490","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Hayes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am sending in my comment for Kratom to remain legal.

Much like marijuana, the worse that happens if you \"overdose\" is a nice, long nap. There is no danger in kratom - the stories suggesting it to be harmfull all seem to share the fact that it's user also had other (often several!) dangerous substances/chemicals/medications in their systems. Blaming those deaths on kratom is disingenuous, and makes it obvious to anyone paying attention that the DEA is trying to justify it's very existence and worse, possibly doing the bidding of the pharmaceutical companies for profit & law enforcement for more bodies to incarcerate. \nI am a chronic pain sufferer who, having tried nearly every other option out there (from simple over the counter Advil, tylenol, etc, to every prescription strength NSAID available, to steroid injections - which made things FAR worse), I put off using the opioids my dr offered me for many, many years, until the pain simply became too much to bear, I was unable to take care of my family or hold a job, and became depressed to the point of desperation. At only 35, I felt like my life was over. When I finally gave in, it changed my life practically overnight. Not only could I care for myself and my family again, over the next 8 years I was able to build a business that grosses over $800k a year and employs 8 other people. However, I (along with millions of other chronic pain patients) now live in fear of this newest DEA over-reach that's requiring pain management doctors to go against their oaths and cut off the only life-line most of their patients have.\nNow, I life in fear that these opioids, which I credit quite literally with saving my life, may be taken away. And worse - cut off suddenly, with no advance warning. In trying to deal with this possibility, my research led me to kratom. I was relieved to find that there was something that, should i be suddenly cut off, I could turn to to ease the symptoms of withdrawal (chemical dependence happens whether you're an addict, or not) and also help with the immeasurable pain I may be forced to return to. Far from \"fixing\" the \"opioid epidemic\", these new guidelines are only making the problem much worse. I have personally talked to people who have been forced to seek their medications on the streets (what would YOU do if these medications were what separated you from living your life or dying a little more each day?) - some have even turned to *heroin* because it's much easier to find & more affordable, especially in light of the new demand for illegal opioids caused by this crackdown. Much like similar laws against marijuana, and the years of alcohol prohibition before that - making something illegal does NOT make it go away. It merely gives criminals another way to profit, increases violence and the state another option for incarcerating it's citizens (which is probably the whole point, all the guise of \"protecting\" the public) - and all for choosing to use something that effects no one but themselves. That's hardly the actions of a free country. What *I* choose to put in my body should concern NO ONE but me. As long as my actions don't physically hurt others, it should be no one else's business. But, I digress. All these laws are the same. Even when faced with proof of this in study after study, and watching the positive outcomes in other countries that have de-criminalized these drugs & show that voluntary usage actually goes DOWN after legalization, the USA still tries to make itself the morality police. Well, please - STOP trying to save me from myself. Let ME decide how to live my life. And let my children live in a world where their mother is actually there for them, and where crime is DOWN because there's no such thing as illegal drugs for criminals to peddle. THAT would be a free country, and we have NO excuse for doing otherwise Keep kratom legal!\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4238","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":" Kratom is a plant, anyone who chooses to use it as an alternative to opiates should have every right to as a citizen of the United States of America.

I'm not a doctor or scientist or anything like that. I'm just a comedian, BUT I'm a comedian who grew up in poverty in rural TN, and as such I am no stranger to the prescription painkiller epidemic. And it is an epidemic. I know the government says pills are fine because they make big pharma lots of money (the better to lobby them with, my dears). But make no mistake...it's a poor people plague. \n\nMy mother is a recovering addict who was absent for most of my life because of it (some of that time in prison). I lost my first cousin, whom I was very close to, to an overdose last year. I've lost countless other family members over the years. I know about pills. I know what they do. \n\nAnd kratom has some very real potential to actually help with this epidemic. When I first heard of it I researched it heavily (unlike the DEA prior to their initial announcement, with all due respect). I found zero, ZERO, significant concerns with either addiction or overdose potential. Kratom has been used both ritually and recreationally in Southeast Asia, where it grows, for literally centuries, with no documented evidence of significant potential for public harm. It is, as far as I and many others can tell, no more harmful than coffee. \n\nSo to outlaw this plant, which has so much potential to help us combat our ever-growing narcotic problem, and further to put it in a category reserved for drugs like heroin, is not only asinine, it is inhumane, it is cruel. It is wrong. \n\nPlease don't do that. Sincerely, please.

I work as a photo retoucher for a photography studio based in New York City that produces visual content for major fashion and accessories brands.  I am very dedicated to my job, and my job requires me to handle large volumes of work within tight deadlines.  \n\nI was recently diagnosed with endometriosis, after a lifetime of suffering massive pain and other associated symptoms from the disease.  Although this diagnosis is helpful, there are few treatments for endometriosis that I (personally) can receive.  My body does not respond well to the hormones contained in birth control, and laparoscopic surgery and other various invasive methods of treatment for the disease are not feasible under the high deductible insurance plan I have.  I have found that taking Kratom has enabled me to control my pain without having to be on synthetic hormones that adversely impact my mental health.  The other options for pain relief are opiate painkillers, which I am well aware of the dangers of dependency with these medications, and personally do not want to assume the risks involved in taking these.  \n\nKratom, when used responsibly, is a very effective way to manage my pain so that I can continue to be productive at my job, as well as continue to remain active so that I can be healthy.  I also was diagnosed with Lyme Disease in 2005, and Ive found that Kratom greatly mitigates the aching pain that a Lyme Disease flare up can bring.  Im a very active individual, who enjoys hiking, biking, running, weight lifting and pilates .  In order to maintain this level of activity, being able to manage my pain levels when they spike into the highly uncomfortable range is a luxury for which I am eternally thankful.  Though I know Kratom has not been officially studied, I have never had any negative experiences with it.  The body seems to react by producing nausea when a dose that is too high is taken, and this prevents a person from having too much.  Furthermore, the effect of Kratom is relatively mild, in my opinion.  It is not enough to highly compromise the functioning of an individual, unless other substances are mixed with it  and this danger exists with any substance, ranging from alcohol to cigarettes and beyond.  Discretion must be advised with any substance, and people must assume responsibility when putting anything inside of their bodies.\n\nIm a big proponent of solving health problems naturally.  I do everything in my power to eat whole foods and avoid certain foods and drinks that would aggravate my symptoms.  I also do copious research on vitamins and herbs that can be helpful in treating my ailments.  Kratom is a wonderful, natural gift that comes from the earth and can help a human body greatly.  Kratom has made living with chronic pain and illness not such a burden.  Kratom allows people who might otherwise be suffering daily the freedom to go out into the world and be highly functioning members of society, unhampered by the physical issues that were holding them back.  \n\nI know that I will personally be highly impacted if Kratom is made a Schedule I substance  I will accrue large medical bills, and it will be difficult for me to attend my job on rough days when my symptoms flare up.  I will also lose the freedom to control my own pain responsibly, and be at the mercy of medications where the side effects outweigh the benefits.  My life will change significantly, along with many other sufferers of chronic pain.  I urge you to possibly find ways to control the amounts of Kratom that can be bought by a single individual in a certain period of time (such as is the case with medications like Claritin that contain pseudoephedrine, etc.).  Furthermore, providing a drivers license number and other such ways of tracking and controlling the distribution of the substance would be great ways to maintain some control without exercising complete prohibition for a substance so many people benefit from, and very few abuse.\n\nI ask you to please carefully consider the benefits of this natural substance and all of the people who responsibly use it to improve their lives.  Lastly, thank you so much for opening up a discussion to the public, so that stories can be shared to gain a better understanding.  I also thank you for your time, and hope that my words have provided at least some clarity on the topic at hand.\n\nBest regards,\nKatelyn R\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6202","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Katelyn Roof","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been diagnosed w/ tourettes.The neurologist put me on a series of drugs all of which made me extremely tired.

Three of my kids are grown and I still have 2 at home. I am also raising my grandson, so I am solely supporting 3 kids. I also financially help my adult son who is undergoing cancer treatment and is a single father of 3 little kiddos. My family depends on me to provide them with their needs. I am on my feet for long, hard 12 hour shifts, often without more than a 5 minute break. I also have chronic back pain. I have a large cyst on my spine (that keeps coming back), anterolisthesis, herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and degenerative disc disease. The pain can be unbearable, The cyst, discs, and vertebrae are also pressing on my spinal nerves and effect my leg, the left more than the right. Many times, I can barely lift my leg to walk. Yet, I also have foot drop and have come very close to tripping over my own foot because I can't lift it up due to spinal nerve damage. Yet, I still must go to work every day and take care of my family. The pain can be unbearable at times, to the point I can hardly move. I can't sit, stand, walk, or lie down. I have been prescribed opioid pain meds, but I cannot take them and work. I have to be 100% present and alert, able to make split second decisions that could mean the difference of life or death for someone. NSAIDs have caused a GI bleed so I can't take them anymore. I searched for natural pain relief remedies, and found kratom. I have some kratom tea in the morning so I can move. I do not feel any opiate \"high\". I do not have any alteration in mentation. What I feel is some relief of pain and am able to move. By the afternoon, I am able to work my shift. I have another cup of tea when I get home, and I am able to sleep comfortably. I am not sure, because there have not been enough studies, but I think it's possible that kratom may have anti-inflammatory effects, as well as pain relieving action due to partially binding to the opiate receptors. Kratom has not caused me any ill effects. It has been used safely for thousands of years by people in Southeast Asia. It is not a drug of abuse in the sense that its effects are so mild that it is not something that someone wanting to get high would seek out. In the US, it is used mostly by older people to aid in alleviating pain. Many people who are depressed use it to lift their mood. People suffering with anxiety use it to relax. For those of us dealing with chronic pain, depression, or anxiety, what is our alternative if you take away this natural plant that has helped so many? The alternative is worse, which are drugs with serious side effects, including death, and a higher risk of addiction than a simple, natural tea that has been used by man for ages.\nPlease do not list kratom as a Schedule I substance, or schedule it at all, Doing so will make it inaccessible to most people. Without kratom, I would not be able to work and have to get disability. That would mean my family would lose our home. My son with cancer would not be able to receive my help. I would not be able to function as a nurse or a mother. My quality of life would be gone. There are many, many more people just like me.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7429","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Debbie Johnson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps addicted people reduce or even eliminate their dependence on opioids.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13744","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Henry Goff","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I feel that the decision to schedule Kratom is wreckless and not in the best interest of the American people. I've worked in the field of substance abuse for almost 7 years now and only encountered 1 instance where someone claimed to be addicted to Kratom. After providing treatment for this individual it was found that they had a lot of other underlying issues such as bipolar disorder and depression. This particular patient was also using many other substances and eventually was diagnosed as a poly-substance abuser. This mere case of 1 patient in a total of 7 years doesn't even meet criteria to be considered as someone who was addicted to this herb. Now on the other side of the token I've met many individuals who are very active in the recovery community that were addicted to pharmaceutical grade opiod medications and eventually turned to heroin resulting in complete and total destruction of their lives. A substantial amount of the ones who miraculously live to tell their story now use Kratom as a supplement. I predict that once Kratom is banned many people will relapse only to experience major consequences and unfortunately death, considering that overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15997","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jenny McBride","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban kratom.

I had been taking prescription opioid pain medication for years to manage my chronic back pain. I moved away from my pain management doctor and couldn't find a doctor in Alaska to prescribe what I had been using, but instead prescribed morphine. I took that for two days and decided that opiates were not going to work for me anymore as I was still experiencing severe pain. I had heard of Kratom, did some research and tried it. Not only did it relive the pain, but prevented any withdrawal symptoms from a long run with oxycodone. \n  I'm fully convinced that Kratom saved my life. I still use it on occasion and have never experienced any I'll effects from its use.\n\n\nThank you. \nRobert Sparks","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18579","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Sparks","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom this may concern;\n\nI am a 35 year old male that suffers from Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis since i was 13 years old. I have had surgeries that removed a foot of my small intestine, a second emergency surgery from peritonitis and had an ostomy bag until i was 18 years old. I then found one of the best doctors at Cedar Sinai Medical Center who specializes in the treatment of Crohn's disease. I am confident that i am getting the best possible care. I had a third surgery to repair scar tissue from the previous two surgeries because i was getting frequent obstructions. Throughout all these surgeries i was given narcotic pain medication. In the hospital i was given a synthetic heroin like drug called dilaudid. At home i was prescribed vicodin, percoset, norco. I suffered horrible withdrawals coming of the medications, as well as constipation while on it. \nI found kratom through my dad while going on a hike with him. He mentioned he enjoys it for it's anxiety reducing effects and he said it reduces pain as well. I tried it when i knew i was going to be in severe pain and was curious to try it. I was hopeful that this would work and be a natural alternative to prescription. Within 20 minutes i could feel all my stomach pain leaving my body. In 30 minutes i had absolutely no pain and felt my anxiety go away too that comes along with my crohn's flare ups. Since then i have been taking it as needed for pain and to help with anxiety. I truly feel this natural plant needs to be legalized, since it helps so many people. This can save lives, people need something like this that they can take thats natural and won't kill them to get off heroin or other hardcore opiates that could lead to death and ruin lives. I do think we need to have a lot of research done on this plant to find out as much as possible to educate the public about its longterm safety and benefits.\n\nPlease keep this legal, i don't want to go back on prescription pain medication ever again.\n\nThank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9047","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Marmor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease.

I now take Kratom on a regular basis, it helps my pain,with very minimal side effects. Kratom has been a Godsend for me, it's natural, has little or no side effects, it is affordable and I feel so much better taking Kratom versus the opioid pain killers the Doctor prescribed me.I'm so happy the DEA Did not schedule the herb Kratom.

How can this be? Now we all know that big pharma has a huge part in the drive to ban this plant, as well as I'm sure the drug trade has an impact, but I'll just be focusing on pharma here as it's a bit easier to express big pharma's interests in a ban. Let's go into all of the benefits. It is pain reducing and anxiolytic. It allows for increased stamina and concentration for those, which otherwise, would be so focused on their pain that they wouldn't be able to think without it. It is impossible to overdose on the plant due to the fact that it is a complete organism, made up of other compounds that would make you vomit before even coming close to an overdose. On the opposite end of the spectrum we have, legal, drugs that have no overdose protection built into them because they are simply concentrated forms of one specific chemical. The bottom line is that this plant helps people every day and it's natural. It saves people money and allows them to live a happier and HEALTHIER life then they would be on pharmaceuticals that end up causing more harm than good in the long run...the side effects of pharmaceuticals tend to lead to the use of other drugs to offset the negatives that come from another...HOW CRAZY IS THAT?! Great for big pharma because their making more money selling more drugs...terrible for the citizens of the United States. This is a safe plant, just listen to the hundreds of millions of users throughout the world. It is clear as day as to why this plant is coming under attack...THANKS BIG PHARMA! As a threat to the pharmaceutical industry and the use of it's overpriced and relatively less safe drugs, it's no wonder that people like myself are up in arms. As a country we expect our government to protect the people of our country and work to provide them with a happier and healthier life to \"make this country great again\". This is a call for our country to take a step in the right direction and take care of its people. Not only monetarily, but health wise as well! DO NOT BAN KRATOM! IT WOULD BE A DISERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY! I'll end on this, there are military men and women out there using this stuff each and every day to ease the pain and live the lives they want to live after sacrificing for this country...if the decision is made to overturn this proposed ban, at least do it for our service men and women.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5237","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ernest Santos","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm concerned about this decision being in the hands of a man who has gone on record calling medical cannabis a \"joke\".\nMaybe Mr Rosenberg has been fortunate enough to have never needed the medical benefits of cannabis, but I can assure him that the many Americans who do rely on 'medical marijuana' to EAT and SLEEP and LIVE their lives, do NOT think it is a 'joke'. Nor do those Americans appreciate the FACE OF THE DEA making such an ignorant, FALSE and insensitive remark about their medication!\n\nIf the HEAD OF THE DEA said that insulin was a 'joke', just because he was uneducated to the point of being unaware of the importance of maintaining healthy sugar levels, I would have no choice but to speculate as to HOW he got a job that he was so markedly UNQUALIFIED to do! The same is true for cannabis! Even MORE SO since cannabis can help treat many different ailments, whereas insulin is used solely to treat diabetes.\n\nEVERY DAY I see the words 'OPIOID EPIDEMIC' used to describe one of the main problems with society here in The USA. The amount of WASTE, in terms of MONEY, law enforcement resources, freedom, time and lost American lives caused by our opioid epidemic is beyond incalculable! It has greatly weakened our country, and there is no end in sight.\n\nHOW, under these circumstances, do you even CONSIDER banning one of the few tools that Americans have, that actually HELPS avoid, or end, addiction to opioids? KRATOM has been repeatedly credited by a significant amount of Americans as having helped save them from opioid addiction. Even the SUGGESTION of banning something that actually helps end a national epidemic puts the government at odds with the health of the nation itself! There is no light in which the DEA can ban something that helps the country recover from, what it calls an 'EPIDEMIC', AND be considered an asset to our nation!\n\nIf the DEA is not allied with the citizens of the United States in an effort to end substance abuse, then what is the purpose of the DEA? You either are part of the problem or part of the solution. As MY tax dollars are the source of the considerable fortune that is spent on your agency I find it DISTURBING, to say the least, that it is I, and my fellow Americans, who need to tell you that banning ANOTHER harmless substance that helps end an epidemic is the WRONG thing to do!\n\nWhile words like shocking and disappointed best describe my own reaction to even the idea of such reckless behavior, I would like to think that, even without the efforts of members of congress which led to this delay and discussion, the DEA would do what is in the best interest of the nation, just as a matter of practice and logic.\n\nPerhaps THIS step, which prevented a misstep, could lead to drug policies that do not negatively effect our nation, as opposed to the drug policies which have led us to this precipice. SCHEDULING, or effectively BANNING KRATOM, would be an EPIC BLUNDER! With the THOUSANDS of comments you have received, and an overwhelming number of them calling for Kratom to remain unscheduled, (about 95+% at my last count), I sincerely hope you can see how little support the citizens of the United States have for the past decision making of your agency.\n\nI remain hopeful that the knee jerk action which was just avoided was just the beginning of change in the way that the DEA handles their role in our country's drug policies and decision making. We need policies that help us move in the direction of HEALTH, not more disease!
