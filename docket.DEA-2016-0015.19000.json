I'm a machinist who stands for 12hrs a day and used to be in horrible pain everyday and couldn't bear standing anymore. My doctor said my only solution would be prescription narcotics and I really did not want to go down that road being a recovering alcoholic and risk getting addicted. I use Kratom everyday, once in they morning and once in the afternoon and my pain is gone after my dose! I am extremely thankful for this plant, without it I wouldn't be able to work everyday to provide for my wife and be the successful man I am today.

Have had these ailments since 1990. I also suffer from depression and PTSD from my teen years due to extensive physical and sexual abuse from childhood on.\nFor almost 25 years my physical ailments limited my life tremendously. I spent most of my time either in bed or on my couch because of the terrible pain. My emotional issues during that time kept me from being able to socialize or be among groups of people because I would have panic attacks and terrible anxiety.\nI learned of kratom in several pain groups I was involved with on social media.\nI had avoided all pharmaceutical medications because of the numerous side effects and the fact that they were all addictive.So,I was wary of kratom also,but was so tired of living as I was. I had no quality of life. \nI decided to try it in January 2015. \nI was extremely surprised to notice the almost immediate difference in my pain levels. They had been at a steady 8-10 all those years and were now at an appreciated level of 3-4. I was able to move around better with less pain. I could do simple everyday things others did,such as stand long enough to actually cook a meal,go to the supermarket myself to shop,do small loads of wash instead of the laundromat doing it for me. The biggest joy was being able to do things with my grandchildren! \nAs all of this was happening I also noticed I wasn't having panic attacks and could be amongst people again. I was able to go to church again!\nI once again feel like a productive member of society instead of being isolated. The thought of losing this simple plant from the coffee family and going back to that heartache frightens me. I never want to be there again.\nPlease don't condemn me to that life again. \nThere are so many thousands of us that have been helped by this plant.\nIt is not addictive,you cannot overdose on it,and there have been no deaths attributed to just kratom alone. The drugs that are FDA approved cannot make those claims,yet they are permitted to be prescribed to people who have become terribly addicted to them and there are thousands of deaths attributed to prescription pain medicine every year.\nPlease allow me to continue to help myself with this harmless plant. Do not sentence me to a life of isolation and agonizing pain.\nThank you for your time and your consideration of my plight,along with many thousands of others.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1742","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bernadette Johnson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have suffered with chronic pain for 20year inhave several auto immune disease with no cure.

Thank the lord that those substances are no longer legal but THEY ARE STILL ON THE STREETS and ruining peoples lives to this day and will continue to do so.\n\n How is it even possible that those HORRIBLE DRUGS were at a time, legal but something as wonderful as Kratom, which is 100% natural and herbal is even being considered something that may be illegal?! It makes no sense. \n\n Kratom has not only helped me with my tendinitis, arthritis, back pain from working manual labor my entire life, but it also has helped several of my friends and family fight addiction from opiods and suboxone and I am sure several other drugs that ruin lives.\n\n Kratom is natural. It is an herb! Like echinachea to boost your immune system, or Valerian root for anxiety and sleep disorders. These herbs are from God. God has put these plants on this world to help what ails us..and you know what? If you take it away..the addicts, the patients with chronic pain..they will just go find something else. Something not natural.

Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a plant indigenous to Southeast Asia. Traditionally, in certain regions of Southeast Asia, the chopped fresh or dried leaves of the tree are chewed or made into tea by local manual laborers to combat fatigue and improve work productivity. Its leaves contain the alkaloids mitragynine, and 7-hydroxymitragynine.  Kratom is used to treat pain, depression, anxiety, and opiate addiction. I use Kratom for several different reasons. It has improved my life and health.  It is not physically addictive, no more than caffeine (Its actually related to the coffee plant.) The DEA has recently expressed their intent to place Kratom on schedule 1, meaning it has no medical value and it also is extremely harmful to human health. The overwhelming evidence and my personal experience is that Kratom is extremely safe and definitely far safer than certain pharmaceutical, narcotic medicines. I ask for your help in this matter and request that you help allow this beautiful plant medicine to continue to improve peoples lives.\nMaximum King \n  We have included several links below that help to explain Kratom and this issue further.\nhttps://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/968786/\nhttp://www.newsweek.com/war-veteran-kratom-dea-taking-away-right-manageable-life-498996\nhttp://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/news/20160919/what-is-kratom-dea-ban\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/15/the-dea-wants-to-ban-another-plant-researchers-say-the-plan-is-insane/\n\n\nSincerely,\nJared J.

My illness started in 2011 when I came down with viral meningitis. I spent 3 days in the hospital and 6 months trying to recover, but I have never been the same. My central nervous system is severely out of whack, and I feel touch and pain much differently. Meningitis also kick started an autoimmune disease, and I am currently undergoing tests for Multiple Sclerosis, Lupus, and Myasthenia Gravis. I also have Fibromyalgia. My brain has also been affected. I now have a small tumor growing in my brain, among other lesions that my doctor has found. I (had) an IQ of 125, perfect vision, excellent memory and fantastic health. Now there are days when I can barely remember my own name, I now wear glasses, have chronic migraines and have been in the hospital 7 out of the last 30 days. I now suffer from major depression and an anxiety disorder, and I have frequent panic attacks. I feel useless. My organs keep going bad, and my appendix  (out this month) was my last expendable one. The pressure in my head is UNBEARABLE. The smallest infection (they couldnt find the source) made me go septic, and I spent 4 days in yhe TCU. The reason I am telling you this is because I want you to get an idea of how a truly sick person like myself has benefitted from kratom. Mytragina Speciosa is a safe, beneficial tea leaf. It is the safest alternative to opioid pain killers available. I was able to stay out of pain management for the last year because of this plant, even though I do qualify for pain management treatment. I don't want to become a junkie. I want to function and have a normal life, which I am able to do with kratom. I am the type of person that does extensive research before putting anything into my body. There have been no documented overdoses of kratom alone--all persons had other harmful substances in their system that ultimately caused death. I WANT to be around for my son. I want to live as long as my body will let me, without the risk of accidental overdose. Please consider doing research on the benefits of this plant, instead of banning it. There is valuable research that can be done to help other people like me. To make pain management as safe as scientifically possible. To treat and cure addiction. Please consider our testimonies, and don't ban Mytragina Speciosa and it's derivative alkaloid compounds. This will hurt so many people, and cause so many deaths. \nThank you for your time.\n ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7018","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandey Rhodes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I ask of you not to schedule this dietary supplement.

The country is currently facing an epidemic of opioid abuse, and these compounds represent one of the most promising treatment options for opioid addiction. Millions of people in the United States have safely used these compounds, particularly as a replacement for more dangerous opioids. Scheduling them now will only exacerbate the growing opioid epidemic by removing one of the few safe alternatives for people experiencing opioid addiction.

If you take this safe alternative away, I will have to go back to the opioids, and I don't want the pain clinic to turn me into a junkie.  As an agency supposedly there to help protect the public (and not just be an extension of \"Big Pharma\"), how, in the midst of this opioid crisis (which makes the crack explosion in the 80's look like childsplay), can you even consider banning this alternative which has been used through human history with little to no adverse consequences?  Most of the poor countries where it's grown made it illegal domestically because it's one of their only exportable cash crops, and the rest of the world pays better, NOT because they were concerned with their countrymen's well-being.  Please, regulate this industry for product consistency and set a minimum age (no one wants kids messing with any potential intoxicant).

When I was 14 I had a stroke. I'm now 22. Ever since then I've had chronic pain. Until I found kratom, I couldn't get by. I refused opiates because I knew the potential addiction risk was high. I wasn't doing well in school and my social life was hampered. I was on the computer looking for anything to ease my pain. I've tried acupuncture, stretching, and countless other remedies. Kratom was a life saver. It isn't at all addictive, no respiratory depression, and no one has ever died from a solely kratom overdose. Since I've started taking kratom my life has improved drastically. I'm a senior at Oklahoma University studying Chemical Engineering. I was shocked to hear that it could become a schedule 1 substance back in late August.  \n\nKratom has a wide variety of uses other than for pain. It helps relieve anxiety, it's an anti inflammatory, and it helps with sleep. Is the DEA going to make thousands of people around the country either be dependent on opiates, or suffer through life with chronic pain? I will lose my faith in the DEA if they schedule kratom. The real public health threat is if the DEA makes kratom illegal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20694","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cale Brown","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,thank you to everyone who approved this comment period. I am 20 years old and I live in Louisiana,I work everyday in air conditioning ductwork for industrial applications like college campuses,businesses,hospitals,ect. It is a very hot job and it's extremely hard work. When I was younger I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Around the age of 11 I was in a dirtbike accident and broke ribs. I was in bed for about a week or two and then i got up and wanted to race again, but everytime I rode after the wreck I noticed a slight pain in my back. I always pushed it off as fibro and took my lortab or tramadol and It helped a little. Well to get to the point when I turned 18,at this time my back has gotten so bad I have lost jobs because I can not work or even get out of bed. My life went downhill fast. In  about a year and a halfs time I had been addicted to every pain pill you could think of ( mostly Oxycontin, that did not work) so I started heroin. I weigh 123 lbs and was doing about $300 of it a day. Until I almost Overdosed. It made me want to stop. So I did it (with the help of family and friends) I withdrawed and hurt for days and nights. Seemed like forever. I had what I think was seizures, extreme vomiting, bowel movements uncontrollably, cold sweats, hot flashes, uncontrollable muscle movement and so on and so on. I WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT KRATOM THEN. But I got threw it. I used suboxone for about 5 months to help. But my back still hurt. I found kratom from a 79 year old lady that uses it for arthritis and has been for a long time. I was skeptical at first because I wanted to stay away for drugs that could possibly become addictive. I tried it one time and that day was the best day I have ever had. Pain was low and no WD symptoms. I felt human again. I have been enjoying this amazing plant for ever since. I have never had any bad side effects at all. I went from not being able to get up out of bed to having an amazing job that I love,married my bestfriend of years,and now have a babygirl comming in December. Kratom does not fix the problem. It's makes it liveable. I have not done any type of drug, alcohol,or pain killer since I found kratom. Please reconsider the ban on kratom and it's ingredients. I finally have my life back. Please don't take it away.. let my little girl have a happy actively great daddy. Please.

Kratom has aided in the relief of many ailments in many people. To make this plant illegal would be to destroy thousands of lives, lives of people who previously had been struggling  on a daily basis, who now are able to perform every day tasks, work a job, and just live life normally. Kratom comes from Southeast Asia, it grows naturally there and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Workers there chew on the leaves to gain energy, for an uplifted mood, and for analgesic qualities. \n     As for my personal experience, i am a 29 year old woman, with a child, a fiance(who also benefits from kratom) and a full time job as a pet groomer. I have struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life, and more recently panic attacks. i have been prescribed a number of medications for these problems, most to no avail. About 2 years ago my fiance and I discovered kratom. My fiance also has depression and anxiety, and chronic pain. He has greatly benefited from this plant, as his pain is reduced significantly. Both of our moods have been improved. We have increased energy, whereas before kratom our energy levels were at an all time low. Anxiety has been decreased to a point where a fast acting pill for panic attacks is only occasionally needed. We are able to better perform at our jobs, take care of our home, and be parents to our child. \n      Please take these comments into consideration before making a decision on scheduling kratom. If this plant is made illegal, the amount of people overdosing will most surely increase, as people who were on heroin or legal prescription pain killers took kratom to help wean themselves off of them, or helped with the withdrawals. To take away this plant wil be to take away the livelihood of thousands of people, people who only want to have a normal life with their families, much like myself and my fiance.

I support a family of four on a single income as Help Desk Technician. I have been to many doctors with little success for treatment. I have found that Kratom improves my quality of life after a hard days work. It isnt comparable to any drugs, marijuana, alcohol or other stimulants.  Kratom helps to improve my quality of life that I suffer with chronic pain. Please dont make this herb illegal. Cervical injections, botox injections, chiropractic care, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, yoga exercises have not helped with my pain.\n \nKratom is a well-known, well-researched herbal substance drawn from the leaves of trees within the coffee family. The number of cases of documented harm from kratom use is remarkably low, both as an absolute matter and when considered against the extensive history of use of kratom, both inside and outside the United States\n \nMitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are two of the primary alkaloids of this plant. These two compounds are not synthetic and should not be lumped together with  \"bath salts\" or \"spice\".\n \nKratom has been used as a medicine by many people for thousands of years. It is a potent remedy for physical pain, anxiety and depression, and could be used to aid with opiate withdrawal by those who would like to quit using illicit drugs such as heroin. Kratom is NOT a hallucinogen and should not be classified as such. Adding mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as a Schedule I substance is rash and unjustified prohibition, resulting in a foreseeable increase in street drug-related crime, as well as a punishment to those who are currently using it responsibly to treat various ailments.\n\nThe reason that there are no deaths solely attributed to Kratom is because Kratom does not affect your respiratory capacity. It does not slow down your central nervous system. It's potential to do harm is virtually impossible.\n\nKratom has very limited recreational capacity.  The White House petition has over 100,000 signatures for the \"Please do not make Kratom a Schedule I Substance.\" \n\nThe federal government has invested significant resources to develop alternative pain management strategies. This includes a study funded by the National Institutes of Health in partnership with the University of Massachusetts and the University of Mississippi to investigate the use of Kratom as a remedy for opioid withdrawal. This study led the researchers to apply for a patent identifying the Kratom extract, mitragyinine, as a useful treatment for other addictive drugs besides opiate derivatives. The DEAs decision to place Kratom as a Schedule I substance will put a halt on federally funded research and innovation surrounding the treatment of individuals suffering from opioid and other addictionsa significant public health threat. Remember the DDear Colleague Letters of Senator Hatch and Congressman Mark Pocan.\n \nWe hope you realize the threat this scheduling causes the people seeking legitimate use of this special plant to improve our quality of life.

I found kratom 2 years ago and have been using it daily. The reason i started using kratom is because i have no cartlige lwft in my knees and two blow disks in my lower back. I moved furniture for four years and now i re renovate condominiums around the world. All of that being physical labor has put me in bad shape already and i am only 20 years old. Before kratom i also had depression anxiety and severe pain all throughout my day, and did not want to take pain medication because of physical labor i didnt want to be out of it or loopy because it could cause someone or myself to get hurt. But with kratom it takes away my pain doesnt leave me loopy takes away my depresion, anxiety and alows me to enjoy life at its fulleat i have started going out and actually talking to other people wich was a huge step for me considering i was a major recluse before because i have social anxiety. I know so many people who kratom has helped along with myself it isnt harsh on your body like pharmacuticales even mild stuff like ibuprofen. And to take away this plant because you havent done the proper testing is absolutely absurde in my opinion thats like saying im going to take away your coffee because it might posibly be dangerouse and it can be in high dosage just like anything else though anything in excess can be bad for you. Just please do the proper testing listen to the people were all basically expers on kratom now since we have been using it for so long and do your own testing to prove to you its not bad for you and you dont get high off of it. It helps with most alments in my opinion.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0880","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jacob Roe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom had been incredibly beneficial to my diet.

After many doctors visits and different SSRIs (among other pharmaceuticals) I was a lot poorer and without any viable solutions. I felt like I had no choice but to accept my sentence of feeling like this forever. This created a vicious cycle of constant anxiety out of fear I couldn't keep up with my responsibilities with my job and this anxiety led to depression. I lost all interest in everything I enjoyed in life. I have always been an active person and enjoy sports so I really knew something was wrong at this point. The anxiety eventually led to chronic muscle tension and this causes chronic low grade pain in my muscles. It was a friend who introduced it to me to Kratom and described it as a mild opioid. I gave it a try and found my mood lifted within an hour and I had that vitality of life back that I had lost due to the severe depression, anxiety and chronic muscle pain. Kratom literally gave me my life back when literally nothing else helped. I was able to ween off all pharmaceuticals with this plant and have lost over 37 pounds (I needed to as I was overweight due to inactivity because of depression) this year with exercise and diet. I do not believe I would of been able to get off of the SSRI I was on without this miracle plant. Please consider not making Kratom a schedule 1 drug.

It has this effect while also acting as a mild stimulant, a dual effect that is rather unique in the herbal world. \nI was diagnosed with social anxiety at the age of 19. Anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medications have had little effect on my ability/motivation to socialize. I think of kratom as an almost life-saving \"social lubricant.\" It has allowed me to excel at job interviews, work in a healthcare setting (which would otherwise be impossibly nerve-wracking for me) and succeed in school. Without the legality of this herbal plant, my life would undeniably suffer. \nTo think the DEA wants it to be a schedule 1 substance is mind numbingly maddening. I support Kratom and will fight for the right to consume it. As an aside, my pattern of use varies from consistent, sporadic, to none at all. To say there are withdrawal effects past the severity of coffee is absurd.

It would also deprive this helpful and inexpensive resource to people who find themselves battling opioid addiction in the future.\n\nI'd been prescribed hydrocodone for my back in 2004.

I was worried about stopping taking them for fear of withdrawal.\n\nI read online about kratom. I tried it, and found that it eased my withdrawal symptoms to the point where I could comfortably function, and even go to work. I was no longer in that \"opiate fog\" I had been in every day for months on end. A dose in the morning, and a dose before bed did the trick.\n\nAfter a few weeks, I stopped the kratom intake and have been able to keep off hydrocodone since. In all my times taking kratom, I have always found its effects to be subtle and mild. Akin to the effect caffeine has. In my experience, alcohol is way more potent a drug than kratom.

I was 21 at the time and in college.  This disease placed me in the hospital on many occasions, and threatened my life several times.  My team of doctors were great but all plans of action failed; forcing them to strongly suggest the removal of my large intestine as well as a portion of my small.  I was an athlete my whole life and they were clear that this procedure would limit my ability participate in sporting activities, assuming I would successfully recover.  I refused the operation and trusted in God to see me through.  I figured, I was born with them and I will die with them.  They accepted my choice and placed me on a morphine drip for the pain.  Months later I slowly recovered to a place of health that was nothing short of a miracle.  During my recovery, the pain was excruciating but I always turned away the prescriptions of pain killers the doctors wrote.  I never wanted to become dependent on them and made the choice to avoid them.  Throughout the years, flare ups have been a regular occurrence.  Each flare up has been met without the aid of prescription pain killers.  My family hated to see me in such terrible pain and often looked for homeopathic ways to help me.  All efforts fell short until my brother researched and recommended Kratom.  When I looked into it and found enough evidence of its non-addicting attributes I decided to try it.  It has been a God send.  Not only did it help me manage my pain, it helped me in many other ways dealing with such a debilitating disease.  \nI am now 36 years old.  I am the Business Operations Officer for River Pediatric Therapies in which I oversee and navigate all business decisions for future growth.  I have also opened a successful gym in my spare time.  There are many factors that have helped me be successful from such a sick and debilitating start.  There is no question that Kratom was one of these factors.  As for the debate on Kratoms addictive qualities; I have never experienced any dependency on it at any time.  I went from taking it daily during a bad flare up to only taking it when pain arises, which currently is about once every two weeks or so.  I ask that you take my story to heart and keep the one supplement that has truly helped me legal.\n\nThank you,\n\nJustin\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5021","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Erdner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whomever it may be of concern, \n\nI write this letter in order to just further add to the rhetoric that Kratom should not be classified as schedule-1 drug. It has been shown to help people who are currently struggling with an addiction to painkillers. If this drug could be regulated and used as treatment for these people then I believe it could truly help those struggling with addiction, and more importantly, it would be beneficial to their families. \n\nI'm originally from Boston MA. And growing up in Boston I saw many things, and one of those things being heroin addiction. In 2015 my uncle charlie died after he overdosed on heroin. He had broken his knee two years prior and started taking pain killers for his injury. The only problem was that he became hooked on those fucking pills. He'd be popping them like they were tick tacks, and after a while it became pretty evident that he had started to develop a problem. After his insurance couldn't cover the medication anymore he moved on to shooting heroin, and other substances. I slowly watched a man who was in many ways like a big brother too me become a completely different human being. He would constantly lie about why he needed money, when in reality he just needed a quick buck so he could go shoot up. I honest to god believe that if this drug was made available then circumstances like these would be avoided. For me and for many people whom have had relatives that struggle with an addiction to painkillers, and then see those addictions become much worse. \n\nSo I please ask you to reconsider what the effects of criminalizing this drug could have. If not with yourself, then the consequences it could have for others and their families.

I began using kratom in August of 2013, and discontinued when it became illegal in my state. I  respect the law, although kratom was a miracle supplement for me. I suffer from a chronic lung disease. Many days of the year, my condition is so debilitating that I can barely make it to the restroom, and I frequently am required to spend days in the hospital. Kratom can't cure my disease but on the days when I'm having a minor flare-up, which doesn't require hospitalization, it's instrumental in helping me go about my day. It gives me a boost in energy, helps alleviate pain, and even seems to open up my airways a bit. I've found it very difficult since it was deemed illegal because I'm stuck with the symptoms of a disease that is incurable. Kratom provided me with a better quality of life that I had thought impossible without the use of prescription narcotics, which are highly addictive and mind-altering. I've been down that path, became addicted (to prescription narcotics) and refuse to go down that path again. No one has ever accused me or asked me if I was high or inebriated when using Kratom because I wasn't, not did I appear so.

I've been using kratom for close to 10 years now on a daily basis. I first started using it because of depression and severe anxiety. It's helped me leaps and bounds in both respects since and is now part of my daily vitamin regiment. Not only does it help me more than prescribed medication like xanax or clonazepam, it is completely non addictive and no side effects either. I know at least five other people who take Kratom regularly with similar outcomes as my own. Not only has kratom helped me significantly in my everyday life, it also works extremely well for my back pain. After suffering from a ruptured disc in my lower back, taking prescription medicine started to form an addiction to the opiates I was taking, Vicodin at the time, and not to mention the horrible stomach pain they'd given me as well. I stopped taking my prescribed medicine and went strictly with kratom. It helped me so much I had no need for the prescribed medicine anymore and I'm truly thankful for that. In a day and age when marijuana can be legal for recreational use, I can't help but pray that kratom remains legal as well as I believe millions of people benefit from all the positives it brings with very few if any negatives, and not to mention, it's completely natural! No chemicals! My story is not the only one. There are people far worse off than I, who if it weren't for kratom, would be suffering to no end. \n\nSincerely,\n\nJim Kuzmiskas","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22450","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jim Kuzmiskas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has many benefits and has not been an addictive or impairing substance when taken in correct doses.

As regulation has tightened on opioids in response to the addiction epidemic, it has been increasingly difficult for me to get access to this medication. Although I have never had an addiction problem, I have had physicians refuse to prescribe it because of their own feelings about the drug. When my physician does prescribe it, I am often subjected to burdensome and even humiliating conditions, including drug tests, before I can get a prescription refilled.\n\nUntil very recently, I was forced to accept these conditions as the price I paid for access to the only drug that has has been fully effective in treating my pain. But in the last six months I discovered Kratom and it has changed my life. The plant is just as effective for treating my chronic pain, and I have been able to get access to it without stigma or embarrassment. As a result, I have been able to significantly curtail my use of opioids for pain management. So naturally I was distressed and upset when I heard the DEA had moved to cut off my access to Kratom and force me back into the regular use of prescription opioids. This struck me as incredibly irresponsible, and even cruel, based more on perception than science. The outcry from the public, the scientific community, and even Congress, and the DEA's relatively unprecedented decision to back down from the rescheduling, tells me my suspicions were correct.\n\nPlease do not take away the access that I and many many others depend on to a natural substance that serves to lessen our dependence on synthetic opioids, while treating very real, very painful conditions. Kratom is safe, has few if any of the addictive characteristics of opiods, and is highly effective. To remove access to it makes absolutely no sense under the DEA's previous reasoning.\n\nThank you.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6954","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Keep it legal and do more research.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9773","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Nichols","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 63 years old and retired (disabled). I worked for The Electrical Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) as Sr. Compliance Engineer. In 2011, I was forced to take disability due to five (5) unsuccessful back surgeries. I have been under the care of a Pain Management (PM) doctor since 2007 for chronic pain (CP), and I am in good standing with my all of my doctors.\n\nI strongly oppose the DEA's choice to move Kratom to a Schedule 1 drug or to restrict it in any form. Many CP patients exchange psychological pain in return for limited physical relief - I am one of them. In addition to the dismal side effects of opiates, we are treated like drug addicts on parole. For those of us who have access to treatment, the presumption of guilt overshadows and influences all aspects of said treatment. We must sign a one sided contract, which robs us of our rights as patients. If we refuse, we suffer. Our privacy is invaded with drug testing and pill counting. Many doctors viewed us as a liability and marginalized us as human beings. No other class of patients endures this kind of treatment! Can you find equality and the due process promised to us by the Constitution in the setting described above? What about our rights!\n\nThis experience lead me to discovered Kratom earlier this year (2016), I have found this plant to be safe and effective in reducing pain without the side effects of opiates. It is also less expensive than doctor's visits and medication. It has been good for my mental well being, too. My blood pressure has dropped. My cognitive ability has returned to normal and did so proportionally as I reduced the intake of pain medication. I am able to do more chores around the house. I can make plans without worrying about the restrictions of being tied to one pharmacy or obtaining a written script every 30 days (PM contract), which includes a 2.5-hour drive. I don't have to worry about the pharmacy being out of the medication, or endure being viewed as a \"drug seeker\" by the pharmacy technicians. CP is bad enough on its own, but when combined with the treatment that comes with it, it can make life unbearable. Imagine what this would be like for you. Would you want this kind of treatment for yourself, or a parent, spouse, or child? Think long and hard about it!\n\nAgain, I oppose any restrictions on Kratom. In closing, I would like to say that I will never be free from pain, but thanks to this plant, I am free of pain medication and free from the draconian environment that accompanies CP treatment. And equality important, I have regained my personal dignity and a modest measure of independence. There are many who testify to this fact. This is real progress: Do not rob us of this small victory!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5401","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kent Grammer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In my opinion i dont believe Kratom should be made a schedule one drug.

I have attached another copy as a .txt file to make it easier to read if the formatting is not retained.\n\nI was an opioid addict for nearly a decade, most of that time spent struggling and failing to get clean. Kratom was the only way I was able to beat this, and I have been using it for almost three years with no ill effects. I don't think it's hyperbolic to say that Kratom saved my life. I'm also afraid of what will happen if it gets banned again and remains illegal. I know many people who are in the same situation as I am. I have tried Suboxone in the past, but it was impossible for me to bear the cost of the expensive prescription and monthly doctor appointments. Additionally, it caused many harmful side effects such as chronic severe constipation and left me with an addiction just as bad, if not worse, than I originally had.\n\nFrom my own experiments I believe that it is physically impossible to suffer a fatal (or even dangerous) overdose from Kratom alone. The plant contains alkaloids other than mitragynine and 7-hydroxy mitragynine. At least one of them has been found to be an opioid receptor antagonist. When an individual consumes an exceptionally large dose of Kratom, these other alkaloids present themselves in sufficient amounts that they start to block the opioid action of mitragynine and 7-hydroxy mitragynine in addition to causing a number of unpleasant (but not dangerous) side effects which resemble a hangover from alcohol (headache and nausea being the most notable) and fade within a few hours.\n\nNormal Kratom doses range from 3-5 grams up to 15-20 grams. In order to show the relative safety of Kratom compared to other substances, I have consumed as much as 30 grams or more on multiple occasions. While I did experience headache, nausea, and mild dizziness at such large doses, there was not a single instance in which I experienced any respiratory depression whatsoever  or felt the need to seek medical attention. Based on my observations, I do not believe that Kratom poses any significant threat to public health and safety whatsoever.\n\nI think it is worth noting that the letter of intent published by the DEA cited 15 deaths and 660 calls to Poison Control Centers associated with Kratom use in the entire USA in two years' time. While myself and many others clearly find this number to be dubious and suspect the true number to be zero, for a moment let's assume that it is accurate. That would mean that in two years, 15 people have been harmed while thousands have used it to free themselves from addictions to much more dangerous substances. For comparison:\n\n- From 2013-2014 there were about 22,000 calls to Poison Control Centers due to ingestion of laundry detergent pods. \n\n- In 2014 Poison Control reported 112,412 calls for antidepressants, 66,058 for vitamins, and 31,903\nfor exposure to hydrocarbons such as gasoline (source: https://aapcc.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/annual_reports/2014_AAPCC_NPDS_Annual_Report.pdf)\n\n- Data obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that more than 300    people die annually as a result of acetaminophen poisoning. Acetaminophen is also responsible for roughly 100,000 calls to poison control and 60,000 emergency room visits annually in the USA alone.\n\n- The CDC reported 29,001 deaths due to alcohol in 2013.(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf)\n\n- In the USA in 2013, 1,182 individuals were treated at a medical facility for overdose of caffeine with 12 of them experiencing major negative health symptoms.\n\n- Cows kill 20 people per year in the USA (40 per 2 years = 2.67 times as deadly as Kratom)\n- Dogs kill 28 people per year in the USA (56 per 2 years = 3.73 times as deadly as Kratom)\n- Bees, Wasps, and Hornets kill 58 people per year in the USA (116 per 2 years = 7.73 times as deadly as Kratom) [all three of these sourced from CDC]\n\nI could go on but I think I've made my point. A good friend of mine just died from an opioid overdose a few days ago. It's time for us to start doing things a different way. The people being helped by Kratom are friends, neighbors, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers. It is inhumane to cut them off from the treatment that allowed them to regain a normal life, especially when doing so leaves them with no other options.\n\nIf Kratom is banned permanently, I guarantee that deaths from both illicit and prescription opioids will increase considerably. This isn't even speculation; it has already happened in the states that have banned Kratom on their own.

To ban this would be outrageous. The only reason I can see this plant being banned is because it helps people rid their addiction to pharmaceutical drugs which in turn will take profits away from the pharmaceutical companies. Our world is so twisted and corrupt to the point where big pharma and our government work together to profit off of drugs that harm individuals rather than promote the use of organic and natural remedies. Most of the time the side effects of pharmaceutical drugs are worse than the condition being treated. If you want to make a positive difference in this world you would not ban kratom.

I am a father of 6 and happily married since to a wonderful  since 2004. \nIn 2008 after suffering a lower back injury in a martial arts competition I was forced to visit a specialist to help me get back to teaching and competing as a top martial artist instructor\nFor 6 straight months I attended Physical Therapy, massage therapy and even tried acupuncture, but no matter what we tried the pain was getting worst, day in, day out.\n\nIt was so bad that my entire left side of the body was almost useless.\nSo my Dr. prescribed hydrocodone for the pain. Boom! after 2 hours of drinking my new little white pills, the pain was gone. Not only was the pain gone but I felt amazing. So the next month I told the Dr to please increase my dosage since 1 pill wasn't doing the job any longer.\n\nTo make a long story short 30 pills went to 60, 60 went to 120 and 120 went to over 300 a month. I was addicted for the first time in my life. One day after having gone to the Dr to get my pills he told me that he could not do that for me any longer, I was shocked and destroyed. My body started going into the worst withdrawal symptoms in history. I wanted to kill myself! Desperate to find something to take the edge off I went to the street for help. I had no choice. my wife went from having an all-star athlete to now having to put up with a junkie. I lost my job and was quickly losing my home and family. \n\n As I searched and searched for an answer I finally gave in and started using heroin. I was shocked at how quickly my withdrawals symptoms went away. 2 weeks of mental health hell, relieved by a 10 dollar bag of heroin. the catch? The heroin addiction was even worst because my heroin habit went from 2 bags a day to 2 bundles a day! I was officially screwed. After 2 months of using heroin, I decided enough is enough I went back to my Dr. and begged him to please prescribe to me a pill called suboxone used to treat heroin addicts.\n\n The Suboxone was another trap. Yes, I only needed a pill a day, but if 3 days passed without my dose, the ugly monster would come back and there I was again chasing a high I just could not control. Scared out of my mind that the suicide thoughts would eventually turn into action. For 7 straight years, I depended on Suboxone to live a half way decent life until again my Dr surprised me with the news that he could no longer prescribe them anymore. And there I was again with 6 pills enough to last me for a week and tired of chasing Dr's. this time though I was determined not to go back to heroin but to find a Natural remedy to my disease.\n\n That is when I found Kratom my life saver. I ordered some from a reputable online vendor, tried it and voila, my symptoms went away, except this time was different I wasn't feeling the high that opioids provide, but rather a natural sense of well-being and an increase in energy. it took me about 2 months to finally accept that with Kratom I wasn't going to get high. I don't use Kratom as much anymore but I will forever be grateful to that plant for helping me take back my life and be a father to my kids, Someone they can be proud of. for the first time in my life I have my own business and my family is closer than ever, we are even making plans to buy a house. I ask you to please do not take Kratom away from  us, it is not a drug to get high, it is an alternative a natural one for many diseases like drug addiction, pain, and depression.

I am very opposed to the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. Please do not take this amazing plant away from those of us who take it responsibly.  I started taking kratom about a year ago after hearing about it six months before that.  I had over-heard a couple of retired professionals who worked out at my gym at the time talk about how well it worked for them.  I decided to research it and eventually later started to try it.  At the time I was in pain management and had been prescribed a combination of Tramadol and HydroCodone for over 3 years. Soon after this my wife and I moved to another state after finding new jobs in the NorthWest.   Moving meant I had to find new Doctors.  I now have a great Primary Care Doctor but was told when we moved that it would take at least 3 months to get in with a new Pain Management Doctor.  Meanwhile I was told I would have to just go to the Emergency Room continuously while my pain would no longer be controlled through pain management! That is insane. I then decided to switch to only taking Kratom and it is the best decision I have ever made.  I no longer have the side effects and dangers of high doses of Hydrocodone and Tramadol. I continue to see my Doctor for all other issues and am considering a surgery to hopefully further reduce my pain. My pain is now at least manageable while I continue to stay healthy and productive for my family. \n\nPlease again, do not take this amazing plant away.  I would be forced to go to the ER and be put on a long wait list for pain management for a period that could also force me out of work and back into pain again that would make it impossible for me to take care of my family.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16852","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Loudon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I cannot believe this is even potentially happening.

I am a 46 year old woman, wife and mother. I have a Masters Degree in Clinical Social Work. I have suffered with mental illness since my late teens. I have been hospitalized many times for suicidal ideation, severe depression and psychosis. I have participated in talk therapy since my teens and started taking anti-depressants in my early 20s. However, I med resistant and none of the medications I have  taken have ever worked. Many of the medications have given me horrible side effects (i.e. psychotic episode). Last year, I had a course of Electroconvulsive Therapy. The treatments were not successful and until this day I suffer from memory loss and impaired cognition. As a result I am unable to work at this time.\nI have never abused drugs or alcohol. Currently, I am taking 4 medications to help combat Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, and Bipolar Type 2. The medications help stabilize me, but I still have trouble functioning on a daily basis due to the depression and the severe anxiety. I am no longer looking for a cure, but a way to \"manage\" my life in healthy ways.\nMy mother believed in homeopathic treatment, however, I resisted. And then I started to research the benefits of Kratom for individuals like myself. I read similar things in response to other medications and even ECT and I was skeptical. However, I decided if I was going to voluntarily shock my brain 5 days a week trying Kratom surely could not make things any worse.\nI continued to read and research. I finally ordered multiple strains to see if I could get the relief I needed. After several tries I started to notice a significant change in my mood, anxiety and behavior. It did not happen overnight. I noticed I was feeling good. I felt something I had never felt before. I had clarity and patience. A sense of happiness took over the continued feelings of hopelessness. I can't remember that last time I had any thoughts of suicide or violent outbursts. I discussed the changes I was experiencing with my therapist and she said this is what it feels like to have hope. This is what it feels like to want to be alive. This is what if feels like to enjoy your children. For the first time ever she said I was living a healthy lifestyle.\nTo this day, I am shocked at the remarkable changes in my life due to Kratom. I am certainly not cured and I never will be. I still feel depressed at times and I still have anxiety attacks. However, they are manageable and not debilitating. They don't last all day and they don't last for months at a time. Instead of sleeping all day and asking a friend to pick up my children from school, I get up with them in the morning, prepare breakfast and pick them up after school. I still may feel depressed but I am able to function. And then there are days, multiple days in a row where I feel good. And I can't believe it. Nothing has ever helped me the way Kratom has. Nothing has even come close. I am a better mom, wife, sister and daughter. I have control over my illness. My illness does not control me. I am happy. I see my future. Medication has never afforded me this wonderful opportunity for healing and recovery. If there is a ban on Kratom I do not know what I am going to do. I am terrified of going back to those dark, ugly places. I am afraid that I will not be able to leave my house for days due to crippling anxiety. I am afraid my children will see me sleeping all day. I dread the thoughts and planning for suicide. My one and only regret is that my mother is now deceased and has not been able to see me well after so many years of struggling and being unwell. \nPlease do not take this away from me. Please. It has changed my life in ways I never imagined.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18876","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly believe scheduling the alkaloids within kratom will hinder any and all further research on kratom.\n Mitrigyna Speciosa has been used for thousands of years, similarly to its close relative coffee, for energy, anxiety, relaxation etc. Though anecdotal, experience has shown this herbal supplement to be safe and very useful.\n I don't believe scheduling kratom as a narcotic would prove to be the best way of regulating it.

My name is Valorie Mall and I am a retired teacher with 30 years of memories of the best career anyone could imagine.  I am 65 years old.\n\nI am disabled resulting from chronic auto immune conditions, neuropathy, and stenosis. My emotional health is affected by PTSD.  DURIng my adult years I have used prescriptions for a variety of pain medications, anti depressants, and anti anxiety drugs. Some were very helpful, others were accompanied by life altering side effects such as memory issues, poor thinking skills, balance problems and unrelenting exhaustion.  At the end of December 2015 I fell and broke my leg in three places.  The hospital stay was a nightmare. Since I was a chronic pain patient it was nearly impossible to control the pain from the injury. After all the therapy to literally get back on my feet, I was done with the amount and types of medications I was on.  They did not help enough to justify how they were destroying my life. I could not speak or think clearly and I was constantly afraid of falling.  \n\nAfter he misery of getting myself off all my prescriptions without assistance, I had to find alternatives.  My pain and anxiety were still there and I had to find ways to deal with them.  I began searching the Internet for pain relief alternatives. I found kratom.  \n\nMy trial of kratom did not begin immediately, first I did research.  After reading many articles and communicating with people that were successfully using kratom for pain and anxiety relief, I was ready to try. I ordered a small amount from a well regarded online vendor.  The result was amazing. After I learned how to adjust amounts and strains, my pain was significantly diminished and my anxiety was under control.  But the best part was there were no side effects.  Friends and family began to comment on the change in me. I could speak and think clearly. I was able to progress at improving my stamina and physical strength.  My sleep had fewer PTSD interruptions. \n\nThere is no cure for the issues I deal with physically and emotionally. But kratom has helped me manage symptoms and improve my quality of life. There are not enough words to explain the difference in my life. I do not believe this wonderful plant should be a schedule 1 substance.  It will negatively impact so many lives. We deserve our chance to lead productive and satisfying lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8468","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Valorie Mall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 49 year old female, mother of three, wife and full time employee. 14 years ago, I could barely leave the house.

I had severe anxiety, depression, horrific pain as well as fibromyalgia. I was at my wits end and was begging God for help. Nothing helped. I did not want to be addicted to medications I wanted to function like a normal human being. That's when someone on an online fibro support group suggested kratom tea. I researched and studied it before I purchased it. After the first cup of tea, I was able to stop tramadol that day. I also stopped my anxiety meds that day. I felt energetic and had a sense of well being. Every day thereafter was an improvement. I had energy and was able to function. I raised my kids, took care of my husband and our home and was able to get a job. I work full time as a safety director and human resources manager.

I believe that responsible adults should have the right to use alternative natural safer pain relievers, such as kratom, rather than turn to very addictive opiates that are often used to medicate pain but have a much higher dependency and dangerous side effects compared to kratom. I have personally been suffering from slowly coming off of years worth of SSRI medication addiction I've used Kratom to help with headaches migraines and body pain for awhile now. Kratom has been a life saver for me. I can honestly say that a common SSRI medication prescribed to me from my doctor was a lot more dangerous and harmful towards my physical and mental health. I've used Kratom off and on to help reduce pain levels and allow me to cope with day-to-day activities. I have stopped for months at a time and had no repercussion withdrawal effects yet I feel hundred percent better when I do use it responsibly to help alleviate my pain. There are many others out there like me but suffering even worse than I am, and can honestly say Kratom has saved their lives. There are thousands of products out there that are way more harmful for our health but legal to sell here in america such as Alcoho, Tobacco, and many of the over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs as well as the chemicals put in our processed foods that we eat daily. I find it disturbing that Kratom has been targeted for a ban. Please do not ignore our voices.

I struggle with constant back pain due to two herniated discs and after I received treatment I was prescribed Tramadol and methylcarbamoyl. Most of my pain is induced while at work due to my heavy workload day to day. The main issue I constantly struggle with is the side effects of the prescribed medication, such as nausea and drowsiness. Taking Kratom as a supplement has helped me in my everyday life. I am able work productively without having to worry about any overbearing symptoms. Other than my back issues, like most women I endure menstrual cramps every month and instead of taking over the counter Midol I've discovered that the Red strains of Kratom alleviate my cramps and improve my hormonal  mood. Kratom is used in its most natural form and it doesn't compare to the chemically compound products that can be potentially toxic to my body. Kratom shouldn't be conisdered a dangerous substance nor should it be scheduled in the same category as heroin or cocaine. I believe we should be able to turn to a more natural alternative without being forced to take addictive pain medication.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21389","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tanya Chacon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom.

I understand there is a lot of concern recently over this plant, however, there is also a lot of misinformation regarding this plant too. I specialize in opiate misuse treatment. I graduated with a masters degree in mental health counseling from Viterbo University. I have been working in the Medically-Assisted Treatment field for almost three years and have significant experience helping people end their opiate addiction and heal the extensive damage that occurs cognitively from extended opiate misuse. I am also very adept at working with methamphetamine addiction which this specialized area is still very much in its infancy yet.  \n\nMany people I have spoken to over the last couple years report that Kratom has been very helpful in alleviating symptoms of withdrawal from their opioid medications when they stop wanting to take these narcotics and retain their former quality of life. Of course this plant became something of interest to me and over the last two years I began doing some research and spoke with hundreds of people about how this plant works for them and what their experiences are regarding Kratom.  I have learned that if you take too much you will feel very sick and ultimately you may even throw up. I believe the knowledge that this plant can help with opiate treatment has caused many, many people to seek it out and use it as a home remedy. I also think that not everyone does their research about this plant and if used improperly there could be fear enough to call 911 and ask for help- hence the increase in CDC poison control calls in the last few years regarding Kratom. This is where regulation is needed and can help protect and inform the public on proper kratom consumption.\n\nKratom was banned in Wisconsin, when misinformation was at its highest, so I have had no contact with the substance. I suspect many people in the DEA have as much personal experience with this plant as I, but why is it that an addiction expert and a government entity have such opposing views on this topic? Deep down I just dont see how banning more plants is going to help in the opioid epidemic. Also, if this leaf works as many people say that it does, I believe banning Kratom would actually increase the likelihood of people using heroin when the DEA cuts off the opioid supply in 2017 due to changing regulation. I truly believe that banning Kratom will have a direct impact on increasing overdose death rates if this plant is able to ease people from resorting to opiates and/or heroin use. \n\nAs a clinician, I also encourage you to look at this issue from a clinical perspective, and if you are not sure what that means I can explain. First, It is important to understand what defines substance abuse and how it impacts a person's life. If you can't control your use, and begin to spend more time participating in drug seeking activities, and lose touch with what is important to you (job, family, self-care) then you have a substance misuse issue. An avid opioid user cares for nothing other than their drug, and the thought of getting and using their drug is what fills their thoughts every waking minute of their day. People who use heroin or other opioids are likely to spend a great deal of money to fuel their habit. They are likely to commit crimes and ultimately put their lives at risk of death. Heroin and other opioid pills are what killed nearly 40,000 people in 2014 due to overdose. \n\nThe Kratom community appears to be a very different population of people. We see a lot of people talking about wanting a quality life back, and seeking to be active in their communities, families, and their personal pursuits. We see people who have taken the reigns of health back in order to deal with a great many symptoms that may have prohibited their former quality of life. They are unwilling to accept that powerful narcotics are the only answer, and that difference in thinking is incredibly important. People who use a plant to engage and participate in life in a functional and positive way are not the people taking great risks with their health. This is a dramatic difference in lifestyle choices and overall outlook towards life and life's possibilities.\n\nI want to close by reiterating that the typical person who uses Kratom is someone with a family, job, education, a desire for quality of life, and goals for their future. Someone trapped in addiction is typically silent in their struggle, disconnected, hopeless, and even suicidal. The question that must be asked is what does the Kratom community appear to be like to you? When you see the efforts being made by hundreds of thousands of people fighting for Kratom, does it resemble strung out behavior? The answer is \"No\" it doesn't, because they are two very separate populations and only one of them needs any help.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0947","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gregg Scharf","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I use Kratom as a crucial part of my pain management program.

I went from ingesting pills, to snorting pills to shooting heroin. I tried cold turkey withdrawal hundred's of times and it never worked. While on opiates, I always felt as though I were a zombie. I was unable to function to work, or maintain a job for all that time. Until one day I read about kratom. I decided to withdrawal from the opiates and try the kratom. With the kratom, I was able to stay off opiates and stay clean for over 5 years. Over these last 5 years, I've gotten married, had 2 children and started my own business. Since quitting opiates and starting kratom I've been clear headed and able to own a business and start my own business while married with a child. Please don't schedule kratom, I know if it is going to be scheduled that I am going to have no choice but to go back on opiates and ultimately go back to heroin and I am really really scared to even think about it.

I have a back injury that caused me to seek a doctors recommendation.as a result I was given Norco to ease the pain. I took my pills as prescribed at first but that quickly became a thing of the past.  I became an addict. My pills consumed every aspect of my life. I stayed on that ride for 7 years before I finally decided that I could no longer put my family through one week of hell every month because I was chasing a high. Out of desperation I looked up natural remedies for opiate withdrawal online and I found several articles on kratom. I decided that it was worth a shot so I bought some and figured out my \"quit date\". I took it and although I didn't feel any \"high\" I felt all of the withdrawal symtoms subside. 6 months later and I have not taken one pill ever since my quit date. I still take kratom twice a day but sometimes will go a few days without taking it just so I know that I still can physically. I've never experienced withdrawals from kratom. I've never felt high from kratom. I have however gotten my life back thanks to Kratom. Please do not take this away from my family and i. They love the man I have become and they deserve better than the pill chaser that I use to be, and would become again without Kratom. I still suffer from the same back pain, but thanks to Kratom it is bearable. \nKratom is all natural. Kratom is a plant. Kratom does not belong on a list of narcotics along with heroin. In fact it belongs on the short list of substances that can save people from the grip of heroin. Please don't take that away from the people that will turn back to heroin. \nThe people that take kratom are nurses, doctors, lawyers, teachers, entrepenuers....professionals....adults. we should be able to decide if we want to use this herb.

For so long this herb has been a little known supplement used by a relatively small number of people for various reasons, but recently it has gained attention in the public and I believe the general perception of what exactly this herb is and does has been skewed and warped by inaccurate reports from the media, and by subjective experiences of people who took it as a drug, for a high, something it should not be used as.\nIn my experience Kratom was truly a life saver.  I had been addicted to heroin for 4 years when i was put on a suboxone maintenance program.  When I tried to get myself off of suboxone I found the withdrawals to be even more painful and far longer lasting than the heroin.  I eventually relapsed and continued to use heroin for another year.  When I finally discovered Kratom I took it to ease he pain if heroin withdrawal, and that is exactly what it did for me.  It didn't get me high, in fact the only effect produced was relief of withdrawal symptoms.  without Kratom I would still be a heroin addict, or I would be dead.  This herb saved my life, just as it has for so many others.\nBanning Kratom will only increase the number of people stuck in a cycle of opioid addiction, it will have zero positive impact on our nation.  Please reconsider banning this supplement, a ban will only hurt the people you are trying to help.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2354","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Peter Rustad","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Brian Baumgardner, I'm a 47-year old graphic designer and photographer from Dayton, Ohio. The following statements represent my opinions on kratom prohibition. \nI first learned about kratom 8 years ago through an online pain management support group as I was dealing with severe pain from a growth in my sinus cavity. Kratom helped me deal with the pain both pre- and post-operative without the need for dangerous prescription narcotics.\nSince then, I have occasionally used kratom to help with pain and seasonal depression. This herb makes it possible for me to avoid pharmaceuticals and their negative side effects.\nAside from pain and depression, kratom has other proven beneficial uses not the least of which is reducing withdrawal symptoms for those trying to quit using opiates and other addictive drugs. With the current opiate issues affecting this country, this might be one of the most important benefits of this plant.\nWith decades of prohibition as our countrys main weapon in the drug war, I think its safe to say it has failed. Drug problems are only getting worse. In May 2016 Alabama banned kratom without public comment. Since then, in Jefferson County alone, deaths from accidental overdose on prescription opiates and heroin have doubled. By April 2016 they saw 47 deaths, as of June 2016 there were 103 deaths attributed to opiates and heroin. http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2016/07/jeffco_sees_25_heroin_fentanyl.html\nKratom remained legal in every state that allowed public comment. After careful research in Florida, kratom remains completely unrestricted. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) released a December 2015 report titled Kratom - Mitragyna Speciosa, The Impact to Florida and found, Kratom does not currently constitute a significant risk to the safety and welfare of Florida residents. Additionally the report sites that the Florida Department of Health found there are no pervasive health issues which can be attributed to the ingestion of Kratom products in Florida. http://speciosa.org/official-statewide-intelligence-drug-report-kratom-and-the-impact-to-florida/ \nUnlike prescription opiates and heroin, kratom does not cause respiratory suppression. This is why I am so confident that not I, nor anyone else will die from drinking kratom by itself.\nThe DEA reasons that the 660 calls regarding kratom to US Poison Control justifies prohibiting the herb. In the same 6 years, there were 23,203 calls regarding caffeine, 66,300 calls about essential oils and 1,499 reports about Valerian root. By DEA reasoning these substances pose a far greater risk than kratom, yet I think it is safe to assume nearly everyone in the DEA and our government uses at least one of those. \nWhile kratom may have some opiate-like effects, it is not an opiate, nor is it a synthetic substance like bath salts as some states have classified it. Kratom has limited, if any recreational value. I never considered my cup of kratom tea a drug any more than I consider a cup of coffee a drug simply because I dont get high off of either one. If kratom had any recreational merit it would be much more popular than it is, after all it has been available here for over 20 years. If it didnt have medicinal properties, I wouldnt use it. \nAside from causing many Americans to suffer and even die, kratom prohibition would also put thousands of hardworking small business owners and their employees out of work. As a mature, educated adult I feel this would be careless and irresponsible. Kratom should remain unrestricted in the same way as Caffeine, essential oils and Valerian root.\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9348","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Baumgardner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It appears that all is well.

As an adult I can just go buy alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine at my convenience.  If alcohol were introduced today it would be a schedule 1 substance; it is dangerous, highly addictive, and has no medical use.  I don't need to tell you how deadly tobacco is, only that the death toll is so high it doesn't even make the news; tobacco deaths are so numerous they are just a statistic (480,000/year - CDC).  Caffeine is the safest of the 3 I've listed; despite that caffeine consumption has been linked to a handful of deaths over the years.  That brings me to kratom, which has been compared to opiates like morphine and heroin.  In truth, kratom is much more similar in its sedative effects to 2-3 beers and unlike alcohol, the effects are not cumulative and taking more kratom will just make you to your stomach instead of high.  Unlike other opioids kratom does not suppress your breathing and it is much less addictive; I was able to stop cold turkey after a year of daily use when the ban was announced with no ill effects.  The withdrawal from quitting caffeine cold turkey are much less pleasant.  The war on drugs has turned the government against its citizens, swelled our prison population, and made criminals out of otherwise law-abiding people.

It therefore does have a potential for abuse and addiction. However the side effects of the opiates contained in kratom are much less than those from poppy based synthetic opiates, and there is substantial scientific research supporting this claim. \n\nKratom also has other alkaloids that counteract the addictive and opiate agonistic properties of it's psychoactive opiates. This is known but poorly understood, more research is needed here. Because of this potential self-limiting property, this could be used for long term pain relief with more success than poppy based opiates. \n\nPoppy based opiates are also not useful for depression because of the addictive nature of them, and that tolerance builds quickly and it can \"dull\" the user and prevent them from driving / working. Kratom does not have such an intoxicating effect and something about it makes it much easier to focus and respond to ones' environment vs. poppy-based opiates. There is a huge need for opiate based antidepressants for some who have combined symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and depression, and a drug based on Kratom could be wildly successful. \n\nPersonally I believe that adults should have the freedom to make their own choice on what they put in their body, unless it is a substance that threatens their life or the lives of others (heroin, amphetamines). However, kratom is pouring in and we don't know where these leaves have been, if there is bacteria on them (kratom can and does cause digestive issues and I know from personal experience) - we don't know if the vendors are spiking it with synthetic opiates or what. It needs to be regulated the same as any other herbal supplement. If I go to my local supermarket I can be assured that at least some health code standards and regulations went to ensure that I'm not going to get some weird stuff in whatever supplement I buy - kratom should be no different.\n\nIt should also not be promoted in smoke shops as a \"legal high\" because that's silly - it should be used for a medical purpose only - not by high school kids wanting to get a buzz. I'm 100% in agreement with a minimum age of 18 or even 21 for kratom purchase. \n\nKratom is a serious substance, it has the potential to so much good if we can research it and decode it. I can only think that a process to extract it's alkaloids and create a drug out of it could be hugely successful and beneficial to society in that they have a far lower side effect to benefit ratio than other opiates on the market. I don't think there is a \"big pharma\" conspiracy - in fact I'd rather the regulatory agencies stepped in and made sure this plant is tightly regulated and not distributed to minors but available to adults who prefer this to antidepressants and traditional pain medication. \n\nI don't think prescription should be required to purchase kratom or any drugs based on it - but that would be better than banning it outright. SOME cost effective solution needs to be in place for the millions (yes millions) of people who are currently using this plant and benefit from it. It saves people from far more dangerous opiates, and helps people with chronic pain live their lives better. \n\nI personally would definitely pay more for a drug where a company did the research on which alkaloids are good and which are bad, isolated the alkaloids that are beneficial and limit the side effects (some alkaloids I believe create some of the side effects), and provided me a drug based on kratom where I didn't have to digest as much plant matter (digestive issues are the #1 side effect by far despite all the misinformation). A little bit of research and pharmaceutical technology has the chance to harness the power of this plant to create a solution for so many people.\n\nHowever - the plant itself should be legal to purchase because it's very cheap and some people probably can't afford the derivative drugs, and it honestly poses very little safety threat when used responsibly (15 deaths but none from Kratom alone). So ramp up the research, ramp up the regulation, but by God don't ban something with so much potential.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3053","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"First of all, thank you for allowing the public to submit comments regarding the herb kratom.

On the days I consume kratom, I find I can more easily get through my day and it helps me to be more active. I believe it is a healthier alternative to other choices available to me and I have never noticed any negative effects.  Kratom does not seem to have properties that would lend itself to abuse and I cannot think of any reason why this plant should be banned.  A family member who studies plants recommended kratom to me.  Since then I've talked to other responsible adults who have told me that consuming kratom has literally saved their lives by allowing them to function in their jobs and to take care of their families, whereas previously they had no choice but to take prescription drugs such as opiates which interfered with carrying on a normal life.  In my opinion, many lives would be negatively affected without access to kratom. \n\nFurthermore, as a business owner, I am concerned that if kratom were placed on the DEA's list of Schedule I drugs, thousands of people who currently consume kratom in order to be productive citizens would be unable to work and instead reduced to relying on welfare programs and disability income to support themselves and their families. The impact of restricting access by responsible adults would be tragic for businesses and the economy.

I work full time as as caretaker for an 83 year old woman who has severe dementia and needs 24 hour care. \n    I first heard about kratom through several friends who were enrolled in a massage therapy course with me. Two of my fellow classmates had been on vicodin for several years and both had been able to replace that habit with the use of kratom. They recommended I try it one day when i was having some menstrual cramps, and I went out to a local store and purchased some. \n\n    I found a very small amount of kratom (I don't have amount scale but about 1tsp, so maybe 1/2 gram?) an effective painkiller that didn't prevent me from doing homework or other daily activities. I still use kratom about once every other month, in equally small amounts, when I'm having similar issues- it worked well for me as a mood stabilizer once when I was switching from hormonal birth control, and I used it a few days in a row once when my caregivering client wasn't sleeping and I needed to stay awake. I've found it helpful where ibuprofen fails, I've never gotten any kind of high whatsoever, and I've never had any feeling of addiction to the substance. \n\n    I do not think kratom should be a Class One drug, as I've experienced it's medical value for myself. HOWEVER, I have read about people using \"extracts,\" or concentrated forms of kratom, and becoming addicted. I have never tried this form of kratom, but from what I've read online of people's personal experiences, it is when people start using concentrated extracts that they tend to become addicted. I don't think it necessary to use kratom in such large amounts to reap its benefits, and perhaps it would be less controversial to prevent kratom addiction and kratom use recreationally by outlawing only this larger scale use of the drug. My understanding is that it would not be practical to consume the amount of kratom contained in an extract through any other method. \n\n    In conclusion, I have experienced the indisputable medical value of kratom. While the amount consumed should perhaps be limited, and while there needs to be some larger scale research conducted, I do not believe making kratom a Schedule 1 drug is the answer.  \n\nThank you for your consideration,\n\nSadie Gardner","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4950","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sadie Gardner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have consumed kratom for 3 years.

That being said, I have been prescribed, and take regularly, high doses of a neuroleptic (Zyprexa) for nearly the past decade, as well as a heavy dose of amphetamines. Over that same time I have been on several classes of antidepressants and virtually every benzodiazepin available, occasionally at alarming doses (including alprazolam, diazepam, clonazepam and lorazopam which, combined, I contribute to about a year of my life being completely unrecallable). My medications have messed me up in ways I would never have thought possible. I've experienced a short but severe bout of dyskinesia several years ago, and currently am suffering from intolerable akathisia which I can only describe as torture from within.\n\nAt some point in my life about eight or nine years ago, I could no longer cope with my life in the most proverbial sense, nor accept the hurt I've caused those I love, and started using virtually any legal (in some cases, grey-area) psychoactives I could find. The bulk of my discoveries were online; mostly information, knowledge and products. \n\nI'd been aware of my susceptibility to opiates/opioids for a while by this point in my life, notably due to prescriptions for kidney stones. I came across Kratom for the first time sometime during the summer of 2005, thanks to Daniel Siebert, and my first experiences with this plant occurred not long thereafter. However my attention was eventually concentrated on dried opium poppy pods which I obtained from eBay. My use of the poppy pods quickly led to a life addicted to opiates, and within a year I was injecting or insufflating heroin and OxyContin. I place the majority of the blame for this addiction happening to me on myself, but I am not entirely at fault. I was already messed up psychologically and if anyone had even mentioned what these medications could eventually do to me and my mind, I would have told my doctors at the time to shove these pills right up their ass. Nevertheless, there I was: an already messed up, vulnerable personality on some crazy medications, now adjunct with an addiction to opiates.\n\nFor nearly five years that was he extent of my existence. Finally, around 2010, I was fired from my job and was watched very closely by my parents during this time (my parents also kept a close eye on my bank accounts). I had no desire nor plans to stop using opiates, but due to circumstances I had no choice.\n\nThe next months were excruciating. I couldn't fall asleep for more than a couple hours at a time yet I never got out of bed. I do not think I need to elaborate further on the specifics of heroin withdrawal. By this time, opium poppies had become difficult to obtain online; eBay pulled all pods off their site and I was not aware of any other reliable sources to acquire them. Desperate for relief, I turned to Kratom. I had only experimented with Kratom a few times and was not optimistic about it curbing my withdrawal symptoms. I could not have further understatement the medicinal power of this plant.\n\nI used Kratom about four or five times a day, roughly 5-10 g of powdered dry leaf per dose (more or less, depending upon the source). Kratom not only made it possible to tolerate opiate withdrawals, Kratom made it easy. I have honestly never even considered using opiates since the first day I started using Kratom medicinally. After roughly five months of using Kratom, I decided on a whim to stop using it and noticed yet another amazing aspect of this plant: it has virtually no withdrawal effects of its own.\n\nKratom took someone who had no desire, at all, to stop using opiates and allowed me to quit heroin cold turkey, and remain opiate-free for over six years (and counting). I know heroin is a national problem - nearly an epidemic at this point. You need to look into this plant more closely before you ban it forever. You need to do what you can to stop kitchen chemists from cooking up analogies of mitragynine and 7-HMG then selling them as research chemicals. This plant can save lives.\n\nI understand that it is nearly certain Kratom will be criminalized. The DEA has a well documented history of having no tolerance for any psychoactive substance whatsoever, which are all eventually scheduled according to popularity and availability. I have learned to be OK with Kratom being illegal because my need for Kratom lies directly behind me, and I seriously doubt anyone could say anything to stop Kratom from being criminalized at this point. I just wish you would realize you cannot win this war on \"drugs,\" which is really a war on drug users; meanwhile smugglers, traffickers and dealers make huge profits from sick people like me because of your fear and ignorance of a plant you can't fully understand.\n\nI have so much more to say, but I've reached the 5000 character limit.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17158","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Keith Nierenhausen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Marie Sakellarion.

After multiple surgeries, I ended up physically dependent on hydrocodone. I decided to quit taking the drug, despite the fact that my pain levels would justify its use. I don't want to take anything that I can't stop taking without severely adverse consequences. I am now almost a year from my last dose. The crushing anxiety coupled with the pain had made returning to using hydrocodone a daily temptation.\n\nKratom came to my attention via a pain management support group. I take 1.5 teaspoons of it per day and it takes away the anxiety, reduces the pain significantly, and caused me to stop thinking about the pills. It does not provide me with feelings of euphoria, so my head is clear and I can function normally. I don't have to increase the dose every six months. I don't have to go to the doctor every month. I don't have to carry the stigma of being physically dependent on opiate pain medications.\n\nWhen I saw the DEA was classifying Kratom as schedule 1, I decided to stop taking it. The following day, I felt no ill effects from discontinuing use. Thus, I know it is going to make physically dependent, and the lack of euphoria doesn't make it a good candidate for addiction. \n\nTaking this action because people have died abusing the product is well intentioned, but misguided. People die from taking too much tylenol. People die from alcohol consumption. People who are prone to abuse and bad decisions are going to find a way to hurt themselves with any product, so taking this line really means you should also consider pulling tylenol off the shelves.\n\nThe perception in the community is that the DEA is only protecting the rights of big pharma with this action. I am not a conspiracy minded person, so I don't think there is a dark room with unaccountable powers making rules to benefit a few wealthy individuals, but I can see where this line of thinking originates when actions like this one are proposed.\n\nIn summary, I ask the DEA to avoid any classification stricter than Ginseng or St John's Wort. This is an effective treatment for pain and anxiety and the vast majority of consumers cause no harm to themselves or others while using it. If you give it a legitimate standing, then supplement companies can package it in reasonable doses and ensure quality. The current approach leads to product tampering, which has been a contributor to several of the reported deaths. \n\nThank you for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3066","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"DO NOT BAN ANOTHER NATURAL PLANT FOR MONETARY GAIN.

Many people think of Kratom users as \"just another drug addict.\" I strongly disagree with this view. I was only 19 years old when I was diagnosed with spinal cord cancer. \nAfter surgery I recovered quickly and felt back to normal. About 18 months after the surgery I began experiencing chronic pain. This pain worsened as time progressed. \nI was unable to sit in a classroom for more than 30 minutes at a time, unable to play any sports, and I eventually was in so much pain that I could not walk over a mile at a time\nwithout experiencing agony. I sought treatment and was sent to a pain clinic. It is an understatement to say that the American medical system failed me in my time of need.\nMost of the pain doctors offered me pills, they tried me on six different muscle relaxers (one at a time), none of which helped even the slightest. They tried me on all sorts of anti-depressants and \nanti-convulsants. Nothing helped. I was sent to physical therapy and pain psychology. Physical therapy helped me get my range of motion back and helped me in the long run, But I needed something to help me live through\nthe next day. I quickly saw my pain medication triple in quantity, at the age of 22 I was up to 30mg of oxycodone a day. I refused to go any higher with it, because it was only making the pain worse. \nI had no social life, I began experiencing trouble in school, I could not work longer than 3-4 hours at a time, and I was depressed and suffered from extreme anxiety. I finally found a great physician who helped\nme find what the underlying problem was. I was treated for ADHD and central pain syndrome. My symptoms drastically improved and my pain medication was cut down to 15mg of oxycodone per day.\nI was not completely satisfied. At the age of 22 I want to be off of pain meds and living a normal life. I found out about kratom after I experienced the worst pain of my life for a week straight,\nI was unable to sleep more than 2 hours each night of the week and pain meds were not doing anything. I have been taking kratom for 5 months now and my pain medication dose has gone from 15mg of oxycodone per day\ndown to no pain meds needed each day. That's right, I have weaned off of my dose and only need to take a pain med once a week or maybe less than that! \nI have a social life, I play softball, I am married, and I am about to pass my last CPA exam. I also work 30 hours per week while attending 3 graduate level accounting classes per week. I graduated at the top of my \nclass for my undergraduate degree and I owe a lot of this to kratom. I have become a productive member of society and I do not want this to change. I am finally happy with\nmy health and my overall well-being. There is no longer the thought in my mind of \"how much pain will I be in tomorrow?\" \nI support the use and research of kratom and believe that the DEA would be acting too hastily if it were to be banned. Research is needed! Please\ndo not let the actions of a few irresponsible kratom users make your impression of kratom to be negative.

I have 4 amazing children ages 10, 11, 20, and 22.  When I was three years old I was diagnosed with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. This disease destroyed every joint in my body. I struggled with this through my entire life, the pain I was in, the treatments they tried, but in the end, the damage continued to get worse.\n\nI grew up taking NSAIDs, muscle relaxers, valium, Vicodin (it was called that then), and a huge variety of arthritis medication that didnt seem to help or the side effects were so severe that I had no choice but to stop taking them.\n\nAs the years went on, the pain finally started to reduce. However, within a couple of years, I was in a bad vehicle accident and was rear ended at a dead stop with the man behind me travelling at about 60mph. He didnt even touch his brakes.  It was then, that April day in 2001 that has changed my adulthood to what it is today.\n\nWithin a few days of the accident, I was in the hospital with bad joint pain in my hips, neck pain, shoulder pain and more. Over time, the symptoms became more severe and I was diagnosed with Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, I have pinched nerves in my lower back, left elbow, and neck, I have facets disease of my spine, arthritis, depression and more.\n\nObviously going from a somewhat healthy woman in her 20s I became a woman that relied on pain medication to make it through the day just to have some kind of quality of life. I went through months of physical therapy, but ultimately in the end, it got to the point where pain medication wasnt working like it had previously, my body and joints had more damage that wouldnt reverse, and when I was 22 years old, I had to have my left hip replaced. 1  years later, I had the right one done. I have had to have my right shoulder replaced already. I had to have surgery on my left shoulder so I could get movement back in it. \n\nI have lived the last 18 years on pain medicine, mainly Vicodin/Norco, muscle relaxers, etc. I have also struggled with depression for as long as I can remember because of my quality of life or lack thereof, as well as the constant struggle of dealing with pain from the moment I woke up until I fell asleep at night.\n\nI just recently discovered Kratom from a friend who takes it and has for a while.  I cannot believe the difference that Kratom has made in my life.  I have lived in a drug induced fog for almost 18 years, never really even knowing I was in that fog, until I began taking Kratom.  I was able to replace Kratom entirely and instead of being and living in a pain filled foggy state of mind, I was shocked to see how clear headed this made me.  I have my Marijuana Medical card, but dont care for taking/smoking it because I dont care for the High that you  receive from this legal drug, but Kratom gives me that release from pain, from depression, that I never thought was possible in my life.  I just recently went through a divorce and I cried for weeks and the first time I tried Kratom, the tears were gone. Its like it took away my pain, it lessened my depression, and made me think clearly to the point of where I could begin the healing process after this life changing event.  I was taking 5-8 Norcos a day, 3 muscle relaxers every day, Valium, antidepressants and more. While I still take the antidepressants, I feel pretty confident that I could wean myself off of them as I continue to take Kratom.  Kratom actually reduces my pain to a manageable level now so that if I have to go to the store, I dont get panic attacks because those trips always wound up with me being in pain, crying by the time I got home. My life has changed dramatically in the past 5 weeks since discovering Kratom and can honestly say that even my children see the difference. I feel I owe them a clear headed mom, one that isnt afraid to go grocery shopping, or to the mall.  I just want to enjoy my life because the first 40 years was nothing but pain and sadness with a life hooked completely reliant on pain medicine to get through my days. \n \nI feel like I am a completely different person. I am happy.  I am close to pain free and I dont have the bad thoughts I did have before Kratom.  I am finally the clear headed mom, my children deserve and I am so thankful to have this as an option.\nPlease dont make Kratom illegal.  I dont want to be the useless, foggy headed mom to my kids, or have no quality of life due to the pain I experience every day without this. I feel that my kids deserve this life!! Without Kratom today, I have no doubts, that I would still be crying, still wishing I wasnt around, still in horrifying pain, and in a fog stateso foggy I didnt even know I was in it until I took Kratom for the first time.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6883","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michelle Thomas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have just recently discovered the benefits of kratom, I use it to help with back pain, I cant and will not take prescription pain killers due to the chance of addiction and other negative side affects.

I oppose the decision to schedule kratom because there has not been sufficient research as to the negative claims brought about by the DEA and the uninformed public.

This means I have chronic, severe pain. This syndrome is not fully understood, but it is thought that excessive, abnormal neurological responses to trauma cause RSD/CRPS. In my case, it began after I broke a bone in my left leg and then developed a complication that required surgery.\n \nThis occurred in October 2013. Since leaving the hospital in December 2013, I've taken a high dose of Lyrica daily for pain. I also took a high dose of Norco (acetaminophen/hydrocodone) daily for pain until April 2016.\n \nDuring this time, I knew my brain was dulled. I knew I dragged around. I knew I could fall asleep anywhere, anytime. When I heard of kratom, by accident on a completely unrelated online board, I researched it. Finally I bought some. And finally, although I feared it at first, I tried some, after weaning myself off Norco.\n \nI want to emphasize that neither Norco nor kratom has made me high or altered my mood in any way.\n \nKratom has been nothing less than a miracle. With every day on kratom, I realized just how messed up my brain had been on Norco. I also got my energy back (well, what energy I have at 65, with a permanent injury and wearing a leg brace ... ). I no longer slept through most of the day. I began to feel like myself again.\n \nBut the best part is how kratom helps with the pain. Every day I take 12.5 grams of kratom in capsule form. This lasts 24 hours and provides good, steady pain relief. By no means does it make my pain go away. But it significantly diminishes it.\n \nNorco, on the other hand, provided roller-coaster pain relief. I would take a pill and feel better for a couple of hours, until the pain gradually increased in intensity. Then it was, take another pill, feel better, have the pain increase, take a pill, feel better, have the pain increase, and so on....\n \nI cannot tell you how very important it is to me to keep kratom legal. It has been used for centuries in other parts of the world. I understand it has not been through our Western system of double-blind testing followed by federal approval. But it works.\n \nI dread having to go back on any type of opioid for my pain. Please, keep kratom legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6063","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"     Hello I have used Kratom for around 7 months when needed for severe anxiety, ADHD, pain relief and Arthritis caused by work injuries and Gout in my feet. I have never felt better these days because I have received benefits from Kratom that have prevented me from using prescription drugs (I was prescribed Benzos and Pain Medications). Long story short, I suffer from consistent pain/gout/anxiety/depression and ADHD according to all of the doctors I have been diagnosed by from early childhood years to adult years (I was diagnosed with anxiety, adhd, and depression as a child, I was diagnosed with severe pain problems around the age of 25 after work related injuries). I have been prescribed multiple pain and anti-anxiety medications but feel that Kratom is better then all of them and is much more safe. There are also no withdrawal effects from Kratom. I had horrible withdrawal effects from Xanax, and had some withdrawals from pain medications that were horrible as well because I had to use both medications long term. I believe that having Kratom available for use will prevent people from using pharmaceutical drugs that end up hurting people in the long run due to negative mental and physical aspects caused by benzo and pain medication withdrawal. Kratom has been a great medicine for me, and I hope I can continue using it because I never want to be on any type of pharmaceutical drug again. Without Kratom, I would have to go back to my doctors and be prescribed anti-anxiety, anti-depressant and pain medications that I truly need, but I would rather not take them because Kratom does not have negative physical effects and negative mental withdrawal symptoms associated with many pharmaceutical medications. Thank you for listening to me, I hope that Kratom stays available for usage in the United States.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0563","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Computer Repair Specialist","postedDate":"2016-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has become one of the most beneficial assets I've used to enter a healthy life style,.

I have not been able to work since 2001, due to a partial colon resection and the ensuing medical problems. Essentially I was in and out of the hospital or on my father's couch from 2001-2004. In 1983 I was admitted to Miami Valley Hospital for depression. Since then I have been on psychiatric medication, remained melancholy, and the depression deepened with all of my intestinal issues at the beginning of this century.\n\nIn 2013 I realized the pain medication was problematic, specifically when I did not have it; it also didn't have the same impact when I took it, having built up a tolerance. An old friend introduced me to Kratom as we drank tea in my section eight apartment, and we discussed my prospects, or lack of prospects. \n\nI thoroughly researched Kratom and the active ingredients in the plant, and decided I'd purchase some and it afforded me the opportunity to ween myself off painkillers, and it also imroved my frame of mind, my mental health. I noticed my complexion improved, my eyes weren't as bleary, and I began concentrating again: reading, walking when possible, making contact with old friends again.\n\nUnfortunately, in August of this year (2016) my back and hip and right buttock began hurting, and I eventually could not get out of a chair. After several emergency rooms and catscans and an MRI and doctor's appointments and epidural injections and physical therapy I was diagnosed with Neuro farimal stenosis, sciatica, a pinched nerve, and constricted L5 spine. Several medications were provided to help with the pain and numbness and inability to move or be mobile, and I am now scheduled to see a neurologist and pain management specialist, this action precluding more visits to the hospital and my family doctor, hopefully. \n\nKratom allowed me to greatly reduce my intake of Flexeril, Oxycodone, Roboxin, Lyrica, Neurontin, Ibuprofen, Ondansetron, Metamucil, and stool softener. I am in a better physical mental and physical state now, my head is clearer, and the pain is manageable, and I finally feel distance from the weeks where I couldn't lay down on a bed, or walk more than a few feet without debilitating pain, or was compelled to call an ambulance twice in twelve hours and be transported to the Miami Valley hospital emergency room.\n\nStructure is crucial to my well-being, and Kratom is part of my daily regimen. In essence, I have benefitted from the Kratom tea in different ways, and the benefits have manifested themselves in stable and hopeful thinking, and a gradual diminuition of pain. It's part of my lifestyle, like Metamucil, walking whenever possible, continuing to see my array of doctors and specialists. \n\nI don't understand why Kratom is in the process of being scheduled as a drug, and in such a way that I won't have access to it. It's critical to my physical and mental health. There is no intoxication, it doesn't affect my driving (rare), it doesn't have side effects--it seems as natural as caffeinated tea or coffee to me. It is very important for my well being that I have access to Kratom, which I would rather utilize than a vast array of medications that muddy my brain and discombobulate my body as a whole.\n\nThank you for your time and I hope you consider my words, or my situation, or plight. \n\nSincerely,\n\nTimothy Fox","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5308","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Timothy Fox","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi.

I have gotten completely off pain killers thanks to Kratom. Taking this away from me would pretty much force me back on pain killers which has so many downfalls. With Kratom I can easily not take it if I do not need too. But with pain killers I will become addicted and not have the option so easily. Please do not take this away from us who do not want to be addicted to drugs. I can not even begin to tell you how much this will hurt me. Unfortunately for me I may possibly never have my back and SI joints fixed so to take this away from people who have found out how helpful Kratom is would be a horrible thing to do and unfortunately cause more people who have found the benefits of Kratom to turn to addictive pain killers or things worse than that. Please take in consideration the issues that are already there with pain killers and for some people they will turn to things even worse and we all have seen the downfall these things have done to so many people in our country. I wish more people knew the wonderful benefits that Kratom offers. It helps people to get off herion, pain killers, helps with anxiety and so many other things. I know it hasn't been totally studied by the government , but the benefits it has should not be taken away from us who have found a way to get away from deadly drugs like opioids and herion. Please don't take this option away from us. I would rather use something that is not harmful and will not cause an issue with addiction.

The DEA has a very good reputation for making sound decisions in \"most\" instances. I feel that most of our Country feels this way. I would ask, if possible, that this case be looked at with patience for the publics sake.   \n\nThank you very much for you time and service to our great Country.

I am currently a kratom user and oppose placement of kratom on the Schedule 1 list or any legislation that would prevent kratom being sold as a dietary supplement.\n\nI first used kratom in 2014 when looking at different supplements for back pain stemming from a lingering injury. I found information on kratom and the additional effects of relieving anxiety and having a calming effect also sounded appealing. I conducted research on online vendors to find the most reputable ones. I also researched responsible use of kratom as a dietary supplement and made my first purchase in the Spring of 2014.\n\nMy research paid off as I consider the dietary supplement quality to be very good as well as the instructions on how to take kratom. My goal was simply to see the effect on back pain and my mood that kratom would have.\n\nI work in mental healthcare which can be mentally draining and results in social burnout. I interact with patients with persistent mental illness on a daily basis for my job. Kratom not only helped my quality of life and job performance by reducing back pain as my injury healed but it also improved my general mood as well, resulting in better time away from work to rejuvenate myself mentally. Kratom is valuable to those struggling with social anxiety.\n\nI have used kratom off and on in the last couple years, finding no adverse side effects from use or quitting use of kratom. I have gone from once a day use to quitting completely with no issues.\n\nPlease consider this testimonial during your evaluation of kratom as a valuable dietary supplement. It is not merely a recreational substance but a dietary supplement that improves the quality of life for the average citizen.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20743","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Milo Bennett","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After a gallbladder removal surgery in 2007, I was left very sick for over 5 years. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea daily. I fell into a deep depression, having lost contact with most of my friends and family. I was having suicidal thoughts daily.  My public anxiety was through the roof, and my depression was rock bottom. These were dark times.\n\nMy girlfriend, now wife, at the time forced me to go see a doctor, despite not having insurance or the funds to afford it. I was prescribed the anti-depressant, Prozac. I lasted 2 weeks on that horrific drug, as it caused me to shake violently and literally go crazy. A horrible experience.\n\nI was then prescribed amitriptyline, which in low doses can also help with calming gut issues. It didn't do anything for me at all, it was like a failed placebo that I wasted 6 months of my life on.\n\nNext up, Alprazolam or Xanax. Xanax took away the anxiety, but made me so tired that I couldn't function in day to day life. We own our own business and not being able to converse with my customers wasn't practical or helping me at all. I stopped taking it as it was worthless.\n\nFast forward to 2013 and I come across the word \"Kratom\" on a depression forum I would frequent often. Some people claimed how it really helped them, how it was nothing more than a dried and powdered plant that you can make a tea with. I figured I had nothing left to do, and being now thousands of dollars in medical tests from numerous tests, I had no funds left to really continue that route. \n\nSo I ordered some kratom. I made a tea. Didn't really 'feel' much from it, maybe a bit more relaxed, but nothing else. Next day, had another tea. Same thing. The next day, same thing. After about a week or so, I suddenly realized: \"I haven't thought about killing myself all week for the first time in YEARS!\" I still had stomach issues, but I felt like I could actually deal with them without the weight of my mind holding me back.\n\nThat's when I knew what a miracle kratom can be. All of the emphasis that is put on drug addicts and people trying to get high is nothing but a slander tactic. You want to get high on kratom? Good luck. You will get the worst stomach ache of your life. \n\nThis plant helps thousands. And without it, the DEA would be forcing us back into a life of failed pharmaceuticals and doctors who would rather run tests than see their patients back on their feet.\n\nPlease, do the right thing. Keep kratom legal. If you want to regulate and help ensure that the products offered are safe and grown appropriately, I support that. Kratom is NOT a party drug and shouldn't be sold as such. It is a supplement in the purest form of the word.\n\nThank you for reading.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6373","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Radant","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"he DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement\nkratom.

Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works... \nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

I am in no way an addict or misusing whatever people are saying this stuff will do to you.\nMe, personally... I was diagnosed with RLS as a young girl and have struggled with it my whole life. I have never been able to sleep normally and I have never found a prescription to work for me without sever side effects or lack of ability to work after a certain amount of time. I was miserable with out my sleep. My parenting, job and day to day responsibilities suffered.\nOne day, a Native American friend of mine introduced this Kratom to me and changed my life forever. I take a small amount in the afternoon and before bed and have been for a couple years now without having to increase the amount whatsoever and I have relieved all my RLS symptoms. To me,  it's  a miracle. Doctors just want to put me on Requip, which has horrible side effects for me. This natural leaf managed to reverse all those years of daily struggle.\nI'm unsure what I will do when you take away this herbal remedy from the people who use it responsibly. It's frustrating that whoever and however people are taking this without its intended purpose is not only ruining my health and day to day life, but I'm certain many others.\nIt breaks my heart.

The slow warping of my  entire lumbar spine progressed bit by bit all my life.  The pain became a life altering aspect of my life in my mid 30s. *(I dealt with the pain with  chiropractic care, massage, pilates, yoga and stretching. This worked well for about 5 years.  The the pain began to dominate my life in my 40s and i drove me to specialists in  my 50s. all oif my non-pharmaceutical interventions were no longer giving me relief so that I could go to work, stay physically and mentally fit so I began to search for  possible pharmaceutical  pain medication help.\n\nOTC medications had zero effect on back and sciatic pain. Forget the OTCs!\n\n Oxycodone  caused extreme itching and/or hives at  2 to 3 mg doses and migraines at drug manufacturer recommended therapeutic doses. Oxy also made it hard to summon the  energy to get daily exercise, and I am a long distance runner so this was completely weird for me. I also found that on minuscule doses of Oxyodone ( 3 mg every 4 to 5 hours) that riding my bicycle for transportation became a dangerous endeavor as my decision making skills were compromised even at avery low dose so forget the Oxycone!\n\n For sure the fairly high doses of Prednisone helped with the sciatica but caused anxiety, thinned skin and easily opened wounds that bled profusely.,healed poorly and scarred permanently.  More seriously, the  7 month  use of Prednisone to control the debilitating  sciatic pain that prevented me from walking more than 100 feet  created SupraVentricular Tachycardia. which required SVT ablation surgery to stop the racing heart. Dump the pPednisone and search on.\n\nIn 2011 I  heard about KRATOM leaf as a possible way to modify and control various types of pain without the negative side effects of the pharmaceuticals that I had  used and ultimately had to jettison due to the extremely negative side effects. So I  ordered  some Kratom powder  online .  Once I figured out which strains worked for my  type of pain and how to prepare the tea which I mix with ginger, Agave syrup and lemon, I fell into a routine that has served me well since 2011. To this day first thing  every morning I drink the Kratom tea mix, ride my bike,  walk my dogs, help out at my daughters business,  tend 3 vegetable gardens,iive my life, have no migraines, no bleeding cuts, no anxiety. \n\nRecently I have had lumbar  fusion surgery and am recovering  without the assistance of any pharmaceuticals. I use the  various Kratom Tea strains  for muscle spasm pain relief and  post-surgical angry nerve syndrome control. I continue with the Kratom as there are no side effects--no anxiety, no migraines, no thinning skin and bleeding...nothing that is detrimental to my health.\n\nKratom is natural, simple, and easy to prepare and  nearly impossible to abuse. \nI now  for sure and quite probably YOU TOO  will  welcome this natural nonaddictive  self -prescribed option  that is nothing more than the powdered tree leaf . Kratom is a  simple natural  remedy that can help me and you avoid the very deleterious  side effects of the poorly researched pharmaceuticals.--if you doubt this last statement, read the drug insert in the pain med packages .  Kratom provides you and  and me with   an inexpensive, unadulterated a safe alternative to pharmaceutical  pain medication  and the  dauntingly long lists of side effects  \nThe simpler the remedy the better in my book.\n\nThank you for reading this,\n Melinda Kinard","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21039","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"melinda kinard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,  \nI appreciate this opportunity to share my thoughts and feelings on Kratom.

The supplement I feel is a big help with anxiety and stress.  \n\nIt would be a shame to have such an amazing thing be labeled as illegal or controlled when it's  a natural occurrence on this green earth that should be freely used by whoever deems necessary.\n\nThank you for your time,  Jesse Bridge","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21851","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jesse Bridge","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I personally have never used Kratom,so I can only give my opinion.Based on what I've heard and read,it's a plant that has helped people with addiction and chronic pain.A plant that's been around for decades in the us and longer elsewhere without negative effects.Putting kratom on schedule 1 list would limit research funding which in turn would limit solving the current opioids epidemic.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15676","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Boudreau","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"With the devastating impact of addiction to opioids, Kratom should not be banned as this will only lead to more opioid overdoses and deaths!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19472","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Coventry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep this natural remedy available to the public.\n\nSincerely \nCaitlin shank","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20407","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Caitlin Shank","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not criminalize kratom.

I've struggled with chronic pain since my early 20's, after a car accident in 2005 resulted in a titanium plate being installed in my leg. While prescribed oxycontin, I was unable to function, and almost failed out of college. Long term over-the-counter painkillers like IB profen lead to a deterioration in my stomach lining, something I found out after a colonoscopy at the relatively young age of 31 to find a solution to crippling stomach aches.\n\nKratom not only with helped my pain, but lessens my anxiety. An unexpected side benefit: I lost weight, as I felt well enough to exercise, and drank far less alcohol than before starting kratom. Before kratom I dreaded the future, wondering how I could manage pain that will only increase with time. I accept I'll always have a certain amount of pain, but with kratom, I'm able to be functional, hold a job (my profession requires me to be on my feet in the kitchen), plus more meaningful relationships with my friends & family, as I'm not on edge from pain and anxiety & can go out socially more. My husband has commented on my general mood & demeanor improving.\n\nI appreciate this comment period being allowed. I don't understand why kratom, a solution to the opiate epidemic, is in consideration to join the same category as heroin. It's not a respiratory depressant, unlike opiates & any alleged kratom overdoses have always been found to have other chemicals present. There's been 4x more calls regarding dishwasher soap pods than kratom, yet those are unrestricted; what's the real threat?  Regulation isn't unreasonable, but to regulate it into inaccessibility is unnecessary, & doesn't make sense for a non-medical entity to decide.\n\nThere's currently much research going on in regard to myriad different medical uses, moving kratom to a schedule 1 substance would not only shut down this valuable research, but would make further, new studies difficult to begin. It's impossible to substantiate the claims that are being made by the DEA, especially since they recently refused to turn over any evidence in a Freedom of Information Act. Perhaps they did not want to be shamed at lack of legitimate reason to make this herbal supplement, a simple plant leaf, into a felony. America already has the highest rate of incarceration, making kratom schedule 1 would add to that, as anyone who's experienced the pain relief of kratom is unlikely to accept going back to a life of constant pain. Kratom is a harm reduction method that could save lives in the form of overdoses, the medical complications that result from long term alcohol/drug abuse, and aid in the recovery for those who are looking to better their lives. That's at least what Florida found out when they launched a special investigation into kratom recently.

This is in regards to the DEAs Notice of Intent to Schedules of Controlled Substances: Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine Into Schedule I, essentially banning a harmless herb, which has helped many individuals to alleviate their own personal physical pain, including our men and women in service and that have served who cannot find relief for their daily physical pain (or choose not to) through conventional narcotic pain medication, would only increase the prison population greater or lead to these people to choose a path they dont want: that of using prescription painkillers. \n\nIt can also help with withdrawal symptoms from prescription opioid drugs and street narcotics, which we are seeing an epidemic of in our country. It is my opinion that the DEA is exceeding its authority to place a plant used by hundreds of thousands of law abiding citizens on the list of Schedule I drugs, which would turn them into immediate criminals - risking extensive jail time due to mandatory minimums, removing their right to vote, and severely impairing the ability to get a job once they are freed, amongst all the other negative consequences.  As Im sure you are well aware, the US has the highest prison population in the world, with over 50% of the inmates in federal prison being non-violent drug offenders.  It is absolutely absurd for the DEA to add a plant, which has been used as a tea for thousands of years by East Asia to their scheduling list.  According to medical literature, not a single death has been caused by kratom (without the individual being a polydrug cocktail that included kratom). [1]  \n\nThe DEA says that kratom has resulted in a total of 30 deaths in the US, and although that is a tragedy, prescription opioid medications alone have resulted in a whopping 28,000 deaths from heroin and prescription painkillers in 2014.  Right now, there is a huge crisis of deaths from opioid abuse in this country that could be helped greatly by leaving kratom available and in the hands of consumers.  Kratom, being a natural plant, should be regulated by the FDA under the DSHEA as a dietary supplement, as it meets that exact criteria.  If there is concern about its misuse, it should be restricted to adults age 18 or 21 to purchase.  Unfortunately, because of all the yellow journalism and smears in the mainstream media, kratom has been lumped together with drugs that should have and have been properly banned.\n\nRecently, the state of Florida had proposed to ban kratom earlier this year, but after testimony and an examination of common sense medical information, Florida came to the conclusion:\n\na review of information currently available through identified law enforcement and laboratory sources in Florida indicates that Kratom does not constitute a significant risk to the safety or welfare of Florida residents. The Florida Department of Health (DOH) reports no pervasive health issues attributed to the ingestion of Kratom products in Florida. [2]\n\nI myself am a daily kratom user, drinking it in the form of a tea to help alleviate the excruciating pain brought upon by my irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).  Banning this substance would negatively affect my quality of life to intolerable degree, of which I have found no prescription medication or treatment to be as effective as kratom.\n\nI believe God gave us this miracle pain relieving plant, to use for the benefit of all mankind, as he said in Genesis 1:29-30\n\nThen God said, \"Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you; and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the sky and to everything that moves on the earth which has life, I have given every green plant for food\"; and it was so.\n\nI view the fact that this plant was just recently brought to the west from across the great oceans as a sign from God that it is intended to help the people of this nation, to help our opioid epidemic, which is taking the lives of so many of our young people today.\n\nI am not the only one who will be impacted by this insane ban.  Just search the hashtag #IamKratom on Youtube, Twitter or Facebook and listen to the stories of people who have been helped tremendously -- many have had their lives saved -- by this simple plant, a tea, that the DEA wants to take away from us for no just cause.\n\nI appreciate the DEA listening to us, the kratom users, and giving us the opportunity to have a public comment period for kratom. These are my thoughts, facts and opinion on the matter.

I'm mother to an 18 year old son. And  I beseech you not you put Kratom on the list of schedule 1 substances for both of our sakes.\n\n I'm on disability mainly because I have been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 disorder with ultra rapid cycling. I can cycle two to three times a day or just remain hypomanic for weeks. With the hypomania I can be depressed enough to want to die and at the same time be manic enough to act on it.  I take medication now but it's never been very effective.  For decades before i was diagnosed I would just self medicate for whatever way I was feeling. They say people with Bipolar have a high risk for substance abuse. I'm certainly testament to that.\n\nI also inherited osteoarthritis from my mother's side of the family.  I've had both of my hips replaced and one of them is ready to be replaced again.  All five sections of my spine are effected so I can look forward to deformities as I age.  The pain can be unbearable. \n\nI used to live on the strongest opiates available. Antipsychotics, antidepressants, Librium. I just floated through life and I don't remember most of the important milestones in my son's life.\n\nTwo years ago a friend told me about kratom. She said it might help my pain and she gave me enough for a few doses. It sat on my kitchen counter for at least a month. Then one day as I was about to take a handful of oxycodone I looked at myself in the mirror and was appalled at what looked back at me. I was mortified and disgusted and filled with self hatred. How had I become this recepticle for pills. Pills that didn't even really help the pain and the depression anymore. I became completely manic and went through all cabinets and collected every pill in the house and threw them down the garbage disposal. I couldn't go on like that. It wasn't living. I don't know what you'd call it but I didn't want to do it anymore.  Well I pretty much changed that tune as the withdrawal started to set in. Where was all of that righteousness then? I was terrified, I was sick it was horrible. And the pain. I had never felt pain that bad. I honestly thought I was going to die.\n\nThat's when I remembered the kratom on the counter. I was desperate. I thought I remembered she said to make it into a tea. So I made some. It didn't take long at all. The withdrawal symptoms eased tremendously and my pain diminished. I honestly couldn't believe this terrible tasting tea did all of this. I called my girlfriend and laughed and said how long have you wanted to give this to me. A few years she said. I always thought no one knew how high I was. Yeah. My depression minimized greatly as well.\n\nSo that's my story. It's not over. There isn't a cure for bipolar and ostioarthritis is a degenerative disease. But kratom has given me my life back.\n\nI don't ever want to be that shell of a person again. Never, but that is what will happen to me if Kratom is put on the list of schedule 1 drugs.\n\nSo again, I beseech you. Please let me have a life that's worth living. Don't deny kratom to the people who need it.\n\n\nAngela Carnazzo","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20432","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Angela Carnazzo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Good Day,\n\nI will start by saying I am  30 year old male and I currently work in the mortgage industry.

It takes away about 97% of everything I was struggling with and more. Gave me energy to keep up and play with my kids. I haven't had anxiety attacks since.

Due to chronic pain, I began and still continue, to research alternative treatments and lifestyle choices, in hopes of maintaining a quality of life. This research, led me to Kratom and I spent hours learning about the leaf, its properties, strains, and testimonials of many people, who shared their stories with regards to the better lives they had, with the help of Kratom. \n\nI can attest to the fact, I found Kratom to be a very complimentery tea, to my lifestyle regiment. I never experienced any \"high\" or \"withdrawal\" from Kratom. My budget does not allow for a constant purchase of Kratom; however, a few months ago, I had decided to start making room for it on a permanent basis, in the budget, in order, to hopefully, no longer use or lessen the use of opioid medication. I do have concerns of what long term use of ANY pharmaceutical medication has on an individual's body. However, with the DEA's intentions of Schedule I placing, I could no longer take the route, I had intended because if I had replaced a medication with Kratom and then, no longer, been able to obtain it, with the current climate regarding prescription opioids, I was concerned I would not be able to obtain the medication.\n\nI have read so many, testimonials of not only, chronic pain patients, who have been helped by Kratom, but the stories of those, who have been able to leave the world of \"addiction\" behind them and once again, be productive tax paying, law abiding, family involved persons!

She has neuropathy in her left leg. The pain is so debilitating most days that she can hardly leave her bed in the morning, let alone walk down the stairs or go to work. She has tried dozens of other medication options and none of them worked to quell her pain and allow her to live a functional lifestyle. She was feeling very hopeless about her medical condition until she discovered Kratom. Since she began taking Kratom her pain has become extremely manageable and she has no problem going through her day joyfully. \n\nI myself struggle with back pain and Kratom is an excellent remedy for me on days where the painful sensations are so distracting and exhausting that I have trouble completing the tasks that are required of me. \n\nPersonally, I feel that any legal or illegal substance that is psychoactive - caffeine, alcohol, over the counter medications, etc... - can become harmful when an individual does not know how to moderate him/herself. However, this does not mean that banning a substance is an effective method for insuring that people don't use it or use it responsibly. \n\nI have plenty of experience taking Kratom with moderation and I have witnessed no side effects. \n\nOverall I believe that Kratom is a safe substance that can improve peoples wellbeing and tackle debilitating medical issues and therefore it should not be scheduled by the DEA.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4340","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thomas Vasilopoulos","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't put kratom on the drug schedule list.

Due to its availability over the counter, I recommend that they try this perfectly legal herbal supplement. \n\nI have had many patients comment that the pain relief they receive from taking various Kratom leaf and tinctures is superior to that of high dose morphine or 75mcg/hr Fentanyl patches. I have had many reports of considerably less drowsiness and fatigue. I have also been told that nausea, a common side-effect of chemotherapy, is not a contributing factor.\n\nThis legal and over the counter substance has many, many great uses. Whether an individual takes small doses to assist with their GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) or severe pain (due to cancer treatment) all I have heard is positive reviews. Truly the only negative review I have heard is that the taste is foul.\n\nI believe that many patients will be harmed by scheduling this substance. This is not the same type of substance as \"bath salts\" that cause hallucinations and strange behavior. Kratom binds to similar sites in the brain that block pain and increase dopamine production; additionally, this herb is used by many native tribes across the glove and has been used for hundreds of years. Certain tribes of Native Americans/United States (First Nations/Canada) are permitted the used of Peyote and other hallucinogenic drugs.\n\nThus far, no evidence has been shown that Kratom has any carcinogenic effect nor does it harm the body. At the first worst, taking too much Kratom may induce nausea. \n\nPlease head my warning that Kratom is a very useful substance that will not lead to some form of pandemic of addiction. The users and researches of Kratom that I know quite well and follow have not show nor found any of the typical behavior of a drug addict.\n\nFinally, many individuals have used this substance in order to desist the use of harder and more dangerous drugs such as diamorphine (Heroin), Oxycodone (Oxycontin, Diludid (Hydromorphone), etc. To remove this avenue of recovery would only increase the usage of these substances while creating a whole new means of arresting and incarcerating individuals that merely wish to relieve their pain, anxiety, and addiction.\n\nA study has shown that even Marijuana itself, now legal for recreational use in several States within the U.S.A., is more addictive.\n\nPlease contact me at 505-514-0062. I am able to provide considerably more information on this substance. It would truly be a crime in itself to schedule this substance as it does not fit any of the criteria of a Schedule I drug.\n\nAdditionally, as someone who has assisted professionally with disabled, infirm, and individuals otherwise unable to care for themselves, I believe I am in a position to provide accurate information.

I am totally disabled by this pain, the resulting exhaustion and increasing effects of poor nutrition and inactivity, and drug side effects.  It is imperative that I keep the neurogenic pain flares to a minimum, because when they are up, I lie curled in a ball, wishing for death.  Flares like that occur a few times per week, and can last up to 8 hrs.  They are virtually guaranteed by activities like going in to town for any reason, or stooping to pick up after my dogs.  In order to survive long enough to find a cure (meaning that I survive the periods of literally preferring death to the pain I am feeling), I have to avoid flare ups as much as possibly by remaining immobile with my legs upon a large wedge pillow, on pain meds.  The pain med side effects are very unpleasant and take a toll on my strength and perseverance.\n\nAs as result of a failed sub dural steroid injection, I got numbness and tingling in my toes, and soon afterwards, in my fingers.  The only activity I have been able to engage in, immobilized and sickened as I am, has been crocheting simple items.  The neuropathy in my fingers was so exacerbated by crocheting that I had to quit, and it never improved very much after that, until I found Kratom.  Before Kratom, it had become almost impossible to type.  It is still very difficult and requires patiently erasing and re-typing almost every other word.  I drop things often, due to a lack of feeing in my finger tips.  For some reason, the Kratom seems to actually cure the neuropathy.  If I take the Kratom (5//8 Tsp, 2x per day) for two days in a row, with 4 days off in between, it keeps the neuropathy down enough that I can crochet for several hours per week - a much needed distraction from the fear and stress I feel about what will happen to me, if I can't become more active, very soon.  I have read that it can cause dependency in some, and since I have experienced the unpleasantness of slowly weaning from dependency on both Gabapentin and Effexor, I strive to avoid developing it, again.\n\nKratom also helps a lot with my pain.  It does cause side effects, but not any as bad as the narcotics I have been prescribed, and simply getting a half day off from the other side effects provides an important psychological break from the suffering.  Since they don't help enough with the pain, and cause horrible side effects, not to mention the resistance of doctors, normal narcotics (hydrocodone and norco make me very ill, morphine side effects are worse than the relief it provides is good, and Dilauded, though the pain relief is better, also makes me ill) I have settled on a mix of Tramadol, Gabapentin and Lyrica (at different times, alternated to avoid dependency), Diclofenac, and some herbals.  I would mention the herbs, but I am concerned that the overzealous bureaucrats in the pocket of big business would go after them, next.  (You should be ashamed.)  \n\nKratom is an important medication for pain sufferers to have access to.  I am sorry that our society produces so many psychologically suffering people that they seek relief in drug abuse; but responsible people should not suffer for that by losing access to useful drugs.  If you are so concerned about that problem, rather than denying the usefulness of herbal medications in order to remove them from shelves, you should focus on funding answers to the social ills producing addicts.  Denying that Kratom has medical uses is an obvious lie and point to some kind of institutional corruption.\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7017","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"D K","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have no idea why the DEA would want to ban Kratom, a plant that has helped countless people get off of opiates, for several reasons:\n1) Kratom is a plant, it is not a drug.

I am a full time manufacturing engineer, with a great income and very stable life. I contribute to our society as productively as possible, -\"\" while using kratom daily. I've been a user for 2 years, i get blood work done regularly, and myself nor my doctor have witnessed ANY adverse effects. Kratom is saving lives and has the potential to fight the absolutely horrible opioid epidemic that we are all well aware of. This is honestly a miracle plant, and poses no threat other than to pharmacy addictions that plague our communities. In my humble opinion, banning a plant simple due to the fact that IT IS NOT UNDERSTOOD is not only wrong, but irresponsible. I am an advocate for further testing, and even age restrictions (which 18+ is already in place within the community). This plant has given me power back over my own life. Most importantly, there has NEVER been a death associated with Kratom, when it was not mixed with other dangerous drugs. To put the blame on kratom makes no scientific sense, as the toxicity of prescription pills is well understood, and in almost every case, are also ingested by the victim. \n\nIn closing, I am a hard working, socially active, politically active, engineer that contributes to my society and community, all while ingesting a simple tea, which is now being looked at as harshly as heroine. This. Is. Wrong. Let's use our resources to study this, not ban out of fear of the unknown. We are the greatest country in the world, banning a plant so it can be profititized as a pill is unamerican, and I promise you that's what will happen after the ban.

The possible banning of kratom has terrified me as I was injured during childbirth six years ago, had two extensive pelvic surgeries with placement of vaginal mesh, and was diagnosed as having a collagen tissue disorder called Ehler-Danlos. The scar tissue from the pelvic surgeries, mesh implants, and the loose joints I have from Ehler-Danlos cause me chronic pain. However I love my six year old son dearly, and I needed a mild pain relieving medication that would not impair my cognition and activity level like narcotic pain relievers and even over the counter pain relievers such as Ibuprofen & Acetaminophen do. Kratom saved my life because it is a medication that I can stop and start taking as needed for pain without the withdrawal symptoms that narcotics cause. I can think clearly with Kratom, and am able to home school my son and do many household duties that I used to be unable to do before Kratom. Losing this literal lifeline of Kratom would harm not just those of us disabled and in chronic pain, but also our families and those who depend upon us being well enough to work without typical pain drug side effects. Professionally as a registered nurse I can find no evidence that this herb is anymore dangerous than a host of other herbs and synthetic medications currently available over the counter. Kratom is a surprisingly safe herb. It does not inhibit respiratory drive like narcotics, and is a mild pain reliever that is much like taking a combination of Ibuprofen with a cup of coffee (Kratom as properties in it similar to caffeine in addition to blocking pain). Alcohol, cigarettes, prescription narcotics, and marijuana are by far much stronger drugs. Alcohol causes poisoning, death, respiratory depression, and addictive abuse on levels that create genuine societal problems, and yet it is perfectly legal over the counter for adults. Health food stores have isles upon isles of shelves filled with herbal supplements such as skullcap, calendula, st. john's wort, valerian, etc and these herbs are perfectly legitimate for adults to choose to supplement with for a host of health reasons as they see fit. Kratom is an herb that poses no more danger than taking an over the counter herb such as calendula or skullcap. I understand the issues the DEA is facing now with trying to stop the rampant abuse of heroin and other strong prescriptive narcotics in the USA presently. My husband is an ER/trauma nurse and we have seen the effects of drugs like heroin and Dilaudid. Kratom may seem like a kissing cousin chemically to narcotics, but in its pure herbal form (non-synthetic) it does not cause issues that narcotics can in terms of respiratory suppression, cognitive issues, and severe addiction. Kratom is no more strong of a addiction than would be found with taking regular coffee/caffeine, chocolate, or sugar while providing enormous benefit to vulnerable and disabled individuals. These disabled individuals with chronic pain on Kratom seek to take the most minimal pain medication possible in order to function the most normally with work and other activities of daily living. I don't know what I will do if I lose this miracle herb. I am scared to think of having to go back on narcotic pills for pain relief as I was not present mentally when on them and could work much less effectively. Please note that the complications found which warranted closer examination of Kratom involved patients taking multiple drugs, and that items such as washing machine detergent pods and alcohol have caused far greater damages and deaths. It makes no sense to ban Kratom from a logical stand point medically, and from a moral stand point banning Kratom will punish and put vulnerable, disabled persons in the population at risk with no other good pain relief options. In an ideal world we would all heal and not have to deal with chronic pain and illness. Yet we live in an imperfect world and there are many of us suffering in the dark with pain and chronic health issues we will carry our entire lives. We are disabled and in need of pain relief, but we are not abusers of medications nor addicts seeking a euphoric high. Look at the sound evidence which shows Kratom to be a safe herbal supplement that can entirely reasonably be taken over the counter by adults of sound mind for useful purposes as the individual deems fit. There are thousands (maybe millions) of us depending upon Kratom as our lifeline, and the evidence shows it is safe to use so please keep Kratom as a legal herbal supplement for the good of our society. Thank you for your consideration. I am happy to answer to any and all questions on this matter to be of further use.

I searched up what is what for and tried to gather as much information as possible, having chronic back pain I was very excited to give it a try. I've been to the doctors for about 10 years trying to get help for a tarlov cyst in my spine which causes severe back pain and led me to be unemployed even after MRIS CT scans Xrays blood test urine test etc. With no help from doctors I feared I would live a life of pain. I ordered a small amount of kratom before september 30th and when I tried it I was astonished how well it worked for my pain. I've tried every medication for nerve pain and inflammation pain and none of it works. Kratom has changed my life for the better, I would like more research done just Incase there are harmful side effects. I'm not into any other drugs including alcohol and I believe kratom should be allowed to be consumed.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0677","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon Davidson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To the DEA,\n\nHello my name is Barbara and I am 57 years old. I am an accountant and own my own business. I'm also a mom, volunteer, animal advocate and am very active in sports. I've been taking the supplement Kratom for over three years now and its changed my life. For decades I've suffered from depression and anxiety and resulting social awkwardness. I realize now that I've been searching for a healthy alternative in the plant family that would help with my issues as listed above. Nothing seems even close to kratom. I found out about Kratom by watching many many testimonials about the benefits of this wonderful herb. So I decided to try it myself. Since that time my life has forever changed. Over the past three years I've experienced great energy, a positive attitude and have become much more comfortable in social situations. I've experienced such a relief from my past negativity and have experienced great joy just from living life to the best of my ability. I no longer take any prescription medications for depression which is an added plus.  I would hate to see this wonderful discovery disappear from my life. Please consider my comments as well as others who really enjoy kratom's benefits. In conclusion, I've learned through my own experience that kratom is safe, and self regulating. You simply cannot take too much without feeling a bit nauseous. This alone deters a person from taking more than they should. I think the benefits of Kratom cannot be ignored based on my testimonial as well as the public outcry to keep Kratom legal.  There are many people out there who use kratom to relieve chronic pain. They simply do not want to take any prescriptions but rather prefer to take something that grows naturally. Please care enough for the people of America and keep Kratom legal and available to the public.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1026","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Barbara Moscato","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"While I have never used Kratom, many thousands have found it useful and helpful in what may otherwise be a life full of pain and/or addiction.

The comparison of Kratom to other\nSchedule 1 substances is just unfathomable. The proof that Kratom is not synthetic, and\ndoes not give a traditional high has been proven over and over again. The war is being \nfought on the wrong battleground. While there may be some that feel that Kratom is \naddictive, and dangerous, how much more dangerous - by anyone's standards- are the \nalternatives?  Whether it be prescription pain killers, replacement therapy such as\nmethadone or suboxone, or illegal drugs like heroin, there is no argument that the \nobviously least harmful of all is Kratom. I personally have tried all the other alternatives\nto manage pain, anxiety, and ultimitely addiction because of these dangerous medications. \nKratom has not only allowed me to free myself from all of the legal and illegal drugs \nthat caused me to be high, to withdrawal when I did not have them, and most importantly\nto take me away from my family and from society, I am now also able to manage my pain\nand mental health better than I ever have before. \nThere is no doubt that the addiction and fatalities caused by both illegal narcotics and \nprescription opiods and medications is something that needs to be direly addressed. \nBut, once again, it's being attacked in the wrong direction. For the million or so people\nthat have changed their lives for the better and escaped the dangerous cycle they \nwere living in, taking Kratom away will absolutely and inarguably do more harm than good. \nWhy take that chance?  If profit does not come before human life, and if a PROVEN \nnon-synthetic supplement can provide so much positive with very little to no negative\nrepercussion, there really is no argument supporting the banning of Kratom left. \nPeople will always find a way to abuse a substances. Too many abuse their prescription \nmedications, mainly due to the nature of the medication themselves - \nbeing prescribed by a physician or managed by thehealthcare system has not stopped that\nabuse and it's lethal consequences in any way. \nWe should have the power to choose what is found in nature. Not a plant that is \nadulterated as cocaine and heroin are, but a leaf exactly as we find in tea and\nother supplements.\nTaking this plant away would not only be unfair, it would be irresponsible. This plant \nhas allowed me to become a mother again, a contributing member of society, while being\nfree of the pain that ruled my every waking moment. I can live without fear of losing\neverything due to an addiction started by pain pills, prescribed by a well-meaning doctor. \nIf the power of this plant can be studied, and harnessed into a pill that can be \nprofited on, all while saving many lives with medications that started this epidemic, \nthan how much more irresponsible would we be to take away that research?  I personally \nwould rather the natural version, but the option should and could be there. Everyone\nwins. \nIntentions were well-meaning, but there is no public health threat with Kratom. \nThose efforts would be better spent focusing on the synthetic drugs pouring\ninto our country legally. Better spent focusing on the dangerous altered illegal \nand counterfeit drugs flooding our streets. Better spent on education and oversight into\nprescription drug abuse. Taking away prescriptions is now causing new problems to those\nwho need relief. Banning Kratom would only add to that, by taking away a safe alternative.\nMy vote goes to Kratom, and to keep it unscheduled and within reach of any and all.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5387","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have never used nor plan to use Kratom.

I also take kratom regularly to help with my depression and anxiety.  In my teen and college years I used illicit substances or overconsumed alcohol in an effort to obtain relief from depression related symptoms.  10 years ago, I successfully quit all alcohol and illicit drug use, began exercising regularly and maintaining a reasonably healthy diet - all of which have improved my mindset, motivation and overall outlook on life.  Nevertheless, prior to discovering kratom I was still struggling frequently with strong feeling of depression and anxiety despite significant efforts to be healthy and productive.  After beginning to take a few grams of kratom each day and maintaining the other elements of an overall healthy lifestyle such as diet and exercise, I now feel much more positive, motivated and at peace.  Kratom has been a huge benefit in my life and helped me to reach my full potential in both my personal and professional endeavors.\nThe proposed action by the DEA to schedule and ban kratom will cause significant and immediate harm to many thousands of individuals such as myself who benefit from taking kratom as a supplement.  A ban will significantly slow or stop ongoing research that can help us better understand how kratom should be safely and effectively used.   Its time for US drug policy to move into the 21st century and acknowledge that prohibition of any and all psychoactive substances including plants and herbs is not always in the best interest of public health and can often result in unintended consequence that harm the public (black markets, black market related violence, sale of contaminated materials).

My story began 3 yeas ago, while trying to find a natural way to deal with my chronic migraine headaches (and other random ailments), all the while becoming more and more dependent and addicted to the legal opiates my doctor had been prescribing to me. Alas, i found Kratom, and a new life emerged. I have since been able to get effective relief with Kratom, without the horrible side effects that opiates have to offer. In fact, I became so impressed with what Kratom had to offer, that I decided to start selling it, as I knew it could help so many others out there. So that is what I did, and indeed, my 2 years of vending have helped thousands of people. I have received hundreds of communications of how grateful my customers were for the services I provided, due to how this tree leaf had benefited their lives. I never could respond to these testaments, due to the restrictions the FDA has placed on vendors and how the product is to be sold. Regardless, it is truly amazing how Kratom saves so many lives. Since the ban proposal, my business has abruptly ended, as it has become nearly impossible to sell Kratom since the ban proposal. Customs is unethically seizing/destroying shipments (to a still legal product), and merchants and payment processors are now afraid to work with Kratom vendors. This has been a hardship to my entire family, as it was my only source of income, as well as the only income for my staff. The Botanical Educational Alliance has estimated that as many as 10,000 Kratom vendors have been effected (if not more) by this unjust action of the DEA. https://www.botanical-education.org/economic-impact-kratom/ This in itself is a serious problem. We are talking about a benign plant, which millions of responsible law-abiding Americans use for very personal and usually necessary reasons. By banning Kratom (or scheduling it in any form), you are putting tens of thousands of people out of work in this economic crisis, and at the same time making criminals out of law-abiding citizens with the black market that will emerge overnight. Are you still not willing to learn from the past mistakes of the War On Drugs? Add to that, those deciding to make the choice of using a benign plant to help them (which would make them criminals), versus those who would rather not become criminals and go back to their old ways.. wow, what an unbelievable choice you will leave them.  Myself included. This has been one of the most trying times in my family's and my life. I can only pray you will listen to the people who have spoken.. the Kratom community as a whole, which involves consumers, scientists, doctors, vendors, and family members which your decision will affect.

My wife suffers from severe depression, anxiety, CPTSD and bipolar tendencies as well as debilitating chronic pain issues. Since she has started using speciosa, her quality of life and interaction has blossomed like I have never seen before. It feels like someone I had been truly and deeply missing for many, many years has finally come home, and the best parts of her can now shine, rather than being drowned underneath her ailments. Her activity levels, the contentment and peacefulness kratom allows her has in turn, enabled her to truly partake in the life around her in ways she hasn't been able to since she was very young. Additionally, the clarity and presence of mind are allowing her to work through and heal many of the traumas that are at the root of her CPTSD and other mental health disorders. To lose access to such a beneficial dietary supplement would be truly devastating to not only her, but our family, friends and others like her who are suffering as well. Speciosa makes her productive, present, clear and the chronic pain issues no longer slow her down, which means she can partake in life so much more than she could normally, meet her goals, self-care and live an active, social and healthy lifestyle. Please keep speciosa legal and available!\nMany thanks in advance,\nSal","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7323","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-26T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sal Nieto","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Amanda and I am a 24 year old from Orlando, FL. \nI have suffered from Fibromayalgia and CFS for over a decade.  These conditions have hindered me in the past from working in my chosen field of work (welder). \nSince discovering kratom via an online fibromayalgia support group, I have been able to stop using all dangerous prescription or OTC painkillers which before were needed for my ailments despite all their nasty side effects.  Although kratom cannot treat or cure fibromayalgia (nothing that we know of can cure it), kratom is in fact the only thing I've ever discovered that can provide me with relief in a safe way.  I have not experienced any negative effects from kratom powder.   I have, however, experienced many negative and scary effects from Rx medications. \nFurthermore, I have noticed absolutely no dependency to kratom producing any withdrawal symptoms.  Most if not all painkillers which can help relieve such pain produce an incredibly awful dependency.  \nSo, in my honest opinion, kratom is a valuable and indispensable plant with many uses and great potential to help thousands of people.   I oppose a schedule I classification for that reason.  \nI would like to continue to be a functioning member of society and be able to work, rather than have to receive any disability.  Kratom helps me be able to do that when nothing else could.  \nThank you for taking my comments into consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1231","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amanda Young","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I Oppose the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances, for the simple fact that the 15 deaths attributed to this plant are dubious and must be further researched, to conclude if other contributing factors / polypharmacy, may have caused their death.\n\nI was alerted to the pending schedule 1 classification of kratom from the Joe Rogan Podcast \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" Episode #876 (avalible for free download on itunes).

It is hard to even consider it an adulterant, such alcohol, or marijuana (both which produce profoundly more intense psychoactive effects). In fact, I liken the effects of Kratom to that of a cup of coffee, minus the crash - and with responsible use, mind you, over the four years I have been enjoying it, I have truly noticed no adverse side affects.\n\nWhat is there to gain from scheduling Kratom? Criminals do not involve themselves with it - and the people who enjoy it are not criminals. If scheduled, you will the place Kratom in the hands of criminals (if there is even a market for them, which I somewhat doubt)... Even worse, you'll turn innocent people into criminals. \n\nThe DEA has been protecting our wonderful country for over 80 years. Let us focus on the real problems.... such as criminal organizations, and actual illicit drugs (which kratom is not) that truly hurt out society (heroin, prescription opioids, cocaine, ect).\n\nI trust that the DEA will make the decision on this matter that is in the best interest of our country. \n\nThank you so much,\nJoe Hertler","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11782","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joe Hertler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I just wanted to say as someone who suffers from chronic depression kratom is probably one of the few supplements I take that is effective and lasting for it.

I then entered in to pain management and was prescribed prescription narcotics on top of physical therapy. While the physical therapy helped some, a need still remained for medication. Can you imagine what it must be like to be a young 30 something year old trying to raise a family, and not being able to provide? The medication, while helpful with the pain, dulled everything. My job performance suffered. I heard about Kratom and gave it a try. It has changed my life. I no longer require a narcotic pain prescription. I don't have to increase my doses due to tolerance issues like what happens so quickly with Oxycodone and similar drugs. My head is clear and I can focus at work.

There is evidence to suggest that nociceptive responses to kratom differ from morphine and codeine, however, and that kratom may interact with opioid receptor subtypes involving serotonin path- ways (Hassan et al. 2013; Macko, Weisbach, and Douglas 1972; Watanabe et al. 1997). Recent animal research has also indicated that kratom has anti-inflammatory actions, antimicrobial activity, and can lead to suppression of food and water intake (Azizi et al. 2010; Shaik et al. 2009; Parthasarathy et al. 2009), making kratom an attractive area of basic research for a wide variety of human conditions. \n\nAdditionally, Boyer, Babu,Adkins, McCurdy, & Halpern (2008) state Opioid analgesics remain highly effective modalities for the treatment of chronic pain, but their long-term administration is associated with the development of opioid misuse, abuse, dependence and addiction, the incidence of which is increasing [4]. Among individuals with chronic pain who are maintained on opioid analgesic agents, kratom is gaining awareness as a natural alternative to physician supervised opioid replacement therapy [1]. One striking finding of this report is the extent to which kratom attenuates potentially severe opioid withdrawal, yet cessation of kratom administration itself appears to be associated with modest abstinence symptoms. The pharmacological bases underlying this effect are uncertain. For example, mitragynine is theorized to stimulate contributions from adrenergic and serotonergic pathways that augment analgesia, but formal binding data have been obtained only for mu-, delta- and kappa opioid receptors [5,6].  Later in the case report, they claim these studies identified that mitragynine extensively inhibits radioligand binding at several central nervous system receptor systems (Table 1). The clinical implication of these results is that mu-opioid agonism may avert withdrawal symptoms, while kappa agonism attenuates reinforcement and produces aversion [7]. In addition, mitragynine, through its putative alpha-2 adrenergic agonist activity, may mimic adjunctive therapies for opioid withdrawal such as clonidine. Mitragynine, therefore, may exert several convergent pharmacological effects that could attenuate opioid withdrawal symptoms and blunt cravings.\n\nFrom these two published, peer-reviewed studies, it is clear that this plant material (Mitragyna speciosa) contains alkaloids which have the potential to help the medical and scientific communities better understand pain response and develop new therapies to treat a myriad of conditions.  It is essential you do not schedule this plant in the most restrictive category, for if you do, a tremendous resource will be locked away from millions of people.  Instead, what should be advocated for is additional study into the plant and its properties so we can harness its ability to attenuate pain.\n\nSincerely,\nKevin Roux, M.Ed., RN\n\nReferences\nSwogger,M.T., Hart,E., Erowid,F., Erowid,E., Trabold,N., Yee,K.,  Walsh,Z.

I mainly use it to help with insomnia and anxiety. I typically take a small dose before bed, and anytime I am having trouble sleeping throughout the night. I currently get some of the best sleep I have ever experienced thanks to kratom. That is priceless to me. \n\nIf kratom was made illegal, I would have to resort to other sleep aids that make me groggy and/or are worse for my health. I feel no noticeable negative side effects from kratom. I usually sleep very well when I take kratom, and wake up feeling great. This is more than I can say for any other sleep aid I have tried.\n\nI only buy kratom from reliable vendors online and have never had any issues with the quality of their products. I see kratom as something that has similar potency and usefulness as coffee. It is a useful plant to millions of people worldwide, and it does a lot more good than harm to society. \n\nI am 100% certain that I am a happier, healthier, and more productive person thanks to kratom. If it was made illegal, my quality of life would suffer an my ability to contribute to society would be lessened. \n\nPlease do not make another extremely beneficial herb illegal. It would cause a lot of suffering in this country, and that is the last thing we need right now. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my comment!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12684","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alexander Blakesley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"PLEASE LIST AGAIN.

I have 3 lifesaving awards, a Veterans Service Medal, and I had the first NARCAN save in my PD. I have seen firsthand how the opiate epidemic has ravaged our communities. One of my lifesaving awards was on a 23-year-old heroin overdose before the days of carrying NARCAN.  I am also OPPOSED to the emergency scheduling of kratom, Docket No. DEA-442W. For this reason, I have chosen to make my comments anonymously. \n\nI am very familiar with addiction. Not only have I dealt with addicts daily over the course of my career, but I am also the son of an alcoholic. When I first heard that people were consuming this plant kratom to assist them in getting off the opiates they were addicted to, I was HIGHLY skeptical. I knew too many heroin addicts who I later ran into as methadone or Suboxone addicts. I was distrustful of kratom, not because it was an unknown plant, but because I had yet to meet anyone who had successfully used one substance to get off another.\n\nI know several individuals who have consumed kratom to help them get off heroin. They went from being \"frequent flyers\" as we refer to people we have repeat contact with, to clean and sober members of the community. They are working and in relationships. They are raising their kids and finishing their educations. Now, I see them as they work their jobs or shop for their groceries. I am not seeing them in handcuffs, being transported to County for yet another drug-related offense. My contact with them is positive contact these days, not negative.\n\nI have seen these \"kratom users\" up close and first hand, and I cannot stress enough that this is NOT something that needs emergency scheduling and I am completely against this ban. At most, I would support an age restriction. We have an age restriction on alcohol and cigarettes, and if the DEA were being honest, I think the agency would agree that alcohol poses a greater threat than kratom.  According to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism website, nearly 88,000 people (approximately 62,000 men and 26,000 women) die from alcohol-related causes annually, making alcohol the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States. In 2014, alcohol-impaired driving fatalities accounted for 9,967 deaths (31 percent of overall driving fatalities). I have seen the ravages of alcohol up close and personal. I have made the death notifications from heroin overdoses and traffic fatalities. Clearly, you do not have these numbers from kratom. Most of my brother officers do not even know what kratom is because it is NOT an issue in our communities! Quite frankly, law enforcement has enough on their plate going after the dealers of hard drugs like heroin and meth. Going after a plant that I have seen help people first hand? Give me a break. Please do not ban this plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6922","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Mid 40's father of 4 with a very physical construction job and arthritis.

People are starting to realize that arresting, raiding, and prosecuting people for illegal substances has more to do with control, asset seizure, keeping private prisons full, and other false pretenses rather than keeping the public \"safe\",  which is only an illusion.  If a person is not harming another person,  it's not right for them to be told what they can and can't put in thier body.  It's often assumed that becuase a person is against the drug war,  that must mean they advocate drug use.  This is not true in my case as well as many other people.  \n\nBanning even one more substance would be going in the opposite direction.  It would be undermining freedom.  I'm sure you are aware that marajuana was banned after alcohol prohibition ended.  A new revenue stream was needed to replace what was lost from the end of prohibition.  To get the public on board with this ban, Racist scare tactics were used that claimed marijuana \"made Mexicans crazy\".  This was reinforced by propaganda movies such as \"Reefer Madness\".\n\nThe same thing is now happening with Kratom.  Many people are discovering it's benefits and profits of Big Pharma are at risk.  People who did research into alternatives for medications such as Oxycontin have (had) an option.  Now the same type of propaganda is being used to scare the public into  supporting (or at very least accepting) a ban.  Like Marijuana,  it would be inaccurate to classify Kratom under schedule 1 (no medical uses) when so many people are finding relief from pain, anxiety, etc.  Kratom doesn't only help people avoid having to take dangerous perscription pain killers.....It also helps people who are already addicted to them.  Right now as far as prescribed medication goes,  there isn't anything available that isn't just as addictive as the substance being abused.  \n\nPlease reconsider this ban.  This affects a great deal of people.  Dangerous or not,  it shouldn't be the government's choice how people choose to manage their pain,  treat their symptoms,  or even experience an altered state of consciousness,  If that's what they choose to do.

I know many people it has saved and maintained from being in the clutches of opiate addiction, and if you take it away, they majority of those people are going to go right back to the opiates.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a minor in Psychology. Before I became too chronically ill to work I was employed as an Admistrative Assistant in the 2-year college system for ten years. My health deteriorated and I became bedridden at times with a very low quality of life.\n\nTwo years ago I learned of a plant called kratom through a chronic pain support group and I began my research into this plant. After extensively researching all aspects of this plant I decided that I would give this all-natural plant a try in an effort to better my quality of life.\n\nOver the past 20 years I have been diagnosed with the following conditions: Major Depressive Disorder; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Panic Attacks; PTSD;  Social Anxiety Disorder; Generalized Mood Disorder; Attention Deficit Disorder; Fibromyalgia; Chronic Fatigue Immue Deficiency; Sjogren's Syndrome; Moderate to Severe Arthritis; Degenerative Disc Disease of my spine and neck (L1 & L2; C5 - C7) with bulging discs; Carpal Tunnel in both wrists; and Fibrosis of my left thumb.\n\nI have been through numerous nerve blocks and injections to no avail. I have been on more psychotropic medications than any one person should ever be prescribed. I have had extensive cognitive therapy counseling including a partialized hospitalization program and also individualized cognitive behavior therapy with little results. More prescription drugs were prescribed that left me feeling drugged, sad, and lethargic. Since then I have had a mixture of prescription medications for my physical and mental pain changed and then changed again and again. I became more depressed and virtually unable to leave my house. The prescription drugs were ineffective and the side effects seemed to make my health worse.\n\nA year ago I began kratom as a dietary supplement. I no longer woke up every morning dreading life. I was no longer a prisoner to my chronic conditions. I was no longer too drugged to function. I still had physical pain. I still had mental pain. The difference being with kratom I was clear headed. I no longer spent my days bedridden. I was no longer a recluse. I became a functioning member of society for the first time in too many years. I was able to exercise, help care for my parents and my precious 95 year old grandmother. I was active in my son's extracurricular activities including being a \"team mom\" for his middle school baseball team. I was so grateful for finally feeling like a real, normal person again.\n\nKratom gave me a new chance at life and it is imperative this dietary supplement be available for people like me. The list of medications I no longer had to take included everything from anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, anti-anxiety medications to pain management medications.\n\nKratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. \n\nUnfortunately legislation in my State was passed to ban kratom. I was able to stop kratom as part of my all natural treatment for my conditions without any of the dangerous side effects or withdrawals caused from stopping my former prescription medications. \n\nThank you for allowing my testimony.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19035","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mindy Sexton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my name is Christopher,  I have been using kratom for a dietary supplement for the last 3 years.  I do not believe that this plant is any worse or even as worse as any other herbal supplement.  I also believe that this is a plant that's only restrictions should be labeled for use over 21 or older. Just as alcohol and tobacco age restrictions are best.  Criminalizing this plant will only header society.  As with today's generation even marijuana which has stronger effects than kratom, will soon be legal for sale. Main reason I ask for this plant to only be regulated and not illegal. There is not many side effects from long term use.  The positives heavily out weigh the negative.  It's obvious that this plant has no deaths directly related to it which should make it not an issue for concern.  It's no more physically addictive than coffee. Actually if you use kratom responsibility there is no addictive side effects at all.  Anyway I think you will understand how important this supplement really is to the people who use it.  Safely and more important responsibility.  I know that as an American entity a country of freedom and capitalism.  The more obviously better choice is to regulate and add age restrictions that's all that I see is needed to not ban this plant from the reach of the society that uses it. \n\nI know you will make the right choice,  far from the days of reefer madness.  Research is known by all citizens.  There is no surprises with kratom.  We all know the side effects if any and we all knowingly use this supplement. Please do the correct research before making any haste choices that could make good everyday people criminals.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6446","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Jones","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, my name is Nick Ehret.

I am a US Navy Veteran, disabled and honorably discharged, currently in the VA health care system. I have been blessed with the opportunity and challenge of having to overcome 2 herniated discs and 2 knees with inoperable cartilaginous tumors. I live with pain.\n\n Before implementing Kratom into my treatment plan, I was certainly not able to reduce my intake of opiates in a proper way. The VA doctors simply switched the types of medications, creating the illusion that my consumption was less, of course when focusing on only 1 particular brand or formulation. But in reality and objectively speaking, my consumption was indeed not declining, it was slowly increasing. Much like the overwhelming majority of patients on opiates. Ultimately I reached a point where I needed to reverse the direction I was headed, and find a way to manage my pain, health and overall situation much better. I knew there had to be a way. I searched and eventually found Kratom.\n\nKratom has been the single most important factor or weapon in my arsenal to fight this daily battle of pain and discomfort. It has allowed me to notably reduce my intake and therefore manage my pain much better. This small adjustment in my life, has yielded much fruit. My family and friends can attest to this. \n\nFor some time now Kratom has been in the collective consciousness and proverbial medicine cabinet of humanity as a whole. In recent history Kratom has been the subject of many studies as its historical presence, use and recorded successes has come to light. These successes have been tested in modern studies and have indeed been validated. However different and varying, the undeniable common thread or theme in the modern feedback and findings from Kratom use is simply that 'quality of life is improved'. I am of the humble opinion that there is enough evidence supporting the benefits of the use of Kratom, primarily in managing pain, therefore we should allow Kratom to remain legal and in that, we should encourage the careful scientific study of the useable alkaloids and it's possible large scale medicinal use for treating a wide variety of human illnesses. \n\nI understand the DEA's concern when approaching this subject of Kratom. It may seem like a slippery slope, however, when objectively examined, I am confident that the DEA will find that Kratom has been unfairly marred in anecdotal reports of harm to humans and chained to the stigma of arising from the dark swamp of the 'drug culture'. But this is an illusion. \n\nKratom is a good thing for humans. Please reconsider the pursuit to criminalize this plant. Thank you for your time, consideration and service to the American people. Please feel free to contact me directly via email. \n\nCarlos Nuques","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18799","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carlos Nuques","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I can't state strongly enough that this substance needs to be made illegal.

It has let me continue being a mother and a grandmother, instead of a homeless person who needs to be taken care of herself.

She used to be very athletic and a good runner. Once she became ill, she lost all of that. She originally was prescribed opiates to help with the pain. These caused many bad side effects for her and negatively impacted her liver. She discussed using Kratom with me once we realized doctors had no other options to help ease some of her pain.

I have been on ten different medications and only one of them has worked and only then for about six months before It stopped working. As a result of my depression I have gotten into trouble with substances, mainly alcohol and other drugs. At my worst I was up to drinking a fifth a day of hard liquor and while I have a goal of long term sobriety it seems impossible to achieve with this horrible mood disorder. After experiencing a lot of failure with maintaining long term society I sought out a harm reduction approach. I tried using other drugs only to have it spiral into addiction. Synthetic marijuana, large doses of over the counter cough medicine and several illegal drugs were all alternatives I turned to in an effort to avoid drinking. I have used a lot of hard drugs and been addicted multiple times, kratom is nothing like those substances. I had heard about kratom through my online research and decided it was worth trying. I've found that it works very quickly to kill my depression and it alleviates alcohol cravings. I don't feel intoxicated while taking it and I have a lot more energy to devote towards work and being a better partner to my wife. Having experienced delirium tremors and nasty drug withdrawal in the past I can say that stopping kratom use is very easy. The benefits go away but I don't feel like I need to get more kratom. Additionally it's simple to use a kitchen scale to measure out my dose and keep it consistent. There is no incentive for me to use more and more of it because if I take too much it will make nauseous. Kratom has been one of the very few alternative treatments I have tried for my co-occuring conditions that works. I'm currently pursuing TMS  (Transcranial magnetic stimulation) treatment for my depression and I'm hoping that I can continue to use kratom as needed to supplement that and keep me sober from alcohol. Talk therapy and a good psychiatrist are also tools I have been using for years and I've been to two treatment programs and more meetings than I care to remember for my addiction problems. I stopped using kratom recently in September and part of October and had several binge drinking slips and a major depressive episode. If it were to be made illegal I genuinely feel that my quality of life would suffer significantly. With kratom in my arsenal I can function in society, I'm a better employee, spouse and student who will be graduating from a university in a few weeks with honors. Without it my choices for safe and effective treatment are limited and I'm not sure that I will make it. Please do not ban this wonderful plant because the small subset of users who are looking for a cheap, legal high. They are probably coming away disappointed. If a person like me, a chronically depressed alcoholic and drug user, can use kratom responsibly than surely it poses little if any actual risk to the public.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3827","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tim Shattuck","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not believe that the plant known as kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) should be scheduled or made illegal.\n\nThere have been no deaths associated with kratom alone in the hundreds of years it has been used and has shown to be no more dangerous than coffee.\n\nPlease keep it 100% legal and regulated as a dietary supplement.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2206","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"K D Moore","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, I was on rx pain meds for a decade.

It's ingestion is known to help alleviate many of the aches and pains associated with aging, curb appetites for harmful addictive substances, and help promote an overall sense of well-being. Many aging laborers in Asian culture have credited Kratom for helping them stay active and productive, and thereby avoid being replaced by younger workers. It's effectiveness has long been highly valued in cultures that don't have institutionalized social safety nets, and remaining physically competitive as long as possible is of utmost importance.\n I believe Kratom use in America has been wrongly associated with the abuse of illicit and harmful substances. The existing body of knowledge suggesting that the ingestion of Kratom ALONE has led to bodily harm is sparse at best. The benefits of protecting American's rights to include natural herbal alternatives in their efforts to maintain an enhanced quality of life appear to outweigh any imminent risks. I am a strong advocate for limiting Federal overreach in limiting naturally occurring choices for self-care.\n Personally I have indeed incorporated Kratom into my health regime, and I believe it's been very beneficial in helping me maintain an active, productive, and self-sustaining lifestyle. I have children and grandchildren who depend on me to be a resource to them.

I have suffered from severe anxiety since elementary school and it was getting worse as I got older.

Not only did it help my pain, my anxiety, but it also helped my symptoms of PMDD. Another happy side effect was that I quit drinking.. I never had a drinking problem but taking kratom just made me not care to drink. Most people suffer from one problem or another and if we could find something that helps make us feel better and is also safe and natural, I say we should explore it more.

I'm strongly opposed to the scheduling of kratom. I have generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. A friend of mine who used kratom to escape opioid addiction told me it was helpful for stress, and after drinking some, I noticed that it also has a positive effect on mood. Over the next few months, as I learned more facts about kratom, the more enthusiastic I became. It helped calm me when I decided to taper off of benzodiazepines, a hellish process. Lately, I've been taking a teaspoon full in tea every day, more or less depending on stress. It's not a replacement for anti-depressants or meds for panic disorders, but it has a very real, very positive effect on my life. I'll be ok if it's banned, but many people won't.\n\nFor many, friends and family included, it's a way to fight opioid addiction without the use of deadly (and deadly expensive) Big Pharma controlled solutions, such as buprenorphine or methadone. I have a friend who's currently trying to get off of methadone using kratom, which should highlight where the real danger lies here. I have several friends and family members who might have lived had they only known about kratom.\n\nKratom was banned in Alabama in May. In June, the number of opioid overdoses in Birmingham doubled. [www.kratomliteracyproject.com/2016/07/drug-policy/] Overnight. Just like that. That should tell us something. A number of states have considered and rejected the idea of a Kratom ban. These states want kratom to be available to their citizens.

Including myself. \n\nI am a 28 year old male living in Texas. I am against the DEA putting Kratom on the schedule 1 controlled substances list. \n\nI was twenty six when I started to use kratom. I live with severe depression and anxiety, and have since I was 13 years old. Before I started using kratom, I was abusing alcohol... Self - medicating daily. \n\nI have been in therapy for my conditions since I was sixteen. I have been on and off more medications than I can count. Some things would work for a little while, but the positive effects would wear off. The side effects would often make things worse. I would become dependent on the drugs, and began to abuse benzodiazepines. Because of my alcohol and substance abuse, frequent panic attacks, and persisting depression and anxiety, I was unable to hold down a job and frequently relied on the grace of my friends to keep me from being homeless.\n\nMy alcohol abuse took me to rock bottom on February 22, 2014 when I attempted to kill myself. By the grace of God, I survived. From that point I knew that if I was going to live, I was going to have to find something that worked. \n\nI quit alcohol cold turkey that day. Things were going pretty well for about a year until I relapsed with alcohol. Things started to look like they were going to spiral down again until I heard about Kratom.\n\nUsing Kratom has enabled me to quit drinking. Unlike alcohol, benzos, and opiates - all of which I have abused in the past - it isn't pleasant to take more than a moderate dose. I was able to replace alcohol with Kratom, and once I was confident that I was through the rough spell, stopped using kratom with no negative effects. \n\nCombined with therapy and light anxiety and depression medications, I am living a normal life for the first time since I was 13 years old. I continue to take a small dose of Kratom occasionally when I start to have a panic attack come on (two or three times a week). \n\nI have enjoyed steady employment and promotions for over two years at a growing company. I have repaired my relationships with my friends and family. I am paying all of my bills for the first time in my life. I could not have done that without Kratom.\n\nIf Kratom is designated a schedule 1 drug, I fear that I will turn back to alcohol and substance abuse. I will become a criminal if I continue to use this natural, mild medicine. I fear for those who rely on kratom to stay off of hard drugs like heroin - a few of which I know personally.\n\nI don't want to be a criminal. I don't want to start abusing substances again. I don't want to die. \n\nThanks to the freedom of this great nation, I was able to find a path to wellness that worked for me when nothing else has. Please represent MY interests and fight for a sensible understanding of this substance, rather than a knee jerk scheduling.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20660","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern:\n\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\n\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.

I am a 48 year old artist and former elementary school teacher.  I am writing to oppose the addition of mitragynine and\n7-hydroxymitragynine, the main psychoactive constituents of the plant Mitragyna speciosa, also referred to as kratom, to the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.\n\nBy the summer of 2014 my (alcohol) drinking was leading to weekly evenings that I did not remember.  In June or July of that year, some close friends invited me to an ethnobotanical tea bar, and I began drinking kratom teas.  My alcohol consumption immediately dropped to almost none.  I still went out with my friends, but instead of several alcoholic drinks, I had just one or two kratom teas.  I had fun, and I REMEMBERED IT.  I read what I could find about kratom online, including a Scientific American article similar to the one at https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/should-kratom-be-legal/, where I learned that kratom could possibly help addicts stop using without withdrawal.  At some point thereafter, I did some intense yard work and discovered that drinking a kratom tea helped alleviate the intense muscle aches I had afterwards.  Since then, my socializing has moved from bars and parties to kava bars, where no alcohol is served.  At the four establishments I have visited, young people who wanted a place to hang out with peers sit alongside former alcoholics, ex-junkies and others.  The atmosphere is calm, friendly, and very supportive.  I have only once heard a voice raised in anger while at a kava bar, and the angry person was not a customer.  I have kratom tea two or three times a week now, except when I travel away from my home area.  Since I started drinking kratom teas, I have been on five trips lasting from one to three weeks each.  During these trips, I had no kratom and experienced no urges or symptoms of withdrawal.  Currently I drink kratom teas socially once or twice and week - often while I paint miniatures, which require steady hands and precise coordination, and additional tea once in a while to alleviate muscle aches.\n\nI think kratom should remain available because it is a natural plant product similar to other teas and coffee that seems to help and be enjoyed by a lot of people.  In my experience, excepting two people who drank very large quantities (leading to nausea, much as drinking that much coffeee might,) no one has reported any negative effects from consuming kratom.  I have not had any negative effects from drinking kratom teas.  Additionally, I worry about the people I know who have told me they were able to stop taking addictive drugs, including illegal ones, and those who have moved away from their alchoholism.  I do not think I will return to drinking (alcohol) heavily should kratom become schedule one, but it unsettled me that my wife, upon hearing of the DEA's proposal to ban kratom, bought me a bottle of whiskey.\n\nPlease do not add mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine to the list of schedule 1 controlled substances or otherwise restrict access to this plant.\n\nSincerely, Don A.

To the best of my knowledge, there have been a handful of deaths that were reportedly caused by Kratom but no direct correlation to it. I don't even want to put this in the same category as something like alcohol or tobacco were the deaths are astronomical because I feel this truly is a medicine that can used to safely to help overcome addiction and depression.\n\nI hope that you will review all of the individual experiences that people have had and use sound judgement to keep this from being a scheduled drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16318","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous User","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not classify Kratom, a natural herbal supplement, as a scheduled drug in the United States.

I am speaking today to share my views on Kratom.\n\nMy first experience with Kratom was sometime early in the year of 2016, my boyfriend of 4 years at the time presented me with this ground up natural leaf speaking of its healing wonders and how him and his mother who both suffer from chronic pain due to knee injuries and TMJ both felt major pain relief and an elevated mood as well as energy depending on the strain. Unlike the prescription medications that both had been prescribed previously for +10 years(opiates, benzos, and muscle relaxers alike), Kratom was the first natural alternative for pain management as well as a pick me up with what seems like no side effects other than being slightly dehydrated and compared to the zombie like pills that Doctors pressured them to take previously, this was nothing. I personally do not suffer from pain like those I speak of, but I do suffer from an incredible amount of anxiety. I initially started using Kratom to test the waters to see how well it helped manage nervous breakdowns, and it did not fail me! This leaf has helped me break through my anxiety in multiple ways, not only social anxiety but also helping me keep my overall spirit uplifted. Days I take Kratom, I really dont experience the crushing weight of my thoughts and let them tear me apart, my life is somewhat manageable with this plant. \n\nI am no Doctor, but I believe Kratom should be kept available to the Public because I highly believe that this plant is safer to use and almost just as effective for pain management as well as depression/anxiety as the prescription medications that are prescribed currently. I also believe that its not as addictive! Please keep Kratom off of the schedule 1 list so we can do more medical research to clear the air on what we are dealing with exactly and educate on how to dose. Medicine is all around us, most medicines are derived from the natural world, so please give this leaf a chance! We the people deserve more natural options to heal ourselves, I thank you for your time and hope my story is enlightening. \n\nAll the best,\nHaley Berg\nHaleymari.92@gmail.com","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15861","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Haley Berg","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Really helps me to become productive and positive","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14504","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Recovered opiate addict that used opiates for ~10 years.

A herbal business owner brought Kratom to my attention about a year before I started using the plant. Before I starting taking Kratom I did my research, which we all know there isn't much out there scientifically. Needless to say, it was a lot of personal reviews is how I educated myself on this plant. I was in the Army from 2003-2008, during that time I acquired some injuries. I broke my pelvis, and a major part of my foot on two separate occasions. Needless to say, those injuries over a few years caused some major back problems (severe arthritis, multiple degenerate disc disease, scoliosis). With that being said, they prescribed me Morphine, which I wasn't very fond of being on a narcotic as such for 5 years. I really wanted to find an natural alternative to help me with my daily pains. I would love to have to not rely on anything, but my pain is so bad, it makes me such a mean miserable person, and with the young kids it just isn't an option. Plus I couldn't even pick up my kids, that is how bad it got, and the only reason Morphine at the time was an option. Kratom got me off the Morphine, and has helped me normalize through out my days. Yes, I can still feel pain, but it is lessened, and way more tolerable! Kratom not only helps with my pain, but also with my extreme anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc. Kratom gave me my life back, and has made me a better mother because of it! Kratom is a God Send! I never want to go back to all those pills, but if Kratom is taking away, what other options do we have? Just thinking about being on Morphine for the rest of my life makes me ill. Not only has Kratom saved my life, but I have introduced the plant to others in need, as well. I have personally seen it help folks with getting of all types of narcotic (to include heroin), people with extreme pain issues (where they were bed ridding and now can move about), Others with extreme PTSD symptoms (to the extreme of never leaving their house, anxiety, suicidal, etc.) and now are living normal lives, all due to Kratom. Kratom is a gift from god, and should be used to help people get back to a normal life. Taking it away will only cause more drug issues. We really need to start perscribing  Kratom, Kratom rehabs, and just educating folks on the alternative, and NOT taking it away! This is a plant and it should be our choice to use it or not. By the way, there are some days where I don't have to take it, and I have no symptoms of detoxing. I keep my dosage very low and only take as needed. So the addiction part is also not true, its the addictive personality that may abuse it. But what is wonderful is that you can't overdose, you can't take to much and put yourself in a deadpan moment, and if you do take to much it will come right back up. Where as, if you take to many pills or shoot up, your dead! I agree there should be more research, only because I am curious on what other benefits could come from this magnificent plant. I could go on for day, but I will stop here. Thank you so much for your time, and please consider all the folks in pain!\n\nSincerely, \n Sarah Sorkin\n Sjhickman13@hotmail.com\n 502-525-2018","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6663","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Sorkin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been very beneficial in helping with my arthritis and fibromyalgia better than any drug prescribed by my doctor.

I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia in 2003.  I have tried all the big pharma medications for pain, anxiety depression, fatigue and pain that comes with a chronic illness.  There were days I could not get out of bed because I was in so much physical and mental pain.\nApproximately 2 years ago a fellow chronic pain sufferer told me about Kratom.  I was skeptical.  I joined a group she recommended.  I was still skeptical.  I conducted my own research, I asked questions and then I decide to try a sample.  I cried the first time I took Kratom because within 15 minutes my pain was at bay.  I felt relief, the kind of relief\nI had not felt since before my diagnosis.  I couldn't believe it.  I told my husband who was also as skeptical as I and after a few days of taking Kratom I was finally convinced.\nI was convinced that I did not have to continue to live in pain.  I did not have to decline invitations to parties and gatherings.  I could manage my pain, anxiety and fatigue in such a way I could have a decent quality of life.\nKratom have me a life I never thought possible with RA and fibro. I could now walk my furkids (dogs) and go to the mall with my husband.  I could work in the yard and clean my house without feeling like a truck hit me after only a few minutes of activity.\nThe best thing about Kratom was there were no side effects.  I didn't feel loopy or \"out of it\" like some pain meds and muscle relaxers make you feel. I could take a yellow strain or white one and have a little more energy while curbing my pain.  My anxiety lessened and I was able to stop the prescription meds.\nKratom helped my insomnia and I could have a decent night's sleep without waking up multiple times during the night because of pain.\nKratom literally saved my life.  I had a tremendous fear of addiction with prescription drugs and since addiction runs in my family I was even more fearful.\nWith Kratom I used what I need.  I can also take a reset tincture to help my body readjust to doses when needed.  I do not feel trapped in my life anymore.  I feel like I have a life. \nI am so thankful for Kratom and I pray you not take away the only thing that has worked for me.  I am not alone. There are so many others like me.  I have helped others find Kratom who in turn were as amazed and grateful as I.\nPlease please please do not outlaw Kratom.  For my sake and all the others who need it for a decent quality of life.\nThank you very much.  \nBarbara Stalder ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8007","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"barbara stalder","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir,\n\nI use Kratom to help manage my back pain.

I am writing this comment to show my strong opposition to the proposed ban & scheduling of Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa). I started using Kratom Tea 1 year ago as a herbal supplement to help transition off opiates & to generally improve my mood. One of the biggest issues when coming off prescription pain medication is a lowered mood & lack of energy/motivation.  Kratom Tea as a supplement has helped to improve my mood & energy/motivation. It also helps ease minor aches & pains. I was unable to work for almost a year, then I found Kratom & it helped me to go back to work again!  I have suffered ZERO negative side effects from this plant.  I've had a medical check-up in the past month (with blood-work) & I'm perfectly healthy.\n\nI think Kratom should remain legal & unscheduled so that people like myself, without health insurance or a large amount of financial resources have a viable supplement that can help improve their quality of life.\n\nAccording to The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, pure leaf kratom appears to be relatively benign in the vast majority of users.\nSource: jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2588524\n\nThe vast majority of people who use Kratom, are law abiding, hard working members of society & many of us are using Kratom to help STAY THAT WAY.

I've had cancer this year, which hasn't helped pain issues, of course. I've drank kratom tea for about 6 years now, and I can't stress enough how much it's helped me get through day to day activitie! I have active grandchildren and I'm able to garden with them, bowl, swim, and many other things I'd not be able to join in without some sort of pain relief. I had a friend pass away in 2007 from pain pill addiction. It wasn't easy to be around her for her last year of life either. It was obvious that she was taking too many of the pain meds too. She became incoherent and difficult to deal with on a daily basis. I wish I'd have been familiar with this plant that God has put on this eart for us to use wisely. Maybe she would still be here, I just don't know. I do know I didn't want to end up like her. I've never had any problems with \"withdrawal symptoms\" when not drinking my kratom tea, and I don't feel the need to use it daily, only when I'm going to be fairly active around the house, or engage in activities with my grandkids. My life is my own now. I'm ever grateful for this plant. Please reconsider banning it. I have had no ill effects that I can speak of, and my bloodwork is done on a near monthly basis, and has looked pretty good, even throughout my cancer treatment. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this, and I hope it helps in some small way to curb making it illegal. I feel it would make matters worse if criminalized at this point. One more thing I'd like to add, and that is, I've gotten a bit nauseous if I drink more than one cup, so I do not. It does not get me \"high\" and I think it's nearly impossible to overdose on this gift from God. Once again, thank you for your time and looking into this matter.

I also have endometriosis, an incurable condition that causes intense pain on an intermittent basis.  For the past three years, kratom tea has helped me cope with the symptoms of this condition without the use of opiate painkillers.\n\nAddiction and drug abuse are rampant and escalating, which is just one reason why it's absolutely counterproductive to ban or restrict an herbal supplement that helps to support people's health and well-being, in turn reducing the use of prescription drugs.  Without kratom, which helps to soothe and ease the extremely painful symptoms I experience with endometriosis, my choices would be very limited.  I would have to either take prescription opiates, which I am adamantly opposed to using, or undergo a hysterectomy at the age of 34.  Aside from the negative effects on my health, a hysterectomy would also be emotionally devastating, since I'm hoping to have a second child.  I am not exaggerating when I say that kratom is what is preserving my fertility, albeit indirectly.\n\nThe existing research is overwhelmingly in favor of the safety of kratom.  While there have been some negative reports, those reports are remarkably few, especially when compared to the number of negative incidents involving everything from energy drinks to over-the-counter medications to other common herbal supplements.  Furthermore, nearly all of those negative incidents have involved at least one of the following factors: adulterated or contaminated products (https://academic.oup.com/jat/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/anatox/35.4.242); combining kratom with multiple other substances; and modified kratom products, meaning the plain leaf (normally crushed or powdered for use as a tea) was converted into a concentrated extract or tincture.\n\nThis does NOT mean that kratom should be banned or \"scheduled.\"  Instead, those who have studied kratom extensively are in favor of regulation that would require vendors to test their products for contamination and purity.  Indeed, the reputable vendors already do this.  We absolutely desire and recommend these kinds of quality-control measures, which could prevent the majority of negative experiences.  Most kratom is already sold in plain leaf form.  If we had regulation requiring that kratom products be sold only in plain leaf form, the sales of modified or concentrated products would be reduced even further.\n\nDr. Walter C. Prozialeck summarizes this quite clearly: \"After evaluating the literature, I can reach no other conclusion than, in pure herbal form, when taken at moderate doses of less than 10 to 15 g, pure leaf kratom appears to be relatively benign in the vast majority of users.\" (jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2588524)\n\nSurely we are beyond pretending that banning substances actually makes them disappear.  By \"scheduling\" or banning products, our government isn't actually controlling them; on the contrary, they are abdicating control.  They are simply handing the regulation of that product over to the black market.\n\nPeople have been using kratom responsibly for many years with no negative effects.  Making kratom a controlled substance would cause irreparable damage to me personally, to thousands of others like me, and to our economy with the loss millions of dollars in legitimate sales and commerce (https://www.botanical-education.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BEA-Economic-Impact-Report_V3-1.pdf).  Please don't rob us of our choices and our freedom to make our own decisions about how we manage and support our health.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18158","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jane Botvinnik","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me immensely since I discovered it two years ago.

Stokes and I reside in Alabama, one of the few states which has banned kratom.  All of my adult life I have suffered from Major Depressive Disorder, PTSD and accompanying anxiety disorders.  Despite the obstacles this has caused in my life, I managed to complete college, graduating summa cum laude from Auburn University.  But absolutely everything was such a struggle for me, and unfortunately I was in the small percentage of people who aren't helped by more traditional psychotropic medications. My psychiatrist decided to try me on an opiate. They often help when other medications don't, and were actually created for use against depression.  My doctor started me on a small dose of oxycodone and it worked for me. It was an epiphany; I understood for the FIRST time in my life why people get out of bed in the morning. There was a small problem for me that I felt a bit \"drugged.\" And also I knew that I would build up a tolerance to the medicine. All of this was about three years ago. And then for the first time in my life I heard of kratom and was made very curious. I told my doctor about it and he researched it thoroughly, as did I. What caught and held my interest was that this wasn't a drug that you got \"high\" from. In fact, all the literature made it clear that if one was looking to get \"high\" or \"get off\" or any other terms used by drug users, that one should look to other substances. So, with my doctor's consent, I ordered my first kratom. It worked for me better than I could have dreamed. I had all the positive effects that the oxycodone had provided, but didn't have any of that sense of being a bit \"drugged.\" I continued to use kratom, and the positive effects continued. Or, maybe it would be more accurate to say that my lack of negative effects continued: my depression and anxiety were controlled for the first time in my life. I had an ability to function that I had never experienced. I can't find words to express what this meant to me, to have lived an entire life colored with a nightmarish quality that never ceased, and to finally, finally, finally have the nightmare end. Of course I was heartbroken when Alabama decided to ban Kratom. My doctor put me back on oxycodone and it does help, but I don't like the feeling of being somewhat drugged. And I think of the millions of people who have died from opiate abuse, literally millions as I'm sure you know. And here is a substance that has allowed countless people to kick their heroin addiction or prescription drug addiction. And all without any effects of \"being high, or intoxicated.\" It doesn't cause any of those type feelings, and if you doubt this, I would suggest you try it. Coffee causes more of a noticeable change in consciousness. And most importantly, IT DOESN'T KILL. I believe maybe a handful of users have died, and those had other drugs in their system. I am one of the people who believe marijuana should be legalized; it is my fervent hope, especially after watching my husband die of the scourge that is cancer. But I understand that much is debatable in the question of marijuana legalization and there are pros and cons. Having used kratom and seen it's effects made me realize that it's remaining legal is a much more clear-cut decision than marijuana, and it is definitely safer in all ways than alcohol. I thank you sincerely for taking time to read of me and my life and considering my thoughts on the question of kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3834","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Terri Stokes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For your consideration - \n\nI am a 50+ year-old grandmother of 4.

It shocked me greatly when I learned of the DEA's proposed ban on this safe and beneficial herb.  There is no substantiated evidence that kratom poses any dangers whatsoever.  In fact, it's quite the opposite scenario.  Kratom has been helping people to discontinue their use of substances which are known to be harmful.  How can a helpful herb be misconstrued as being a threat?  It simply doesn't make any sense to list kratom among Schedule I drugs, as it does not fall into the categorical requirements necessary for such restrictions.  I have been using kratom for several years and have never felt the need to increase dosage, which would be reflective of an addiction.  Likewise, I've never experienced any cravings or withdrawal symptoms when I haven't taken kratom.  Although I am not in the medical field, it seems apparent that with further research kratom may be found to have clear medicinal benefits.  From personal experience, kratom has helped me to maintain balance with my clinically diagnosed bipolar condition.  Additionally, I used to struggle with alcohol abuse but kratom has helped me tremendously to maintain abstinence from drinking.  I do not know why kratom has been so helpful for people dealing with substance abuse issues, but the evidence to this effect is overwhelming.  Given the current opioid \"crisis\" in this country, and the DEA's clear directive to combat opioid addiction and abuse, it seems highly contradictory to ban an inexpensive and easily grown natural herb which aides in the depletion of opioid use.  My biggest fear is that because kratom is a natural supplement, and cannot be patented by big pharmaceutical companies, that the suggested Scheduling was a means to potentiate financial gains for companies looking to market pharmaceutically derived opiate substitutes.  This circumstance would be a gross misuse of authority and a direct violation of consumer's rights.  Kratom should continue to be legally available for anyone who chooses to utilize its benefits, and for scientists to further research its medical potential.  There is no valid proof that kratom poses any threat to those who use it.  I cannot believe that this is even an issue!  There have been well over 20,000 documented opioid related deaths in this country over the past year.  It's completely irrational, and also dangerous, to prevent excess to a harmless opioid alternative that is saving people's lives!!  \n\nSincerely,\nDaniel Bailey","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1158","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Bailey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me!

I think it commendable that the DEA is considering public comment on this plant derived material. I think Kratom in its natural unrefined form can act as a genuine pain killer without the addictive traits of other opiates; and while I certainly do not endorse the idea of any addictive behavior as being good for humanity, it would seem that a naturally occurring substance like Kratom could aid in opiate withdrawal and mitigation. My concern is that the FDA might also misjudge the benefits of a substance like this and error on the side of corporate privilege and regulation. Perhaps an issue like this might also be dealt with more judiciously on a State level. It also has to be said that people misuse and abuse commonplace devices and chemicals on a daily basis as they have the freedom to do so. Our social responsibility is to encourage and promote positive and life-affirming behavior. In summation I would say that the use of Kratom in its naturally occurring unrefined form could be of great benefit to opiate addicts as well as the medical establishment, without the stigma of contraband being attached.

I am an epileptic, and have been all my life and it has been quite a struggle. I have had many grand mal seizures throughout my life and it has really taken a toll on my body.  My back  being tweaked in positions it should never be in. My rotator cuffs both torn. One surgery already  that only half of half  of the ligament could be fixed.  Bad wrists, neck problems, leg and joint issues all over. Before my seizures were somewhat under control I have been deemed disabled. I was not able to work and never knew when another seizure was coming. I managed to get off disability when my seizures we're finally somewhat under control and my body healed. I have always researched alternative holistic remedies for epilepsy and seizures. I have to treat my body with respect and make sure I get proper nutrition, proper amount of sleep and try to keep my stress level as low as possible. I don't know if you are aware of all the positive benefits of Kratom or not. If not please research them before you read any further. It has many beneficial properties. It also is a holistic remedy for seizures. I don't know how to stress this enough but I have been able to reduce the levels of seizure medicine I take which is very expensive. It has given me a better quality of living and i have become more seizure free then I ever have in my life before Kratom was made illegal. I would only drink a cup of tea in the morning and i could function seizure free almost daily. More so than just taking prescribed  pharmaceuticals and as long as i eat properly. I do not abuse it and am not addicted to it. I had not been sick since I started using it before it was made illegal, due to some of the beneficial properties. This, along with UK neurology doctors have make such a difference in my life financially and physically for a better quality of living. I can hold a job now. I no longer require the help of the government and the  american people to pay for my disability. It saves money for everyone! It also saves my life. Everytime a person has a seizure, they permanently lose part of their memory, take time off their life due to body stress and lack of oxygen. They could aslo die at any time. It seems these days everyone knows someone or has a family member that has seizures. Please, for me and all the American people out there who have epilepsy or some form of seizures do not make this life-saving plant illegal. It makes no sense at all to make this a schedule 1 drug and put it up there with Heroin. It only takes common sense to understand the benefits of this plant. Please take a moment to read and understand the benefits of \"Kratom\". Again for me, children, and all the American people with health issues that this could benefit. Please understand and pass on this message for us. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

In the past, every preventative treatment and rescue treatment for my migraines and body pain that pharmaceutical companies have available did not work for me at all. Every form of alternative therapy/treatment produced little to no effect at reducing my pain (Chiropractic care, massage therapy, exercise, Acupuncture, etc.). The one and only thing that did work (in the past) was strong, narcotic pain medications. I have been on 80% of the different strong opiate pain medications currently on the market (both long acting and short acting opiates). While most did work to reduce my pain and make me functional (but never completely took my pain away), they came with a whole host of bad side effects: sedation, nausea, constipation, tiredness, rebound headaches, itching, and many more. The negative side effects took me from functional pain-wise to not functional because of side effects alone. Also, if you have to go without pain medication for any reason or length of time (if people are taking it daily like I was), the withdrawal side effects are HORRIBLE and unbearable (especially with the pain returning full force on top of withdrawal side effects)! I became fed up of dealing with those negative side effects and the risk of overdose and death, and I decided to try another alternative therapy. That's when I found Kratom. When I tried it, it worked in the same way as pain medication but with less side effects and it's an all natural, herbal therapy. Kratom is NOT an opiate pain medication. It is an herb that acts on opiate receptors despite the fact that it's not an opiate. Kratom's cousins are the coffee plant and Ginseng. I was amazed and totally stunned that I had not found this herbal medicine years ago!! I was able to stop taking traditional opiate pain medication completely and switch straight over to Kratom. There are different strains of Kratom that allow for more energy, focus, motivation, or more in the direction of relaxation, stress relief, better sleep, pain relief, etc. I loved (and love) that there were (are) so many different strains so I can mix and match to meet my needs for each individual day and each individual dose. Some days I need more energy, and some nights I need better sleep. With Kratom, that is exactly what I get - pain relief and many other health benefits! I have been taking Kratom for one year and six months now. When I found out that this miracle treatment I have been taking for 18 months was going to become illegal, I was horrified! Kratom is herbal and all natural. Why would a natural and safe herb be banned (when there's no risk of harm when it's taken correctly)? Are coffee and ginseng (Kratom's cousins) going to be made illegal, too? Kratom should NOT be banned or made illegal! The alternative to Kratom for me and for many others is strong opiate pain killers that have the potential for overdose and death. I CANNOT go back to taking pain pills (or other pain medication)! I NEED Kratom daily in order to function, so I'm not bedridden, and so I can be a productive member of society. I can't imagine what that will do to me if it does get taken away soon. My life would literally go out the window. Kratom, when taken correctly, has NO potential for overdose or death. Narcotic pain medication CAN kill you, and it already HAS killed many thousands of people from accidental overdoses. If Kratom does become illegal, I will have to return to opiate pain medication (if I am even able to find a doctor that will prescribe it, which is rare), and I'll hate every minute of the bad side effects that I get from them. Please keep Kratom legal for myself and for many other people like me who have found relief through Kratom (for various health issues or ailments). I need Kratom to remain available to me, and I really hope you don't take that away from me and from so many others! Please research this herbal medicine more and allow more time before making a misinformed decision that will cause suffering to thousands upon thousands of people who depend on it. This has the potential to successfully treat many ailments in the future better than any pill can, but in order to do that, it must remain legal and open to the public. Please do not ban Kratom. Don't make it illegal, and please don't schedule it either. It should remain available to everyone.

Kratom is an opioid and can help to maintain opiate cravings. If someone is going to relapse from heroin, it would be much safer if Kratom is available to that person as a non lethal alternative. Making Kratom illegal takes away that choice and increases the chances that someone will die.\n\nKratom is an non lethal alternative to lethal and addictive drugs. \nMany opiate addictions occur after one has been prescribed them for pain. \nIf Kratom works for a patient to manage pain, there is no reason they need to turn to a potentially lethal and addictive substance. \n\nIt is painfully obvious that Kratom is a multi million dollar industry. Yes, millions of dollars not going to the opiate drug companies who kill thousands every year. \n\nKratom is a plant. How can we actually claim to be a free people when we cannot even decide for ourselves which plants to grow and possess. \nIf you want Kratom illegal, you hate freedom.\n\nIt is time to abolish the DEA. The DEA's existence has, since its inception, been based on racist and misinformed drug policy. The DEA works to protect big business, capitalism and white supremacy at the expense of people's livelihood and health. Their decisions are not based on science or the good will of the people, but on maintaining a complacent, crony capitalist society ruled by a rich business elite.\n\nThe DEA serves to protect the power of the elite by attempting to limit the cognitive experiences of citizens by dictating how one can and cannot alter his consciousness. If the substance serves the capitalist paradigm (coffee) or aids in the complacency of the citizens (alcohol) then the substance is allowed. If the substance threatens the market of synthetic, patented drugs, then the substance is illegal (cannabis and soon to be Kratom). \n\nIf the substance allows an individual to experience paradigms of thought unconventional or disadvantageous to the the capitalist, white imperialist paradigm, then the substance is illegal. (Psychedelics & cannabis) The DEA is so concerned with this as to even limit the plants and organic molecules which a \"free\" man is allowed to cultivate, possess, and consume. In fact, every one of us is breaking this law, as we all possess dimethyltryptamine in our brains.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1149","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Rubin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom successfully weaned me off from taking opioids.

Kratom has saved the lives of many people I know. They have used it successfully to get off opiates and it comes at a monetary price that they can afford. This plant does not cause overdoses. The very worst that could happen is nausea and vomiting. This plant is also helpful for people who struggle with depression and anxiety and when used responsibly is not particularly addictive. We live in a society where alcohol is legal, which most definitely causes deaths due to drunk driving etc. Therefore a plant which by no means will cause deaths, should not be scheduled.

I do not use drugs and have no criminal record.  I have been a Kratom consumer for the past 4 years.  \n\n I first learned about Kratom through my brother.  He was a member of a group of Iraq and Afghanistan war vets who've  suffered greatly from PTSD.  He joined the group after losing many of his friends to suicide and drugs and feeling his depression deepen, he was afraid he would soon be on that path.   He told me of the success of Kratom amongst his group and with himself. \n\nMy father has been using Kratom to ease his Parkinson's symptoms.   Something that runs in my family.   When I begin to experience severe tremors and severe panic attacks I reached out to my doctor.   I was put on a multitude of different medicines, some making me worse and all having terrible side effects. When going off the medicine the symptoms would return far worse.  Eventually my work life begin to become effected.  My personal life was effected and my spirits were at an all time low. I tried a strict regimen of exercise and diet and it would help only so much.  The only thing that seemed to help was alcohol.  My family was concerned and told me about Kratom.   Compiled with a proper diet and exercise I've made great progress.  I have spent the past three years doing and accomplishing more than I have in the 15 before.  I went from drinking 3 glasses of wine a night to drinking no more than 3 a year.  \n\nThere seems to be a large degree of misinformation on Kratom from \"lazy journalism\" or internet articles written for shock value.  My family and myself have experienced no side effects or negative traits from Kratom use.  I've been in the best health in years and my check- ups are stellar.  Kratom does not get us \"high\". To many ignorant articles make comparison to opiates-  sorry but it's very far from the truth.  If anything Kratom has an effect no different than coffee meets a dose of NyQuil.   After a few times even this effect is subdued.  \n\nWhy the concern over Kratom? Those of us who are consumers are dumbfounded with this.  It has helped so many in such a positive way.  \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11035","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Phillip H","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I had multiple spinal surgeries in my mid 30s.

The effects are mild, the comparison to morphine are way off base, and side affects are minimal to non-existent. All the news stories show packaging that looks like bath salts & spice which is misleading. I wouldn't trust them either, because it's old, poor quality, and most likely mixed with synthetic poison. No one's death has been attributed to pure  Kratom alone, usually there's a host of \"legal\" pharmaceutical in their system. It also has a natural ceiling affect, you just feel sick & throw up; No one is trying to push their limits with this plant for that very reason.\n\nI personally feel that 18+, and some quality control is all this plant needs. If this plant is banned people will find another alternative whether it be returning to drugs, pharmaceuticals, or alcohol. It will have enormous ramifications, and the consequences should lie solely on the agency that banned it.

Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, commonly known as Kratom, seems potentially safer than opiates and should be available at least by prescription for treatment of chronic pain.  Research and education will lead to safer use of Kratom.  Prohibition of this potential therapeutic will only increase perscription opiate use (which we know leads to addiction in a not-insignifcant porportion of patients), lead to wasted tax money on expansion of the war on drugs, and criminalize users of Kraton who are trying to avoid opiate use.  If there is a real therapeutic use, this drug should be regulated by the FDA like any other medication to ensure safe and effective dosing.  Prohibition is not a solution; let's learn more and make an educated decision!

I am 59 yrs old. I suffer from degenerative disc disease, osteoarthritis,  diabetes, cardiovascular disease and have had five surgeries.  I have had wrist dead bone removed, 2 fusions on my cervical spine from L2-L7, lumbar fusion from L2-S1 and a complete knee replacement. All of these surgeries since 2009. 28th the lower back fusion just one yr ago. The fusion is not complete and so far is a failed fusion. The bone is not growing over the surgery area. I love in constant pain. Even tho these surgeries have help keep me walking I can no longer work. I cannot sit or stand for very long as the pain is debilitating. I have depended on opiate pain meds for close to ten yrs along with other drugs for other medical illnesses. I have always made sure to take them as prescribed and under the care of a pain management Dr. I decided to start looking for something more natural to help stop or at least control my pain. That is when I found Kratom. I take one to two teaspoons a day and that is all it takes. It takes the edge off of my pain and I am able to function better physically. It also has helped me keep from feeling depressed.  I have been using it for about 8 months. It has been a God send. I have gotten off of pain meds for a month at a time at different times during those 8 months. I am not dependent on the opiates anymore. When I would run short on my pain meds because when I had flare ups of pain I took more pain meds. Kratom literally stops all withdrawal effects from not having the pain meds. It helps so much that is has become a daily routine to take kratom.  It truly is a natural miracle of nature. I have never felt I needed more than I take now. I have not had any negative side effects or withdrawal from Kratom. It works without the dangers of using opiates. I don't get a \"high\" feeling. I just feel good and can function better and more focused. If the DEA makes Kratom a drug it will take away my quality of life. I still take opiate pain meds only if my pain levelvgoes up to an 8-10 level which it does occasionally. I am a responsible person and take all my meds as scripted. The opiates have increased at times over the yrs. I also have found when I don't take the opiates my joint pain and morning aches go away.  Kratom has helped give me my life back. Please do not take that away from me. It is so much healthier, in my opinion as a user, than opiate pain meds. The long term use of pain meds can be crippling. I am not addicted but am dependent on them and with Kratom that dependency is gone. Please keep it legal. So many success stories I have read.

How many death directly from kratom ? .. None . How many deaths from alcohol or perscriptions a year ? I'll leave it at that . Please don't ban this plant it has changed my life and gotten me off of pain medications . It has a lot potential to get people off of drugs., I've seen it many times now.

However, I have never used anything so safe and profoundly beneficial as kratom has proven itself to be. We have used it nearly every day for a year, and the benefits to both myself and my wife have been life-changing. I had taken early retirement due to knee and hip pain, but have since been able to start working again, as well as being more active as a father to my young sons.\n\nThe mood stabilization of kratom has also been very helpful in keeping us off antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication. My wife suffers from Lyme disease, and I have watched her transition from suffering through seizures and high anxiety, terrible body pain, and insomnia to now living a full and active life again. I can't stress enough how much of a blessing kratom has been to me and my family. Please don't take this necessary and safe herb away from the American public, as pure unadulterated kratom has proven to be safe and effective.

I suffered a terrible fall 20 years ago and was prescribed opiates, neurological drugs and antidepressants over the course of a decade.  I was given Fentanyl patches after being diagnosed with severe fibromyalgia and nerve damage.  None of those drugs did much to releive my pain and I ended up with a miserable cycle of opiate addiction.  I don't know what was worse, the fibromyalgia symptoms or the pain that comes from opiate use and opiate withdrawal.  A few years ago I saw a youtube video where a man kicked heroin using kratom tea.  Since then his life has turned around.  I thought, if it works for him it cld work for me.\n\nI had heard about Seboxen and Methodon as the only pharmaceutical treatment for withdrawal but they are just as addictive as opiates and the withdrawal is just as bad in many people's experience.  \n\nI decided to try kratom tea.\n\nI slowly decreased the use of the Fentanyl patch as much as I cld stand.  Then I started drinking the tea.  It helped me sooo much with the hot and cold flashes, the shakes, the anxiety. I took a few weeks for me to feel free of withdrawal symptoms and I was overjoyed.  \n\nI also experienced that I no longer wanted coffee in the morning and that my lifelong battle with anxiety attacks had decreased.  The fibromyalgia is not gone but I am so much better now.  I like my kratom tea like other people like their coffee.  \n\nI also have several friends who are Vietnam Veterans who have found relief from the terrible side effects they had on multiple pharmaceutical cocktails they were prescribed and now all they do is drink kratom tea instead.  \n\nPlease DO NOT BAN kratom tea.

This is the most important message I have ever wrote. Peoples quality of life and mortality are at stake here. I spent 15 years suffering beyond belief with zero help from my doctors. I tried to get help and they turned me away many times. The first time they told me that I should be on oxycontin or morphine, but because of my age they did not want to make me a chronic pain patient, and left me wishing I was dead because of how much I was hurting. I am a disabled veteran who is battling severe pain from a horrible car accident, PTSD, arthritus, social anxiety borderline panic disorder, epilepsy, and something they can't even figure out that makes every inch of my body hurt non stop. When you have an illness they can't even find in a time when opiate abuse is out of control as a young man getting pain medication is impossible where I live and you either have to find relief on your own or try not to kill yourself because your life is endless torture. I can't even write this without crying because I am suffering so bad. I am expected to love on close to $20 per day for social security so I can't even afford the medication I need, but at least I get some days of relief. My doctors solution to my problems they can't figure out was to misdiagnose me and put me on so many pills I was bed ridden and having seizures daily. Doctors are failing people like me and if I was not religious I probably would have killed myself a long time ago, but I have faith I will get better. Please do not give us a death sentence or take away the only thing making our quality of life bearable. God put these plants on the earth for people suffering and nobody should just destroy peoples lives that are hard enough already. My body responds well to natural substances, but these chemicals from the docotor have side effects that are very hard on very ill people like myself. If you decide to go through with banning this harmless God given medication you will be directly killing and destroying thousands of lives and I beg you to reconsider. I have got to a point in my life where I will survive with or without it but I was not always this strong and many others are not. I have the utmost respect for you. I was military police and I love my country and support law enforcement. Please consider that ther are many people like me who are not trying to get high and do not use recreational drugs. I am suffering with nowhere to turn. I had to be my own doctor and using natural herbs I feel my life has been saved. I am scared and helpless and my quality of life is in your hands now. Please do not send me back to the horrible situation I was in for the last 15 years. Imagine suffering 15 years having the feeling liek you have a flu that never goes away with pain from head to toe after having shattered your hip and leg getting hit by a truck on my driver side door going about 55 mph. It feels to me like nobody cares about us and I have been forgotten and left to die. I would be homeless if I didn't have people helping me like many other disabled and veterans. We have enough on our plates without having a medication that replaced 15 pills that were destroying my liver and body just snatched away for no good reason. I know there will be some people who abuse it, but people abuse glue by sniffing it and we do not punish everyone who uses glue because of a small amount of fools. It has and will never kill anyone who is not on a coctail of other deadly chemicals. I will respect whatever choice you make on this, and I know God will take vare of me no matter what, but I worry about everybody else who is not mentally strong as I have just recently achieved. The truth of it is that alcohol and cigarettes are way more dangerous and deadly but those are ignored while recreational and not a medicine helping the most unfortunate disabled people. Kratom never killed anyone from lung cancer or psorosis of the liver. It never made someone beat thier wive or hurt anyone. Kratom has a slight euphoria and makes you feel good, but nothing close to the pills from the doctor that you can overdose on or be high on.  Tylonol is more dangerous and would kill you faster. I know your agency is not out to hurt us and you have already put a hold on this ban. The facts will show that the ban is a bad idea and would be a law that helps nobody and hurts or kills thousands. I am confident you would not make a decision like that and I thank you for taking time to reconsider it. You holding off on the ban and listening to our stories really means a lot to me as not many people or institutions care about the unfortunate these days. God bless you all.  I will pray for your safety out in the field and pray for God to guide you to make the right decision.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1534","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Scott Chace","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have suffered from debilitating endometriosis for years. I didn't want to be on pain meds anymore, as they were making me into a zombie, and I did not want to be addicted to anything. When I found Kratom, I was able to immediately stop the opiates, and overnight. No chaos, no drama, no issues at all. A teaspoon in the morning, and one mid afternoon, and I had my quality of life back. \n\nFast forward to later years, and it also helped me tremendously, when I had to face the illness and loss of my mother in 2015. There was much upheaval in our lives that even included a move out of state. If I had not been able to manage my pain and health with kratom, I don't know where I'd be right now. \n\nI have used Kratom with NO problem or issue at all for 5 years. While there is a sense of well being, and it can uplift the mood, it is SO mild and the thought of it being considered evil or dangerous is honestly ridiculous. The DEA keeps citing deaths involving Kratom. To my knowledge, every single death involved OTHER substances that were indeed dangerous, and not the Kratom itself. \n\nI am in extreme fear to think of how the prisons will fill up with people like me, who are not criminals or druggies (I don't even smoke or drink). So many of us have quietly lived our lives, with Kratom. The absolute destruction this will bring to good people, should be a crime itself.\n\nIt is horrifying to see the government so willing to gamble with the lives of so many, but I am grateful for this comment period and the chance to be heard. Kratom is safe. The fact that the emergency rooms are not filled to the brim with those of us who have used it, for a long time, should speak loudly.\n\nI am fully prepared to face my future without kratom, as I refuse to become a felon over committing no actual crime than managing my own pain with a plant related to coffee. But it is my sincere hope and prayer that common sense will prevail, as the truth about Kratom, and all it has done to help people suffering, will shine through and lead your decision in this important matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5553","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Darlanne Knapp","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Brittany Chipman,  I am a 30 year old single mother of 2 amazing girls.

I was introduced to Heroin.  My life very quickly spiraled out of control,  this drug turned me into a desperate,  selfish, lying, theif of a monster.  With in a few short months I became someone I despise,  I lost my job,  I lost my home, I lost my dog,  I became a felon that was featured on the front page of newspapers and on the six o'clock news,  and I almost my children,  who are my reason for existence.  This is very hard to tell my story in detail.  I do not live that way,  I don't know the woman I was at that time.  It's hard for me to even fathom that that was me.  I eventually ended up on Suboxin, and that was no different as far as I am concerned.  $500 a month just to feel like I wasnt dying,  although by this time I surely wanted to.

My girls and I are now  members of our local church,  I manage the most successful restaurant in my area,  my children are honor role exceptional students who are succeeding in every way,  my family is proud of me,  I am well known in my community for good things, for helping others and not for the awful past I was once known by.  This is just my Kratom story but there 100's of thousands just like mine.  4 years clean from all prescription and non prescription opiates and managing my symptoms and chronic pain with the help of this wonder plant,  while maintaining a awesome life I am so proud to call mine.

I work as a manager and head of maintenance. I have a degree in engineering from Penn State Behrend. For the record, I am fully against scheduling of Kratom by the DEA. I have been using Kratom for two years now. I use it after a physically-demanding day at work to help me relax. I also have chronic depression and social anxiety, which I've had since early highschool. I have found a personal correlation between the time I was in a terrible car accident in 2006 which caused a tooth to die and also the herniation of my third lumbar in my spine. I have been forced to use everything ranging from opioids, muscle relaxers, and pain creams to counteract the severe physical problems and discomfort associated with the accident. I stopped using pain pills due to nausea and disorientation, which made it extremely difficult for me to do my job. I began researching alternatives to SSRI's and pain medications and concluded that Kratom was the safest to test run. I have since been alleviated of my social anxiety to a point that I am not confined to my home after work and able to work and interact more easily/comfortably with my co-workers. Furthermore, I have been able to move more easily and have a more comfortable range of motion since beginning my use of Kratom. I have not noticed any nausea as a result of this use, either. It is the most beneficial substance I have come to use as a result of my car accident. If you are truly representatives of the people, you will reflect our views and wishes to keep Kratom unscheduled. This is what the people commenting her want. These experiences and benefits I've mentioned are my personal experience and opinions. Do the right thing, please, and represent the interests of the people that give you the authority you have. Please do not schedule Kratom among the incredibly DEADLY and unforgiving substances such as heroine. I am familiar with the damage of scheduled drugs as I work in the funeral industry.

I get that the Registry exists to keep our citizens safe from dangerous drugs like Bath Salts, or to keep things like Heroin out of the hands of children. These things are public health hazards. Deadly. Made for no other purpose than to intoxicate and addict the populace.\n\nKratom is none of these things. The people that call Poison Control and claim that they overdosed on Kratom are the same people that have panic attacks from smoking marijuana, or from drinking too much alcohol. Kratom has never, and so long as it remains unadulterated, WILL never kill or harm a user. We have centuries of empirical evidence as to its benign nature from the peoples of Southeast Asia who use it daily as a medicine, as a mild stimulant (it is closely related to the coffee family) and in religious ceremonies. \n\nUnlike alcohol and other legal drugs, Kratom doesn't make you \"high.\" It doesn't give you a \"buzz.\" It doesn't alter your conscience. It can promote a sense of relaxation and is very effective as a pain killer. I personally use it for the latter. After years on prescription pain killers, my tolerance was such that with the amount of pills I took, my liver would have eventually given out on me. Thank GOD for Kratom.\n\nIf you shortsightedly banish Kratom to the netherworld of illegal opiates, you will see an uptake in fatal overdoses, of an amount unlike any the civilized world has ever known. We're already in the throes of an epidemic of narcotic drug abuse; it would seem to reason that your agency would PROMOTE an all natural, safe alternative to such drugs rather than hinder its use.

Including fibromyalgia. I found out about Kratom online, studying about it I tried it 2 years ago.I was on 7 different medications, including narcotic pain medicine which I beacame addicted to. Kratom allowed me to go off of everything, & I don't even have to take it everyday.  I've never felt withdrawal with it as I did when I ran out of my narcotic pain medicine.  My whole life has changed, and now I am able to function, be a wife and mother. I am so afraid I will have to go back on addicting medicine if you make this illegal. I don't want to, & maybe it makes no sense for someone to go back to it, but if I can't take Kratom, my options are to either be in chronic constant pain, with depression and anxiety or take addictive medicines. Kratom helps me with all these issues with hardly any side effects.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21270","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shelley Osenbaugh","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think sometime we forget what Our wonderful plant is here for this day 2 years ago I found kradom it's my birthday and I had everything ready I was going to kill myself letters was wrote to the people I loved my will was done clothes was out so I would be nice looking when they found me my husband had brought some Kradom from ahead shop I was in a lot of pain that am so I said what did I have to lose wow that changed my life it picked me up and helped me control my pain I put those letters away they are still in that draw waiting.

Drug and Alcohol related deaths happen every single day.  Alcohol alone is so dangerous and destructive that I question why that is legal.

The plant known as kratom has a long history of human use, with a relative scarcity of health issues presented. The potential therapeutic and medicinal  properties in the relief of opioid addiction are too compelling to ignore. Those effects deserve further medical study. Schedule I restrictions are far too limiting on research, preventing us from understanding the mechanisms by which this chemical interacts with the human body. \n\nIt is my suspicion that, upon further subsequent study, it will be found that the reported fatalities and other harmful reactions to mitragynine have been exceptional rather than commonplace. If the goal of restricting legal access to such a substance is truly to act in the best interests of the public, we should not react in ignorance and fear by banning use of such substances without understanding them. Instead, the government should see it as their mandate to protect the people by pushing efforts forward in intense study of beneficial and detrimental effects, and only then acting based on accurate knowledge. \n\nI urge the DEA to consider studies such as the following:\n\n Kruegel AC, Gassaway MM, Kapoor A, Vradi A, Majumdar S, Filizola M, Javitch JA, Sames D. \nSynthetic and Receptor Signaling Explorations of the Mitragyna Alkaloids: Mitragynine as an Atypical Molecular Framework for Opioid Receptor Modulators. \nJ Am Chem Soc. 2016 Jun 01;138(21):6754-64.\n\nand \n\n Singh D, Narayanan S, Vicknasingam B. \nTraditional and non-traditional uses of Mitragynine (Kratom): A survey of the literature. \nBrain Res Bull. 2016 May 28;.\n\nThese recent studies are the kind of thing we should pursue, until such time that conclusive studies establish a credible and genuine threat to the wellbeing of the public. If we as a country and culture are willing to allow individuals to choose to engage in tobacco use, despite the known harmful effects of smoking and addictive properties of nicotene, then it stands to reason that a substance such as kratom (which has narrow usage and beneficial properties) deserves similar treatment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14927","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ipsa Scientia Potestas Est","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used kratom to ween my self off drugs of all kinds.

I believe there is a need for further research into the beneficial qualities of this substance. The leaf of Mitragyna Speciosa Korth appear to contain alkaloids which have beneficial effects for many medical conditions. The limited research available suggests that the beneficial effects of this plant are not a result of any single alkaloid, but are due to the cumulative effects of the naturally occurring combination. There is a need and an opportunity for more research into the medical potential of this plant which would be severely curtailed by the proposed entry in Schedule 1. There are also many testimonials of chronic pain patients who have experienced an improved quality of life due to this plant and its unique alkaloid profile. I would also like to clarify that the vast majority of deaths involving Kratom were due to a single criminal action, the adulteration of the brand Krypton Kratom with the chemical O-Desmethyltramadol, and that several others were Polydrug combinations which would likely have been fatal regardless of Kratom ingestion. There has not been a single death backed by forensic evidence that Kratom or the alkaloids in Kratom were the specific cause of death. There are documented side effects as with any substance. I believe that allowing this plant and/or it's component alkaloids to be scheduled at this time would be a disservice to millions of American citizens who could benefit from further research and development of medical applications.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4239","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom became an important dietary supplement for me about 6 years ago, at that time I was researching for something that could help with stress and anxiety, without the side effects of prescription medications.

My pain was real and a lot of the time I couldn't stand on my own two feet for too long unfortunately. But instead of being sent to a back doctor I was sent to pain management. Physical therapy could have greatly helped my condition. At 23 years old I didn't really understand what pain management was even when they laid out the rules to me. For about four months I was fine on the medications I was on. The pain medicine helped and I didn't even use the muscle relaxers. However, my body began to grow used to the medicine and I needed more with each dose to feel the pain relieving effects. The first time I went to the hospital it was because of a fall that happened when I was outside on my stairs. I didn't tell them I was on pain medicine from a PM doctor because I wanted more pain medication. This became a slippery slope that landed me in the ER a lot. \n\nFor about 2 years I continued this behavior even after my PM doctor found out and kicked me out of his practice. I was dangerously addicted to the pain medicine. It took over my life and when I wasn't able to have pain medicine I was a mess. I couldn't cope with the way I felt or didn't feel. When finally it completely destroyed the relationship between me and my mom enough that she told me to get help or leave I realized that my life wasn't my own anymore. The pain medicine controlled me. \n\nI went to a rehab facility in Reseda California called the Discovery House. And it was a good place to be at first. They were helpful and firm about getting me up off of my feet. But, the first time I took suboxone which is a government approved medicine to help with coming off of pain medicine it felt like I got high off of 30 percocet pills. I got violently sick to my stomach which lasted for about 12 hours. And when I came off of the suboxone a few weeks later I went through the worst withdrawal I could imagine. My skin hurt when air would touch it, my whole entire body was aching, and the only relief I ever got was sitting in the sun. Eventually I was released from the rehab, but at the worst time possible. I had a management position in the area at a retail shop in a mall and the rehab people could no longer house me. My mom did not want me home yet because she wasn't comfortable with that idea and she had moved. So I was forced to live with a friend and that situation went from okay to bad very quickly. Within a few days of being there I was already relapsing and by the time I left I was back on pain medicine because of the stress. Thankfully I went and lived with my older sister in Oakland. She helped me get on my feet again and taught me how to be a very responsible woman. I got two jobs and moved into my first place by myself. But even with two jobs I couldn't afford a $700 a month room and I ended up going to live with my brother and his girlfriend in Rancho Cordova. I again relapsed when I found pain medicine in their bathroom and finally I got to go home to my mom. \n\nI was still in the middle of a relapse unfortunately and took more pain medicine that I had at her house from my previous surgeries. But, it was then at this point that I tried Kratom. It took more than a few purchases of this magical herb for me to find the one that worked the best. When I did find the one that worked the best for me it was like such relief to find something that worked and helped. My cravings were gone, and yet the energy that I loved from taking pain medicine I got from Kratom. It made me feel better emotional and sometimes physically. \n\nHowever I did end up having to go back on pain medicine due to endometriosis that had been diagnosed two years back. I was on pain medicine for about a month and a half before my surgery. I had a partial hysterectomy and the pain was really bad after surgery. I ended up going back onto suboxone to try and ease coming off the pain medicine, but I again went through the WORST withdrawal that my mom now had to witness. She watched me through agony as I got off suboxone. And finally, after moving to Idaho from Mississippi I started to use Kratom on a weekly basis. Since then I've noticed that I don't want to use pain medicine anymore when I'm on the Kratom. It helps my mood, my energy levels, my physical state so that I can be the best version of myself. \n\nThis plant is not a danger to anyone by itself. The worst side effect I've ever seen is headaches or nausea. You have taken measures that removed it from suppliers online and now I'm trying to bear through everyday without the one thing that helps me through. Its a safe herb and its a miracle for me and people like me. This country is under attack by opiate addiction and the one herb that has proven to help us you want to remove. This will hurt more people than cause it good. I hope that by reading my story you come to understand why this herb is so important to people all over this nation.

From pain medication to medications for PTSD, and depression. She has been on suboxone for the last 6 years before we researched kratom. Before suboxone it was many other medications.. After a while they quit working and she was in pain all the time, and her quality of life was heartbreaking. She has 2 children. We discovered that making one glass of kratom tea a day helped her tremendously, and she was able to get off all the addictive medications and control her ailments. She now is able to play with her children. I ask you to consider this comment about my family when you decide to ban kratom or scheldule it (our daughter is and never has been a criminal), and think of how its going to affect those babys, us (her parents) and everyone else that loves her dearly. Kratom is just a natural plant, and she never has any nasty side effects from it. And we are blessed to find something that actually works for her. I understand that if more people are using kratom that the pharma industry will loose money, but the meds she was getting from them were killing her basically, but she had no choice at the time.. Lets make this about helping people, and not money and do the right thing for a change. God Bless and I will be praying that my daughter doesn't have to go backwards on her health, she's lucky to be alive today considering the amounts of medicatons she was prescribed before.

Nearly two years ago i decided to research botanical alternatives for anxiety relief. Upon tedious amounts of research i discovered Kratom.  After about a month or so i decided to order. To my suprise, kratom really didn't help me with anxiety relief, it did however ease my pain from degenerative disc disease and herniated disc. At a previous time i was prescribed multiple medications to treat my ailments, all of which left me with a low quality of life. Between the pain medications and anxiety medications, i could not function normally. I made the decision to suffer through my days unmedicated because though i was in pain and dealing with an extreme amount of anxiety, unmedicated was some what better.  While i still choose to suffer through my anxiety, kratom has provided me with a better quality of life. I wake up in pain everyday, after a cup of Kratom tea and i feel better and can go about my daily activities with little to no discomfort. If this botanical were to become illegal, i would no doubt begin to struggle to get through my work day, normal activity would become much harder to deal with. I beg you to reconsider this legal action, as the results would be detrimental to so many lives. Kratom can provide a better quality of life to so many suffering from chronic pain and opiod addiction. Please do not prohibit something so very helpful to so very many people.

I strongly oppose the addition of this herbal supplement to the list of Schedule I drugs that include heroin and LSD.  Kratom is nothing like those substances. It smells like tea!  I began using it this past summer when someone in a research group I was in mentioned they used it for pain.  I have had chonic back and neck pain for some time;  I did some quick research and had some kratom delivered to my door.  It took a bit of responsible experimentation, but I finally got my dosage right.  I only take a 1/2 tsp blend in the morning and about 3/4 tsp at night.  I have never had the back pain diagnosed, but that 1/2 tsp makes it disappear for hours.  I have been prescribed clonazepam for anxiety- I have a husband with pancreatic cancer and a daughter with a lot of legal problems.  I had no idea kratom would work to alleviate anxiety, but it seems to do just that.  I also had no idea it would decrease my desire for alcohol, but thankfully, it seems to do that as well.  All of these effects occur, for me, on a sub-perceptual level;  I didn't realize I was pain free until the kratom wore off late in the afternoon and the pain came back.  I have had to do my job in spite of some bad news on my mind more than once this year, and some aspect of this kratom seems to help me focus on the task at hand and not let my brain wander down a sad rabbit hole.  As I said, I am an elementary school librarian- I take a small dose right before I leave for work.  If this was as bad as heroin or LSD, would I be able to read and converse with little people and parents within an hour of ingestion?  NO!  I feel like this herb makes me a better person somehow.  I'm just . . .nicer.  It's not addicting.  I have run out the door without it a couple of times, and the only thing that happens is the pain returns.  I don't pretend to know how it works.  That's why we need research.  I hope you'll consider research over a ban.  This herb can help a lot of people.  It has certainly helped me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4803","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laura Crumhorn","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not classify any compounds from Mitragyna speciosa, or Kratom.

I started using because of deep depression that wasn't getting the right treatment from doctors and pills.  KRATOM has helped support my ability to stay clean from opiates. Since I started taking Kratom a year ago, my quality of life has improved. Before that I was struggling with staying clean. I'm balanced again and the urge to use has deminished. It's unbelievable how many addicts didn't know about this product before the possible ban. KRATOM has saved lives! It has helped save mine! It's a safe treatment with a ceiling level. You don't get high, but it does offer relief. If you take too much the worst that has happened is nausea. I refuse to be put on toxic suboxen. Suboxone is an addiction in itself. The shot that's available might take away the ability to get high, but it does NOT take away the urge and longing for relief. People continue to try to use when they're on the shot because the relief just isn't there. Counting down the days when it might wear off and give you the window to take matters into your own hands. I have not used Heroin or pills or had the need to since I started taking KRATOM twice a day. 10 grams total for the day. This is my body, I should be allowed to use a leaf from a tree to help with my depression and anxiety. God knows I've tried everything else legal and illegal.  If this becomes regulated though, other users will lose the chance to save themselves. Not everyone wants to turn to a doctor for help. Addicts aren't happy to be addicts, it's shameful, and telling someone is the hardest part.  Not everyone has the money to see a doctor for it either. Please keep this available to the public.

I just felt that I should comment on the kratm situation while I have the chance to.  I have used it in the past to deal with chronic pain (severe sciatica) And have found it very useful in dealing with that pain, as a substitution for the infinitely more addictive and destructive opioid painkillers.  I don't currently use it and feel no need to or cravings for it.  It also at the time helped me to overcome an intense alcohol addiction that was beginning to take hold of my life.  It seems to be counterintuitive to ban kratom if the DEA is so worried about the opioid epidemic, as kratom is an excellent tool in combating opioid addictions, as well as others.  One could argue that kratom is a \"gateway drug\" to opioids, but this argument is absurd, there are no studies to back it up, and it is just based on assumption and conjecture.  People who use kratom are using it because they specifically do not want to use powerful prescription opioids.  I hope you will reconsider scheduling kratom, as it has overwhelmingly impacted people's lives in positive ways.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3262","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alex Penrose","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing this in the hopes that a mother will be on the receiving end. I will keep it short and sweet. Kratom has saved my life. I was run over by an SUV while walking on the sidewalk many, many years ago. I was gravely injured. I spent the better part of 7 years in the hospital fighting a chronic staph infection due to a compound fracture. I was brought into surgery to amputate my leg twice. I wanted to die. I developed a dangerous physical dependence on the pain medications prescribed to me, but had little to no relief from my pain. My life was in a very ugly downward spiral. I was on 80-120 mgs of Percocet every day. Until I discovered Kratom. Kratom helps with my pain a great deal without making me feel drugged, or high. I can actually function as a person. I'm so afraid of losing what I have gained from Kratom if it is banned. Right now I am able to take care of myself, my mother who has leukemia (CML), my grandmother who has esophageal cancer stage 4, and my grandfather who has pulmonary disease. Without Kratom I would not be able to care for them. Kratom has allowed me to become a better person, a better mother, daughter, granddaughter, etc. I'm terrified to think of where I will be, where my family will be, if it is banned.

I took them for 4 years just to get relief from pain. at this time I had a wife, 2 wonderful step kids as well as my own daughter. my addiction to the Dr prescribed drugs took over my life. I had to plan my life and activities around the drugs. I ended up loosing my house, my job, my family all because a dr said I needed to take these drugs.. one day my Dr could not fill my prescription because he was in Jail... since my dr was out of the picture I started doing heroin. heroin was cheep and it filled the gap that prescription drugs left. I am in no way proud of this... I was raised in a great environment with no exposures to any drugs what so ever... but I was addicted to prescription drugs and I needed to feel pain relief.. I went through 3 weeks of withdraws and ended up in the hospital. almost died from this because I was taking 300 qty 30 mil of pills a month along with heroin to just get by for a day.. long story short, a friend suggested to try Kratom. as soon as I was able to drive and just get out of bed I went to get some kratom. The 2nd day on kratom I was able to walk, talk, and function as a human. I started buying kratom in 2010 after loosing my entire life to prescription drugs. since 2011 I have gone back to school, developed friendships, landed my dream job and my life is back on track. of course my heart still hurts from the lose of my family.. But at least now I am well respected and I manage a team of 10 people in a multi Billion dollar company. I know in my heart that what I am doing now is what God wanted me to do and if there is even a chance of not being able to buy my Kratom Tea I may fall back into the shit cycle I was in back in the day. one more thing I am happy to disclose, growing up I have tried every drug on this planet... no drugs have effected my life in a negative way as prescription drugs. one the same note, no drugs I have ever had have made as positive impact on my life as KRATOM..... if you would like to talk to me please feel free to call me at 3034199157. I will support people getting their lives back together for the rest of my life. Life is so very short, you must make the best of it each and every day.

I oppose the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.\n\nMy story is as follows. Several years ago, shortly after the birth of my son, I  began to develop  pain in my check, neck, hip and back.  Thanks to inheriting arthritis and joint issues from my mothers side of the family, gradually the pain increased, then increased some more.  The pain made sleep next to impossible and exercise was completely impossible.  When my son turned one, I was up to 320 lbs from 225, I slept maybe 4 hours a night, and was essentially a miserable human being.  \n\nDuring this year, when I did attempt to treat this pain, the medicine made things worse.  Anti-inflammatory medicine led to severe gastrointestinal issues which led to me taking about a hundred dollars of antacids a month.  I was also given prescription pain medicine (hydrocodone) which helped the pain but left me inebriated making work and interaction with my child impossible.\n\nI also drank, a lot.  I am not proud of this but when you feel like I did you want to feel pretty much any other way possible.  \n\nIn fear of my lifer and life, I went in search of something else to help.  I went to the internet where I discovered kratom. I bought some, tried it and honestly felt better than I had in years.  My pain wasn't gone, but it was manageable.  The best part was I was clear headed.  I didn't feel \"high\", more like I had a cup of coffee minus the jitters.  After a week of using a small dose, I started my life over.  I began to exercise, which I didn't think possible.  I could play with my son.  Literally play, not just lay on the floor while trying to avoid not getting jumped on.  \n\nAfter a year I was down to 260 lbs.  Not perfect, but in a state where I didn't need daily dosages of anything - no kratom, pills, alcohol, or coffee.  I felt good. \n\nNow that life was pain lessened (not free because I doubt that is possible) my wife and I were able to give my son a sister.  Something we wanted to do right after he turned one but had to wait three additional years to due thanks to how I felt.  \n\nAt this point ,I save kratom for a maybe 6-8 times a week when pain starts taking its toll on me.  The rest of the time I can just \"grin and bear it\" but the thought of it being illegal is very frightening to me. I am not saying kratom is responsible for my life change, but without it, I don't think that first week of the gym would have happened.  Right now there are many people suffering like I was and if kratom is added to the schedule 1 list, they might not have that catalyst to change either.  \n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20196","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ian Seniff","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Reading these comments really breaks my heart. It is especially sad seeing some of the negative comments referring to users as junkies and of the like. The healthcare community has slowly realized that addiction is a mental disorder and not a moral failure. I, like many others on here, have discovered Kratom to help me stay off opiates. Consider all of the positive comments and stories on how it saved lives. There are many cultures that have used Kratom for centuries. Like everything else, there are positives and negatives to taking it. In a day where our country faces an enormous epidemic, taking away natural choices for pain relief is incredibly shortsighted and goes against the healthcare community. There is enough for the regulators to deal with in the illegal department. Read these comments and do the right thing. Keep Kratom Legal.

I am hoping this actually reaches a person and does not get lost on some internet server somewhere. Kratom has become a \"life saver\" for me. I have 2 herniated discs in my neck and have pain from this just about every day. I went the traditional route first through specialist doctors and worked my way up to a Pain Management doctor. I followed their advice and prescriptions only to find myself eating pill after pill often more than prescribed. You get to a point where you don't even remember how many you have had for the day so you take another just in case.. \n  After some time this caused major issues with my wife so I would pledge to not go back to the doctor. I then suffered HORRIBLE withdrawals and then would be off meds for a period of time. This would only last a couple months, then it was back to the doctor again for more pills but it will be different this time. Wrong! It was not different and it strained my relationship with my wife to the breaking point. I got fat, stopped exercising, could not perform sexually and was in a bad mood most days. I almost lost my wife and kids. She deserves better than a pill head addict. So I got off the meds, for good this time knowing I was making a deal that would force me to be in pain. Neck pain is better than losing my family no matter how severe. \n I finally found Kratom looking for alternatives to pills and it seems to serve as a REAL solution to my problem. I am not \"high\" anymore but I am also not in pain when I take it. I have more energy to play with my kids and I am in a better mood. I can dose once in the morning and feel fine for most of the day, it knocks the pain down at least 80%. I would venture to say it is a more powerful pain reliever than the oxycodone I was on before but without all of the bad side effects. All of my negative side effects listed above are gone and I am happy to say that my relationship with my wife is back to being great again. Best of all, I have zero desire to go back to the doctor or take pills again. \n I really hope this plan remains legal as it has really helped me and many people in the same position.

What could this be? Upon doing some research, I found that kratom is a natural leaf from a tree that grows mostly in the far East. People have used kratom for hundreds of years with no ill effect. Recent research has shown that kratom affects the same receptors in the brain as opioids, but without the harmful addiction. Some scientists have suggested that kratom would serve as a perfect natural alternative for people who are attempting to break their addiction to opioids. I have seen on the news that there is a huge problem here in America with opioid addiction and overdose deaths. The government has even made it a priority to address this national problem. How great it is, that there is a natural alternative which has been shown to help people quit opioids. But wait, just when one branch of the government is trying to quell the national epidemic, another branch of the government (the DEA) wants to put the alternative completely out of reach, not only to people already getting relief, but to researchers who can certainly find even more positive aspects of kratom, if they not held back by schedule 1. It is beyond ridiculous that the DEA claims an immediate danger to the public from constituents in kratom, given the years and years of harmless use by people all around the world. I can't help but surmise that the DEA is acting under the influence of certain pharmaceutical companies. I have heard that these companies are working to create a prescription drug mimicking kratom (at great cost to the pubic, undoubtedly) and they would hate to see competition from Mother Nature. Aside from this obvious pharmaceutical conflict of interest, it is really disturbing to see our government in conflict with itself. I do draw some comfort from the fact that the DEA did back off from scheduling kratom into schedule 1, due to both public outcry and several Congress member's objections. I hope that logic and compassion will overcome the DEA's urge to regulate kratom, and it will remain available to the public.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2628","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern: \n\nI am a 29-year-old female with a graduate education.

This plant is inexpensive and it is about as harmless as taking an herbal supplement. Of course, anything can be abused, and any substance, including tap water from your home faucet, can be overdosed on.\n\nPeople around the world have used Kratom for many years, perhaps many centuries. The plant's pain relieving properties are real, yet I do not feel the plant works for me like a scripted opiate; Kratom relieves my pain without the \"loopyness\" I get from scripted opiates. This is a good thing! I can use a red strain of Kratom and have my neck, back, arthritic, and muscular pain relieved while still being able to function normally and do my work through my business and around my home. Being able to have a clear head and a body that's not feeling drugged is a God-send.\n\nI have taken scripted opiates for many years due to several old accidents and arthritis that's haunted my joints for almost three decades (it's not RA and the joint pain I have cannot be associated with an autoimmune disease as I have been tested several times and there is no particular reason for this pain and the flares I have). Kratom has been so helpful for me and has reduced what would be a dependence upon scripted opiates. Since the US Government and the DEA have taken my medical history and treatment out of my primary doctor and specialists' hands, being treated for chronic pain is a nightmare. You walk the line and never know if you will be able to receive another script for pain meds that you genuinely need. You never know when you might be sent to a pain management clinic that has no interest in treating your pain with scripted meds that help you; the pain management clinics seem to be more interested in forcing patients to receive injections that may or may not work. If you read patient forums (cancer patients, pain management patients, etc.), it's a crap shoot when you receive the injections pain management anesthesiologists force most pain patients to endure. My own mother who is Stage IV cancer with a limited prognosis is being forced to receive injections that, for the most part, are not working for her. She's also scripted Tramadol 50 mg for breakthrough pain. Really?????? \n\nThis is our great government at work. Because of pill mills in Florida and irresponsible physicians who enjoyed the kick backs from big pharma's pill pushing over the last two decades, some people lost their lives. This is very sad and I am sorry this happened. My heart goes out to the families and friends left behind. However, that is NO REASON the US Government should step in and become the watch dog of my physicians who care for me. My physician and my specialists are responsible individuals who do not over script opiates or any other medication, for that matter.\n\nAnd now the DEA and US Government are concerned about Kratom? This makes no sense. If you are truly concerned, DEA and US Government, allow independent studies to be conducted. Allow these plants and their various strains to be researched. But if you haven't researched the plants and if you don't know what you are dealing with - because you do not - then there is no reason to say that I have no right to consume this plant. \n\nYou don't have a problem with me taking other herbal supplements for various reasons (St. John's Wort, Valerian, Kava Kava, etc.), so why pick on Kratom? Please do not schedule this plant and take something that works for so many people, people like me who cannot get relief from their pain through scripts, and people like me who do not want to take illegal drugs. Thank you for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17206","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I firmly believe that kratom literally saved my life. When I was 18 I was assaulted and left with ongoing pain, in addition to anxiety and depression. I was also in a few car accidents in my early twenties which extended the amount of time that I was on narcotic pain relievers, so before I knew it I was hooked. I managed my addiction pretty well all through 2 rounds of college and through the beginning of a great careee, until one day I just couldn't, everything came crashing down. I knew that if I didn't find a real solution I would lose everything, my career, my house, or my pets, and most of all my fiance. I really just didn't know what to do. I have tried buprenorphine before and hated it. It made me feel sick, just ill, it took away all of my emotions and made me feel like a zombie. Most importantly, it just did not keep me off of the drugs. I was searching desperately for some sort of solution when I remembered that I had taken Kratom when I was younger. I did some research online and found that thousands of people we're also using kratom to come off of drugs, and to also deal with pain. \n\nAt first, I didn't notice any changes due to the amount of opiates I had been on, but slowly I started to feel like a normal person again and I cannot describe how good that made me feel. Kratom took the edge off of the pain, not nearly as good as an opiate would but enough to where it wasn't constantly on my mind. It also essentially killed all anxiety and depression. Most importantly, it took away almost all of the drug cravings, and I can honestly say that I have not touched opiates since I started using kratom. \n\nKratom has saved my life, and I know based upon the stories that I have read that Kratom has also saved thousands and thousands of other lives. As you well know, our country is in the middle of an opioid epidemic. News of overdoses are always splashed across the headlines, as well as our government's efforts to get some sort of control over this horrible situation. I don't want to politicize this argument, but I will say that a real solution has been offered here with kratom and I honestly can't wrap my head around why anyone, aside from pharmaceutical companies, would want to take away something that can save lives with little to no negative effects. I've looked over the Kratom overdose information, and from what I can see, every individual who overdosed with kratom in their body was also found with numerous other substances in their blood. \n\nMy biggest fear is that the DEA will ban kratom, and that the thousands and thousands of lives that it has staved will be ruined as people will likely turn back to opiates. I beg you to please reconsider your decision to ban kratom, for your sake, and ours.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1799","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Tatianna Kilgore and I am new to the kratom scene, but have never been happier.

I have a Bachelors and a Masters Degree. I know what hard work and integrity means and I know about addiction. 5 years ago,  I found kratom. \n\n I am healthy mentally and physically. Other than my yearly well-woman visit, I have not seen or required a doctor in 4 years.  I take kratom like a vitamin regime for energy, mood boost, and pain. I work long hours bettering and brightening the future for children. And I am one of the best in my field.  I dont get high from kratom. I use it responsibly. I dont drink alcohol. I dont smoke cigarettes.  I am the Best Me I have ever been.  Kratom has saved my life. \n\nWhile the DEA statistics say that Kratom has killed 15 people in 2 years (although the people who have died had other substances in their system), cigarettes are responsible for 480,000 deaths a year (CDC, www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/)  . Alcohol is responsible for 88,000 a year and 2.5 million years of potential life lost (CDC, www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm).  Approximately 185 accidently die each year from Tylenol yet it remains on the shelves for public consumption because the FDA stated the agency saw the benefits of keeping acetaminophen widely available as outweighing the relatively rare risk of liver damage or death (U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention Multiple Cause of Death Database).  Many, possibly hundreds, of prescriptions and over-the-counter medications that the FDA and DEA allow for use as relatively safe, have been the cause of more deaths and more overdoses in one year than decades of Kratom use.  Substances that the DEA and FDA know are dangerous such as alcohol and cigarettes continue to be a part of our mainstream repertoire of consumption, yet those remain legal and a staple in our culture. \n\nKratom has saved the lives of thousands of people. My conservative family members are thankful for kratom and what it has done for me.  Thousands of people use kratom to abstain from the very things that are legal and harmful. The people of this country are fighting and winning their own War on Drugs and Prescriptions by using kratom in their arsenal. That being said, kratom users are not all addicts getting clean from drugs that are illegal and legal. Many people use kratom as a healthy alternative to combating the effects of diseases, chronic pain, depression, and the list goes on and on. Their eyes are open to the harmful side effects of any prescription drugs that may be prescribed and they are choosing safer alternative methods such as kratom.  Please keep kratom legal for the sake and well-being of millions of Americans.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10160","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Allison McCowan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 60 years old my wife is 58,she suffers from Fibromyalgia and a bulging disc ,I have chronic back pain.

I served 2 deployments to Fallujah and Ramadi. I was the lead machine gunner and driver for the lead vehicle of a route clearance team. We were in charge of escorting troops around Al Anbar province while clearing improvised explosives from the roads in order to allow clear passage for other troops operating in the area. During this time, we had 168 successful missions while our vehicles were actually hit by IEDs on 38 occasions. 4 of these hits were on my vehicle causing traumatic brain injury and compressed lower discs in my back along with other injuries that were able to heal through stitches and staples. Upon returning from deployments I had PTSD and was unable to go out in public places without getting anxiety. I turned to drinking and relied on it for years after because I thought it was safer than any prescription drugs. Not until just recently I found kratom after hearing a few people tell me how it's helped them.

Kratom has helped me tremendously, and the ignorance surrounding this proposed ban is astounding. I can function normally after consuming kratom, as it does not impair day to day functioning. It reduces my anxiety and provides a feeling of alertness but without the jittery side effects of coffee. It also produces a slight feeling of well-being, which helps people with anxiety.  Making this plant illegal and classified the same as heroin and other extremely dangerous drugs is one of the most disheartening and disturbing acts I've ever seen by the government.\n\nI have several friends age 40 to 70 who use kratom regularly for other ailments as well, including chronic pain such as arthritis. I have introduced kratom to these friends and they have been extremely thankful because it allowed them to stop using powerful pain killers with many negative side effects. It has enabled them to lead productive lives with less pain, and allowed them to perform their jobs and all their normal day to day functions. \n\nThis plant is certainly much safer than alcohol, as it does not impair you. If taking too much, the worst that can happen is dizziness and vomiting, which are common effects of drinking too much alcohol. Kratom consumption does not create any kind of intoxication, and I am shocked that the DEA has proposed a ban. It is by no means a hardcore drug and can safely be used by people who just want to lead pain-free, anxiety-free, and productive lives.\n\nI suspect that the motivation behind this ban comes from big pharma, as they are likely waiting to make billions by patenting a synthesized version of the alkoloids found in Kratom. If the DEA's motivation does in fact come from this profit-driving pressure to cash in on new prescription drugs, I will have lost all faith in our government and the DEA to protect us from the real hazards out there. \n\nAs a successful and responsible 46 year old U.S. citizen, I strongly oppose the kratom ban.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3009","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Griffith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I used kratom during my journey with cancer.

Kratom has helped so many people (including me) to live healthier, happier lives. For several years I battled an addiction to drugs and alcohol. I made several unsuccessful attempts to get sober. That changed when I discovered kratom. A friend suggested that I try kratom as it has helped others beat their addictions. I did and within 3 weeks of the first time I tried it I was completely off of the substances I was using (which included prescription pain pills, ecstasy, meth, and alcohol). I have been completely drug and alcohol free since trying kratom. It has given me my life back. I do not know where I would be without it. Kratom has helped people with addiction issues as well as pain management. Many people are turning to kratom as an alternative to dangerous and addictive prescription pain pills. The medications that are prescribed to people in droves by doctors are far more dangerous than any amount of kratom. Thousands and thousands of people overdose on pills every year yet there has never been a single death from kratom. The DEA cited roughly 660 calls to the poison control center and just a handful of deaths. However, not a single one of those deaths was from kratom alone. Every single case had other dangerous substances involved. Kratom has saved so many lives and has killed nobody. I believe that the reason kratom has become an issue with the government is because the pharmaceutical companies are losing money due to people weening themselves off of their products in order to seek a less dangerous, less debilitating, less addictive method of pain management. It is extremely frustrated to feel like the interests of big business are being placed above doing what is best for the public. In the midst of such a terrible opiate epidemic we need to be embracing any safe substance that is helping people stay away from these dangerous drugs. Kratom is no danger to the public. If kratom becomes illegal, addicts will go back to their old habits and lives will be destroyed. If Kratom becomes a schedule 1 substance scientists and doctors will not be able to continue their research in finding out what kratom can do for people. There is simply not the evidence to support turning kratom into an illegal substance. I would like to encourage the DEA to remember who they are supposed to represent and to do the right thing here. Kratom must stay legal and available to everyone who uses it to live better lives. I appreciate your consideration and your allowing the public to comment on this important issue and I look forward to Kratom remaining legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14068","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Meghan Leber","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n This message is a comment on the sheduling of an important beneficial plant to the human species, which will lead to this plant becoming inaccessible to those who may have otherwise found its' many healing properties. As a researcher and consumer of this powerful medicinal botanical, I have experienced the overwhelmingly positive benefits kratom has provided to me over the course of my daily usage for over three years. I suffer from a variety of physiological and psychological discrepancies and kratom is one of the reasons I have the strength to make it out of bed in a positive mood every morning. While this is just my experience, I know of countless examples in which kratom has helped many different types of people overcome and maintain a wide variety of ailments. More specifically a massive benefit of this plant has been and is to help ease an extremely dangerous epidemic already gripping the nation... Opioids. Kratom helps those who suffer from opioid dependence to find an alternative, and those who are trying to quit opiates/opioids find healthier (and cheaper) means of treating and maintaining those side effects or dependencies. This is an undeniable fact, however painful it may be, kratom is being treated like marijuana has been throughout history up until just mere years ago, when the approval of medical marijuana was accepted. In a sense, kratom is very similar to marijuana in that it is more or less harmless with no deaths contributed (each alone) for hundreds if not thousands of years of human use...Also that it is difficult to tax and regulate because it can be so widely grown in tropical areas, that the government could not make a viable profit from taxation every time kratom switched hands from grower to distributor.. While much of my story may be conjecture, it is also personal experience and knowledge based in responsibility as a natural person and born sovereign. \n\n I urge you to consider this statement on our natural rights as human beings. If laws can be passed to regulate what substances can and can not be consumed, what does that say about who owns our bodies? If I do not have the right to choose, with my own free will, what I will consume and put into the body I currently own and inhabit, who does choose what I am allowed to put into MY body?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and I sincerely hope the reader will grasp the medical value and beneficial impact this botanical ally has on people everywhere. I also hope that just like it's powerful sister plant marijuana, kratom will be recognized as a therapeutic tool to help people in a natural way conducive to responsibility and health in fair economic and environmental practice. Kratom is amazing, please consider our input as the people who make up the country in which the laws are supposed to \"protect\". This is also not just a battle on the scheduling of this powerful plant, but an attack on consciousness. Governement was created to maintain a structured freedom, a freedom that we, the people, constitute. Don't take our freedom to choose what we will put in our bodies and fill more privatized prisons with people of victimless crimes. \n\nI appreciate the recipients willingness to sift through these input letters and hope this finds a place you can relate to somehow, someway as a human being. \nSincerely and with positivity,  \n       \n John Perry","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8795","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Perry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom, as with soursop, has been used as a medicinal food in the vein of Hipocrates's famous quote: \"let food be thy medicine.

Through the course of the last 13-14 years my pain has developed in a way that no medical specialist has been able to prescribe me anything that has helped in alleviating or reversing the condition I have. I was recently diagnosed with severe and advanced Ankylosing Spondylitis among a few other thing as the source of my pain.\nAt around 2010 I moved out to go to school out of state and out of desperation, I started searching online for ways of dealing with pain so I could physically hold a job and support my self and that was when I discovered Kratom. It has helped me cope with my pain in a way that none of the pain medication and various pharmaceuticals Ive had to take has. Although my conditions still exist, the pain that comes with it is much more bearable to where I feel I can live a much more productive life than I once was able to. It has even allowed me to get through a time in my life where I had to consider applying for disability assistance. I have had a doctor tell me to keep taking it at low doses along with Anti-inflammatorys since its continued to help my pain and hasnt given me adverse reactions and there weren't any clinical side effects or abnormalities noticed from blood tests. \nAlong with the 800+ milligram doses of Ibuprofen I have to take daily (this dose is doctor recomended in keeping down inflammation) along with the 5 gram dose of powdered crushed leaf Kratom I take with it keeps me mobile throughout the first part of the day and significantly takes the edge off of the pain.\nI know that this plant has benefited my well being and quality of life within the last few years and I know it has to have been a miracle to many other Americans in similar situations that have come to find this plant through they're search for natural and non synthetic pharmaceutical remedies for pain. \nOn top of pain relief, I am also aware of the epidemic of opioids addictions inflicting many peoples lives in this country and have personally known people coming off opioid substance addictions through use of Kratom and then altogether lifting their hands of off every substance, illicit and unregulated. Even leaving Kratom itself, which itself tells me that Kratom can be/is a tool for an important problem and is most definitely helping people set they're lives straight from addiction. \nI would like to know that there will continue to be hope for myself and many others that are dealing with potentially debilitating diseases/conditions that use this plant to improve they're well being where nothing else has and please consider the availability ofkratom over much more harmful things. \nSincerely,\n \nNathaniel Ashton Cemento","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17844","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nathaniel Cemento","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"DEA, \n      I sincerely hope u choose not to ban Kratom.

My doctor limits me to 6 pills a day; it's never enough. A friend of mine had been taking Kratom for his pain and suggested I try it; after looking into it and seeing its long history, I did. It does not treat pain as well as narcotic painkillers, but it is an adequate substitute when I have reached my limit. I have found that with Kratom, I am able to leave the house and get things done when otherwise I would not; I can function without painkillers, albeit at a lower level. \nI have never felt \"high\".

I started it, because of back issues from years ago, I began taking prescription pain killers, such as Norco, then suboxone, and at times muscle relaxers such as Soma. When in Norco, my tolerance got so high, and I had become so addicted, in my worst years, I could take over 40 pills a day, and had to make more Doctor trips, and at times exaggerate my symptoms to get more and prevent from being sick. After years, I was then prescribed suboxone, which at first was great, one lozenge a day, didn't get me as high as the pills, but prevented withdrawal. After another two years on Suboxone, I lost my insurance and had to go cold turkey, which is horrible if you have ever been through it, especially after 10 years of abuse, it's the worst pain imaginable, physically and emotionally, so I would still seek out opiates. I found Kratom in a smoke shop locally and it says it helps with pain and energy, so I tried it once when in total withdrawal, it didn't get me high at all, but the withdrawal symptoms were tolerable and bear gone, I couldn't believe it, a natural plant. Kratom helped me kick my addiction, and when it came time to get off Kratom, it was 10 fold easier than getting off of the pills, little discomfort and tiredness. I have now been using Kratom on and off for two years, it helps with my pain, as well as gives me energy and helps with my anxiety and mood as well, but does not incapacitate me, there is NO high at all, not like taking pills, it is so mild, that I don't think anyone would even try to abuse it, if they did, they may get a headache and feel Nautious, (as I have when testing my preferred dose). And my tolerance is high, since I used it to get off of these killers. Usually 15 grams per dose, anything past 20 just makes me Nautious, but you won't see anyone nodding off, or stealing from their grandmother to get this stuff. Please do not outlaw this natural substance. Just regulate it as an herbal supplement, maybe an age restriction and quality standards, but finally something natural gets found to help, for it to get taken away, would be very bad and very sad for many suffering people, thank you and regards, Justin Stoner.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0390","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Citizen","postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Stoner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Kyle and I have used Kratom for over 4 years.

We are imploring the government and pertinent agencies involved in this upcoming decision to hear the will of the people. We have a God given right to this very helpful plant. I work 50-70 hours a week, own two small businesses and have numerous other projects that I diligently am engaging when time allows. I am a husband and father to five amazing children and again Kratom has been helpful in giving me the handles to be better at al of these aforementioned things. It would be undesirable, more costly and outright unfair for me to be forced into obtaining pharmaceuticals to help with the various issues I struggle with. I've tried before and to no avail. I thanks God often for this plant and it's uniquely structured elements and alkaloids that make it what it is. Also no one has in and of itself never overdosed from Kratom unless they had other things in their system. In closing we once again plead with the DEA & FDA to show empathy and reason in this decision, Moderate regulation should be the worst case scenario for this plant. Nothing is perfect and nothing ever will be but the benefits of Kratom far outweigh the risk and I am a part of a massive community that appreciate the positive things this plant has done for each of them. I n regards to the opiate epidemic we without hesitation suggest that Kratom is part of the solution and not part of the problem. Thank you for  reading this. God bless.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8370","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyle S","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 59 year old wife, Mother, of two and grandmother of four.

As a biomedical researcher who works on addiction, I know how dangerous these opiate problems can be. Any potential alternative needs to be seriously considered and researched before being essentially banned by making it a Schedule I drug. So far Kratom seems much safer and more manageable than alternative pain medications, but it's also important that we do the proper studies to understand the short- and long-term effects of this plant's use. Making it Schedule I will make any further research nearly impossible, and in the meantime many more people will have their lives ruined by doctor prescribed painkillers that they become addicted to, leading to harder drug use such as heroin, or overdose from.\n\nPLEASE KEEP KRATOM LEGAL AND ALLOW PROPER RESEARCH INTO ITS ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES. AS A SOCIETY WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LET MORE PEOPLE SUFFER FROM OPIATE ADDICTION WHEN WE KNOW OF POTENTIALLY LIFE SAVING ALTERNATIVES.\n\nI hope you consider this issue very seriously moving forward.

There are a lot of terrible side affects with taking to many Tylenol or Ibuprofen products and it leaves little choice out there for additional pain relief and this substance really seems to help break through that barrier a little better. It gives me an extra choice to rotate through for pain relief in a time when all other pain relievers that are normally available for doctors to use to treat and manage people with chronic pain problems are being restricted so much. You practically have to be a person diagnosed with cancer to be eligible for pain management. \n\nWe do have legalized marijuana in our state, but as a going on 3 year X-smoker that also has COPD this is not the best choice since it is primarily a smoking product. Side effects of marijuana and Kratom are quite different.  Marijuana's pain relief has limitations on how well you can function and do your work when using it and it is legalized. \n\nKratom is something that is just strong enough for me and helps with pain throughout the day and does not have the side effects that a substance like Marijuana or Alcohol do and tend to leave you to effected to do your work. Kratom is not smoking product either. It can be added to hot drinks of tea or coffee. After consuming Kratom I am still able to function quite well at my job, there is no driving risk at all for me because I work at home, but also because the product once used does not really impair you physically that much or last to long in your system. \n\nI am a productive tax paying citizen and I am really getting tired of anything stronger then the limited over the counter pain relief items being regulated and rescheduled to Level 1 with little or no good long term human studies being presented. How do you really know that it just automatically has to be scheduled this way and made an illegal Schedule 1 narcotic and no one should be able to get it at all without the studies and proof backing it up and being presented to the public in general. \n\nPlease do some serious human studies on Kratom before just automatically changing it to a something that is just taken off the market all together and further limiting law abiding people trying to truly manage pain in a responsible way with limited side effects.  \n\nI would like to add that if you take this product off the market before even studying it that you also review other products that are used in other countries. They are legal in other countries and help people that can manage their pain responsibly.  People need choices and help with chronic pain relief such as Tylenol with codeine or Ibuprofen with codeine for responsible people that are really just trying to feel normal, get through the day without having constant pain and still be functional. There are a lot of people in pain that need more help at a reasonable cost with something that still allows them to function with less impairment to normal senses, thoughts and physical functioning of their bodies.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on this product.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4257","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't see any reason to make this illegal.

I'm a 90% Service Connected, Disabled Veteran.  I love my country, I love the freedoms we are afforded and the rules we have to live by. My body is pretty abused after years of service. The VA will care for an individual to death,  if you have a problem they will prescribe away the issues till either the problem goes away or the individual is killed from over medication.  I receive care for visible and non-visible injuries. Regardless of the issue, pills are the solution. They wreck havoc on the body and the mind. \n\nKratom is not a perfect solution, but neither are the rest of the pills. At a minimum the leaf is natural. Although it can be abused or enhanced many other products can be as well. I'm not going to try and justify risks by comparing it to alcohol or caffeine or other substances; however, the potential for misuse or harm is significantly less than people seeking synthetic chemical alternatives. I've been on dozens of pain medication, other medications, and Kratom is by far the most promising. I can walk without pain after 3 ankle surgeries and spinal fusion. I hope that I can run again.\n\nHope is the operative work in that sentence, hope is something I have lost in pain medications and other pills. Hope is not having to beg the doctor for a script they are afraid to write because of the scrutiny of controlled substances. Please don't force me back on pills and regulated substances. Alkaloids (active ingredients in Kratom) in their natural form work much better than synthetic medications. \n\nIf its required, fund the proper \"due diligence\" to find the answers being sought through research, but until there is a satisfactory answer, please do not punish us our of fear and ban something that is helping people. Please spend your limited resources on higher priority problems that plague us rather than something that may not be understood by policy makers. \n\nThank you for your consideration, its the most I personally could ask for.

I would like to share my thoughts and experiences in regards to Kratom. Ever since I was 26 years old I have suffered from two bulging disks in my lower back. This has over the past ten years caused severe spinal stenosis which besides the back pain and spasms causes quite a bit of neuropathy/radiculopathy in my legs. In addition to this I also have inherited rheumatoid arthritis from my dad's side and poly cystic kidney disease from my mom's side. Sounds like quite a mess doesn't it? Before I knew I had PKD there was a few years I took prescription pain relievers in order to continue working and providing for my family. Now however, I can not safely take narcotic pain pills due to my kidneys. My kidney function numbers and levels are still great and it is my desire to keep them that way. Pain pills caused a slew of other problems as well. I'm not an addictive person by nature but my tolerance for the opioids would increase at a rate that was very surprising to me. It also changed my personality in a negative way.  I noticed myself becoming more or less a jerk. Lacking empathy or concern for those I love. All the while not adequately controlling the pain. I quit taking the opiates and lived on Motrin until that was useless. I was at my wits end and was contemplating going back on opiates after being off them for years . The spinal stenosis was really starting to wreak havoc on me. On my way to the doctors I called my friend who owns a vitamin/health store. I asked her if there was really something natural that works for pain. I didn't expect to hear that there was. Long story short, I was introduced to Kratom. I have now been taking  Kratom for almost one year. In that year my pain has been the most managed as it ever has been and I have not had to increase my dose at all.  There are practically no side effects and if I'm having a good day with little pain and don't take Kratom I have not experienced any withdrawal symptoms. I have recently had my blood work done and my kidney and liver functions are perfect. Sounds too good to be true. Please, there are many of us who for one reason or another are in pain,  suffer anxiety and depression or perhaps have symptoms of ADHD. Kratom is a safe, cost effective way to manage all those things. It actually is known for boosting your immune system as well. There is a growing number of people who do not want narcotics to be the only option. Kratom has given me and many people I've come in contact with their lives back with no ill side effects or dependency issues. I have worked with addicts in the ministry I am involved with. I've seen what these heavy duty synthetic drugs can do to people. Please don't make people have to choose between pain and breaking the law. Or choose between pain and addiction. We have an alternative. If your afraid of kids getting it, don't be. The worst thing that could happen if someone tried to get high off it they say is that person would throw up. Those of us who utilize it don't take it to get a buzz. It doesn't work that way anyhow. It blocks certain receptors while working on the others. Truly amazing. It deserves to be studied and utilized. Please keep it legal. An age requirement would be fine. However, criminalizing this plant would just add more headache and more cost to try to add it to the already failing war on drugs. I do hope and pray that you will keep this plant available for so many people who have their quality of life back. I thank you so much for your time and for the opportunity to be heard.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19922","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has saved my life. I was diagnosed with lupus around 9 years ago. I was on many medications with many, many side effects. Some of the medications made me sick to my stomach, others made my long beautiful hair fall out. I was unable to go into any type of uv or natural sunlight at all because of one of the medications, and the consequence of doing so would result in large burn like patches all over my skin. Another medication caused seizures, seizures I'm which I had never had before. I would also like to mention that I was a college student, my lupus medications could cost a few hundred a month, and infusions could cost a few thousands. I went years being on all of these medications, with all of the horrible side effects. Sometimes, the medications wouldn't even begin to touch the pain lupus was putting my body through. I found kratom around four or five years ago. I have since been able to stop most of moths medications I have been on, one by one, with the support of a doctor. I now only take one medication, a steroid as needed. I haven't had to take it for almost a year now. I have been pain free for four years. I have been able to rid myself of all the ill side effects from the many medications I was on. I can go out and enjoy the sunlight. I have even been pain free enough to take up activities like hiking and kayaking. Kratom honestly gave me a life again. My lupus finally went into remission this past summer. My hair is growing back, I was able to start excercising and losing the weight gain the steroids have caused. This plant has changed my life. I am happier than I have been for years. And one day, since I have been able to stop the chemotherapy medications, I will be able to achieve my biggest dream. I will be able to have a baby and raise a family. Many of the lupus medications I was on can are too dangerous for pregnant woman, some even caused blood issues which can lead to miscarriage. I pray that this plant can be given a second look. I don't think I could have a life without it. If this natural plant is no longer available,my biggest fear is having to go back to the lupus meds, the infusions, the chemotherapy. I will have to live in pain again, and I may never get to experience the beauty of motherhood and children.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7290","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 33 year old married mother. I served in the military, I am a homeowner, hold an associates degree, and am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Finance in Accounting. My husband works in retail management. I am a Procurement Supervisor at a growing company, and am aiming my career towards finance.\n\nWhile I've always had tight and achy muscles despite frequent stretching, In 2007 I began experiencing extreme fatigue. I drank copious amounts of coffee in an attempt to keep myself awake. I also started experiencing more pain in my shoulders and back. By 2011, my primary care physician - who I have visited dozens of times for these symptoms - diagnosed me with fibromyalgia, prescribed me Cymbalta and sent me on my way. The pain did not cease, and neither did the fatigue. I found myself regularly falling asleep while driving - once causing an accident while my children in the car. This was in spite of sleeping 9 hours a night and eating a whole food diet. At the time, I was employed, but quit my job in 2013 because I was physically unable to sit at a desk and operate the computer mouse because of the pain and fatigue and I ran out of FMLA time. I started drinking energy drinks instead of coffee to keep myself awake at the wheel. By that time, I was seeing a chiropractor three times a week for chronic neck pain, headaches, and minor scoliosis. In 2014 I took a temporary work from home job with a well known tech company, but found it difficult to stay awake and focus on my work. I became severely depressed, and began seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. My PCP prescribed Vicodin and Percocet, but they did not help my pain. My psychiatrist, suspecting underlying ADHD because of my inability to focus, prescribed Adderall. While very effective at keeping me awake, it made my mind race and did not help my pain. Still, with his guidance, in late 2015 I was able to secure a decent paying temporary job in Procurement. It was hard - I was convinced I was not going to be able to keep it. I was so tired all of the time. When I took the Adderall I was able to stay awake, but could not keep my mind fully on my tasks. When I didn't take the Adderall, I could barely keep my eyes open. My children were not given nearly as much attention as they deserved, and my house was in disarray - I was too tired to clean. I would cry to my husband - if I hurt this much and am this tired now, what in the world would our lives be like when we're 60? I could not imagine 20+ more years in this amount of anguish. I wasn't living - I was only surviving.\n\nOne night shortly after starting my new job, I found Kratom while searching for a natural solution for chronic fatigue and pain. At the point of \"I'll try anything\", I ordered 4 ounces of the powdered leaf. I put 3 grams into a cup, added hot water and drank. 30 minutes later, I noticed that not only had the constant pain in my back and shoulder dulled, I was awake. Not jittery like the Adderall made me, or artificially propped up like with coffee, but like I'd actually had a decent night's rest. I had one of the most productive days at work to in years, and felt amazing. Since that day, I take kratom the exact same dose on weekdays - 3 grams in hot water before I go to work. I only use it on weekends if I have a busy day. Since using it, I was promoted from a temporary procurement specialist to the supervisor of my department. I was able to re-enroll in school. My house is clean! My children got their mother back. My husband got his wife back. I haven't had an energy drink in months. The pain isn't entirely gone, but the degree to which it has lessened is incredible. While I do still enjoy coffee, it's no longer a thing I need just to keep my eyes open. I'm not getting high - kratom does not create a sense of euphoria for me at all. It only makes it so I can function, and I finally feel like myself again.\n\nWith kratom, my 2016 earnings will be more than double my 2014 earnings. My personal income is up over 68% in the last 12 months. I pay more income taxes and am actually contributing to society. Rather than dreading the day I am forced to give up and collect disability for chronic fatigue, I'm looking forward to my next promotion and a long life filled with those I love. \n\nIf Kratom is made illegal, you will have sentenced me to either become a criminal, or to become a disabled young woman who can no longer work, and who can't even drive for fear of falling asleep and killing others. You will turn me into a burden on the social safety nets that I proudly pay into now. Either that, or the amount I pay in taxes will potentially become nullified if I am arrested and prosecuted for a federal drug crime. \n\nThe alternative would be legally getting myself addicted to Adderall, just to get by. Modern medicine has failed me, but a plant found in nature has given me my life back. For my sake, the sake of my children, and the countless others who are in similar situations, do not ban my miracle.

Before I found kratom, I was a heavy drinker with declining functionality as I tried to medicate my anxiety. Kratom has the unique ability to give me energy while subduing all symptoms of my anxiety. Under the effects of kratom I am able to feel wholly functional- I can objectively assess \"threatening\" situations for what they truly are, which in reality is usually not a threatening situation at all. It drastically improves my mood and improves taste, sound, even interpersonal relationships. What I most enjoy about kratom is that since I've discovered it I've lost the need to continually search for anxiety drugs. The effects of kratom provide me with enough energy and positivity to get me through the toughest mornings without feeling like I'm \"on drugs.\" If this tea is illegalized I will never stop protesting- for myself and for millions of others who are less fortunate than me, those who rely on kratom's natural healing to endure severe pain and the trauma of disorders like PTSD. Do not bastardize the legacy of kratom through unnecessary legislation and scheduling.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0447","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lauren McIntyre","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA,\n\nKratom seems like a possible herbal option for people suffering in pain rather than having to solely rely on much harsher opiate drugs that for some unknown reason we continue to get American's hooked on.  I think we need to support this drug by allowing more research to be done before ruling it out.  If I were in chronic pain, I would prefer to have an option that doesn't have me walking around like a zombie before I ultimately die of an overdose.  We really have it backwards in my opinion.  Why are ancient herbal substances shamed, yet chemicals and opiates that are killing someone every 19 minutes considered helpful?  Let's do some research here.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13342","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alice ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should be treated as a dietary supplement and not regulated as a drug. Its safety profile is comparable to other natural substances such as St. John's Wort, Valerian Root, Chamomile, Ashwagandha, etc.\n\nI have used kratom regularly for many years and have never experienced any serious adverse affects. Even considering the occasional negative reaction to kratom, there is no reason it should be subject to regulation any stricter than caffeine. Statistics will show across the board in calls to poison control centers, ER visits, or alleged problems with dependency that the effects of caffeine will be more severe and occurring more often in each and every metric. There are confirmed deaths from caffeine overdose, there has never been a single death in history linked definitively to unadulterated kratom. If the FDA and DEA have determined that caffeine needs no significant regulation, then it would be entirely unreasonable to revoke the liberties of so many Americans who unanimously wish to continue to take kratom undisturbed. \n\nThe public has not asked for regulation. A simple tally of the collective comments will show that the overwhelming majority believe the status quo of kratom ought to be preserved. Any scheduling by the Drug Enforcement Agency is utterly without justification. The Food and Drug Administration should cease all of its efforts to seize kratom shipments from law-abiding, American small business owners. In my experience with kratom vendors, I have seen nothing but the most responsible and ethical business practices.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0970","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Peterson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a pharmacist who has endometriosis as well as a bad back and I had a fusion in 2012.  I have been on chronic pain medication including opiates since 2009 and I haven't been able to work for 4 years.  My mom also has chronic pain due to lupus and spinal cysts and she had been on opiates for 13 years.  About 4 months ago my mom decided she wanted to get off the opiates and with her pain doctor she slowly got off but she was still having terrible pain.  I did research on Kratom and thought it would be worth a try for her because she tried marijuana and it wasn't helping much so she was thinking of going back on the opiates.  About 2 months ago she tried her first dose of kratom and had significant pain relief with no side effects.  I decided to try it in place of my opiates during the day and to my surprise I could go 8-12 hours without my opiates and with no withdrawal symptoms whereas if I had done that without kratom I would be having significant withdrawals.  I am working now on tapering off the prescription opiates solely to kratom and it is amazing.  Both my mom and I have significant pain relief and we don't have to take it every 4 hours like with the opiates or even every day.  Kratom has been a godsend for my mom and I and I am scared of it is no longer available my mom will go back on the prescription opiates she worked so hard to get off of.  As a pharmacist I am greatly encouraged by the possibilities with Kratom in getting people off chronic pain medication to something that truly can be taken only as needed without the strong dependence of opiates but with similar pain relief.  Please allow people to continue to use this herb that has helped so many people, thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21344","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cynthia Warwick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think Kratom should be kept legal.

I was so miserable that I spent most of two years in bed and isolating myself resolved that that would be how I would spend the remainder of my life.\nI began researching the meds I was on and  discovered that combinations of some meds were incredibly dangerous and even could be deadly. I carefully began tapering off the meds one at a time and started researching natural medicines and found many options one of them being kratom. I researched for days learning everything I could and found claims that kratom could be used to detox off opiates, manage pain, treat anxiety and depression, and provide energy. It sounded too good to be true. Soon after I had joined a kratom community on FB, ordered a variety and my experiment began. I found it worked very well and also quickly realized it to be non-addictive unlike the opiates I had been taking. I am so happy to say that I am down from 9 medications to just a couple plus kratom and a few other herbs. I am back to the me that had been lost during those two miserable years. I am taking much better care of myself and although I may have to lie down a couple times a day I can even take short walks, do some light housekeeping, light gardening I love and get out to do necessary shopping. I've even been fortunate enough to find a few new friends from my kratom community Facebook page who are local. I won't ever be able to resume working in the career I loved but I thanks to my journey with kratom I have a life again.\n\nCynthia H.

People aren't getting into fights at bars because of kratom. People aren't getting aweful diseases or having terrible side effects from kratom.

He started using it to relieve his anxiety symptoms. He became physically addicted. He ended up dropping out of college, spent thousands of dollars on kratom and finally reached out for help when he realized his addiction was out of control. He went through withdrawal at a detox center and is currently in out-patient treatment for substance addiction. Kratom, although I agree it has benefits for some people, needs to be regulated.

Let me give you some background information, I'll try to be a brief as possible. I promise, I do have a point at the end. \n\nMy most disabling pain condition is chronic migraine (I haven't had a pain free day, or even hour, in over a decade now), along with other chronic pain. I got my first migraine when I was 4 years old, I didn't know what to do. I began banging my head on the floor at preschool, I was yelled at and put in time out. I tried to explain the pain, but I was ignored. I found out many years later that I wasn't alone, others also hit their head at a young age when the pain started. My mom knew immediately that it was a migraine (they run in our family), she had them bad as well, but no one got them as young as I did. I began having migraines once or twice a month and headaches weekly. Then as I started middle and high school, I began getting migraines a couple days a week, with more mild headache pain on other days. The pain was so bad that I would miss school weekly, but always made sure I did my work and had near straight A's through high school. When I was 17 to 18, I realized my pain just didn't seem to ever let up, and it was moderate to severe every day. By this time I tried several preventative and abortive medications, and saw a neurologist at UC San Francisco, but never got any relief. I was determined to keep \"pushing through\" the pain every day because I wanted to finish college, work a job, and support myself, I just wanted a normal life. I made myself hang out with friends, but always had the pain and always would collapse the second I was alone, into my bed in a dark room, no friends understood my pain. I graduated college, worked some jobs, supported myself for awhile, but it finally became too much to keep \"pushing through.\" \n\nAbout 5 years ago I moved in with my mom, stopped working for a year, went back to work when my savings disappeared, then had to quit for good about 3 years ago. I am now on disability and have my mom basically taking care of me in every way, this isn't how life should be for a 30 year old. I can barely stand up long enough to shower because I'm too dizzy, I can barely stay at a healthy weight because of my nausea and vomiting, and I'm unable to drive anymore. Through all of this time, I've tried literally every medication and treatment in existence, even some meds that are only in trials now because my doctor wants me to feel better. I've been hospitalized several times, but the doctors can never get my pain down. I'm suffering constantly and I have nothing to turn to. \n\nI tell you all this because those of us who are in such constant pain need more to turn to, and every time the government just bans a potentially life saving medication before they even know anything about it, they're giving chronic pain patients even less options. I know many people through online pain support groups who have gotten some relief through using Kratom, and I recently began looking into it. Shortly after I did, I found out it was going to be banned. I literally cried because it's another thing that I can't even try now for pain relief. Chronic migraine disease is one of the hardest and most disabling conditions a person can have because the symptoms affect every part of the person (I'm unable to read because focusing my eyes increases pain, I can't enjoy concerts because I'm sensitive to sounds, I wear sunglasses constantly because light is so painful, I can only eat a few items because so many foods increase my nausea, I can't stand or walk much because I'm too dizzy, I barely sleep because the pain is so severe, the list goes on). There isn't a single treatment that helps everybody, in fact, most available treatments only help a small percentage of patients. This is why we need everything in existence available to us. \n\nI completely support further testing and understanding of Kratom, but please don't make it unavailable in the meantime. All the testing could take years or even more than a decade, and people who are suffering don't have that long to wait. Kratom has the potential to help so many people, and to have few side effects compared to most alternative medications. Patients who currently are using it don't have another option, please don't take it away from them, or from me. Kratom could be lifesaving for myself, and may even mean that I could function as a normal human, work and support myself, live my life. I can't afford to have access denied to another medication. \n\nI am sorry for such a long message. I sincerely hope that my concerns are listened to and taken to heart. The current medications that are available are not helping me or thousands like me, so we need other options. Kratom is more natural and very different from what's available, please keep it available to patients who truly need it.

There appears to be a consensus among scientific evidence and user experiences that kratom is far less harmful--using almost any metric--than alcohol or tobacco, which are both effectively regulated by the FDA. Under FDA regulation, quality standards and age restrictions could be imposed upon kratom cultivation and sales, which would effectively reduce any harms presented by the plant. Not only would this solution be appropriate in light of other currently-regulated substances, it would also be the optimal solution for the purpose of public health. There is considerable evidence for public health benefits associated with kratom (e.g. diversion from illegal drugs, cessation of illegal opioid use, improved productivity and motivation, pain relief), but significantly less evidence for public health risks associated with kratom (e.g. dependency that is far less severe than that associated with alcohol or prescription opioids, overdose toxicity only when used in conjunction with other substances, liver toxicity in some extremely small percentage of the population). Considering that kratom's public health risk-to-benefit ratio is relatively trivial when compared to substances currently controlled by the DEA (e.g. heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine) and is even less than some substances currently regulated by the FDA (e.g. tobacco and alcohol), it would be more appropriate to subject kratom to FDA regulation than to DEA regulation. I would estimate that kratom's public health risk-to-benefit ratio is much closer to that of caffeine than to alcohol or any controlled substance. \n\nSecond, I am strongly against regulating kratom as a prescription drug, as I believe that this would severely undermine its public health benefits for two reasons. First, many adults responsibly use kratom for occasional recreation or self-medication without causing any social harm; regulating kratom as a prescription drug would unduly interfere with their autonomy to consume products in accordance with their preferences. Second, and perhaps more importantly, many former opioid addicts have ceased using opioids through use of kratom, which is far less harmful to their health and overall well-being; arguably, the health effects of kratom are much less significant than those presented by pharmaceutical opiate cessation products like suboxone or methadone. Unfortunately, many people who use kratom as an opiate cessation product do not have health insurance, cannot afford pharmaceutical treatments, or prefer to maintain their privacy by avoiding healthcare providers; whatever their reasons, they have decided that self-medication with kratom is the best solution for them, and the government should not interfere with this freedom of choice without some compelling reason for doing so. Our government currently allows for the unregulated use of many different herbal supplements and health products, and kratom should be treated similarly to these other legal herbal supplements unless there is overwhelming evidence that it presents significant risks to public health, which there most certainly is not. People have been safely using kratom for centuries around the world, and I see no compelling reason to suddenly ban it; I am certain that doing so would harm many more people than it helps.\n\nFinally, I would like to give you some background information about myself and my reasons for writing this comment today. I am currently a law student who has used kratom over the past few years to manage my chronic muscle pain and fatigue; more importantly, I have used kratom in order to avoid using dangerous illegal drugs that I previously struggled to stay away from. In my experience with kratom, I have found that the benefits greatly outweigh any risks. Since I began using kratom, I have been able to consistently manage my personal and professional affairs without suffering from the bouts of depression and fatigue that used to severely hinder my achievement. Moreover, I have been able to abstain from using illicit drugs, which were once a major problem in my life. The only downsides I've experienced in using kratom are occasional constipation that I've effectively managed by increasing my fiber intake, an extra monthly expense of around $100 that is well worth the benefits to my overall well-being (and far cheaper than pharmaceutical or black market alternatives), and a dependency that I find far less harmful and debilitating than the dependencies I would otherwise likely have (i.e. alcohol, illegal opiates, etc.). As far as I know, no one has ever died from standalone kratom use, but only when concurrently using other more dangerous drugs. Furthermore, anyone who has used kratom will agree that there is a definite \"ceiling\" on its effects; taking more kratom will not result in stronger desired effects, but rather, regular moderate usage produces optimum results. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11069","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"J W","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It's difficult to avoid bias in commenting here, but the decision to schedule Mitragynine can't possibly be in the best interest of american citizens.

KRATOM IS NOT A DANGEROUS DRUG.  I am 59 years old and I have been using kratom everyday for OVER 3 years now. I take kratom for my back pain (I have 2 compression fractures of the spine) and for my osteoarthritis AND IT DEFINITELY HELPS. I also take kratom for my severe anxiety and depression and sleep problems AND IT DEFINITELY HELPS. I also should mention that I do NOT take any RX or OTC drugs -- NONE. And, I do NOT drink alcohol.\n\nI do NOT take kratom to get high. Kratom does NOT get me high no matter how much I take. I  do NOT crave more and more kratom even after daily use for 3+ years -- I always take the same amount everyday. Kratom is not addicting like heroin, it's much closer to a coffee addiction which I can easily deal with [IF] I have to. We all are addicted to something, be it coffee, sugar, wheat, cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, gambling or fast food. The fact is... too much of anything can be bad for you and could lead to an addiction. The fact is nobody has died [specifically] from taking too much kratom ALONE. \n\nWhy not just regulate kratom in the same way you regulate alcohol, cigarettes and E-cigarettes which are definitely more of a health problem than kratom. The industry needs to come together to self-regulate and self-police one another and get rid of some of the bad apples out there.\n\nI support placing an age restriction on kratom for consumers who are 18 or older. I also believe that stricter labeling guidelines are necessary. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding shouldnt use kratom, for example, and anyone with a medical condition or who is taking prescription medications should consult their doctor before trying kratom. Perhaps most importantly, make sure that products arent being deliberately marketed toward younger consumers, or with the intent of comparing its effects to other drugs, like actual opiates.\n\nKratom is a tropical plant in the coffee family from Southeast Asia that has been used to support energy and focus, as well as a potent immune system booster.  Kratom is inherently safe and shares many therapeutic constituents in common with other widely recognized medicinal plants such as Cats Claw and Yohimbe, which currently enjoy wide spread safe usage as dietary supplements in the United States and abroad.\n\nThe DEA, without a serious review of the available scientific literature, has chosen to emergency schedule Kratom and designate it as schedule I substance; one that has no accepted medical value. The common citizen can easily perform a search for Mitragyna speciosa in Google scholar and find over 1,660 search results documenting the potential medical value of Kratom.  The DEA has not only turned a blind eye to the scientific literature, but it has also taken the stance that it is uninterested in hearing testimony from Kratom users who use it for its therapeutic value.  Thus, the DEA considers any and all use of Kratom to be abuse, while ignoring the medical literature, NIH funded studies, numerous patents, and millions of users testimonies, all of which point to its therapeutic potential.\n\nRather than consider the therapeutic potential for Kratom, the DEA has unilaterally moved to make millions of felons out of Kratom users who are simply using Kratom in accordance with its historical use, its patented use, and the conclusions of thousands of scientific studies. Allowing the DEA to unilaterally criminalize the use of Kratom will not only create millions of felons out of otherwise law abiding citizens, but it will also halt all scientific investigations into Kratoms medicinal benefits which would benefit millions of other law abiding citizens.  With America currently suffering from an opiate epidemic and opiate related overdoses at an all-time high, a policy that prohibits the research of therapeutic compounds does not make sense.  \n\nFurthermore, the economic impact of the criminalization of Kratom will have unforeseen consequences due to the enforcement costs and public health costs associated with addiction such as emergency room visits due to substituting Rx medicines, petty theft to obtain said Rx medicines, etc.  Lastly, harsh penalties, such as a felony charge for possessing Kratom will not only be ineffective in preventing its use but it will also severely limit otherwise law abiding citizens future prospects, a challenge that can be permanently damaging to individuals, while costing US citizens tax revenue that can be better spent.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9573","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Hoenigmann","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a normal, average concerned citizen.

I no longer take the kratom every day, only on days where I am experiencing pain. I truly believe that kratom has saved my life, because without it I would either be stuck on suboxone, which is horrible on the brain, or went back to heroin to get over the long and agonizing suboxone withdrawals. The only choice we have in the USA when quitting opioids is cold turkey, methadone, suboxone, or kratom. Kratom is the best way to get off of opioids. It is natural, safe, and has saved many lives.

I am a registered pharmacist, but have been employed as a software engineer in the healthcare industry for the past 20 years. \nI have a long history or social anxiety, anxiety, and panic attacks. I went the route of prescription medications for years, suffered debilitating side effects from them, and realized very little benefit from them. My doctor and I werent able to find a medication or combination that would help me. For a while, I wasnt even comfortable leaving my house and going into public, driving to work, and the like. I used to dread just having to get in the car to go somewhere and I almost lost my job because of this. There were several occasions where I ended up in the ER from panic attacks, and on one occasion, was even admitted overnight since I was having chest pain and was convinced I was having a heart attack.\n\nI found out about kratom about 12 years ago when browsing a social anxiety support forum and have been using it daily since. I was able to stop my prescription anti-anxiety and antidepressant medications and feel better than I ever have.  I am now a productive member of society, hold a respectable job, and can go to work and in public without worrying about panic attacks and anxiety. Even on medication I wasn't comfortable doing this. Now, even large crowds arent an issue for me.\n\nOnce I started using Kratom, I no longer had the urge to drink since my anxiety was under control using kratom. I drank daily for quite a long period of time (in attempts to ease my anxiety) prior to finding this wonderful plant. I have not had a drink in the past 12 years. The amount of kratom I use has not increased or changed at all over this time period. Using it for anxiety and panic disorder, I have used the same amount daily for almost 12 years without any reduced effectiveness. \n\nKratom has completely changed my life for the better and I am just one of a large number of Americans that benefit from it. Over the past 12 years I have not noticed the slightest side effect and I am as healthy as I have ever been. My doctor is aware of my kratom use and has encouraged me to keep using it since it has enabled me to stop taking SSRIs, benzodiazepines, and no longer drink. My lab work is all within normal limits, and she feels this is a great alternative for me since it has kept me off of several medications that are addictive and have side effects. Also, removing the desire to consume alcohol is a big win in her opinion since in the long run (outside of its damaging health effects) it really just aggravates and exacerbates my anxiety issues. \n\nKratom has been the only thing that has worked for me after suffering for years juggling many different prescriptions medications that provided little if any relief and I finally found something that returned me to being a functioning member of society. I feel the benzodiazepines and SSRI medications I was previously prescribed are both very addictive (again Im a pharmacist) and were extremely hard to taper from when I stopped using them. I think the SSRI withdrawal was worse than the benzodiazepines for me. I didnt feel normal or myself for almost six months after coming off of Paxil. My doctor helped me slowly wean off of them, but it was still not easy. In contrast, there have been several times I have gone without kratom for a few days here and there, and did not notice any significant withdrawal, just my anxiety symptoms returning. \n\nI do not want to have to return to taking a cocktail of SSRI and benzodiazepine medications to control my anxiety, but thats what I will have to do if kratom becomes a schedule I substance. These medications clouded my judgment and basically turned me into a zombie. I didnt feel like myself. In contrast, kratom is almost like having a cup of coffee in the morning. It wakes me up, allows me to focus and controls my anxiety, all without clouding my head. I basically feel normal and like myself again. Kratom is the only thing that has worked for me.\n \nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8645","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have anxiety and back pain.\nKratom helps me manage my personal issues.\nIf kratom is banned i will have to use illigal, UN-TAXED, harmful narcotics. \n\nLet the states legeslate.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6015","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Chambers","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am posting for my husband.

After a bad car accident (of not my fault) left me with a fractured spine (in several spots) I was told I'd be in pain for the rest of my life- all before the age of 20. Post accident I was written prescriptions left and right for nerve damage, pain and the resulting mental illness (depression). The pain medications (all various opiates from dilaudid to hydrocodone) definitely helped cover the pain but did nothing for my life improvement. I quickly got addicted and ended up failed out of college, self harming and nearly suicidal. Going through constant withdrawal until my next prescription and running out too early from taking more than prescribed. It sucked because while I knew I couldn't be on these substances (for health and social/work/general life reasons) I could hardly function due to pain. A double edged sword. Then a friend told me about Kratom, sold at my local health and wellness store. I was skeptical and at first used kratom to help ease withdrawal between prescriptions but then I noticed the pain relief AND it didn't make me foggy or tired. I never craved more kratom as I had the opiates. Ever. And still to this day (2 years of kratom) do not. Switching to kratom has helped me get my life back. I can work an 8 hour day and go to class with full focus and minimal pain. I can do normal things with my friends and family without worrying when my next 'dose' is. I'm a normal person. I actually feel like I contribute to my home and community. I am not a drain on resources. All other pain/accident prescribed medications are out of my life- for the better. Kratom has helped me become me again, someone I sorely missed when opiates had their grasp on me.\n\nIf kratom becomes schedule 1 I am terrified for my future. Will I be able to continue to excel at work? Will I be able to finish and graduate college? All because pain is back to controlling my life? Will it be so bad I have no choice but to go back on opiate medications? \n\nPlease hear us. Kratom saves. It doesn't kill.

The list already contains marijuana as a schedule 1 drug along with heroin.  That is ludicrous and it is time lawmakers and the DEA wake up to what Americans want and need and remove cannabis, as a medicinal product, from the \"list,\" and make it retroactive.  The mandatory minimums and old laws from the war on drugs are corrupt; throwing people in jail for longer than murderers and child molesters get! The mandatory minimums should be repealed and any politician on the hill that supports or seeks to lengthen them is deceiving the American public and committing the worse and most destructive type of tyranny against Americans.\n\nLegalizing cannabis is happening in more & more states.  The only reason I can see that the DEA is not eliminating cannabis from the list is perhaps because Big Pharma is paying them off.  The only reason DEA is trying to add Kratom is to fatten its pocketbook while its costing over $80 billion per year to house and incarcerate the 2.4 million imprisoned; the majority for a medicinal plant!  Even the FBOP Director & Inspector General want reduction and rehab for drug offenders. Why can't the politicians & lawmakers listen and get these laws repealed?  Obviously the old laws are not working and criminal justice reform is needed, not tightening and lengthening already corrupt and abusive laws in a criminal justice system that has become abusive and unjust!  Serving the American public and making America Great Again doesn't mean destroying it through these unjust criminal justice system tactics.  It has been proven that the length of the sentence does not improve the chance of rehabilitation.  Just the opposite.  Folks need a chance to get re-trained and go through rehabilitation to be able to contribute and rejoin society.  Any politician that opposes such a program should be kicked out of office.  Any change of administration should not be a return to the old ways of lock them up and throw away the key; nor an extension of mandatory minimums. That only shows how ignorant and backwards such tactics have become in our \"injustice\" system.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20566","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom saved my life, I'm able to have a functional life that is not co-dependent on alcohol and able to go to school and better myself each day with the help of Kratom.

At first it just kept me from being sick coming off the Suboxones that were prescribed by the doctors. I was in a place where I was stuck between not wanting to be an addict yet hopelessly losing the battle to the professionals answer which happened to be Suboxone or methadone. After the addiction to Pills  came the addiction to Suboxone which was just as bad if not worse then the pills.  Kratom doesn't make me sick when I am without. Kratom does not leave me feeling helpless. It is about as mine altering as a cup of coffee. No physical dependency or withdrawal symptoms. I am still asking myself what in the world one could find negative about this substance?  Kratom comes from the same plant family as coffee and is in no way negative to our ability to function.

My name is Sarah Oliver and I am a twenty two year old woman living in Colorado with my small, but close, family. I have been taking kratom for six years. I have been experiencing severe and debilitating chronic pain my entire life, which has impacted my mental health in the past. This pain prevented me from getting any sleep, ever. I lost so much weight because I could not eat. I  nearly even lost my life to suicide. I lost the ability to stay standing for more than a few minutes at a time and have been dependent on a mobility aid since my freshman year of college. I suffer from a plethora of conditions that make day-to-day life almost unbearable, but I press on every day and have actively been taking charge of my own life. I am proud to say that I am pursuing a degree again after my chronic pain stole away my first attempt at higher education, as well as both my jobs, and I am working with a doctor who supports my choice to choose kratom to make my pain a little bit better. I am not making any health claims when I say this; I take kratom because my pain prevents me from being able to stand up and take care of myself, and I suffer. I want to be able to stand up long enough to prepare food to myself, and I want to be able to help out around the house, and I want to be able to walk outside and check the mail. When I found kratom, I was struggling to adjust to my disabled body. My abilities had changed so drastically and so quickly, and I was still so young. The frustration of not being able to walk like I used to was awful. I came across kratom in a little shop along a street in Savannah, and was told that other customers buy it for their back pain. I bought it, and Im very glad I made that decision. Kratom helps me because even though there is nothing I can do about my illness and I still wake up in exhausting pain every morning, I know that when I take my kratom, I wont be in such a state of suffering that I cant get out of bed and I will be able to have some sort of quality of life. I want to maintain this quality of life. I have never experienced any form of respiratory depression from taking kratom, and kratom has never caused me to suffer. Kratom has not cured my illness, but it is an immense blessing for me. Please save kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15264","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Oliver","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 35yr old father, husband, and am employed full time in IT.

If we don't have our health then what do we have? \n\nWhy punish those who seek a more natural treatment for themselves rather than known addictive substances that have shown to destroy lives, families, and cause death??\n\nEveryone sees the epidemic of narcotic drug abuse & death in this country, why take away a more healthy alternative to that which is non addictive & does not ruin people's lives?\n\nIf Kratom becomes illegal you leave people w/ chronic pain no choice of what to use for relief. \nYou create a bigger monster, more lives destroyed, more children w/out parents, more parents w/ out children.\n\nPlease don't leave us w/out a choice, that's what made this country & makes this country great = choice!\n\nPlease keep Kratom legal, it gives people like me the ability to have joy again, to feel normal again, to hold their children again. \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17267","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matt M","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I take it as a pain killer alternative as I don't like opiates and have a shoulder that needs surgery.

DEA should be focusing on really dangerous drugs that are killing many people.   Kratom is a very good and safe substitue for those more dangerous substances.  Kratom is habit forming, yes to some degree, but so is chocolate, soda pop, fast foods, and many other things.  We should have the right to choose.  Making it Schedule I would greatly hamper research into this potentially very useful plant.  If the DEA makes it illegal, I will bet it is the influence of big Pharma.

I hope that my comment, along with many others will help keep Kratom save, legal, and regulated like tobacco and alcohol. Opioid addiction dependency is something that can happen to anyone. It is not something that is reserved for teenagers looking for a high. I imagine my story is going to be told over and over in these comments. For me, pain pills were just a once in a while recreation used to help with a sore back or when I just wanted to relax. I graduated with a bachelors and got a good full time job right out of college in 2009 (worst time to come out of college). Then, like many people, I began self-medicating and turned a once in a while recreation into an everyday habit. It did not affect my work, but it turned into a regular thing to get normal. It took a huge event to scare me off to quit cold turkey. I felt the after effects of Vicodin withdrawal for at least 3 months. \nThis disgusting habit was a huge financial burden and the craving always remained. A friend told me about Kratom as a cheap, safe and effective pain relief. After one use, my craving was completely gone. Unlike opioids, it doesnt actually get you high or mellow your mood. You function the same as normal but it helps with aches and pains from sports or whatever else. As someone who has tried to quit with other drugs like suboxone and weening myself off, this was much more effective. It simply gets rid of your craving and feels much like a real good cup of coffee or green tea. \nI get that Drugs are not accepted in society as an illness. It is a stigma and we throw people with addiction under the normalcy of society and force people to hide it or even worse, put a blotch on their criminal record or throw them in jail. Many countries around the world have figured this out but we lag far behind. The kratom community is not a large one but it has helped us. We are 100% supportive of regulation and age restrictions but banning it would be horrible for us. Its not only a potential research opportunity but it saves lives now. Banning natural herbs that help responsible adults will only drive us back into the spirals of previous life. There is a real opioid epidemic that our society is struggling to solve. Getting rid of options for people who dont want to be addicted to pain killers in their 30s is the opposite of what we should be doing. Please hear us and take our voices into account.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1552","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom.

The prescribed medication does not work for my problems and has limited my abilities greatly these past 3 weeks. \nBecause of previous surgeries on my stomach and other issues I cannot have nsaids, steroids, etc. I cannot eat without pain medication, I also have arthritis, disk problems and , fibromyalgia. I  am having a spine surgery in 2 weeks.  \nKratom over the last 2 years had gotten me off most prescribed medication and gave me the ability to be active with my children, go on walks, shop, etc.\nin  trying to do without it this last month, even with narcotic pain perscribed medication, I have been less able to perform my daily activity, in  pain throughout my entire day, and less able to perform my needed household things. \nLast month I took a 2 mile hike with my family. Last week without it and with hydrocodone I could not do a half mile before my. Back was hurting too much to stay outside. For me it will change my life dramatically not having it. It has been the difference in being able to take part in normal living activities with limited pain.\n I have no alternative medication that works for my pain issues. It scares me and upsets me that I have to loose something that over the last 2 years had given me my life back. I was supposed to be on medication like methotrexate, and prednisone, was a regular need, along with Toridol shots, muscle relaxers, and hydrocodone. Even then I was in pain daily.\n Although I still have pain, when using only 2 kratom every 4 to 6 hours, I have relief and am able to live almost normal. Without steroid, nsaids, or methotrexate ..all of which I cannot have anymore because it would cause my stomach to bleed now. \nI am agreed in one thing of kratom study, and that is that I would feel better if it was bottled and I knew every time I bought it it was true to be the strength or quality it is supposed to be. In the same way I purchase my vitamins I would like to know it came from a reputable source. \nI am a grandmother and a full time caregiver. Taking away kratom will prevent me from participating in most of the family things I have for the first time in years been able to do. It will also limit my ability to complete my home needs. My life will change greatly if I cannot legally have access to kratom and its benefits to my life. It will cost me more in medical appointments and medications that have side effects that make me feel miserable . Please reconsider the direction this is going.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

Some options, as opiates, feed into the ever-growing opioid addiction epidemic, while other alternative dietary supplements, as Kratom, not only mitigate and provide relief from suffering, but can also be utilized to assist those with opioid addictions to safely wean and withdraw from opiate use, lessen the super harsh withdrawal side effects of opiates, and mainly support a natural, more healthful lifestyle and life choices. This is true for me personally, an active 62-year young, public school teacher who aggressively and lovingly educates a classroom full of energetic 3rd graders daily in a Title 1 School here in Las Vegas.\n\nAs the Information Age and social media opens up our world to vast stores of information, folks as myself are more empowered to do their own research and discover alternative ways or methods to enhance the quality of their lives and to become more healthy in the process.  Kratom has had a positive effect and impact on 3 to 5 million Americans today who have willingly come forward to share their personal experiences with Kratom, which, by the way, many such individuals have attested to successfully withdrawing from opiates while consuming Kratom. Overall, the vast population of Kratom consumers will happily share with you their much improved health and well-being, reduced suffering from existing conditions, and gratitude that they had at last found Kratom! This as well, has also encouraged me to step forward and speak about my own happy experience to you. \n\nThe streams of Grass Roots, positive affirmations that Kratom is both safe and healthful should mean something to our nations Lawmakers, and I pray that my letter will be added to support Kratom because I have used Kratom and have also benefited greatly in my health, well-being, and stamina as both as a senior citizen, but also as a full-time elementary school teacher with a classroom full of energetic third graders. Over the years I have written to you and signed petitions about my growing concern with the health industry to both you and in the newspapers.  Recently, out of desperation, I did my own research and decided to try Kratom.  My family members and friends know how awful and debilitating my own chronic health had been for over a decade, and can tell you theres a light years positive difference today with me consuming Kratom.  To my amazement, Kratom is really helpful, and is truly safe.  My wish is for Kratom to remain freely available and it also would be wonderful if my teachers health insurance would cover some of the cost because it is a bit expensive. But I am thrilled at this point, and would gladly come to testify as a citizen if called to do so.\n\nTruly, Kratom does not belong on the Scheduled Substance List.  Kratom should continue to be available as a dietary supplement for conscientious consumers like myself, in the health market.  Individuals are far better served in such a way, and this practice is sustainable, freeing up our country and community to pursue other more pressing concerns that affect our quality of life.\n\nThank you for your time reading my letter of support for Kratom, for your kind consideration in keeping Kratom off the Scheduled Substance List, and for continuing to make Kratom available to the health conscious and aware public consumer.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2216","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Star Mistriel","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I really think you need to listen to all the people who are in pain and those who are addicted to heavy drugs who say that this really works.

I desperately wish for a shift in attitudes of acceptance towards substances that adults take both recreationally and medicinally.  Currently on the docket is kratom so I will focus comments on it.  I've only been using kratom for about 6 months and only found it on my quest to find a legal way to feel good.  As a 32 year old adult, that is absolutely my prerogative to pursue happiness in any way I see fit and it should be without fear of an ominous government force that actively engages in passing laws and regulations that would see me, a fully responsible adult who pays taxes and dutifully shows up to work each day and doesn't bother a soul, possibly tossed in jail/prison just for seeking a little thrill.  Ranting aside, my experience with kratom specifically is that it's really not that much different or intense than coffee.  You worry about this as an addictive entity, it's not; at least no more than you could mentally become addicted to anything. Granted I only use about once a week, but I've not dealt with any withdrawal symptoms ever.  The potential for abuse is low because at higher doses the effects become unpleasant.  Everything I've read about it has indicated that it does NOT lower your heart rate like opiates do and the deaths that supposedly have been attributed to kratom are not the kratom itself, but it's because they were in combination with other pharmaceuticals.  Folks who have been addicted to opiates are using kratom to get off of opiates.

I have worked since the age of 15. I have 3 grown children and have bone on bone knees due to 25 years of kitchen work and 20 years of skiing and ski instructing. Ten years ago I was close to being disabled. I went to several doctors and they concluded I need 2 new knees. the pain was and is terrible. I was prescribed many different opioids and eventually became an addict. one doc had me on 240- 80 mg. oxcycontins per month. after a long and sickening addiction, I tired kratom as I was close to death or suicide. within a period of 3 or 4 days, my addiction, the cravings, the never ending search was over. I no longer cared about the opiate and have gotten my life back. I have used kratom ( 6 to 10 grams) per day for about 3 years. I have better control of pain and feel as though kratom saved my life. I have been without kratom and have never experienced any withdrawls or discomfort. kratom can not be abused to get \"high\" as its natural safe guard, if you take too much you get tired, maybe naseau but no high. I have better focus to deal with everyday jobs and don't have to worry about over dose, going to jail and not breaking the law. to me kratom is a miracle and needs to be in all doctors playbooks. please, please do not ruin this safe and effective natural herb. please call me with ANY questins. scott sandquist","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5464","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"scott sandquist","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi I'am 41 years young thanks to a botanical plant/leaf that can be made into a tea. Kratom has been around for centuries as well as over 20 plus years here in the USA. Close to 5 million Americans consume kratom. Kratom has helped my aches and pains and chronic fatigue tremendously. I'am a husband with three children with a demanding work schedule, and kratom has been a blessing in my life, giving me a life of quantity and quality. Kratom is not a drug its no different then coffee or black tea or green tea. I use many other herbs that are on the market as well that have virtually no side effects. Kratom is effective in treating opiate withdrawals for people trying to get off them. Opiates are so dangerous with a lot of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention and bloating, constipation, liver damage, brain damage due to hypoxia, resulting from respiratory depression, tolerance, dependence and even death. Please keep this plant legal, if the government is going to make kratom illegal and waste tax payers money than you might as well make espressos at star bucks illegal as well,  soda or or beer or liquor for that matter. Please reconsider a possible ban on this plant. The kratom community has been through alot over the last couple of months we have spoke up on this issue and the benefits of this plant through already doing one comment period, calling law enforcement and politicians as well as peaceful protests all across the usa. WE HAVE BEEN MAKING OUR VOICES HEARD. Has there been any deaths in the last 3 months??? NO! At least we could meet in the middle on this issue some how some way.

There have been under 10 reports of accidental overdose, while alcohol has thousands of deaths per year and is legal. According to 2015 statistics, there were more instances of tylenol intoxication that kratom intoxication. There is no reason that kratom should be scheduled, and to do so would be encouraging hard drug users to choose worse drugs like heroin or perscription pills over a natural herb supplement. This is am example of government shutting down home remedies which can not be strictly perscribed or control, in favor of profit gains of large pharmaceutical companies that profit off of users addicted to Schedule II pills. Kratom could easily go through an FDA approval mechanism or at peast oversight, and there would be no scientific basis for a ban. E-cigarettes remain legal despite similar regulation issues. Furthermore, these electronic vaporizing devices have had more proven intoxication results with far worse consequences than that of alleged kratom overdoses. I strongly encourage the DEA to reconsider this ban, and question who is being helped versus harmed by a potential ban.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7727","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Liam O'Neil","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This drug should remain legal.

Kratom, a relative to coffee, has many benefits. Kratom provides users a safer alternative to prescription pills for many different things. Kratom can help with anxiety, pain, depression and many other ailments. Unlike Rx, Kratom is 100% natural. Kratom has also been proven safe and effective in easing users ofo heroin,  benzodiazepine and other common opiates. Our country's heroin use is out of control. It has become an epidemic. Kratom can help get people off the life-ruining drug. Also, there is a common misconception that Kratom gets users high. This is false. During my use (for anxiety and back pain) I experience a feeling of well being. Kratom is not even close to how psychoactive Marijuana is- a plant that, which I agree has medical benefits, is more inebriating than Kratom. And despite the high that users obviously get from Marijuana, it's becoming legal and more accepted across the nation. To me it doesn't make any sense to make Kratom illegal. It will do more harm than good. Please, keep this safe, wonderful plant unscheduled.

Since the DEA's choice to not reschedule marijuana off the schedule 1 lising, I've lost faith in the DEA's presense as a protective agency. Cannabis has medical benefits and it is being actively used to help people. Legal on the state level in some states.  I thought the rescheduling of that plant was a no brainer of sorts. I can't fathom any reason not to reschedule it with all the research and testomy of it's positive effects from your own citizens and the people who pay your salary. Job preservation for the business of law enforcement and corrections instituations,  and/or a cooperative effort with the pharma industry is the only rationale answer I'm left with. \n\nI don't use Kratom and at present I'm not a regular marijuana user, i have however heard from people I know about their benefits and I've heard experts in science and medicine discuss the uses of each. I fear that like Marijuana, Kratom is being set up to be put on an illegal listing for reasons not in the best interests of the US citizens it seems to help. At the very least there should be time allowed to research this and we all know based on your own history that once its put on the bad list it never leaves no matter what. \n\nI'm here to ask that the DEA looks upon this as a threat to it's citizens health, not a threat if Kratom use is allowed, but a threat if it's made illegal. Many people including veterans of our countries wars are using this product to help with pain and its keeping them from the spiral of more severe drug addictions to opiate based pills that are found already to be killing thousands a year, but are legal and prescribed by doctors every day. \n\nI would ask that you use good judgement and prove to be the agency many of us thought you were, but now have serious doubts.

I've been cigarette free for over 2 and a half years and rarely drink alcohol (maybe twice a month at most). I have a healthy smoothie that I make every day when I get home from work and then spend quality time with my wife and 2 and half year old daughter. We have one more daughter coming around Nov. 4th.\n\nWhen I heard that the DEA published a letter (on Aug 31st 2016) of intent to schedule Kratom (on Sept 30th 2016) I was horrified.\n\nThe company I've always used to purchase Kratom from is super professional and I really love them over there. Great customer support, great product consistency, etc. Two months ago they moved to a new warehouse in a new state to streamline things. I'm sure they had to sign a year lease on the space... What now, they just default on payments and go out of business? What about all the other small businesses just like them?\n\nHonestly, I'm having a hard time coping with the idea that I could go to bed one night and wake up the next morning a criminal because I still have some Kratom left over from my last order... The DEA is pushing this WAY too quickly. We need a public forum for our voices to be heard. This is not a 'bath salts' situation; no matter how much they try to make it sound the same. I have taken 7 grams of dried powdered leaf 3 times a day (21 grams/day) for over 3 years. The only ill effect in the beginning was having harder stools. That passed within two weeks. Now there's NO negative at all. I take it in the morning and go about my business; just like someone might do with St. John's Wort or Chamomile Tea.\n\nAs you are probably already aware; in the U.S., Kratom has become popular among people coping with chronic pain and others trying to wean themselves off opioids or alcohol. The main chemical is mitragynine. It binds to some of the same receptors as opioids, providing some pain relief and a calming effect, but, NOT the same high. It's important that I state this: The plant and its chemicals are NOT Opioids. The chemical doesn't cause the same, sometimes deadly, side effects as opioids, such as respiratory depression.\n\n\"\"On August 31, the Drug Enforcement Agency published a \"notice of intent\" in the Federal Register\nstating its plan to list the herb as a Schedule I substance, the most restrictive category, alongside\nheroin and LSD, effective September 30th with no opportunity for a public comment period.\"\"\n\nI was very active in helping to tell the FCC that internet providers should be treated like utilities because these days the internet is a necessity. I helped sway the FCC's decision and I really hope to help sway the DEA's decision.\n\nHeck if they wanted to ban synthetic chemicals derived from the plant; or even highly potent extracts of the leaf I'd be ok with that. BUT; the regular leaf should remain legal. And even if the ultimate decision is made to ban it; it should be done in a year after open public forums and stories like mine reverberating throughout the country.\n\nAlabama actually banned Kratom a while back and their overdose rates went up because people were going back to their \"old ways\".\n\nThe DEA cites about 15 poison control center calls involving Kratom; but I want to point out that all of those cases had several other drugs in their systems as well. To put it in perspective, more than 15 people died falling out of bed within the past 6 months.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0010","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Greg Walker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"ANONYMOUS, 42yr old Female, Pharmaceutical Logistics Sr. Associate (Professional)\n\nI believe the request by the DEA to make Kratom a Schedule I controlled substance is unfair, inaccurate, and irresponsible.  I have had little to NO side effects from using Kratom.  There is much concern to what will happen to people if the DEA has their way.  I believe it should be up to the person on what works best for them in using Kratom, I have personally found NO dangers in using it. I sincerely hope that the DEA/government will decide to leave this innocent leaf alone and the people who appreciate its uses.  I hope they respect us enough to let us decide for ourselves what we need and it isnt Opioids.\nIn the fall of 2010, I was diagnosed with no disc between my L5-S1 and neck problems (the bones in my neck look the opposite of what a neck should look like in an x-ray).  Because of this issue, I had severe pain in my legs, radiating from my back (sciatica).  I developed issues in my feet where I could barely walk for at least an hour in the morning.  I have worn heels and flat shoes most of my life. I was sworn to wearing tennis shoes with business attire for work.  There werent many options for me because of my job.  I had headaches DAILY; all day every day.  It was getting so bad that I was having approximately 4 migraines a month for over a year.  I considered leaving my job as the breadwinner and doing something less stressful on my body and without the commitment of getting up every day at a certain time to go to work.  I was depressed and miserable.  Enough was enough for me!\nIn regards to my medication and lifestyle; I ONLY used pain medication when I was in pain; started in 2010 with 5 mg Hydrocodone, then 2011 moved to 7.5mg Hydrocodone, and 2014 moved up to 10mg Hydrocodone with Percocet (2-3 per week @ 5mg).  With Opioids you develop a tolerance and then you need to increase the mg/dosage in order to have the same effect in reduction of pain (pain was never eliminated).  In addition to pain medication, I used approximately 800-1600mg of ibuprofen a day.  Just to be clear, I do not have an addictive personality, nor do I drink alcohol, or take any illicit drugs or experiment with anything that is not given by a doctor or pharmacy (OTC).  I am a responsible adult, who has her own home, cars, and a job that Ive had for over 12 years.  The job before that I had for over 7 years.  I am what you call a steady Eddie.  I follow the law to the letter, no misdemeanors or felonies, no problems with the law&.Ive gotten only 2 traffic tickets in my whole life. I am married with 2 stepsons and 2 dogs.  I only eat out 1-2x a week; I typically eat salads, fruits, veggies, and low fat meat, some healthy carbs. \nOver a year and a half ago, I began looking into trying Kratom.  This started because I had been tossed around for 4 years between a back doctor, 3 pain management doctors,  2 other specialists/doctors, a chiropractor, 2.5 years of physical therapy (2-3x a week), 3 steroid injections in my back, change in different types of pharmaceuticals, changing DEA laws, and the changing pharmacy issues.  I, again, had had enough!  I had heard it could help with pain reduction and increase quality of life.  I was not yet a believer until I tried it.  I use it as a tea and add nothing to it except Stevia (because it is quite bitter).  For over a year now, I make 2-3 Kratom teas a day, using approximately a teaspoon at a time.  I sip on those and within 15 minutes, my pain is reduced.  I have not used pain medication since the DAY I tried the Kratom tea.  I still have my pain medication sitting in my medicine cabinet that I stopped that day.  I had tried stopping before, cold turkey, and could not do it; because of pain AND body addiction.  I had no cravings after my 2nd Kratom tea.  My feet quit hurting literally, within hours of drinking the tea, they have NEVER hurt like they did before.  The best I can explain is that it feels like it blocks the craving for an opioid and then reduces pain; A sense of warmth in my back and feet and neck.  I rarely have to take any ibuprofen, usually because I have a headache here and there (about once a week).  I have only had 2 migraines in over a year.  Im not sure what caused what and when, but I can tell you that I am a TON better off without Opioids and with Kratom.  I have had no side effects from the Kratom tea.  I went from missing time at work, to back to my old self of never missing work.  I enjoy my life now, more appreciative of what I have, because I was so miserable for so long.  My husband knows the difference because he lives with me.  He is also very thankful for Kratom.  It has made a world of difference in not only my life, but in my relationships with others.  I can be myself again.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18097","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI am an entrepreneur and small business owner, who has been utilizing kratom for about ten years.

He is a father, husband and sole bread-winner of the family. This is in response to the DEA's intention to make Kratom a Schedule I substance. It includes a great amount of information on what Kratom is and the what will happen if the DEA goes through with the emergency scheduling.\n\nThanks,\n\nFaye\n\nDear DEA,\n \nPlease remove Mitragynine & 7-hydroxymitragynine which is in Kratom from becoming a Schedule I substance.\n \nI am 29 and suffer from a herniated disc, chronic neck pain, TMJ, arthritis in my neck. I support a family of four on a single income as a Help Desk Tech. I have been to many doctors with little success for treatment. I have found that Kratom improves my quality of life after a hard days work. It isnt comparable to any drugs, marijuana, alcohol or other stimulants.  Kratom helps to improve my quality of life that I suffer with chronic pain. Please dont make this herb illegal. Cervical injections, botox injections, chiropractic care, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, yoga exercises have not helped with my pain.\n \nKratom is a well-known, well-researched herbal substance drawn from the leaves of trees within the coffee family. The number of cases of documented harm from kratom use is remarkably low, both as an absolute matter and when considered against the extensive history of use of kratom, both inside and outside the United States\n \nMitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are two of the primary alkaloids of this plant. These two compounds are not synthetic and should not be lumped together with  \"bath salts\" or \"spice\".\n \nKratom has been used as a medicine by many people for thousands of years. It is a potent remedy for physical pain, anxiety and depression, and could be used to aid with opiate withdrawal by those who would like to quit using illicit drugs such as heroin. Kratom is NOT a hallucinogen and should not be classified as such. Adding mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as a Schedule I substance is rash and unjustified prohibition, resulting in a foreseeable increase in street drug-related crime, as well as a punishment to those who are currently using it responsibly to treat various ailments.\n\nThe reason that there are no deaths solely attributed to Kratom is because Kratom does not affect your respiratory capacity. It does not slow down your central nervous system. It's potential to do harm is virtually impossible.\n\nKratom has very limited recreational capacity.  The White House petition has over 100,000 signatures for the \"Please do not make Kratom a Schedule I Substance.\" \n\nThe federal government has invested significant resources to develop alternative pain management strategies. This includes a study funded by the National Institutes of Health in partnership with the University of Massachusetts and the University of Mississippi to investigate the use of Kratom as a remedy for opioid withdrawal. This study led the researchers to apply for a patent identifying the Kratom extract, mitragyinine, as a useful treatment for other addictive drugs besides opiate derivatives. The DEAs decision to place Kratom as a Schedule I substance will put a halt on federally funded research and innovation surrounding the treatment of individuals suffering from opioid and other addictionsa significant public health threat. Remember the DDear Colleague Letters of Senator Hatch and Congressman Mark Pocan.\n \nWe hope you realize the threat this scheduling causes the people seeking legitimate use of this special plant to improve our quality of life.

The\n benefits I experienced were very positive witch included but not limited to complete relief in pain with a very small dose 2g,\n  no dizziness, a slight boost in energy and quite relaxed. I did not have any negative side effects. I know it is impossible to over\ndose because you will vomit before you can OD and the taste is the most prohibitive thing about it.

I am not addicted to in any way shape or form. I think it is BS that the DEA wants to ban it blaming\n it on 15 supposed deaths when other  legal so called drugs cause more deaths a year than Kratom. I believe Kratom shout not\n be scheduled at all because there is no drug in it. I know the DEA knows all one does it take a tree leaf and dry it out then\n powder it. There are ZERO negative psychological effect of the plant and it is suggested it may hel some of the nastier \npsychological disorders like withdrawal, depression and eating disorders. But the most troubling thing about the DEA moving\n to ban Kratom is that this action would be done with out congressional approval. In closing I believe Kratom is safer that opiate \ndrugs because it is a natural remedy to chronic pain mostly for my self and has many other benefits that need to be studied.\nLastly it would be crazy to over night make a very small percentage of the population felons when there are worse legal drugs\ncausing the bulk of crimes that attention should be paid to long before questioning a plant that has been used for centuries that \ndose not require the use of opiates.

A truck hit my car and it killed my brother instantly, the next day at the hospital one of my twins, Kirsten died and both my other twin, Kelsie and I were hospitalized.  Our major injuries included Kelsie having a lacerated liver and I had a broken back.  My father gave up on life and died 2 years later.  Over half of my family was gone.  While in the hospital I was given opioid pain pills, benzodiazepines and soma muscle relaxers.  When I left the hospital my doctor continued to prescribe me these medications.  Not long after, I found myself addicted to these drugs, especially the opioids.  My husband was in the Army but was granted a discharge due to the severity of the accident and our family situation.  He also became addicted to these drugs.  I found myself putting myself at risk by going to the streets to get more of the pain pills.  What was left of my family quickly started to fall apart.  My husband and I were in and out of rehabs and had many relapses.  We found kratom and all we know is that this plant has helped us.  I struggle with anxiety, depression, pain and addiction issues and he struggles with anxiety and addiction issues.  We found that when we would take kratom we did not crave other drugs, especially opiates or synthetic opioids.  It also gave us a sense of well-being, energy and helped me with pain.  Today we are responsible adults that no longer seek drugs.  My husband finally was able to obtain his BA in Business Management and I finally was able to obtain my BS in Psychology and I am currently working on my MS in Professional Counseling.  We use kratom responsibly and we are productive citizens.  I do not ever want to go back to all the different pharmaceutical medications I was on because I was not a productive member of society.  I took from society.  Now both my husband and I give back to society.  We are great spouses, parents and productive American citizens!  I think that kratom should have an age restriction similar to those for alcohol or cigarettes.  I also think an organization should monitor kratom so that irresponsible people cannot mix dangerous substances with it.  To me alcohol is more of a health crisis than kratom.  We see more alcohol related deaths.  I do not think that it should have to be dispensed by a doctor so they and the pharmaceutical companies can make more profit.  They are rich enough.  Alcohol is very addictive and a doctor does not have to dispense it.  Taking kratom does not make you \"high\" like opiates or other dangerous drugs.  It is more like drinking a good cup of coffee that gives you a sense of well-being with the bonus of helping to ease pain.  It is wonderful for this country, especially with the opiate crisis we have here in the U.S..  Kratom helps people to stop taking dangerous substances such as, heroin, suboxone, synthetic opioids and even alcohol.  I ask you to please not schedule kratom at all.  It has helped way more people than it has hurt and the same cannot be said of legal substances, such as alcohol and cigarettes.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nRegina Caminita Gabilondo","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1285","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Regina Gabilondo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We don't need any more penal law enforcement for supplements deemed drugs.

Kratom is NOT a drug, it is a plant. The Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitraginine compounds in question by the DEA are naturally occurring chemicals, just like caffeine, ethanol, acetic acid, or lactose. Govenment has no authority to declare God's creation evil and withhold it from the People. A ban on Kratom is a violation of natural law and religious freedom. Furthermore, government has no authority to declare nature unnatural, or ban and withhold naturally occurring substances from the people. Government did not create nature and has no authority to take it away. A ban on Kratom, Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitraginine is just as absurd as a ban on milk, apples, or pepper.\n\n2.) Kratom, Mitragynine, and 7-Hydroxymitraginine are NOT dangerous or addictive. Rather, it is incredibly safe, especially in comparison to alcohol, tobacco, tylenol, ibuprofen, etc. Kratom is closely related to coffee and tea, and exhibits similar effects. If one attempted to overdose on Kratom to illicit negative effects, one would have to ingest copious, repulsive amounts and actively resist reflexive vomiting. It is just as ridiculous to expect one to eat a pound of coffee in one sitting as to eat an pound of kratom. It just does not happen. Do some people people become agitated or experience a slightly elevated heart rate when they drink too much coffee? Yes. The same harmless physiologic effects apply to kratom and are dealt with by common sense and cultural education about the plant's properties.\n\n3.) Kratom, Mitragynine, and 7-Hydroxymitraginine HELP thousands of people with a variety of physical and emotional ailments, including opiate addiction, chronic fatigue, obesity, and depression to name a few. Most significantly, Kratom has the potential to help curb the tragic opioid epidemic afflicting our nation. It is well known that heroin and prescription opioids are killing tens of thousands every year and rising. How many thousands of lives have already been saved by this not-well-known plant is unknown. But what is certain is that an unconstitutional, illogical, authoritarian, arbitrary ban placed by a small group of uninformed individuals in government will certainly result in the deaths of millions over the long term. \n\nFor these reasons and thousands more, the People of the United States of America implore DEA and government agencies to get informed about the reality of Kratom, Mitragynine, and 7-Hydroxymitraginine. It is NOT a drug, but a plant. It is NOT harmful, dangerous, or addictive. It IS BENEFICIAL for a myriad of reasons. Just try it out and talk to users, and you will understand and agree with aforementioned.\n\nIn God we trust and pray for your wisdom and right action.\n\nMost sincerely,\nJackson B.

Studying the possible benefits would be much harder post-scheduling.\n\nwww.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/without-kratom-promising-research-opioid-alternatives-may-suffer/\n\nAlso, making substances illegal - especially as schedule I - does more harm than good for people abusing drugs, who need help not punishment. If it's not a problem for many individuals, why make it one? The War on Drugs is a failure. Don't continue to cause harm by it.\n\nThank you for your time and this open comments period.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5630","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern:\n\nI believe introducing legislation on mitragyna speciosa is an error in judgement on behalf of the DEA.

Kratom has been safely used for thousands and thousands of years, with effects similar to coffee or tea. Kratom has lifesaving potential, as it has been used by thousands to get over opiate addiction and withdrawals. Furthermore, it has been used to heal those experience chronic pain, with little to no side effects. No one has ever died as a direct result of Kratom, it saves many lives from not only addiction, but constant pain. Banning Kratom would result in an increase of addictive opioids and opiate overdoses, as this has been shown in individual states that have banned Kratom. Kratom is not a drug in which you get \"high\" on, rather an herb similar to coffee. I believe banning Kratom will not be taking away a life saving medicine from those who need it, but it will be creating a black market, and only lead to more violence. Keeping Kratom legal is a must. Taking this life saving plant away from the thousands and thousands of people who need it is wrong.

I work full time as a Retail Manager.  I started drinking kratom about a year ago. I learned about this amazing leaf from a pain group on Facebook. I did extensive research before deciding to try it. I've never once had ill effects from this plant, unlike the narcotics Doctors were prescribing for my chronic pain. This is a natural plant, not a \"drug\" as most people whom are not educated on kratom might think. I believe it is a terrible idea to take my freedom to decide what I put in my body, when it's a natural plant. The claims that people have died from kratom alone are untrue, these people had drugs in their system as well. I do think that there should be some sort of regulation such as no kratom sold at gas stations or to anyone under 18. Kratom is related to coffee and tea, I don't believe coffee or tea should be banned though you can easily take in too much caffeine and actually die from it. My family supports me, and even some of my Doctors support my decision to drink this plant to help me function with severe chronic pain. Without this plant, I would be a very unproductive member of society, and probably living off the Government. I enjoy my freedom , and wish to not see this plant banned.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3400","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please reconsider the scheduling of Kratom.

Needless to say, I've experienced some off the stuff that has made its way into my head and is making my life difficult. I'm talking about PTSD.

Including three herniated discs in my lower back, which causes me a lot of pain. \nIn order to deal with all this baggage, the VA prescribed me their fare share of medicines. I felt like a total zombie, just out of it. On top of that, I was getting hooked on codeine and other opioids, not good. My brain felt like it was drying up inside, if that makes any since. So I started research natural pain relief and natural anti anxiety/depression herbals. My discover lead me to Kratom. I could give you a long history of where its from and what it is, but all you have to do is google it. It has completely changed my life. It's the type of herb that you can take when you need it.

I am a veteran of the United States Army, and love my country more than anything else.  When I first read of this folly to label Kratom a Schedule 1, I was taken back because of how insane it sounded.  I have had multiple surgeries on my shoulder which introduced me to the world of opioid analgesics.  I never said to myself, \"man, I can't stop taking them\" but I can relate to the MILLIONS of people who fight that struggle everyday.  I found Kratom in the Fall of 2014 and haven't looked back since.  It is not only an amazing pain reliever, but it's great for my overall mental well being.  I work as an analyst for the government so stress is part of my day to day.  I am not addicted to Kratom,  I have no ill side effects from the numerous strains I have encountered, and most importantly, I can honestly say Kratom is a life saver.  Who knows what would have happened if pain pills controlled my life, but with this essential plant I can firmly state I will never ever find out.  DEA,  please focus your time on something serious like the over medicating of our children with Ritalin, or the foreign threats of Heroin and other man made poisons.   Do your research on Kratom,  talk to the people who actually benefit from it, I promise you will be amazed at what you hear.  You have been lied to woth these stats of 15 deaths attributed to kratom.  I guarantee every single person had a different substance in their blood that caused death.  I am a veteran of this great nation's Army, I overcame extreme pain due to shoulder surgery, and I want to sleep well at night knowing my country's drug enforcement agency isn't going on a witch hunt while potentially killing untold amounts of people if they follow through with this debacle.  Contact me personally If you wany more feedback.  I take this very seriously the same way I am taking voting seriously tomorrow Novver 8th.

I have been supplementing with kratom tea for a year now. It has replaced Sam-E and my nerve medication, providing me with a more holistic alternative for helping my nerve damage, chronic pain, and emotional mood swings since my mother past away recently. It's like a multi-vitamin that helps me get through my busy days. I am able to have a clear head while I travel on business, speak at conferences, being a mom and a wife to a military veteran. I rely on this plant as much as I rely on my coffee every morning. It would be horrible if this supplement was taken away and banned. It's a plant, a herb that organic seeking people turn to in order to help manage some normal day to day physical hardships that happen to the best of us. Please do not ban this herb. I did a lot of search on the plant before adding it to my daily supplement regimen. \n\nI'm a professional woman, with a clean record, no substance abuse background, so this is absurd that DEA/FDA would even consider taking this away. It's like taking away Ginko Biloba! You walk into Whole Foods, half the stuff on the shelves are foreign and alternative...Just because kratom is one of those things most have not heard of, doesn't mean it's dangerous. \n\nHave you seen the possible side effects to Sam-E? If you don't know, the famous SamE is known to TREAT depression, anxiety, heart disease, fibromyalgia, abdominal pain, osteoarthritis, bursitis, tendonitis, chronic lower back pain, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, slowing the aging process, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), improving mental performance, liver disease, and Parkinson's disease. It is also used for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, seizures, migraine headache, lead poisoning, to break down a chemical in the body called bilirubin, or to help with disorders related to the buildup of a chemical called porphyrin or its precursors. Side effects? Sometimes cause gas, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dry mouth, headache, mild insomnia, anorexia, sweating, dizziness, and nervousness, especially at higher doses. It can also make some people with depression feel anxious..... Sounds a bit dodgy to me.... \n\nPoint is, it's a plant...that's been extremely misunderstood and mischaracterized. Additional research should continue without the need of a ban. There has been more deaths from laundry detergent balls than kratom....and laundry balls are still legal too..... (http://www.today.com/health/never-seen-anything-more-children-harmed-ingesting-laundry-pods-t88036).\n\nIt would be foolish to take away a plant that has had nearly to no reputable studies done and a massively small percentage of reported issues--that are questionable, to say the least. Im implore you, the DEA, the FDA, to see and hear the masses that are benefiting from this supplement and not be too hasty to take away a leaf that's from the coffee family...... Thank you for taking time out to read my comment in defense of a supplement I value right along with my Ginko Biloba.... Now excuse me as I drink my Monster Energy Drink that I have been addicted to since age 18 (You might want to research this drink BTW...I can swear it's a drug).

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA front-running the kratom market to help monopolize/monetize for Big Pharma?  Who is the corporate paymaster underwriting this brazen grab at monopoly power?  Or is it just the prison industrial lobby seeking to make everything illegal so that they can enhance their profits by converting the US to a prison state?\n\nNixon is dead, so is his War on Drugs.

Prior to that I had surgeries that were successful since the age of 17. As I age I find doctors less willing to help me with pain meds,  is the opposite of what I would expect. Normally as you age the pain increases when you have degenerate chronic illnesses.\n I was hit by a drunk driver when I was 11 and have had multiple surgeries and now I  have osteoarthritis in my joints from my waist down. So one of the  only meds they're willing to treat me with is suboxne which is an awful pain medication - it doesn't work very well in the long term. Kratom enhanced the ability of my Suboxone to actually work. It reduce the inflammation in my body immediately. I slept through the night over 2 hours at a time for the first time in years.\n I have reduced my medication from about 5 prescription and over-the-counter meds to one Suboxone about every 3 days really just to take the acute pain off and avoid withdrawal. Other than that the Kratom really treats the pain, reduces iinflammation,  enhances my sleep, reduces my allergies , helps my mental state and anxiety. I don't know why it does this or how but it does. I don't get high off of it although the tea does tend to make me a little drowsy for a short time.  I tend to stick to the powder but I don't get loopy, euphoric or a sstone feeling off of kratom. If I could think of any pharmaceutical that could do half of what the Kratom powder has done for me I would beg my doctor to provide that for me. \n I pay about $120 a month for my Kratom oon-line,  which is a big chunk of my monthly budget but it's worth it . Please consider the help and the risks which are very low that this ii not even a drug it's more of a food supplement or an herbal supplement. I think it helps people with very low risk factors. \nThe other thing I forgot to mention was I have been on  a  medically supervised diet program and the Kratom has regulated my hunger signals and my hormone levels, while they're  not to the level it was when I was in my twenties but at least re-activated my endocrine system again. I noticed I'm hungry when I'm supposed to be and not hungry when I'm not supposed to be which is new for me. \nIt is a whole body system balancer and reduces inflammation so that your body can find the balance it needs to center and rebuild itself.  It has been an answer to a pharmaceutical nightmare.

Although I have been prescribed many treatments for lowering my anxiety, the side effects of what I was given were often worse then the problem. The tranquilizers would leave me with no energy, often sleeping through important meetings or social events. The anti-depressants changed my whole mood and put me in an unhealthy state of mind. \n\nWhen I discovered Kratom, it was a godsend. A friend recommended a tea brewed from powdered Kratom leaves, and I noticed a difference immediately. It was a very subtle shift, but social situations stopped driving me crazy.

I can go to my nieces birthday parties without having to leave four or five times to calm down and get a hold of myself  amidst the laud noises and crowds of people.\n\nKratom tea has proven to be safe alternative to the prescription medicines recommended to treat my crippling anxiety.  I have not experienced any negative side effects, and loosing access to this wonderful herbal remedy is severely effecting my daily life. I haven't used it since September, when the website I use ran out due to the proposed ban. While I am back to suffering daily anxiety, I have not experienced anything resembling withdrawal symptoms.

I was what I call a Doctor prescribed drug addict. I have had back and knee problems for as long as I can remember. I was on Opioid Narcotics for many years and it almost wrecked my marriage and my life.\nMy overall health was steadily declining in my attempts to live a pain free life. The pain medications gave me stomach issues, nausea, loss of appetite (ILowest 99lbs. I'm 5'4\" and looked sickly), tension headaches and constipation. But above ALL of those side effects were my horrendous mood swings and detoxification. I felt mentally UNSTABLE while on pain medication. And if I was unable to get/take my prescriptions for some reason (usually the pharmacy would run out do to OVERWRITING of meds!) I would begin to detox after about 24hours. Detoxing is physical AND psychological torture. My body would spasm and ache worse than EVER before. I would vomit and have diarrhea. It was simply TORTURE. You begin to think irrationally. You feel everyone is against you and you will do almost ANYTHING to end the detox. \nThe mood swings from euphoria to manic was a daily occurrence, not just during detoxification. My children feared me and my husband loathed me. They didn't know which Mommy they were going to get and THAT is what forced me to explore alternatives. Since starting Kratom I have NO (NONE.ZIP.ZILCH.) side effects and my pain is managed beautifully! It truly saved my life...and my marriage. It should be my right to choose NATURAL remedies. Please reconsider this ban. These PLANTS are stopping opioid addiction and making is possible for addicts to get clean. The detox from meds is torture and these LEAVES capped ALL of the effects, for me. We need to make this plant MORE accessible! More people die from pharms than ANYTHING else!

One of my close friends in college did, however. He was a football player in high school and injured his back in a game. The doctors put him on hydrocodone and there began his addiction to opiate pain medication, which then expanded to all forms of pills from antidepressants, to antipsychotics, uppers, downers, and everything in between. At 17 he was prescribed opiate pain medication. 17! My brother is 17 and I could never imagine exposing him to opiates, I don't understand how doctors can feel okay prescribing these medications to children. \n\nThankfully my friend was able to beat his addiction with the help of his friends and family. My friends and I had to have multiple interventions with him, and I know his family did as well. This is how powerful these drugs are, and we give them this hall pass because they are prescribed by physicians. If my friend had been given kratom in high school he most likely never would have known his propensity for such drugs, and even if he had been exposed to them, he would not have had a prescription that he could used to get scripts filled online. \n\nI think kratom has its greatest potential with our nation's youth, especially those that play contact sports and are more prone to injury. The more kids we keep from getting prescribed opiates, the less exposed our nation's youth are to the drugs as a whole. All it takes is one kid's prescription to expose all of his or her friends to these drugs.

Due to these medical conditions I am required to take multiple pain and anxiety medications (likely for the rest of my life) just to get out of bed and function like a \"normal\" human being. The pain medications I am required to take cause unpleasant side effects and no doubt are harming my internal organs, Mitragyna Speciosa, A.K.A Kratom has been a miracle plant to me, reducing my pain and anxiety tremendously without the unpleasant side effects of Benzodiazepines and Opiod medications. With kratom I can greatly reduce and maybe one day even eliminate my need for these medications. I plead that the DEA and FDA give this miracle plant a chance, i strongly believe this plant can help millions of Americans suffering from chronic pain like my self, and help millions of other opiate dependent people. Here is some information on kratom: \n\nIt is known to be a natural analgesic, muscle relaxer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant (http://www.vice.com/read/why-banning-the-controversial-painkiller-kratom-could-be-bad-news-for-americas-heroin-addicts). I currently three medications that address these issues.\n\nAccording to Kratom Science (https://www.kratomscience.com/strains-effects-and-dosage): An important distinction is that unlike other administered drugs like oxycodone and morphine, kratom exhibits less dependency and addiction potential on the user. Over the last 4 years of using Tramadol, I have needed to increase the dose 3 times from 50mg 3 times a day to 5 times a day as my body had adjusted the prior dose and I was not finding relief . I am very cautious of not becoming too dependent on any one substance and believe that diversification with kratom can be beneficial to my pain management plan.\n\nVice News reports that it is used to wean addicts off of heroin (http://www.vice.com/read/why-banning-the-controversial-painkiller-kratom-could-be-bad-news-for-americas-heroin-addicts).\nThose with multiple sclerosis, back pain, chronic fatigue syndrome and Lyme disease have reported relief when using kratom.\n\nThere have been a limited number of deaths attributed solely to kratom. Only 15 reported in the last 10 years. The majority of overdoses where kratom is present, other drugs and alcohol were all contributing factors.  Unlike opioids, kratom does not suppress the breathing function, which is an element of overdosing.\nThese findings led me to try kratom. After trying different strains and dosing, I can say that my pain level decreases. I have not found any medication that completely takes away my pain. Kratom definitely knocks my pain down much more than my doctor prescribed medications and gives me about 4-5 hours of relief. I found that it gives me a little boost, allowing me to be more productive and get back to work. I have been pleased with the results and love that kratom is less toxic than opioids.\n\nOver 100,000 Americans signed a petition (including myself) to halt the DEAs two-year ban on kratom. During the temporary ban, the DEA would conduct studies on this natural supplement. To me, it makes more sense to conduct studies and then come to a conclusion on whether or not to ban kratom. It clearly helps at least 100,000 manage their pain in an era where taking any type of opioid is completely taboo. People with pain matter. Completely blocking access to kratom will have a direct impact on those who responsibly take pain medications to deal with a chronic medical issue.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the DEA to halt the ban until further studies can be performed. I believe that I represent the majority of patients with chronic pain who use opioids. We are responsible and educated. Yes, there is an opioid epidemic in this country. However, taking away a natural supplement that could replace an opioid as pain management doesnt make any sense.\n\nThanks for your time, \n\nEvanni Dominguez \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23123","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Evanni Dominguez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This drug clearly helps people overcome addictions to give their family, their friends and most importantly themselves a second chance.\n\nSincerely, \nStephen McIntyre","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9894","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephen McIntyre","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nMy name is Zachary Temple, I am a 24-year-old male who works in the IT field and I oppose the upcoming ban on kratom. I have been using kratom 1-3 times a week as a dietary supplement for roughly 2 years now.\n\nHere is my story...\n\nAll of my life I have suffered from severe social anxiety. I always had problems talking to people, and even walking down the street making eye contact with people would cause me to experience extreme anxiety. Kratom is the only thing that I have found that effectively helps with my social anxiety. Once I began occasionally taking kratom before work, my entire demeanor changed. I went from the quiet guy in the corner, to an outgoing friendly person.\nMy managers soon noticed that I was completing my work in a timely manner with quality and helping others when I could. I have since been promoted and now manage a group of people. Without kratom I do not believe I would have been promoted to a management position. To hear the DEA claim that kratom is a risk to public health almost seems absurd. It really disheartens me that they would do something like that, the DEA is supposed to be a government agency for public safety, but if this scheduling proceeds as planned, more harm than good will be done. \nI am far more concerned with people who use kratom for their chronic pain management than I am concerned about myself. When kratom gets banned, many who used kratom to ween off of pharmaceutical prescription opiate painkillers may be forced to return back to them, or even worse, be forced to turn to the street to buy illegal opiates (heroin or other painkillers). This is an important issue to me as I grew up in a small town that was overrun with heroin and painkiller abuse, which has affected me immensely. One of my close friends has passed away from this epidemic, and I lost contact with a couple of other friends who stole from me or other friends to support their drug habit. \nI do not always take kratom 1-3 times during the week and often have a couple of weeks where I do not take kratom at all because I know using any supplement as a crutch will not help with an anxiety order in the long term.\nI have never experienced any form of withdrawal symptoms on the days or weeks that I do not take kratom.\nI believe kratom is on the same level as kava, valerian root, or St. John's wort and that it should remain a dietary supplement along with the mentions supplements.\n\nPlease consider the effect that a ban of kratom will have upon Americans.\n\nThank you for your time,\n                                              Zachary Temple","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16308","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zachary Temple","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My husband has had back pain for years.

At the time I was lost, my life was off track and I felt I had dug myself deep down in a dark hole. My brother was battling cancer, and was prescribed Oxycontin for pain management. When he was in remission, he was still going through a lot and found himself depending on his prescription to get him through the day, regardless of there being any pain or not. The last thing he needed was anymore adversity on his plate, so he looked into alternatives which is how he found Kratom. The weight lifted off his shoulders was visibly noticeable once he realized there was a way out of addiction. I began researching Kratom because I was concerned my brother was ingesting something that could cause him more harm. I found out that Kratom could also help me with my life, so I began taking it in moderation to see if it was right for me. It has helped me immensely in the last seven years. I have severe anxiety and mild depression, and nagging pain from a herniated disc in my lower back. I have never been opposed to people treating these conditions with pharmaceuticals, unfortunately for me they did more harm than good as far as my quality of life. Kratom is a great alternative for people like me, and it would truly be heartbreaking to ban this plant. I fear so many good people will be lost again and back in a dark hole they worked so hard to dig themselves out of. So many of us are responsible people, contributing members of society, and overall good people who don't deserve to have the right to consume this plant taken away from them. Kratom is doing way more good than bad, which is more than we can say about other legal things available to treat ailments, or to get a recreational \"buzz\" from. Please make the right decision, and know that you'll be helping so many people by doing that.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17604","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dustin Adams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my name is Maria.

This plant is the only thing that allowed me to get my life back after falling into heroin and prescription pain pill addiction.  I couldn't afford rehab and the time off of work that rehab requires, I had a family to support.  I felt trapped in the addiction with no viable way out.  I couldn't take a week or 2 off of work to try a home detox either.  I was \"zombie mommy\" just trying to keep life together for my child.  After many desperate hours of research I luckily stumbled across kratom, and a week later I was free!!  No rehab, no therapy, no missed work... just a week of kratom saved my life.  It saddens and frustrates me that there are others out there with situations like mine and much worse who could also get their lives, their families, and themselves back with this miracle, but may not get the opportunity.  There is no dangerous aspect of this plant, it's IMPOSSIBLE to overdose, only vomit or fall asleep, so therefore there is NO viable reason under the sun that it should be scheduled.  You fail those in need of help by banning this wonderful plant and it's God given alkaloids.  Not to mention those in chronic life long pain, as the pain relieving properties FAR exceed that of ANY pharmaceutical substance anywhere.\n\nIn short, I know that there is no need to \"battle the opioid epidemic\" as long as kratom is available, well known, and easily accessible because it is the answer to the problem.

If it needs more proper labeling, that is understandable - but to ban it outright would be absolutely asinine and counterproductive in a nation always seeking safer ways of improving living standards.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20178","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nicholas Trapeni","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been of great use in mitigating my anxiety and allowing me to work and support myself.

I saw no way out of my addiction and didnt think i was going to live to see my twenty first birthday. After getting in trouble with the law because of my addiction i knew i had to get off heroin, if i couldn't i would surley die or be in and out of jail my whole life. After doing a little research, i kept reading how kratom is a highly recommended herb to help ease opiate withdrawal. I had my doubts but to my surprise it worked. Not only did kratom ease my withdrawals, i was able to sleep, eat, relax, and not vomit at all. This was 20 months ago, since then i havent used any drugs or alcohol. It also helps with my social anxiety in a immense way. Im now living a normal life with a good job, great friends and a loving family. If it wasnt for kratom i would not be here today, a productive member of society that has a bright future ahead of him. Kratom has also help my father get off presciption pain killers. After rupturing two dics in his back he was destined to take pain killers the rest of his life. His pain was so bad he told me, \"If i didnt have two boys that depend on me i would have ate a bullet years ago\". After 13 years of him taking multiple prescription pain killers and two surgerys i suggested kratom to him. That day changed his life, he was amazed a simple herb can take away pain that made a grown man want to kill himself. He now takes two, four gram doses a day and hasnt taken a single pain killer for 13 months. Kratom is a miracle herb that has many health benfits and has helped thousands of people a year. It is the greatest alternative to pain killers and many other presciption drugs Please dont schedule Kratom, it would only escalate things such as illegal and presciption drug abuse. \nThank you for taking the time to read this, JRB","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11180","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jarod Benison","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a patient who suffers from Chronic Lyme Disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, OCD, Chronic Depression, Severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Agoraphobia, Hypothyroid, Osteoarthritis, Osteoporosis and much more.

At the register, they had a pile of leaflets directing me here to leave a comment, and some guiding information about where they stand on the issue.  It was all very sound until I got to the middle section where they stated emphatically that \"Kratom is not addictive\".  This is the only grey area I encounter when it comes to this plant.  I've been using it on and off for 2 years, you see, in \"stints\" that ranged from 3 weeks to 3 months--always daily--and each time I chose to stop, I experienced withdrawal.  It was classic addiction.  Mind you, the withdrawal was not intolerable.  It always averaged out to just a little under 3 days during which I mainly lay in bed watching TV.  I know this isn't the same for everyone.  \n\nI have a friend in Idaho I introduced to kratom for his back pain (I use it for medicine resistant depression) and he has been using it as often as he pleases with zero discernible withdrawal whenever he stops.  As he's gone through half a kilo on his own already, I am incredulous that he seems immune to Kratom addiction.  (He used to smoke cigarettes for years, and was also a chronic drinker before Kratom stopped his drinking altogether, so he is not immune to addiction itself).  \n\nI just stopped Kratom after a month of daily use, and this is the beginning of 4 days clean. Do I miss it?  Yes.  Even though the easy detox period is over, I miss the stimulation of Kratom and just how much it allows me to accomplish (with a fairly clear head, I might add, save some short term memory issues while I'm on it.  I generally keep a list in my pocket to keep track of responsibilities).  What's the longest I've been off it since I began this Kratom adventure?  About \n4 months.  \n\nDownsides:   Constipation (I manage it fine with stool softeners)\n                      The memory thing I already mentioned\n                      The lack of appetite that is par for the course on Kratom\n                      The inability to achieve orgasm without pausing in my usage for about 16 hours.\n                      A cigarette smoker may see his smoking increase by twice their normal amount.\n\n\nConclusion:  When I heard Kratom was to be banned at the end of September, I had very mixed feelings.  At first, I only selfishly thought of me.  I was both happy that I would be forced to find another alternative for untreatable depression that might not inhibit my digestion or sex drive, and I was outraged I would have to find an alternative for untreatable depression....\nIn twenty years, I've been on virtually every antidepressant under the sun.  \n\nWhen I considered Kratom's usefulness for others, that's when I really did my homework.  In short, if Kratom is listed on a Schedule that prevents research that will ultimately keep this substance from the hands of hardcore opiate addicts--you know:  the kind one can actually overdose on, unlike Kratom--then America will continue to lose its children for lack of a solution to heroin/painkiller epidemic that actually works.  The testimonials are out there.  Kratom saves lives. \n\nThank you for your time.  \n\n\nR.

I am a 20 year old male. I have haemochromatosis, a genetic disorder, which causes me to absorb too much iron and causes painful tendon problems, skeletal pain, migraines, and problems with my organs (due to iron being stored in them). On top of this, I have issues with my P450 enzyme system in my liver. I am an under-methylator which means my body doesn't break down nutrients properly. I unfortunately was born with bad genes in this regard. I have tried pharmaceuticals to help with depressive symptoms and physical pain, all of which only made my symptoms worse. Even over the counter pain medications either do nothing for my pain or make it worse. I did find some relief from gabapentin (Neurontin) but it made me too tired to go about my day. I also developed a tolerance to it and it gave me very unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, to the point where I felt mentally unstable just hours after taking a dose. I found out about kratom after I heard it was being scheduled. I decided to try some while it was still legal just to see if it helped. I was hoping it would help my physical pain, but it has done much more that just to help manage pain. It gives me clean energy that I haven't ever felt before. I don't really have anything else to take to give me energy. Coffee/caffeine gives me migraines and visual disturbances. It makes me physically sick and it doesn't actually give me energy. It just makes me unable to sleep and causes me to feel extremely stressed out. I don't know if the iron overloaded from haemochromatosis causes this, or if my other genetic issues are to blame. It probably is a mixture of the two. I do know my liver and thyroid functioning is compromised to some degree, and not reacting well to \"normal\" substances- especially MSG (glutamate) and caffeine, has been a huge problem of mine starting around the time I hit puberty. \n\nSince taking kratom, I have had energy and my pain levels are down. I don't feel depressive brain fog that used to plague my day to day life. What still amazes me to this day is, kratom gives me no \"crash\" that other stimulants do. I take some in the morning and evening usually. I end up getting a great night's rest and wake up feeling refreshed. I was actually able to come completely off gabapentin with the help of kratom and I no longer have been taking gabapentin. My quality of life is the best it has been since I was a very young child. I am able to go on long runs without experiencing tendon pain in my ankles and legs, for example. Furthermore, I can say that using kratom responsibly has yielded less withdrawal symptoms- less addictive potential than the gabapentin had, and I was taking that as prescribed by my doctor. I have read the science behind kratom addiction. It takes a very large amount of kratom powder to stimulate the mu-opioid receptors in the brain (which are the ones involved in addiction to mitragynine, the main psychoactive alkaloid in kratom) and the amounts I am using simply isn't causing me the type of addiction I experienced on gabapentin.\n\nIf kratom is scheduled I do not know what I will do. What I do know is that my quality of life will decline; I will be in significant physical pain, and I ultimately will be faced with the decision to go back on pharmaceuticals that are either more addictive or are not metabolized by my liver correctly.\n\nThere are thousands of farmers around the world who rely on preparing kratom leaves and exporting them for work. Scheduling kratom would simply not be fair to them or to me, nor would it be fair to those on opioid narcotic pain medications much stronger than gabapentin, whose quality of life has been improved since taking kratom. \n\nIn reality, kratom is just a tea leaf. It can be taken as tea or taken as a supplement, just like many teas are. It isn't anywhere near as dangerous as the few people in positions of power seem to believe. If kratom is dangerous and needs to be scheduled, please also consider scheduling sugar, MSG, caffeine, alcohol, and NSAIDs such as Tylenol. They are all more dangerous than the kratom leaf.

I graduated my HiSet w/Honors, and am a straight A-B student. \n\nI have advanced degenerative osteoarthritis in my knees (bilateral), and arthritis in my neck as well. I've been prescribed Mobic/Meloxicam twice a day, and it helped with all but the most serious pain. However, noticing some side-effects I wasn't comfortable with, I self-discontinued and the pain became so bad that I Googled alternative pain relief measures and Kratom came up almost immediately.\n\nHowever, not wanting to do anything risky, I began studying it. I have yet to take any, even though my first batch came in the  mail several weeks ago. I am still collecting information, and hope you will do so as well before making it a Shedule I controlled substance.\n\nBut I can tell you that some form of regulation needs to occur, so that incidents like the Sweden fatalities, as well as other incidents occurring as the result of (usually) tainted Kratom do not occur again.\n\nHere is some of what my research has yielded:\n\nKratom is highly individualistic in how it interacts with the human body. Some people get sick of a gram, while some can consume over fifteen grams daily without incident (reportedly--this information comes from self-reports.) \n\nIt is an opioid agonist, and can help with opiate withdraw issues. It is not been known (read: directly observed) to affect the CNS' respiratory functions in a negative way, as does opioids. However, if taken with an opioid, it may magnify the opiate's response to the CNS and depress breathing moreso than the opiate would alone.\n\nIt has caused seizures in a small (reportedly) percentage of the population of daily users. It has been remarked that it may have withdraw symptoms similar to those experienced by heroin users. Other side effects are those found with most opioids, and a far shorter list than those associated with Meloxicam, I might add. Some ephedrine/heroin/caffeine side effects are also reported in a small percentage of users. The extent of potent hepatoxicity is undetermined, but from self-reports I've seen, I believe it is higher than many would claim. Further studies need done on this, for this is perhaps one of the most serious health risks Kratom may pose, should it exist to that extent.\n\nFurther studies also need to be done on the potential spectrum of drug interactions in the human body when taking Kratom and other prescribed substances. Most of the studies on this reference many drugs that conflict (fatally so) with standard opiates, In the majority of deaths associated with Kratom, Tramadol was a significant factor. Kratom does not play well with other stimulants, depressants, SSRI's, Psychedelics, or MAOI's. But beyond that, we know little else about what it might interact negatively with. \n\nThe safest way to consume Kratom is by steeping it as a tea. It can also be taken as a pill, but for many that aggravates the stomach lining, especially if taken on an empty stomach. It should never, ever be injected or smoked. A common method among many users is the 'toss-n'wash,' where a certain amount of Kratom is put into the mouth, then chased by a liquid and swallowed. This may complicate pre-existing lung issues, or may cause these issues to occur where they might not have before. Think cinnamon challenge, and that's basically what you have. Research needs to be carried out to determine a safe maximum daily dosage, though this is hard with Kratom's unique effects on varying individuals. There has been no determined fatality limit associated with Kratom, as the body's defensive reactions to it seem exceedingly similar to those of the neuro-toxin capciasin. In other words, it appears that in severe overdose cases, the body will do everything in its power to incapacitate the recipient before death is a possibility.\n\nWhile I think Schedule I is a bit much, I do agree with certain regulation protocols to protect the people from unsavory sellers and con-men. I also believe that nearly any pharmaceutical and OTC medicine carries much higher rates of dangerous side-effects than is possible with Kratom.

I have read through a number of comments. While aren't many studies that confirm the anecdotal evidence in these comments, I hope that the 1000s of people who have shared their story give regulators pause when considering scheduling kratom. \n\nI have never used kratom, but my wife used it successfully to treat chronic pain. We're a young family. I'm 33, my wife 32, and our daughter 2. With the exception of this year, my wife had slowly deteriorated physically and mentally from chronic pain for the last number of years. She saw her primary care doctor countless times along with regular visits to the rheumatologist and other specialists.\n\nUnder the care of her doctors, she slowly but surely was prescribed a larger and larger batter of pharmaceutical medications. Sometimes, the pain would temporarily subside but mostly it stayed the same or progressed. Her mental condition was the most difficult for her and to see. Towards the end of using Lyrica, Abilify, Xanax, and a handful of other medications that I can't remember, she became agoraphobic. Her condition was wrongly thought to be progressing and was told to see a neurologist and get an EMG. \n\nIn truth, she was experiencing side effects from medications and then put on additional medications to address the side effects. It was a vicious circle that increased her anxiety substantially and, looking back, likely caused a psychosomatic increase in pain. \n\nI kept looking for answers because I was losing my wife and was drowning in the pressure of being a caregiver to my baby, my wife, and as the sole breadwinner. Occasionally, my wife would be open to trying alternative treatments. One of them was kratom. We were thoughtful about her approach to using kratom including it's dose, what strains to use and when, and so on. Kratom is most effective in small amounts and kratom has a natural way of preventing you from taking it in large amounts, nausea and taste!\n\nAre there people misusing kratom, surely. The people who are misusing kratom are mixing with it opioids and other drugs. Just as surely as people are misusing kratom, they aren't dying from it. They are dying from fentanyl, heroin, etc. and happen to have kratom in their system at the time. \n\nDo people who use kratom often continue to use it for potentially indefinite periods of time, yes. There are counter examples though. My wife used kratom for a short period and the relief allowed her to the opportunity to get off all of her prescriptions medications. Kratom gave me my wife back. Her pain levels reduced substantially from her improved mental state and with some subsequent dietary changes her pain has subsided.\n\nAs to the people who depend upon kratom. It's important to point out something that you already know, that dependence and addiction are two different things. You and I are dependent upon water. We don't, however, exhibit the kind of behaviors of substance use disorder such as physically risky behaviors, isolating ourselves from important relationships, etc. Just as some people are on SSRIs indefinitely, some kratom users are too because they need the results that it produces.\n\nUsers of this herbal supplement can keep their tolerance low by changing the strains that they use regularly, an occasional off day, and other methods. \n\nIn short, kratom doesn't meet the definition of a schedule 1 drug. It has medicinal value and it's addiction potential is low. \n\nMy wife's experience with kratom and my own with chiropractic care, has led me to believe that regulatory agencies should to take an extremely conservative approach in regulating alternative health. This is my body and I'm responsible for what I put it in it with some notable exceptions that endanger public health, eg. heroin, cocaine, etc. Kratom is a natural substance and with care can be a helpful supplement to many. \n\nI'm sure that there are people using all kinds of herbs irresponsibly thought not necessarily recreationally. I read a story about someone who slathered neem, used to clean teeth in some forms among other uses, all over his teeth and gums leaving it there for 20 minutes. At that point, he was desperately posting on an alternative health forum because the skin on his gums was peeling. I'm sure he ended up fine, and hopefully he learned that he is responsible for his health and it's a sacred responsibility that should be pursued with thought and care.\n\nI ask that you not schedule kratom since it does not meet the criteria for a schedule one drug and that, generally speaking, you allow people to take responsibility for their own health as they see fit.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4078","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ben Donahower","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"November 21, 2016\n\nS Hemme\n195 MC 8055\nYellville, AR 72687\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nI am a 50-year-old woman, a teaching veteran of 27 years, an artist, an outdoor enthusiast, and a mother to three young adult children.

I am a 56 year old male. I have two children, am a licensed attorney in the state of Michigan, and am currently employed in the oil and gas industry as a landman. I currently use Kratom on a daily basis for therapeutic reasons. Throughout the years I have suffered from and been diagnosed with clinical depression. I have tried numerous medications in the past that have either been ineffective or have resulted in unpleasant side effects. A friend recommended that I give Kratom a try. \n\nI researched the scientific literature and discovered several studies that suggest that Kratom has an antidepressant effect without impairing one's abilities to function. It has also been discovered that Kratom has an anti inflammatory effect. Some research has found that depression may be a result of inflammation in the body, which alters mood. Having taken Kratom for over 3 years now, I can personally state that my mood has improved and stabilized. I am able to parent and work without impairment of any kind. It has allowed me to be a more productive person. \n\nThe effect I experience when using Kratom has been an increase in energy and a mild uplift in mood, not unlike drinking several cups of coffee, but without the jitters and without the inevitable crash. (Interestingly, Kratom is a plant in the coffee family). In the 3 years I have used Kratom I have experienced no ill effects or unpleasant side effects like I have in the past with prescribed medications. I have not personally experienced any effects of addiction, and I use the same amount daily without any increase in tolerance. I also have not experienced any effects which I would consider similar to narcotic medications. I have found Kratom to be similar to St. John's Wort, which is marketed as an OTC herbal remedy for depression, but I have found it to be much more effective. \n\nI would be devastated if this natural herbal substance were to be made illegal (and me a criminal), especially when I have found it to be effective in treating my symptoms of depressions and when further scientific research into Kratom is sorely needed.

Kratom is non-addictive. It mearly  provides aid for anxiety and depression it does not \"treat\" the cause of such symptoms but it merely helps in the complexity of dealing with them. \n\nKratom feels like a beneficial plant that I have found that is being threatened and compared to other very scary and murderous substances that nearly took my life. Due to my anxiety and depression, I found myself turning to very hard opioid drugs. Since I found Kratom, I have not only been able to remove myself from the curse of opioid addiction, but I have also graduated with a master's degree, been able to get off of hard opioid drugs, and also pull myself out of a seriously dangerous situation which wound me up in the emergency by overdose. I was taking OxyContin, fentanyl, and morphine. My life was nearly over. Kratom did not treat this near fatal use but it merely helped me face it myself. And safely. \n\nI firmly believe that taking this viable, inexpensive, and safe form of natural aid from adult people will provide a deeper and more harmful cut into the already devastating reality of American drug opioid epidemic. Please consider the vast amount of people on this thread who are speaking from experience and perhaps providing a unque and portentously life saving aid to something that is not being handled appropriately. Americans deserve this type of consideration. Please take this profoundly honest opinion seriously. I do believe a ban on Kratom will not only be a backwards move in the direction against a failed war on drugs, but also a harmful move against a population that needs support and science based evidence. People who use Kratom are not criminals. They are mothers, fathers, children, grandparents, and veterans.

Honestly, I want to clarify a few things about my experience with kratom.\n\nSeveral years ago, I became chronically ill  to the point I was bedridden...in my late forties. My wonderful husband had to do everything up to and including shampooing my hair and shaving my legs for me. Daily, I crawled to the bathroom because the neuropathy was excruciating.  Being a person that has always worked 2 or 3 jobs, this was extremely  difficult. Not just physically but mentally. \n\nI had raised my children and this was supposed to be the years to travel, take up hobbies and enjoy life. It was a nightmare of a life! Each morning I wondered WHY? Why on Earth did I wake up again? The pills were making me sicker. I needed two more pills to cover the side effects of the pill prescribed last month. \n\nFinally, enough was enough! I searched the Internet for natural alternatives.  Lo and behold, I discovered kratom. I researched it for 6 months before trying it. Now, let me be clear, it didn't cure or heal me, what it did do is allowed my symptoms to be more manageable.  I got ip out of bed, started a business, have traveled and been able to pursue some hobbies. There is no \"high\", there is no drowsiness...in fact, quite the opposite. I feel energetic, mood elevation, mental clarity and overall \"feel like I did in my twenties\".  \n\nTo take this plant from me, would be like putting the final nails in my coffin. We are law abiding citizens, a veteran family with my son active duty, a grandmother to 8 and they sure love spending \"fun\" time with Granny.

I have worked in the Medical and Perscription drug field for 14 years.  Kratom should not be further considered to be a potential Schedule 1 controlled substance.  Our society has largely become addicts of many of the drugs that the FDA has approved and pushed into our homes. Our drug dependence issues in this country are not because of a naturally occuring plant that has been avilable for decades. Addiction has been cause by the very drugs that the  DEA and FDA have approved and \" Scheduled\" for our \" Safety\" . \nPeople seeking to abuse a substance are not going looking for Kratom. Kratom is not a street drug.  They are breaking into pharmacies and homes or buying it from friends who have perscriptions for real \" Schedule 1 \" medications.  \nI have a chronic pain condition at 41. That means in a years time I went from feeling like a 39 year  old , to feeling like I was over the age of 80 and in failing health.   I am not a person that will accept pain as the winner  and allow it to take over my life.  I attempted many of the approved medications to assist with the pain. Changed my diet, did Physical therapy anything to help learn how to adjust to a different way of life. The medications had so many side affects that although it took the edge off the pain at times it left me barely able to function at work or keep my concentration to drive.  I was becoming a person consumed by my illness and the medications to treat it . I could lose my job, my home I have two children I support on only my income. I began a quest for alternative options to my care.  Kratom has been a part of the new path to wellness for me. I don't need it every day. I have no side effects.  I have a 1/4 of a teaspoon in the morning if I am having a difficult day.  I sometimes use at night to help me sleep. \nKratom has given me a big portion of my functionality back so I can at least manage my life on a better level.  If you have never taken a drug like Cymbalta you will never know what you have to give up just to get a tiny bit back. With Kratom I give up nothing and the benefits are large. \nThe percentage of people who use this to better their lives far exceeds the few who may have abused it. As is the case with anything as simple as food, cold mdicine etc.  Look at the real drug issues in this country, not ones that don't exist.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17859","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kristen Welch","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please allow rational research to guide responses to individual plants and substances derived from them.

My main concern was the long-term use of opiates and acetaminophen on my body. I came across a few articles discussing individual experiences with kratom and decided to do more research. In my research, I found that kratom was more than just a plant, but also a community.\n\nI ordered a small amount to try for myself, initially quite skeptical. I was surprised to see how much of an improvement it made almost immediately. The best part? No major side effects. \n\nOver time, I have found that the kratom community is made up of people from all walks of life: military veterans, teachers, accountants, retirees, lawyers, students, IT specialists, factory workers, among others.\n\nI won't delve much deeper than that, but I strongly believe this plant needs to remain unscheduled and widely available. I would NOT have a problem with regulations being put in place to make sure what is imported is free of other materials and to make sure nefarious actors don't falsely sell it offering it as a \"natural high\" or try to sell it to minors. More studies need to be funded and keeping it unscheduled would facilitate that. There is already an immense amount of anecdotal evidence that this plant is safe, effective, and improved the lives of many people.\n\nThe majority of people that actually gather, ship, import, sell, and use kratom are GOOD, ordinary citizens, with full-time jobs and families. To schedule or ban this plant would hurt people, plain and simple. Please do the right thing. Please do the research. Please keep this plant legal and available.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11555","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anon anon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Seriously Kratom being my option for pain relief keeps me off opiate and opioid pain meds that I do NOT want to suffer long term addiction to based on chronic pain and continuous use.

I have used Kratom for about a year now and I just want to try and reason with you about why kratom should not be scheduled. This isn't about me.. this is about all of the veterans that unfortunately do not receive the treatment they have earned and it is causing our nation to collapse. I do not want kratom legal for me, but for my parents. My mother and father are extremely hard workers. My father is the Fire Cheif of my city and he's an incredible man. He suffers from certain pains and aches everyday and he refuses to try kratom until it is legal. He's the strongest man I have ever met, and it breaks my heart to see my hero down for the count. Kratom has helped me in so many ways. My generation was not raised on a farm and we do not appreciate hard work like we should. I have just about dropped my prescription medication for this plant. It is a life savor to many people, and even mine. But this isn't about me.. my mother is an amazing woman. She raised my brother, sister and I at home while my father was off supporting us for our entire lives. My mother suffers from many different conditions that all revolve around pain. It is very upsetting to see my mother in bed with a migraine knowing that there is nothing that can help but kratom. She will not try it until it is legal and it breaks my heart even more. Right in front of us is a miracle plant that have saved countless number of lives. It was made on our God given Earth and it should not be restricted nor banned. I do believe that kratom should only be sold to those that are 21+ and it should be taxed like alcohol and marijuana in legal states. Please.. I respect what the DEA does and I respect our country.. I do not want to see us go out like this. We need to stand together as one nation, under God, indivisible. Thank you for taking the time to read my comment.

My name is Nathan Nacey and I have been a kratom user for over a year now.  I came to try kratom in hopes that it would help with my chronic back pain. 5 years ago I began to have an onset of continual pain in my lower back.  I eventually found out that I had two torn discs in my back as well as degenerative disc disease and dysfunction of the sacrum.  Surgery was an option but no doctor would perform it on someone so young.  My full time job suffered as I was unable to sit for extended periods of time and I had to be put on Family Medical leave.  One of the worst parts of being in chronic pain is that it never goes away.  Not only did it interrupt my day to day life but it caused me not to be able to sleep or exercise or do much of anything.  My pain doctor tried multiple things including injections into my spine, chiropractic care, physical therapy, decompression therapy etc.  He tried to keep the pain at bay by prescribing opiods yet these did not work and he was hesitant to prescribe because he feared I would be addicted.  Truth was , I WAS addicted.  There is nothing you can do when you live in chronic pain and people have no way to heal you.  He in fact told me that the best he could do was to keep me comfortable but even this was a lie as the pain meds just werent working and I was taking them only to avoid further withdrawal .   When I tried kratom I got sick to my stomach a bit the first time.  I didnt throw up but after reading so many positive stories I decided to stick with it.  The second time I tried it I took a little less and found that my pain in fact was reduced more than when I would take pain killers.    It was a very easy decision after seeing how effective it was in helping my pain; I stopped going to the doctor who couldnt do anything other than prescribe me more meds.  I went back to work and now take it daily when I feel the onset of pain.  I can function on it while at my desk at work and it actually even gives me a bit of energy and focus (similar to coffee).  I have taken it for over a year now and have no ill effects.  My wife and family are happy that I take it and have found relief.  I can tell you with certainty that if the plant is not accessible to me in the future I will have no choice but to go directly to the pain doctor and start taking opiates again.  My pain condition does not go away ever.  It is underlying and always there, but at a minimum I seem to find relief more with this plant than anything else.  In addition to this benefit  I was able to quit opiates all together with what seemed like minimal withdrawal.  Such a clear choice; take synthetic drugs or get help from an all natural plant.  \nSincerely,\nNathan Nacey","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7992","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nathan Nacey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Sharon Mosley, I'm a wife, mother, daughter, friend.

I have never been arrested and I am not a felon.  I've struggled with depression since my two month old baby died many years ago.  Also, I suffer from chronic back pain after being involved in several bad car accidents caused by others.  I have taken nearly every anti-depressant and legal pain medicine made as prescribed from my doctors along with trying many natural herbs and supplements.  I am not an illegal drug user nor a user of medical marijuana and rarely drink alcohol.  After seeing how the natural plant supplement Kratom was helping one of my family members and researching it, I decided to try it.  This natural supplement has improved my mood and made my back pain more manageable.  I have taken strong pain medications from my doctors and Kratom does not impair me at all like most pain medicine.  I strongly urge the DEA to keep Kratom as a legal supplement and allow continued research.  Americans should be free to make an informed choice about what supplements they take to improve their health.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18421","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 30 year old responsible user of Mitragyna speciosa. If the DEA bans this herbal supplement, I believe they will be hurting millions of people by subsequently stopping any research on the benefits of this plant as well as forcing many chronic pain patients back onto opiates. With the opiate epidemic going on in this country, I feel that any natural and safe alternatives need to be studied and allowed. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kratom-drug-ban-may-cripple-promising-painkiller-research/\nI know many people that kratom has helped to live a more functional and productive life. It has helped me tremendously with my anxiety and depression issues. Before kratom I had a very hard time living day to day because of the state of my mental health. I was barely able to get out of bed because life was too overwhelming.  Kratom, has helped me to deal with debilitating anxiety and panic attacks. I am able to be a loving and attentive mother now because it dims the lights on my anxiety. Medications from my doctor never have helped me as much. Kratom does not make me feel high or drugged up unlike many prescription medications I have tried. Kratom is NOT a party drug. \nI whole heartedly support the regulation of kratom so that responsible users can be confident they are getting a quality and pure product but banning it is not the way to do that. Please do not give this herbal supplement a schedule one rating. This amazing plant needs to be studied for any potential. I am confident that if it is properly studied it could be a life changing remedy for millions of suffering Americans.

I am 78 years old, and I haven't found anything else out there that has helped me with both anxiety and pain like Kratom has. I have been using Kratom on and off for years, without having a single side effect, except relief from my problems. It is by far less addicting than caffeine. There is absolutely no way that this drug can cause harm to the human body. You need to investigate the bogus claims of negative side effects thoroughly. Anyone who claims they were harmed by Kratom is either lying, or took it with something else that was harmful. At most, it might cause a little nausea if too much is taken at once.This is a natural plant that only helps people, and I find it ridiculous that it has even gone this far, that the DEA is considering scheduling it. Please reconsider.
