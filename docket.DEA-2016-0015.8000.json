There are no proven issues with Kratom unlike other schedule 1 drugs. You are silly to classify a medication many people need to function normally everyday with out Opoid addiction and side effects. If you just take this medication you realize it has absolutely no high but offers serious reduction of pain much better then any OTC pain medication. There are more issues with Tylenol or IB then with this medication.

I want to be completely honest with my experience using the substance in hopes that it may help in making the decision to schedule it.\n I first used kratom when it was recommended to me by my brother. I had sustained an injury to my shoulder at work and I was therefore having pain and restricted use of my arm and shoulder. Kratom not only relieved the pain beyond what was becoming an excessive use of ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But, kratom also gave me higher levels of energy and kept me in a better mood. \nI have now been taking kratom for several months. My use is not maintained out of necessity and addiction, but rather as a daily dietary supplement allowing me to be less anxious, happier, and more energetic through the day. To confirm that I was still in control over the substance,  I have stopped using kratom on multiple occasions with no side effects,  \nI strongly feel that if the DEA continues with its push to place kratom as a scheduled substance, they would be denying me of my right to enjoy a much better lifestyle. I also feel like they would be throwing gasoline onto the wildfire of opiate and heroine addiction that is destroying our nation. \nIn conclusion, I hope that the DEA will be honest and unbiased with their research of kratom. And I hope that they will consider how people, the everyday, hard working, tax paying people that they represent feel, and what their wishes are. Thank you for taking the time to read my input, and I ask that you please carefully consider the decision before you and how it will affect the people you represent.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10727","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gary Jenkins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I am a 43 year old single woman who works as a realtor. I had a spinal fusion March of 2010. I have had a lot of issues since the surgery not with just pain but auto immune symptoms.  Due to all the auto immune, I have trouble with abnormally strong side effects from Rx & otc medications. I have been DNA tested which confirmed the meds were making me sicker. I came across Kratom last summer. To my surprise, I did not have the same reaction I do to Rx & otc meds. Being able to add something into my \"tool chest\" to help supplement with my chronic pain has greatly improved my quality of life. I have been able to work more & have even taken on a secondary specialty in my field.  I am still continuing my journey to get as healthy as possible & am even having surgery Dec 13th.  I am really hoping after my surgery, I will not need Kratom on a daily basis.

My depression became so much worse after the birth of my baby I had to go into the hospital for a month; my husband had to manage alone with the help of my mom. In the end, it was kratom that allowed me to function enough to live at home be able to care, at least partially, for my beautiful new baby. I did not find that it made me feel \"high\" - I wouldn't have felt that I could be responsible for a newborn if it had. It simply lifted my depression enough that I could feed her and sing to her and put her to bed - all the things normal mothers take for granted. Also, the fact that kratom actually had an effect on my 20-year treatment-resistant depression helped my doctors by providing evidence they needed to find the right medicine at last. I am now finally, after twenty years, living a normal life with my husband and almost-two-year-old. If I had not discovered kratom when I did, I am positive that I would not be here right now. I found it to be harmless, non-addictive, and incredibly helpful when taken responsibly. What really needs to happen is for the DEA to open the door for more research to be done on opiate-based anti-depressants for severe refractory cases, but in the absence of that, the legal status of kratom is incredibly important to maintain for those with depression who find it helpful. If you have ever had refractory or even regular depression, you know that if you find something that helps, ANYTHING, you need to keep that treatment available to you. People who take kratom to help their depression are often at the end of their ropes emotionally. I have a lot of experience among the very depressed, and I can tell you that I'm sure that if it is banned, a number of suicides will result. Actual people will kill themselves because the one medication that was helping them is not legal anymore. I don't know about you, but I personally would certainly not want to be responsible for those deaths. \n\nIn summary: Kratom allowed me to overcome my severe depression enough to function as a new mother, and it also helped me find a medical treatment that actually worked at last after twenty years and twenty-three different laboratory-manufactured medications. Sure it can be abused, but just about anything can be abused if used irresponsibly. Keep alcohol in mind here. I'd be willing to bet that the number of deaths caused by people using kratom (or marijuana, for that matter) is a miniscule, teeny drop in the bucket when compared to alcohol-caused deaths. Please keep this natural, comparatively harmless substance available to those whom it helps.

While all of these pharmaceutical drugs do work and provide relief to some degree, they all come with a host of negative side effects, including dependency/addiction, ref. the much publicized opioid epidemic crisis. I am also at the mercy of my insurance company as to what and how much medication they deem necessary, on occasion overriding my doctors' best medical judgment.\n\nA couple of years ago I discovered Kratom by means of and Internet search for alternative remedies. It is a natural (unadulterated) plant - NOT a drug - and has essentially changed my life. I am no longer beholden to doctors and faceless insurance companies. Kratom works wonders for pain relief and also acts as a mood stabilizer helping me greatly with my depression and anxiety, to the point where I can significantly reduce, or even stop taking, my Rx medications. And all this without any negative side effects. No drowsiness, no \"cotton head\" and no addiction or bad withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIf my government agencies take the extreme action of criminalizing a natural, harmless herb, I would have to revert to dependency on the Rx medications, with the aforementioned slew of negative side effects.\n\nConsidering the prescription-drug epidemic currently plaguing the nation, with countless overdose deaths daily, I am flummoxed as to why the DEA would even consider banning Kratom, an innocuous plant that besides its beneficial effects for my (and millions others) condition, also has shown great potential in weening addicts off of deadly opioids, including heroin. The negative effects of banning Kratom, on a personal level as well as society at large, cannot be overstated. I implore in the strongest terms possible the DEA to reconsider its stance in this regard.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0074","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lars Dahl","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I oppose the DEA's proposed ban on kratom.

The recent deluge of detailed anecdotal accounts from the people who have been consuming this plant regularly for years constitutes a massive data set for what can now be considered one of the largest-scale clinical trials to date.  \n\nFrom this information, it has become evident that kratom is used much like St. John's Wort or coffee, and is similar to these products in terms of both its intensity and the potential risks it presents to consumers.  Unlike how it had been characterized by a handful of poorly researched (local) media reports seeking to increase viewership through hysterics and sensationalism, kratom is not a mysterious, fashionable \"new recreational drug\" being snuck into the country from the orient.  Anyone attempting to use it as such will find themselves sorely disappointed, as one can access numerous products with more mind-altering capabilities in a typical grocery store (alcohol, cough syrup, nitrous oxide in canned whipped cream...), let alone their local pharmacy.  Thus, the allure it presents to drug-seeking youths (beyond the inaccurate media portrayals) is nonexistent.  \n\nEven still, should someone consume kratom in an amount far exceeding a typical serving, we can rest assured knowing that although the consequences may be uncomfortable (possibly resulting in nausea and vomiting), they will not be fatal. Although, there have been a handful of deaths associated with kratom in which the deceased had kratom in their digestive tract upon autopsy examination, in each of these cases the person was shown to have had dangerous/toxic amounts of lethal drugs in their system. To date, there have been zero deaths attributed to kratom consumption. This fact is striking when one considers the estimated 458 deaths from over-the-counter acetaminophen annually. \n\nMost importantly is how the responsible adults who make the informed decision to consume kratom will be impacted.  The war veterans and grandmothers with fibromyalgia who protested in front of the White House on September 13th represent tens of thousands of Americans who would be criminalized by the scheduling of kratom as a controlled substance.  With its new found attention, scientific research is just now proving what people have known for hundreds of years; kratom has the unique potential to safely and effectively stem opiate addiction.  Considering the crises facing America, it is your jurisdictional responsibility to weigh the potential risks against the benefits.  Criminalizing an innocuous plant possessing widely acknowledged benefits and potentials is simply unjustifiable.  Such a misguided decision would undoubtedly result in a legal battle that would raise serious questions about the motivations of the DEA - diminishing public's faith in the agency and possibly challenging the very constitutionality of the organization itself.

I take a very small dose on days that I will be very active with my toddler (you don't realize how much you rely on your toes when chasing a child around). I'm able to run and play with him, without the searing pain- and without the \"doped up\" haze that I was in before my back surgery. I know that there is no cure-all for pain, but this has helped me immensely without the terrible side effects of prescription opiates that I had before.

Hundreds of  thousands of people like me drink Kratom tea as an herbal supplement in order to avoid worse more dangerous remedies such as using escalating but ineffective quantities of addictive drugs riddled with serious side effects.  The proposed action to criminalize Kratom tea, even temporarily, should be tabled/denied/ never implemented for many valid reasons:\n\n1.\tEven if Kratom tea drinkers were forced to use conventional opioid therapy, it is unlikely our doctors would prescribe adequate pain relief, due to the stigma of long term opioid use.  \n2.\tI am able to live a productive life as an asset to society because of herbal supplements, like Kratom.  My positive function in society and the work place  would not be possible without kratom, as I would be less able, or unable to maintain the most basic functions of my job either because I will be wracked with pain or because I would be dependent on medication in quantities that would cause side effects that are dangerous to the work place.\n3.\tCriminalizing, prohibiting and unreasonably restricting Kratom will have many other harsh consequences such as:   legal operating Kratom vendors/businesses will have  shut down; people drinking Kratom tea to fight pain, or keep from using addictive drugs will have to obtain $$$ medical services; law enforcement will have to spend time and money on arresting and prosecuting older adults, 50+ year olds,  for drinking Kratom tea, instead of investigating criminals for real crimes; legally abiding Canadian citizens would be violating very serious drug laws if they brought their Kratom tea to the US with them on vacation or visiting (legal herbal supplement in Canada, as it has been here for years) and many others too numerous to write.\n4.\tEven temporarily criminalizing and unreasonably restricting Kratom will cause harm, to me, and many others, and prevent none.   If Kratom is criminalized and unreasonably restricted, it should remain legal and its use unimpeded while all appeals and studies are being conducted, and Kratom should NOT be temporarily prohibited while these matters are decided.  Hundreds of thousands of people in the US, like me,  have been safely using this supplement for many years, and there have been virtually no negative harmful, deadly, or more than minor, incidents compared to the number of people using Kratom supplement tea.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21578","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"N V Landeson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"as a medical professional I have found the benefits of Kratom tea to be beneficial in proper dosage.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17064","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Castello","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The only reason the DEA would ban this plant is for profit.

My girlfriend has been on extremely high doses of pain and other medications for over ten years, and kratom is the only thing that is helping her get off of all those other dangerous medications and be her self again for the first time in over ten years. Kratom is not a dangerous drug, it's a natural plant in the coffee tree family that is helping thousands of people become their selves again. So if the DEA goes ahead with this ban it's not because it's a dangerous drug, it's because they are in bed with the Big pharmaceutical companies. That will show that they don't care about the American people they only care about making the rich even richer by banning kratom so Big Pharmaceutical can patient it to create drugs to sell back to the people. We as a people need to stop being told what we can and can't do by the rich.\nA kratom ban would be all about AMERICAN GREED!

You are doing more harm than good by making more felons. You are doing more harm than good by suppressing research by proposing schedule 1, though it should not be scheduled at all. \n\nOur government and institutions have been bought by the pharmaceutical industry and the private prison industry and Americans are aware of this to an increasing degree. We have elected a populist president because our civic institutions are failing all of us (see the most recent issue of Foreign Affairs for more reading on this topic). This potential ban is just one more example of government caving to money, not representing the common citizen's best interests, and not listening to the public. SHAME ON YOU. We know. We can see you. If this government doesn't gut you as an institution, the next one will. Make a good, honest, fact-supported decision FOR ONCE. We ALL know what you are doing.

I am opposed to the DEA placing the plant kratom into a schedule 1 category of narcotics because it's not a narcotic. It's a plant in the coffee family; a dietary supplement that people have found helps them in their everyday lives. It's an all natural substitute to the quite often debilitating effects of pharmaceutical drugs that so many people are unwillingly being forced to take due to poor health or from freak accidents. There are so many people who would have never been a (pharmaceutical) drug addict if it weren't for unforeseen circumstances that life has thrown their way. Fortunately for some of these people, kratom made it's way into their lives. I've seen vets with PTSD who can't stand the medicine they take (but have no choice), then start taking kratom in it's place and VOILA!, they get their life back. Same with senior citizens sick of the same old thing that doesn't work. There are thousands of these examples of good, hardworking, and patriotic citizens who want to work, provide for their family, and if it's not too much to ask they would like to be as pain-free as possible. View the Facebook page #IAmKratom for testimonies that would have most people in tears. This is a plant; a dietary supplement that would do more good for the people and for the economy of America if it were just regulated than if it were banned outright. We in the community would be content with an Age Restriction of 21 (or even 25)! I don't think it's right to punish people who have found a natural way to get through life. Often times, the pain killers prescribed will kill the pain, but cause utter anguish inside. Kratom kills the pain and leaves the soul still in tact.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20549","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Oakley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jennifer and I am a 34 year old registered nurse.

My profession is IT networking. I appreciate the opportunity to comment like this. First, I respect the law. Period.  Now that being said, I do not agree with the DEA decision to make Mitragyna speciosa illegal. That would mean I and millions of others, can no longer control our pain the BEST AND SAFEST way possible. I find the DEA involvement quite invasive on the matter of making M. Speciosa illegal. Why on earth would someone deny the right to choose the relief that works the best for them?  Now, I am sure that because this topic has been blown out of proportion, the DEA is AWARE of some benefits from this miraculous plant. I hope they can see how it helps the lives of Americans. I really do.. The DEA has absolutely no clue how much pain I am in. Or how much pain my neighbor is in. OR how much pain THEIR neighbors are in. Yet, it is okay to make that choice for them? The DEA is basically telling \"us\", \"I deny you the option to have pain relief\". Oh, gee, thanks a lot. I find that behavior disgusting. Putting M. Speciosa in the same class as meth, crack, and cocaine, is insane. I have been taking M Speciosa for three years now. I take it every day. When I wake up, around lunch time, around dinner time and before I sleep. I have damage to L3-L4, as well as discs and sciatic nerve issues. I took Prescribed opiate pain killers for years and I HATED it. It provided little relief yet, I felt like I always has to take them. I was moody when I was running low, couldn't poop, I would nod off and had mood swings. My withdrawal symptoms were TERRIBLE. Cold sweats, couldn't sleep, restless legs. I do not get that way with M Speciosa. I read about it on a forum and decided to try it. Well, it changed my life for the better. I transitioned over with ZERO WITHDRAWAL symptoms. I felt alive again, slept better, my sex life improved with my wife, my job performance improved, no nodding off.  It is a miracle plant! I think it should remain available and out of the DEA control because I have finally found something that works well and doesn't make me feel guilty when I take it.\nIt is much like cannabis.

My doctors prescribed numerous medications (Cymbalta, Lyrica, Tramadol, Gabapentin, and hydrocodone) in an effort to alleviate my pain.

I was diagnosed with scoliosis as a teenager and went to many doctors only to be told it \"wasn't severe enough\" to have surgery and I would probably have chronic pain for the rest of my life.  I self medicated for years and years because of lack of access to health insurance and the ability to pay for doctor visits and physical therapists.  In my early 20s, I was in two car accidents which only aggravated my condition and started me on the path of opiates.  From 23 to 30, I took opiates everyday, all day (except when pregnant with my 2 boys) and by the time I was 30 the opiates didn't even manage my pain. My whole day was spent looking for pills.  Plus, I was addicted to them!  It was a hopeless time period in my life I was in terrible pain, addicted and just didn't see an end to this cycle in sight.\n\n\nAfter searching the internet for other options that were legal and natural  besides opiates, I found an online drug forum and in the opiate section I kept seeing the world KRATOM and how helpful it was for many people.  Not only to get off opiates but to manage daily chronic pain. I was very skeptical at first but within the first two or three times of dosing IT WORKED!  A LEAF FROM A TREE WAS ALL I NEEDED. I never went back to opiates.  That was almost nine years ago and kratom has totally changed my life.  I am able to work a full time job as a legal assistant, raise my two boys, be a wife and enjoy the things I LOVE most about life.  I no longer self medicate.  That's ALL I really need.  It's important to me that I always have access to it and I hope that the people trying to ban this plant realize that this plant has made a HUGE improvement in my life and my family's life and to take it away from people like me, a mother, a tax-payer, a woman, is just not right.

I did research online looking for a natural way to reduce my pain and to give me energy and discovered Kratom. After ordering and taking Kratom the first time making a tea out of it, I was very surprised at how well it blocked the pain and also how much energy it gave me. Now three years later, the hernias healed on their own without the need for surgery with the help of kratom.  I still take it once a day for the doctor diagnosed arthritis and to give me energy. I was very shocked to read that the DEA was going to ban this natural plant, so far I have had zero side affects from taking it other than a decrease in my libido, but I am also in my mid forties so that could be more of the issue. Please reconsider banning this natural plan, it has done wonders for me and others, it has really gave me my life back.

I was raised on an all organic diet and using homeopathic remedies instead of using medication, I also have severe anxiety which has resulted in more than 6 hospital visits in the past 7 years. One of which was 4 days ago. I never use pharmaceutical medication because I believe that there is more side affects then what is actually necessary for the benefits. About 3 months ago I finally said I can't take it anymore and visited my aid station and tried to get on some mediction. I was prescribed a generic of paxil and hydroxyzine, I gave it a chance after about a month and a half i couldn't take it anymore, the meds I was given made my anxiety way worse and made it unbearable to work. I was going to stop it sooner but took my doctors advice \"It will get worse before it gets better.\" So I continued to take it and the frequency of my anxiety attacks got worse and I constantly had nightmares. Have in mind every time I have an anxiety attack I feel like I'm having a severe heart attack and may die, hence the reason for being hospitalized several times and every time I've been to the hospital have been treated like crap by at least one or all of the staff because my anxiety attacks resemble being on drugs even though all toxicology reports come back clean. Kratom is the only all natural medication that I have been able to take without any negative side affects and has helped tremendously. As I'm writing this I was having a mild panic attack before and took some kratom and it kicked in about halfway through this very long comment. I constantly have chest tightness and have been prescribed an inhaler of which I can't even use all the time because it will eventually have a negative effect. I have 3 beautiful girls of which the oldest is only 7 years old. They hate to see there father having panic attacks and have to go for a jog for anywhere from 3 to 11 hours just to keep himself feeling like his heart is going to explode and the last thing that I want to do is leave my wife with 3 kids because of heart failure or anything else my severe anxiety can do to me; at least what I feel like it will do to me. As some one who is fighting for our freedom in the United States of America and trying to make a contribution while I am trying to deal with this painful disease I beg you please don't schedule kratom as a schedule 1 drug. It has more medical benefits than you may know and even though you can't see it kratom is saving this country. I'm sorry for the one really long paragraph but people need more natural medication that don't have a side effect of \"MAY CAUSE DEATH\".

I know of many people, including members of my family who have died or nearly been killed by opiate addiction after they had been prescribed FDA approved pharmaceutical medication. The FDA greatly misled the public about the safety of pain medication. Now, the public has found a substance that treats pain in a much safer, and manageable way and they would like to ban it outright. I have not ever read or heard of a single person dying just from ingesting kratom. People who take it frequently have more energy, greater mental clarity, and DO NOT turn to heroin after using this drug, unlike prescription opiates. A ban would put hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of Americans in jeopardy because they might resort to illegal or prescription opiates.\n\nI understand that the government is beholden to big pharmaceutical copanies and kratom could potentially cut into their profits, but they have made quite enough money peddling their LETHAL poison to the public. I grew up in a town with good, hard-working and educated people that came from moral, middle class backgrounds. I have seen opiate addiction destroy peoples lives, people you would never think of as heroin addicts. People often turn to heroin after being prescribed opiates, once the pills are no longer medically approved, or when prescription medication such as Suboxone is too expensive. Pharmaceutical companies' answer is extremely expensive and more importantly harder to stop taking than the opiates thems l es and have terrible side effects such as tooth decay. Private prisons have made enough money criminalizing addicts created by other corporations. The United States has the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world, largely a result of criminalizing drugs. But more importantly, know that by banning the active ingredients in kratom you condemn great numbers of Americans to death.\n\nIn a less extreme illustration of the importance of kratom is that I know some one who has suffered depression and panic disorder following Lyme disease. The suffered so badly that they were labeled disabled by the government for several years, receiving SSI payments. This person regularly takes kratom and requested payments to stop since they are now able to work regularly and support themselves. The kratom helps relieve anxiety and depression. I know that several psychiatric medications that treated these conditions had terrible side effects or even worsened the very problems they were supposed to treat. I believe kratom can be very helpful to many. people.\n\nHowever, I would be amiss not to note that it can create a physical dependence and may be habit forming in some people, but certainly not everyone. There is no quality control so people could possibly take an adulterated product. So perhaps some oversight would be beneficial. Maybe states could vote on it and it could be distributed much like marijuana.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9092","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 33 year old tattoo artist, husband and father I have been using Kratom for roughly 2 and a half years.

As a front line healthcare worker in this setting I experience, on a nightly basis, the public and personal harm caused by our country's precarious relationship with opioid pain medications. I am writing this comment to express my grave concern with the recent DEA decision to place kratom and its opioid alkaloids on the schedule I substance list.\n\nI first became aware of kratom through the experience of a friend, who consumes the plant to help treat intractable pain caused by advanced neuropathy. I consider it both a personal and professional duty to help my loved ones understand the benefits and risks of any substance they put into their body, the same as I do for the patients I treat. Kratom is a plant with obvious benefits and risks to the public, and a thorough investigation of its pharmacological qualities is quite warranted.\n\nAfter even a cursory review of existing research and anecdotal evidence, it is clear to me that placing kratom into the schedule I category is premature, highly misguided, and a blatant abuse of DEA authority.\n\nKratom does demonstrate obvious benefits and risks. Clearly, it is effective in pain management in many people. It also demonstrates immense potential as an alternative to pharmaceutical opioids in those patients who suffer from physical dependency to these medications. Based on anecdotal data, kratom also appears to exhibit the potential for anxiolytic and antidepressant treatment as well.\n\nAs with any opioid, the risks of kratom appear to include potential for abuse, mild constipation, and impaired judgment or coordination. There is absolutely zero evidence to support the DEA assertion that kratom contributes to the severe and dangerous side effects of respiratory depression or sudden death. I find it highly irresponsible of the DEA to make such claims.\n\nThe pharmacological qualities of kratom warrant further research. Scheduling this plant would effectively halt these efforts, and stands in antithesis of the DEA's aims at harm-reduction and evidence-based policy.\n\nOur country is losing its battle against the chronic use and abuse of oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and other opioid pain medications. My heart is broken on a nightly basis observing the direct and collateral damage of this war on patients, families, and communities. Kratom is an immensely promising plant that can assist in this struggleplease do not destroy this tool before we have even began to explore its use.\n\nI implore the DEA to allow further examination of this plant in the medical and scientific communities where its management belongs. Any further abuses of the DEA's scheduling authority will only inflict further direct harm on our country. Prohibition is a failed model and a waste of public resources.\n\nThank you for considering this comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11460","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Derek Bremer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern,\n I am writing to voice my concern over the proposed ban on Kratom.

I am an educated technical professional and enjoy a stimulating and challenging career as a senior systems engineer in charge of 5 other engineers.\n\nI owe my current satisfaction in life largely due to my healthy relationship with Kratom.  I have safely and effectively used Kratom for over 10 years.  I use kratom in conjunction with the active care of my psychiatrist for depression and anxiety.  My doctor has determined there is no threat to using kratom with my anti-depressants.  Furthermore, my doctor has agreed to supervise and ween me off of Prozac in favor of transitioning to kratom.  This is a serious personal and medical decision between my psychiatrist and me.  My ability to choose - as an adult - the method of my treatment should remain a personal choice protected by my unalienable right to Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  \n\nAnecdotally, I can testify that Kratom has improved my life, my family and my career.  My depression and anxiety are almost non-existent now.  Additionally, I know that the DEA had concerns about the abuse potential of Kratom - again please allow research/evidence to support what the large kratom-using community already knows:   Kratom is almost impossible to abuse.  Large amounts cause rather uncomfortable dizziness and nausea (much like too much caffeine!).\n\nAs someone who abused alcohol for 20+ years, I know all too well the grip of an addictive substance.  Having now been sober for over 12 years - of which 10 years has included Kratom tea - I can honestly tell you that I have no desire to engage in harmful behavior ever again.  I chose to 'legally' self-medicate with alcohol for all those years...  which had disastrous consequences. How I wish I had known about Kratom 20 years ago!  The point is that I choose to now drink kratom tea instead.  I have found that Kratom - FOR ME - is the most efficacious manner of allowing me to lead a happy, sober and productive life.  I remain appalled that alcohol - which has no redeeming medical value, is addictive and causes over 50k deaths a year (to say the least) - is not a Schedule 1 substance!   Yet somehow a rather benign tea with the potential to save numerous lives is being considered for Schedule 1?\n\nAs such, any decision to regulate Kratom needs to be done with full scientific disclosure and regulatory transparency.  Furthermore,  the big picture about America's opioid use needs to be accounted for as well.  Please allow research to validate Kratom's role in providing significant harm-reduction for individuals suffering from depression, alcoholism and drug addiction.\n\nI do see this public comment period as a great stride in educating Americans about democracy, harm-reduction, applying common-sense regulation in place of irrational 'war on drug' tactics, addressing the larger problem of opioid addiction and the roles that pharmaceutical companies play in this epidemic, and for allowing science to research the many beneficial uses that Kratom may have to offer us:\n-- better pain relief without respiratory depression and/or addiction\n-- better treatment for opioid addiction and withdrawal\n-- depression and anxiety treatment\n-- treatment for alcoholism\nThe anecdotal evidence and the untapped potential of Kratom far outweighs any perceived imminent threat to American citizens.\n\nTo say that I am against a Schedule 1 classification does NOT mean that I am opposed towards common-sense regulation of Kratom!  (Ex:  21 years old to buy, no adulterants)\nIf the DEA bans kratom... Kratom research will be extremely difficult to pursue.  I see the ban of Kratom as a potential health-care crisis with unintended consequences  Again,  please let science, common sense, good regulation prevail over any rash classification of Kratom as a Schedule 1 controlled substance.\n\nThank you for this opportunity to participate and tell a small part of my story - and how Kratom has changed my life for the better.\nPease do not take away my ability to pursue my health and my happiness.\n\nSincerely,","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21307","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, I am in the health field  for my occupation and was put on pain medication for chronic pain 3 years ago, one month my ppin was a lot stronger so had ran out soon error than I was supposed to and the wwithdrawal for just that two days was awful so I researched and found kratom....his has been a life saver I do not use have the pain pills I used to it has dropped my blood pressure, works on my thyroid .

DEA442W. My name is Adam M I am against the ban, a responsible adult 37 years old, a husband and father to one. My health like many others here was on the decline as I have 2 pinched nerves and a flattened disc pushing on my spine in my neck. Facet triopathy on the 3 lower levels of my back and mild sciatica as well. Before finding Kratom I was taking 4 tramadol a day and it had its grasps on me. I felt highly dependent probably borderline addicted to it. I was in a constant fog and knew I needed to get out of this. So I did some research online for a natural health supplement that would ease me back into a better standard of living. That's when I came across Kratom. I heard much of what your hearing here in these comments and I thought what could it hurt, ordered some and I wasn't expecting much, but much to my surprise when I took it I was quite amazed. My fatigue lifted, I was able to get up in the morning and do meaningful tasks and go to work happy and productive. I in NO way felt \"high\" or felt any dissociation.  I was able to lift my little girl up n carry her around and stand n walk around a store for more than 10-15 min. This was 2 years ago.\nI have followed the American Kratom Association and will ultimately leave them to prove the following but I have seen evidence that Kratom is only as minimally addictive and habit forming as coffee. If compared to an opioid Its effects are very limited and mild due to its partial and very limited activity at the receptors in question. It's anti withdrawal and anti addictive behavior makes dependency FAR less prevalent in low to moderate doses. It is virtually IMPOSSIBLE to overdose on as it is a self regulating leaf and any over consumption will lead to feeling sick and nauseous and any further use to vomiting. It's overall profile appears to be quite safe. Any addiction that does occur is on par with caffeine as this substance has shown both here and abroad that exactly like caffeine, it still produces productive members of society who pose NO threat to themselves or others.\nLiver study:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20643198/\nWhen testing rats with kratom extract high doses are considered around 40mg not only can they not induce toxicity until 1000 milligrams I'd say this also reinforces the fact that respiratory depression won't kill the rat at that level. For a human I'd assume that would be extract in amount the size of a softball, or plain leaf the size of a pumpkin. \nRespiratory study:\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b00360\nKratom unlike all other conventional opioids does not activate B-Arrestin pathways, thus not creating respiratory depression and constipation\nBehavioral and addiction study:\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Axel_Becker4/publication/248705549_Behavioral_and_neurochemical_characterization_of_kratom_Mitragyna_speciosa_extract/links/576157c008ae244d0372c475.pdf?origin=publication_detail \nIn the discussion findings actually contradict what would be known as addictive behavior.\nKratom has also helped my wife's father. He has an extreme alcohol addiction and over the last 35 years has pretty much ruined both himself his relationships with others. He has had multiple concussions, more than I can count on 2 hands and has broken multiple bones in his arms and legs. He has a hard time with conversation and tasks, and has never been clean for more than ONE WEEK. Well after some hard to convince family members having to get them to try it before they would agree to it, which curbed ones smoking habit by the way. O and this man is denied any pain meds because of his addictive behavior and his health has slipped even further cause of the pain. We were at the house he stays at and I gave him some, I didn't tell him what it was but asked him to tell me what he feels like in an hour. 3 hours went by and my wife was in tears because she saw the transformation before her eyes. He was more coherent, talking and walking better. I saw him look at me out of the corner of his eye and I made a motion like tilting a beer. His eyes immediately teared up and he came to me and asked why he wasn't thinking of beer anymore and asked me if it will stay this way. He takes Kratom twice a day and is looking better than ever. So I ask you is this the substance that deserves to be controlled and not regulated to ensure all have availability to this. Controlling something like this would be deplorable.\nObviously people in less than average to dire health will benefit from this novel substance and are using it in ways far off the beaten path of abuse or recreation. It's effect to curb addictive behavior in itself should be revered.\nIf you need more positive proof go to the Internet site reddit/Kratom and search with the words (changed life) and you'll see thousands more predated years ago of the exact same productive outcomes. No one back then had any purpose to spill their heart out other than to share with a growing community.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4081","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adam M","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern:  I currently take a blood thinner so I must not take a lot of Advil (due to increased bleeding risks).

I need to work but i get extreme panic attacks for unknown reasons and kratom calmns me down. I cant drink coffee in the morning for alertness or alcohol in the evening socially because of my anxiety attacks and i dont want to become habituated to some pharmaceutical. Kratom also helps me feel less depressed.  Anxiety and depression generally go hand in hand.  Ive had no previous issues with opiates of any form and use a very small amount of kratom when necessary.

During this time I felt as if i had aged 10 years. Painkillers will do that to you. Short term relief from narcotics has a way of dragging you down with depression and a general unhealthy sluggishness. I turned to Kratom to help with ending my addiction to Vicodin after my surgery and recovery. It was a godsend. No side effects compared to opiates. My activity level and outlook on life was as if i was 10 years younger. Now i use it instead of Motrin, for muscle aches and pain. The nearest thing i can compare Kratom is is coffee. Coffee helps you wake up, Kratom helps you get up. This country should provide the active ingredient in Kratom to addicted people free. It would give them their life back, before addiction takes it away from them.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3698","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Barring hard scientific evidence to the contrary, the benefits of kratom should not be treated any differently than any other medicinal herbal product.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19931","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Glenn Mooney","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't ingest or ever plan on ingesting kratom, it just doesn't seem like something I would be interested in.

I have a combination of agonizing chronic pain and debilitating chronic fatigue which, although barely controlled with pharmaceutical drugs, are so severe I couldn't face spending another month in such misery. Worse, I couldn't see making my family watch me suffer any longer. I had become a burden on everyone around me. When I read the things people were claiming Kratom helped them with I was skeptical but thought it was worth the chance to try it. Now I'm one of the multitude of people who are begging to keep our salvation legal!!  It is terrifying to know that there are a group of people, you at the DEA, who hold the power to destroy the lives of hundreds of thousands of us who only want to live normal lives with as little pain, depression, fatigue, etc. as possible. I'm personally begging that before you make a decision , please consider what you would do if it were your wife, or daughter, or father who were in agonizing pain (of any kind) and nothing helped them. Would you deny them the miracle of relief in the form of a plant?? If you are still tempted to say \"yes because its just like heroin and just as addicting\", then I say TRY IT FOR YOURSELF and see that this is just plain incorrect! Please, you who hold the power, please do not take away our right to the relief that this miracle from planet Earth gives us. We are all strangers to you, and out of sight/out of mind, but I can assure you that you will be causing incalculable suffering if you ban Kratom!  Please don't ban it.

Quite the contrary...\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts.

He is now suboxone free because of kratom, I take it for my fibromyalgia and neuropathy, anxiety and depression, my husband takes it for hip pain, he had been on pharmaceutical drugs with no relief, kratom is a God send, it's a plant not a drug, and not addictive the way pharmaceuticals are, I don't know where we would be without it! When the news reports over doses from kratom it because it was found in the bodies along with street drugs, heroin, crack,fentanyl etc, kratom taken in large doses only makes you nauseous it does not Kill you. This amazing plant is related to the coffee plant nothing more. Please do not ban kratom, it has helped thousands of people around the world and kept them of drugs and has kept them alive!

It is so easy, instant and reliable. \n\nKratom in use for others-  \n1.) I have witnessed even more benefits in others. For instance, My Fiance has consistent neck pain, he uses Kratom daily to help relieve the pain and it is very effective for him. He was unable to afford health insurance during open enrollment and luckily can rely on this easy-to-use herb for relief. \nHe happens to be from Memphis, TN. \nA city in which has one of the strongest Opioid problems in the country. The pharmaceutical industry has been giving away these horrible benzodiazepine pills to treat issues such as anxiety, or even for instance, a poor 40 year old family-man who has to take Xanax after an Knee operation and gets hooked on them in a matter of weeks. \nTHIS is DANGEROUS stuff. The addictive properties are life hazardous. \n\nKratom is the alternative, it realistically helps people get their relief without any \"high\" like the pharmaceutical industry provides with many medications..but that's a different story.\n\n2.)  My brother suffers from RSD (Chronic Nerve Pain) throughout his entire body consistently since 2007. I have watched him go to doctor after doctor with no relief, no one willing to give him the time of research for ACTUAL relief without crazy side effects. \nEven at his most recent specialist appointment in Jacksonville, Florida. \n\" I'm sorry, currently their aren't any new products available for your condition\" -and that's it. Doctors just give up now a days, they don't help to figure out the problems and how to cure it, they hear the symptoms and write a prescription for a pill that does half the job and sends my brother spinning in the kitchen and barely able to make it down the stairs.. \n\nWe want medicine that is going to help us physically, without altering our minds and creating many dangerous side effects.. Don't you want the same?\n\nI was fed up, and I finally decided to give my brother some Kratom. I had been avoiding it since the legality is in the air and I didn't want him to get his hopes up on an herbal alternative that may be taken from him, tweaked into some chemically altered synthetic BS.\nSigh... It works. It works for him, it works for everyone else in these comments.. and effects thousands upon millions who suffer from Benzos. \n\nWe just want to be able to take our nonpyshcoactive herbs in peace. \n\nPlease.

I first started using kratom 4 years ago, since i have started using kratom i have quit drinking alcohol which has always been an issue for me. Alcohol kept me from liveing a normal life, it was hard to hold down a job much less a girlfriend. I never wanted to quit drinking because it was a social thing for me . Kratom is mostly served at kava bars which i have fallen in love with these past 4 years as my social outlet. I have became IT manager of a travel agency and have my current girlfriend of 4 years. I cant put all my success on kratom but i can say that since using it my life jas been more managable. I do not use kratom to aleviate pain, i only use it as a social drink, at parties and on weekends at the kava bars. I have never craved kratom or experianced any hangovers or withdaws from using to much or not haveing any in days. I know that it has impacted everyone i have introduced to kratom positivly. So again makeing kratom a schedule 1 drug is definetly a negative decision and will only have negative effects on the population.

I do not believe that the properties and safety profile of this plant merit it being a controlled substance, and especially not a Schedule One.\n  I began using kratom in August of 2010 as a means of breaking an opiate addiction, for which kratom was remarkably effective.  This is why I began using this plant however I continue to use it for medical reasons.  \n  I was diagnosed with Chrons disease about 2 years ago but have been dealing with it for about 4-5 and kratom has provided tremendous relief for me from two of the main symptoms of Chrons - fatigue and abdominal pain.  Chronic fatigue is a common symptom of Chrons and kratom gives me the ability to function with a normal level of energy.  On some days I simply do not have energy to get out of bed without kratom.  And no other non prescription analgesic is nearly as effective as kratom for mitigating the (sometimes very intense) abdominal pain.\n  Here is a link to a forum where Chrons sufferers talk about the ways that kratom has helped them:\nwww.crohnsforum.com/showthread.php?t=68408\n  There are clear benefits kratom has for some medical conditions.  And I dont see how a natural substance with zero fatal overdose potential could be considered to be a threat to public safety.  But one thing that can be stated with almost certainty is that if kratom were to become illegal some people would turn to using traditional opiates, inevitably leading to more overdoses and deaths.\n  Please do not ban this plant.  It has legitimate medical benefits and its prohibition would benefit no one, with the possible exception of a small elite group of pharmaceutical executives.  Please allow the honest, hardworking, law-abiding, tax-paying American citizens who depend on kratom to continue benefitting from this plant.

I'm a 43 year old male professional who has been in the work force and entertainment industry since I was 17.   I also suffer from social anxiety, depression, and ADD.    I started drinking the Kratom tea in April of 2015.  It was recommended to me by a friend in the spiritual community.  It's helped me on so many levels by giving me an increase in energy, stronger focus, and a positive mood boost.  It's helped me to be more sociable with others when I normally wouldn't be.   \n\nI had a relationship break up in January 2014 which I never bounced back from until I started drinking Kratom over a year later.  After I started drinking Kratom, I got my life back, started exercising again, and started writing again.   As a result, I was able to write and publish six books since then.  I am anti-drugs because I've witnessed the negative effects and results from taking drugs by so many people.  Not only does it destroy lives, but ones health as well.   As someone who is nutrition and exercise focused in general, I would never put anything in my body that is harmful.  Kratom is not a drug or harmful at all.   I wouldn't be able to function or accomplish anything if that were the case.  Kratom has been a lifesaver to me in many positive ways.  Therefore, I hope that the DEA seriously considers the detriment this would cause to so many people who have been able to get their life back after having the Kratom tea.  Which begs to the suggestion that not only should be Kratom be left alone, it should also be sold as a tea in health food stores such as Whole Foods and Trader Joe's.\n\nAll my best,\n\nKevin","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20615","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"RE: Docket No. DEA-442W - My Comments\n\nPlease see the attached Exhibit A.docx for my full comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8882","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern.

I've prefer to take kratom over seeking alternative medicines such as xanax because I know how addictive xanax can be. I refuse to be dependent on a medication that could quite possibly ruin my life should I decide to quit. Kratom does not create a dependency, and if I decide to stop taking it I know I won't have suicidial thoughts and terrible withdrawals. Yes, there can be some slight withdrawal symptoms if you are a daily kratom user and decide to stop - those withdrawals include a runny nose and possibly a slight headache. I believe people have worse withdrawals when they stop drinking coffee, or smoking cigarettes (of course). I know this about kratom from experience. I go through periods where I decide to stop taking it because my anxiety has subsided, and never once have I had issues with withdrawals that prevented me from functioning in my daily life. Furthermore, kratom is not addictive. Yes, it can be habit forming, and individuals who have addictive personalities lay struggle to quit - but you can also say that about coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana...... the list could go on. \n\nPlease do not place kratom as a schedule I drug. You will be doing a huge disservice to individuals all over the US who will now need to seek out pharmaceutical medication to treat their anxiety, depression, addiction to hard drugs, etc. Kratom is a natural plant, much like coffee, that doesn't deserve the sensationalized, scare-tactic reputation that the DEA is trying to give it.

I've been using it as needed, rather than dangerous, addictive opiate painkillers to treat various sports injuries and chronic pain. It helps with pain relief yet due to it's mixed action (agonist/antagonist) at the opioid receptors, there is no 'high' and no addiction potential (any more than coffee/caffeine, and certainly less than alcohol).\n\nThis supplement is cheaper and far safer than the prescription opioids people would be taking if Kratom were to be made illegal. I've even had friends use it to wean themselves off of more powerful and more dangerous opiates, quite literally SAVING their lives. Instead of doing heroin, they can take a natural supplement that apparently helps prevent the withdrawals that send so many people back on these dangerous drugs. \n\nThe safety profile of Kratom is fantastic. While prescription opiods are killing tens of thousands of Americans every year, Kratom does not produce respiratory depression and is thus a SIGNIFICANTLY safer option for those seeking pain relief. There have only been a handful of deaths over the last few years where Kratom was even present, and EVERY one of them had other, far more dangerous drugs involved. Caffine, Tylenol and almost every other common (and legal) drug is far more dangerous.\n\nI ask that the DEA please keep Kratom legal.

The US's war on drugs has been a futile effort and has become costly and unpopular. Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it. \n\n2. Our prisons are overcrowded with people who have committed menial drug-related crime, increasing financial burdens on taxpayers around the country. If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars, further exacerbating the prison population and justice problems in our country.\n \n3. The vast amount of anecdotal evidence behind kratom's benefits are difficult to ignore. Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n\n4. Kratom's benefits vastly outweigh any downside associated with it's use. Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n\n5. Our country is currently plagued with opioid addiction. My own sister is struggling with an addiction to prescription pain pills. Her addiction is having a tremendous impact on both her personal life and our family. I fear for her health and safety on a daily basis. Prohibiting kratom will take away a vital tool that could save my sister's life and worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nI believe the DEA is an upstanding agency and has an important role to play in the regulation and enforcement of dangerous substances within our society. However, I do not agree with some of the agency's past policies and decisions. Prohibiting kratom without thorough scientific study and disregarding the opinion of the general public would be a hastily myopic move unbecoming of a respectable government agency such as the DEA. Furthermore, banning yet another beneficial substance like kratom would become an increased burden on taxpayers, the criminal justice system, and a abhorrent disservice to the American people.\n\nI would kindly ask that the DEA devote its energy and resources to the substances that have already been proven to be highly addictive, life-shattering, and already negatively impacting millions of people in our country.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9713","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Josh McClelland","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a wonderful plant that helps me with controlling my mood and stress levels where antidepressants failed to help. \nAntidepressants made everything worse. \nKratom eliminated my constant feelings of despair and has given me back my life.

He uses Kratom for pain relief now instead of the dangerously addictive and life threatening prescription pain killers. Government-approved pain medications are well-known to be abused (Drugs.com, 2016, Prescription drug addiction).  These legal medications also lend to respiratory depression (Novusdetox, 2016, Opiates and opioids overdose). Kratom has in test subjects shown no instances of respiratory depression (Greenemeier, 2013, Should Kratom use be legal?). The biggest push to reclassify Kratom as a Schedule 1 substance seems only to be substantiated by the claim that there haven't been enough tests to prove Kratom's medical uses. It appears from user testimony and comments seen here that Kratom does in fact have medical merit and can be used instead of more lethal yet legal prescription pain medications. The issue is worth further medical research at least before it is reclassified and leaves users turning to more highly addictive and proven to be life threatening prescription pain medications.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17201","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"See attached file(s)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17232","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Emily Polashek","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a nurse and was told about Kratom from another nurse.

I was rushed to the emergency room as I had problems breathing, after and EKG, MRI and Ultrasound, the on call Dr. said that I would need surgery. The problem with that is I do not have medical insurance due to the cost, so using a natural form like Kratom and physical therapy was my only option. I've been to chiropractors and massage therapists to help with the chronic pain and taking Ibuprofen/Tylenol every day does not work. With all of the ailments that I currently suffer from I refuse to self medicate with  alcohol or THC. I am constantly in pain, and with that comes the stress/anxiety and depression and have no other alternative. \n\n\nTwo years ago after suffering through the pain since 2012 I learned about kratom, a natural substance known for its pain relieving qualities. I researched everything I could about Kratom and checked on the facts of how it could help me and exactly how to use Kratom, as a tea or ingesting capsules.   \n\nKratom is known to be a natural analgesic, muscle relaxer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant (http://www.vice.com/read/why-banning-the-controversial-painkiller-kratom-could-be-bad-news-for-americas-heroin-addicts). I currently take Kratom to help with the pain and anxiety and I have been able to function better than before.  Kratom has helped with my quality of life, whereas I have little or no pain at all. \n\n\nAccording to Kratom Science (https://www.kratomscience.com/strains-effects-and-dosage): An important distinction is that unlike other administered drugs like oxycodone and morphine, kratom exhibits less dependency and addiction potential on the user. \n\nI am very aware of not becoming too dependent on any one substance and believe that diversification with kratom can be beneficial to my pain management plan.\nVice News reports that it is used to wean addicts off of heroin (http://www.vice.com/read/why-banning-the-controversial-painkiller-kratom-could-be-bad-news-for-americas-heroin-addicts).\nPeople with multiple sclerosis, back pain, chronic fatigue syndrome and Lyme disease have reported relief when using kratom.\n\nAfter researching Kratom, I also have found that it is not the sole purpose of an overdose. The alleged fifteen (15) people who have reportedly died had other mixes of substances in their system, such as alcohol/cocaine & heroin.  Kratom cannot be blamed for killing someone on it's own. Unlike opioids, kratom does not suppress the breathing function, which is an element of overdosing. \n\nOver 146,000 Americans signed a petition (including myself) to halt the DEAs two-year ban on kratom. During the temporary ban, the DEA would conduct studies on this natural supplement. To me, it makes more sense to conduct studies and then come to a conclusion on whether or not to ban kratom. It clearly helped at least 146,000 people.\nSo completely blocking access to kratom will have a negative impact on those who responsibly use Kratom to deal with a chronic medical issue.\n\nI urge the DEA to stop the ban until further studies can be performed. I believe that I represent the majority of patients with chronic pain who had used opiods and other forms of medication that are far more harmful to the human body. I am responsible and educated. Yes, there is an opioid epidemic in this country. However, taking away a \"natural supplement\" that could replace an opioid as pain management makes no sense whatsoever. \n\n\nSincerely,","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18614","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dena Boyd","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have never used kratom personally but I have a friend that suffers from severe withdraws that gets great relief from it.

I believe doing so without proper scientific research into the effect of Kratom on the human body and mind would be irresponsible.  Many people suffering from chronic pain have reported positive effects from proper use of Kratom.  Identifying Kratom as a Schedule 1 drug would deny people the right to another option of treatment that may be preferred to traditional pharmaceuticals.  \n\nI believe Kratom itself is not a danger to society and does not need to be placed on Schedule 1.  Proper misuse of any potentially mind altering substance may have extreme consequences.  We currently are in contact with many things everyday that could cause us grave harm if misused.  Cars are an effective way to get around but if misused can lead to serious injury of self and others.  Ethanol, the drinkable form of alcohol, is used purely for recreation yet is legal and has the potential to cause serious harm to self and others if misused.  \n\nI hope you will consider my comments when making your decision the placement of Kratom on the list of Scheduled drugs.  Thank you for taking the time to read my comment.

I am 43 years old, a former Naval Officer, I hold a Juris Doctor, and am a program manager, responsible for accounts totaling more than $60,000,000 annually. I am a Christian, and volunteer in my community. Kratom impacts all aspects of my life; I beg the DEA to leave Kratom unscheduled and accessible to people like me.\nIn 2012 I was diagnosed with Lyme Disease. After 2 years of treatments, the disease left me chronically fatigued and suffering joint pain in my hips, knees, and feet. I could not lead the active lifestyle I needed. Additionally, I am predisposed to high cholesterol and am diagnosed with Depressive Disorder, and General Anxiety Disorder. Without overcoming fatigue and pain, I was unable to exercise.  Exercise is essential to treating all of these issues.\nIn 2014, a fellow Lyme patient recommended Kratom. The results are miraculous! 2 years later I can do all the things I love, especially exercise! I run about 15 miles per week, and am in excellent physical and mental condition. Kratom is the game-changer.\nEvery other day, I brew two tablespoons of Kratom with two cups of water. Just before I exercise, I drink 1 cup. Within a few minutes I am able to run pain-free. After running 4-8 miles, I ice my knees and feet and drink the second cup. The pain-relief lasts through the night and into the next day.\nKratom did not heal my conditions. However, Kratom gives me the ability to be active, and it is that activity that is helping treat my conditions. Since being able to exercise, my cholesterol count is down and my mood and anxiety are more stable than ever; I feel great!  I tried other treatments (e.g. ibuprofen, acetaminophen, etc.), but they do not provide the sustained relief needed to exercise. Furthermore, there is no scientific evidence that Kratom has the long-term negative side effects of the OTC drugs listed above. \nKratom does not produce a high. After taking Kratom, I am not impaired in any way. I am able to do all tasks with the same sobriety as the days I do not drink the tea. Twice, I was given opiates to for severe pain. I was not able to think clearly, and my motor skills were compromised, keeping me from performing everyday tasks and impairing my judgement. Kratom has no such effects.  \nSecondly, by scheduling Kratom, the Agency will worsen the opiate addiction crisis. Kratom has no high similar to opiates; even if it did, Kratom is not an opiate!  It is chemically similar to coffee, and does not have the addictive properties of opiates. At least one scientific study concludes that Kratom has no harmful side effects, even after long term use.\nAssuming arguendo, that Kratom provides the same high as opiates, the user has no risk of overdose, as Kratom does not slow the respiratory system like opiates. Therefore, removing Kratom as a safe alternative to opiates will have negative outcomes, as people in search of opiate substitutes will not be able to find one and will continue to use opiates, thereby increasing the risk of overdose. After an investigation into Kratom, the state of Florida concluded that it should be kept unscheduled. I implore the Agency to rely on the integrity of the Florida study and reach the same conclusion.\nThirdly, scheduling Kratom has the appearance that the Agency is serving special interests over the public.  Kratom users are mostly over 35 treating chronic pain. Scheduling Kratom appears to be an attempt to force these people into the prescription drug market, to take medications that are less safe and have higher potentials for abuse and addiction, all to serve special interests.\nThis theory is analogous to cannabis. 26 states legalized cannabis for medical use, but the Agency affirmed its position that cannabis has no known medical application. Moreover, the FDA approved a synthetic cannabinoid that has the same effect on the user as natural cannabis. In other words, the Agency allows doctors to prescribe synthetic cannabis, but claims that cannabis has no known medical benefit.  The motive of serving the Agencys special interests is obvious\nIn closing, I plead with the Agency to keep Kratom unscheduled. My story is one of countless stories about Kratoms positive impact on the lives of good people. We do not get high; we use Kratom as a supplement and alternative to prescription and OTC drugs that cannot provide the same relief, have harmful side effects, and are prone to addiction and overdose. With these considerations, I trust that the Agency will make the right decision for the well-being and quality of life for Kratom users.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15618","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Blade","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me significantly with pain and social anxiety and enabled me to be more productive at work.

Even caffeine has a relatively low LD50, but we trust the public to make their own decisions with it.

He has been able to get off of about 6 prescription medications for pain, anxiety and depression because of kratom. He makes a tea from the crushed leaves only.  He does not even use extracts. It is heartbreaking to think that he would be criminalized for his use of this botanical.  He is thriving now, but he was not thriving on those other prescription meds.  I really don't know what he will do if the DEA persists in this misguided action. \n\nAs a citizen, I am furious that this is clearly not a mandate from the people, and the DEA is overstepping its authority.

In many ways, Kratom is an herbal pain reliever and I believe banning it is nonsensical in the way banning coffee would be. However, I do support some regulations, just as tobacco has a minimum age limit. Unlike alcohol, Kratom is not mind altering, and I believe, if any regulations should be required, it should be treated much like tobacco, and should be available without a prescription in it's natural form. \n\nI also think Kratom should be studied as an over-the-counter replacement option for those suffering from pain. I believe if doctors tried Kratom with patients first, similar to how they try ibuprofen or Aleve before moving to narcotics on patients- which then can lead to addiction, pain and suffering and worsening drug addiction in those patients who move from prescription painkillers to street drugs. \nThe cycle is quite terrible for families, it is expensive to tax payers, it is life threatening to the user and it is an epidemic growing exponentially. \n\nI have witnessed, first hand, the use Kratom as an herbal remedy to alleviate the pain of the withdrawal cycle for heavy drug users, and then lifting them out of the cycle of illegal drug use, into a healthier life while still being able to treat their pain naturally with Kratom. Personally, I also have found Kratom works as a natural anxiety alleviant, and if it is banned, that would force me to have to make the difficult decision of whether to start taking prescription medications like Xanax, which make me feel terrible, alter my personality, drains me of my normal energy and makes my overall quality of life less... or decide to live with anxiety without medication which also lessens my over quality of life.\n\nFor these reasons and more, I ask you to drop the Kratom ban and continue to allow Kratom to be purchased by those over the age of 18, similarly to our current tobacco policy.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5381","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Danielle K","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI am a 37-year-old Professional Psychologist, mother and wife.

He is a father, husband and sole bread-winner of the family:\n\nDear DEA,\n\nPlease remove Mitragynine & 7-hydroxymitragynine which is in Kratom from becoming a Schedule I substance.\n \nI am 29 and suffer from a herniated disc, chronic neck pain, TMJ, arthritis in my neck. I support a family of four on a single income. I have been to many doctors with little success for treatment. I have found that Kratom improves my quality of life after a hard days work. It isnt comparable to any drugs, marijuana, alcohol or other stimulants.  Kratom helps to improve my quality of life that I suffer with chronic pain. Please dont make this herb illegal. Cervical injections, botox injections, chiropractic care, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, yoga exercises have not helped with my pain.\n \nKratom is a well-known, well-researched herbal substance drawn from the leaves of trees within the coffee family. The number of cases of documented harm from kratom use is remarkably low, both as an absolute matter and when considered against the extensive history of use of kratom, both inside and outside the United States\n \nMitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are two of the primary alkaloids of this plant. These two compounds are not synthetic and should not be lumped together with  \"bath salts\" or \"spice\".\n \nKratom has been used as a medicine by many people for thousands of years. It is a potent remedy for physical pain, anxiety and depression, and could be used to aid with opiate withdrawal by those who would like to quit using illicit drugs such as heroin. Kratom is NOT a hallucinogen and should not be classified as such. Adding mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as a Schedule I substance is rash and unjustified prohibition, resulting in a foreseeable increase in street drug-related crime, as well as a punishment to those who are currently using it responsibly to treat various ailments.\n\nThe reason that there are no deaths solely attributed to Kratom is because Kratom does not affect your respiratory capacity. It does not slow down your central nervous system. It's potential to do harm is virtually impossible.\n\nKratom has very limited recreational capacity.  The White House petition has over 100,000 signatures for the \"Please do not make Kratom a Schedule I Substance.\" \n\nThe federal government has invested significant resources to develop alternative pain management strategies. This includes a study funded by the National Institutes of Health in partnership with the University of Massachusetts and the University of Mississippi to investigate the use of Kratom as a remedy for opioid withdrawal. This study led the researchers to apply for a patent identifying the Kratom extract, mitragyinine, as a useful treatment for other addictive drugs besides opiate derivatives. The DEAs decision to place Kratom as a Schedule I substance will put a halt on federally funded research and innovation surrounding the treatment of individuals suffering from opioid and other addictionsa significant public health threat. Remember the DDear Colleague Letters of Senator Hatch and Congressman Mark Pocan.\n \nWe hope you realize the threat this scheduling causes the people seeking legitimate use of this special plant to improve our quality of life.

My name is Carter Fleming, I am 52 and self-employed. When I'm able to work, that is. Herniated discs, spinal compression and stenosis all contribute to an acute condition that prevents me from holding any sort of steady employment or even being able to stick to one thing for any productive length of time. Several years ago I was prescribed Tramadol for my pain which developed into a full-blown dependency, and was never fully effective. The only thing I have found that relieves my neuralgic symptoms enough for me to function during the day and sleep at night is kratom. the first time I tried it I had no need for the medication and have not looked back since. While I recognize a dependency of any sort is not healthy, I have worked to control and manage my body's many structural issues for years, and I recognize that I feel and function better when I consume this natural herb to manage my pain than I do on either Tramadol or Ibuprofen. Please consider the many legitimate uses of this amazing gift from nature and don't take away control of our bodies.\n\nRespectfully yours,\nCarter Fleming","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11145","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carter Fleming","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, my name is Chace Wayne Young, i am raising a family with my gorlfriend and i am an artist.

I am 39 years old and have lived in California, Oregon, and Hawaii. I don't believe Kratom should become illegal. We should have the choice as Americans to make these decisions for ourselves. I first was introduced to Kratom in Hawaii. After hearing that it has a stimulating effect to help deal with depression I wanted to try it. I tried it and it worked, I felt more confident and had the energy back that I had been missing. I had thought to myself several times that this is a miracle plant and why don't more people know about this. I also shattered my heel years ago when I fell three stories. The Kratom helps with the pain and the swelling. I sometime had to use pain pills to deal with the pain when I am at work on my feet all day. I have had bad experiences with pain pills and don't ever want to use them again. With Kratom I will never need to use pain pills again. When i first discovered Kratom I was so happy that I found something legal, natural and that worked for several of my issues. I have been more productive at work and a  better husband and father. All thanks to the use of Kratom to fight my physical pain and depression. My only other alternative would be medication from the doctor that has so many negative side effects. This plant has helped so many people to live better lives and deal with pain. Please leave Kratom legal as it will be helping so many people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16246","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Peter Carland","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm against adding Mitragyine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, aka, Kratom to the Schedule 1 of Controlled Substances.\nIt has helped me manage my anxiety and mild aches and pains, depression, and even helps me maintain focus.

My life was a living hell before I discovered Kratom, as I was highly dependent upon prescription opiates delivered to me by my doctor.  The efficacy of these prescription drugs have an inverse return, losing precious pain-killing effects over time whilst simultaneously building tolerance and thus propagating intense withdrawals.  I would experience these withdrawals every morning as a result of my medication, and felt helpless, alone, and depressed.  Kratom allowed me to ween off of my medicines with minimal discomfort and resume a completely productive and normal life as a software entrepreneur, able to traverse the globe and work long hours without withdrawal from meds or exhaustion due to my chronic pain.  This substance has proven to be a godsend.  \n   Opiates had begun to cause serious damage to my heart, interfering with the electrical impulses produced therein and causing dangerous arrhythmia in an evermore recurring fashion.  Kratom has proven to be almost negligibly addictive, with a runny nose and irritability being the only side effects when I have stopped taken for a week or two (much like  coffee, and certainly less addictive then Immodium A/D).  My mother and grandmother, both seriously dependent upon painkillers for their Rheumatoid Arthritis (It's genetic), have completely changed their lives and improved their happiness and productivity a thousand fold due to this amazing substance.  Please do NOT ban Kratom on December 1st, and do not put control into the hands of doctors.

Before kratom, i was having to see a pain management dr monthly for years. Got to the point though that the meds were not working and made me feel worse mentally/physically. Someone told me about kratom and amazingly I was not only able to start taking it for my health issues, but I also didn't go thru terrible withdrawals from all the meds the doctor's had me on! I take it daily when before I took five different prescriptions!  If kratom becomes illegal, I honestly dont know what I will do. I don't want to go back to all those meds that not only cost an arm and a leg, but are worse to my health, addicting and doesn't help like this tea leaf. It doesnt make me foggy, messed up or anything negative. It's just absolutely amazing and I thank God for it. I'm a wife, mother of three, Christian and by no means is kratom a drug such as heroine, Marijuana,  etc!!! I've known several who it has changed their lives as well and some that were set free from addiction to pain killers. Making kratom illegal will ruin lives and I do believe there will be a much worse epidemic take place by taking away a life changing/helping/healing leaf from those who need it. Kratom works and saves lives. I know, for it has for me! And for the record, overdosing is impossible! Take a bit too much, which rarely happens, then you get nauseous, vomit then all better! Doesnt knock you out or ever put you out of your mind! It's like coffee or tea, but helps with chronic pain!!!

Opiate addiction is huge in the world and as you know we are currently experiencing a heroin epidemic here in the US. These drugs are causing many to lose their loved, face hardship, etc. This plant, mitragyna speciosa, has helped hundreds of thousands including myself overcome their particularly deadly opiate addiction. I suffer from chornic back pain and severe anxiety issues which caused my to gain an addiction from my prescribed painkillers and benzodiazepines. It has ruined a huge portion of my short adult life. Then, I discovered kratom. This leaf completely turned around my addiction and pain issues. It has not been proven that overdose is even possible on kratom alone. Since taking kratom I have been able to start working again and functioning like a normal human being. I live in Washington where marijuana is legal and for medical reasons has been for awhile. I compare this plant to marijuana. IT does have possibility for addiction just like marijuana can be addicting. Alcohol is addicting as well but WAY more harmful than kratom ever could be. I understand kratom produces a euphoric effect like many other substances(such as alcohol) which is why I believe there SHOULD be, without a medical reason, a age restriction on kratom of 21. Just like marijuana and alcohol here in Washington. I have seen kratom help many, many people overcoming opiates and using kratom as safe alternative to the normally prescribed opiates. Please realize this plant is saving thousands of lives and banning it will not help anyone. Most people will go back to their painkillers or turn to more extreme drugs such as heroin and the death count will rise.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1945","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason King Snaza","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thanks for taking the time to read my comment.  Kratom has been enormously helpful to me during my recovery from heroin and methamphetamine addiction.  Using Kratom has allowed me to deal proactively with my periods of craving and withdrawal from what are known to be dangerous drugs.  I've been sober for 21 months.  Before going to rehab, I was sober for maybe a handful of days during a span of about 18 years.  I had A LOT of adjustments to make in my thinking and how I related to the world.  Kratom has helped me feel 'normal' and has allowed me to meet the many challenges of newly found sobriety with strength and minimal emotional and physical discomfort.  I used Suboxone, under medical orders, during my initial phase of acute withdrawal; it helped enormously, but was not ideal for me for long term use.  Suboxone negatively affected my memory, sex-drive and emotional state.  Being on Suboxone for an extended length of time was nearly as troublesome as being back on heroin.  With Kratom, I experience NONE of the side-effects I had with Suboxone.  Kratom is nothing short of miraculous.  The only negative effects I've experienced from Kratom came from when I first began taking it, and being inexperienced, I took too much.  The result?  Nausea that lasted for a couple of hours, that's it.  Comparing the effects of Kratom to the effects of hard drugs is GROSSLY INACCURATE.  Hard drugs kill.  For that matter, caffeine kills, tobacco kills, alcohol kills- people even die from misusing sugar or water.  The dose makes the poison.\nScheduling Kratom will help no one.

I wanted to state how kratom has helped me. I have no real urges or strong desires to take kratom for a \"high\". It simply provides a mild mood lift. I also wanted to explain that I have no so-called \"withdrawal\" symptoms from stopping my use of kratom. Coffee is harder to stop than the herbal supplement kratom in my opinion. Kratom is not meant to substitute any form of prescription drug nor is it a substitute for medical help. The FDA disclaimer applies to all my comments as kratom is not evaluated by the FDA and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent disease. Kratom supports my health in many ways. It relieves occasional sleeplessness. Helps me focus and stay on task. Reduces anxious feelings and obsessive compulsive behavior. Receives very minor pain from mild injuries. Helps restore mental alertness when experiencing mild, occasional fatigue. Kratom should be treated just like any other supplement without regulation. It is not meant for a medical cure for anything. It is simply used to maintain my health and well-being. If another substance is adulterated inside of kratom then the FDA has the right to remove the particular brand from the market through due process, just like how other supplements are treated. I believe the best way to handle this is without regulation and by categorizing this as an herbal supplement.

Like many others, I started enjoying how they made me feel but of course I 8 had to take more and more to reach that high and for pain relief.  Once I lost insurance I resorted to purchasing from the street. I definitely slowed down my intake because of the cost. My life REALLY went down hill from there. I moved to a smaller house, started missing due dates on my bills, etc. \n\nI finally did a search one day on what would help me deal with my pain and withdrawals. I came across marijuana, of course, but did not want to do something else it was it illegal. Then I came across kratom. I read everything I could about it. I ordered some, and took it. That day was the day I stop taking pain pills. I got off the opiates with virtually no side effects from not taking pain pills. Now, I take kratom maybe once a day when my back is hurting. You can def try and get that feeling from kratom you used to get from pain pills, but that, I think, is the best part of kratom.  It will just make you feel bad no matter your tolerance.  Believe me, I've tried.  I've tried increasing my tolerance but quickly found out it doesn't do anything and I was wasting money. \n\nPLEASE don't make this illegal. Today I'm in a successful relationship, my bills are all up to date, just bought a brand new car, and I'm pain free.

Early in my life I became withdrawn from social circles, and many important life opportunities were closed off to me as a result of the impotence of my social skills. \n\nI have what I can describe an irrational fear of social situations. It took a lot of work for me to be able to make conversation with anyone not in my immediate family, and I often felt as if higher education and future job prospects may be out of my reach as a result.

It is no exaggeration to say that I was able to attend a major public university in my state, get married, and build a social network all thanks to Kratom. \n\nI continue to use Kratom today because it is safe when used by responsible adults, such as many other supplements daily consumed in the US. I want Kratom to remain available, in part to continue helping me as well as many others in my situation, and also because I would honestly like to see well documented, public and unbiased research on Kratom.

To consider adding kratom to the drug scheduling system is a waste of money and time, as well as a loss of quality of life for many people. \nThis is another natural product that is viewed as a threat because politicians do not see the value, but many lobbying industries see the value of it being scheduled, including the pharmaceutical companies and the prison industrial complex.  When you ask the people, and thank you for asking us now, we see the truth about natural, plant based treatments for what ails us. \nThe pharmaceutical route is a valid one but it is not for everybody. People who cannot take opioids (for many reasons including: addiction, fear of addiction, opioid allergy, lack of money for doctors visit and prescriptions) can utilize kratom instead. There are other benefits and dangers to discover. But we can learn them only if we can study the plant further and a Schedule 1 \"drug\" cannot be studied. Scheduling kratom is cutting off our arm for a scraped elbow.\nThere is a need for medicine in the form of a natural plant. We know they work and now we have the scientific ability, as well as the desire, to understand them better. We want to explore why they work and for what symptoms within the body.\nI would like to note that sooner or later, pharmaceutical companies will be creating, selling, and marketing for big money, synthetic forms of these very same chemicals.

Unlike many pharmaceuticals, kratom does not have adverse side effects.  Having it available without a prescription is also keeping it accessible to those in need.  The war on drugs is a colossal failure and adding useful drugs, such as kratom to the list will not make it a success.  As the country becomes more educated on drugs and moves to deregulate more drugs, adding drugs to the schedule 1 list seems to be an act of ignorance.  The sufferers who have successfully treated their conditions with kratom deserve to have access to it.  Safe, legal access to kratom is an American right.

Kratom ease my pain without the horrible side affects of pain pills.

Kratom helped me get thru the surgery pain as well. Only 1 surgery did I end up on pain pills for an extended time. The shoulder was not healing properly and there was more than the 'standard' pain with it. I did not use Kratom during that short period due to bleeding risk.

You're repeating the same dangerous and violent and arrogant mistakes -- except, of course, with the added mistake of not bothering to secure the proper lawful authorization first. Why would that be?\n\nIf you want prohibition authority, get to work stumping for the People to LAWFULLY delegate it (again) through the conveniently provided amendment process -- the one that you nevertheless evidently considered simply too onerous to pursue for your neo-prohibition efforts.\n\nSupporting documentation: Declaration of Independence, US Constitution\nSuggested alternative: a return to a society in which the maximum role of government is the protection of individuals' rights to life, liberty, and property. Or at the very least, to where government actually respects the restrictions imposed on it.\nPros: Individual liberty\nCons: Individual liberty (I understand how that grates. I don't care. I'm not obligated to.)\nTrade-offs: You'd lose unlawfully arrogated power.

Kratom is a medicinal plant used for millennia in Southeast Asia, and is currently being used safely by millions of people in the U.S. Medical evidence supports kratom's efficacy as a pain reliever and opiod replacement. Many people struggling with opiod addiction have used kratom to cut back or quit, but now promising scientific studies regarding kratom's role in opiod addiction could be immediately and needlessly halted.                       Prohibiting kratom would be counterproductive to our country's problems of opiod addiction and overdose. Adding kratom to any one of the five drug schedules would cause people using it to be criminalized and arrested, expanding the war on drugs even though the American public overwhelmingly supports ending it.

I have chronic back pain caused by severe scoliosis. The way my spine is twisted, it actually presses against my lungs and when the pain gets bad, it can cause difficulty breathing. I have dealt with this since I was 15, and never been able to find any kind of real relief, especially any that didn't harm my body,  until I started taking kratom. Doctors told me they couldn't do anything to help me other than throw pain killers (opiates) at me, unless I wanted to have surgery. So, I chose to take the 'easier' way, or so I thought, and took prescribed pain killers. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, but to make a long story short, it made for a very difficult time in my life. I became addicted to opiates and the relief it gave me. I was not able to live a happy and productive life without them, because I was in pain. What I didn't realize though, is the longer I was physically addicted to this junk, the more unhappy I became. Luckily, I realized how miserable I was and made my way to rehab and began my journey of sobriety. Unfortunately, I was prescribed Suboxone for my pain, since I was unable to take any narcotics. This  did me more harm than good. It didn't help with pain, my mind was foggy, I had no motivation, and was still not living up to my potential. About four years after taking this, I found out about kratom and all of its benefits. It's a natural plant, that God put on this planet, just like the fruits and vegetables He created for us to eat in order to survive. He put these other plants here for us to use to help us as well, and if kratom can actually help us, why should we not take advantage of this? Kratom has been used for thousands of years for many different types of ailments, and actually does work! Of course, I believe more research needs to be done for us to know everything about it, but we can't do that is you place this PLANT on the schedule one list! It is nothing like heroin or LSD in any way shape or form. The effects of it are very much like coffee, and is related to coffee. The biggest reason I believe that we need to research this plant and keep it legal is because of the very serious opiate epidemic we have in this country. Way too many people are overdosing/dying every day from drugs that are begingegally prescribed by doctors, and  we must stop it! It would be asinine not to try and figure out a way to use it, if only for that reason alone! In conclusion, my life is so much better now since I started using kratom, that I am doing things I never thought I would do and living a very happy & content life. So much so, that People who have known me for a while have noticed what a change there has been in my life, and when they ask why I look so much better and happier, I tell them it's because of kratom. (of course i give all the credit to God, but He did give us kratom!) I don't use drugs, I don't drink alcohol, and frankly I never think of wanting to do those things. I am pain free and only want to better my life! PLEASE DO NOT PUT KRATOM ON SCHEDULE ONE- keep it legal, and let us use it the way He intended!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17705","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Abbie McMillan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This substance could be the answer to the opiate problem in this country.

The doctors prescribed a cocktail of various drugs to treat her symptoms that make her nauseous, give her headaches, insomnia, and negatively affect her taste buds; most food tastes bad and she seldom eats or eats very little which affects her blood sugar.\n\nAfter a friend told me about kratom, I did some research online. There are multiple articles supporting both the benefits and risks associated with this plant. The articles supporting provided historical evidence of kratoms use in Southeast Asia for treating various maladies and multiple user testimonials. The articles warning of kartoms use came primarily from drug treatment centers and looked more like advertisements to enroll in the various treatment centers without any real evidence that the drug was dangerous or addictive.\n\nWith my research behind me, I bought some capsules from an organic supplement store and gave them to my wife as a birthday gift. I was seriously concerned that the medication she was taking was having more harmful side effects than benefit. We agreed that she would stop the meds for two weeks and try this herbal alternative to what the outcome would be. If she didnt feel better, she would go back to the prescriptions. \n\nWe are on our third week, taking 4 pills of Maeng Da kratom per day  2 in the morning and 2 at night. She has been able to fall asleep faster and sleep easier, albeit not as long as I would like. It seems like her appetite has returned but we are still determining that outcome. The blood pressure and sugar spiked for the first 4 days but testing every day is showing a steady decrease. \n\nIm not suggesting that this is some super plant that will cure all health problems. I have not seen nor has my wife experienced any negative side effects. We are not fearful that this can be habit-forming or addictive and its not some massive rollercoaster ride of a high then a crash like some other schedule 1 controlled substances.\n\nThe composition of this plant has made a positive change in my wifes health and in our lives. If more research is needed for FDA approval, then take the time and verify.

I am 38 years old so I assume that this may be caused by changing hormones at my age.  I researched natural ways to help with anxiety and Kratom kept appearing.  I decided order a small amount because was desperate to live my life again.

I continued take a small amount daily, I skipped some days, I skipped a couple of weeks when money was low and I experienced no withdrawal issues.  Kratom has improved my quality of life tremendously I enjoy consuming it as a responsible adult.  As a nurse I have seen many MANY people struggle with addiction and I even lost a couple friends to abuse of prescription medication over the years.  \nI ask that you please allow Kratom to not become a scheduled substance, it is not dangerous, addictive, nor does give a person  \"high\".  It deserves be studied so it can help people who struggle daily can continue their lives in peace and happiness.

I've been taking Kratom daily for over a year, and first tried it seven years ago. I've found it useful to combat depression, anxiety and back pain from a narrowed disc. I take one capsule six times a day. Two months ago, I had a complete blood checkup, and all the numbers were normal. \n\nAn important distinction Kratom has from prescription opioids, in addition to feeling milder and not sedating , is  no tolerance. I was taking ten capsules per day this time last year.\n\nIf Kratom becomes illegal, I worry my treatment resistant depression I was diagnosed with and battled years ago may return, as well as not being able to function as well socially, and be less able to tolerate the long hours I work.\n\nI will likely avoid opioid painkillers if Kratom becomes illegal, however many tens of thousands will turn to them if Kratom isn't available. Making Kratom illegal seems a bit like making coffee illegal. There are well over a hundred thousand who take it, and such a small number of poison control calls should be expected from a safe herb that may have slightly punishing effects if taken in excess, like nausea and headache, not getting high.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3483","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Gardner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been an herbal supplement that I've been taking for a few years.

This wonderful concoction brought me more peace and dampened the anxiety by a lot. Anytime I felt my anxiety spike, I would run off and mix this herbal supplement with camomile or any other teas. I have not stopped using this for two years - give or take. I think it would be huge mistake to take this off the market.

Kratom is a member of the coffee family and isn't much different than black tea, green tea or coffee. There is no reason to make this plant/tea illegal, none what so ever. The kratom community has already made their voices heard and their cases made to the DEA and to politicians a like. In fact a lot of political leaders have got involved in this cause and agree that kratom should remain legal. No one has ever died from kratom alone. We should not be even wasting all of our time on this subject, making kratom illegal will be a waste of tax payers money and a waste of time for law enforcement. Since there seems to be an issue with this tea there has to be a middle ground that we can all agree on. Please let's work together or just leave this issue alone.

She is my wife and the mother of our four beautiful children and she was unable to function.  Sometimes she was bedridden for a week.\n\nShe was prescribed several different medications, all of which had severe side effects and impaired her psychologically and cognitively.  Again, with she was still unable to function as a productive citizen and mother of our four children.\n\nSometime late in 2005 we discovered kratom through various internet searches looking for an all natural way to help her with her conditions.  With kratom she was able to function as a normal person for the first time in years!  She no longer needed the prescription medications that altered her personality and put her in an eternal mental fog.  Kratom gave me my wife back.  Kratom gave me my kids their mother back.  Scheduling kratom will take her away from us!\n\nMy wife has been taking kratom almost daily for more than 10 years.  There have been absolutely no negative side effects and it is exactly as \"addicting\" as a cup of coffee.  Kratom has been taken for more than a thousand years in South East Asia.  Kratom was documented by the Dutch when they first explored Malaysia close to 200 years ago.  Kratom is nothing new and has been helping people for a very, very long time.  There are no reports of illness due to kratom in these regions or in the United States.\n\nRegulation of Kratom is yet another overreach of the government.  It is already established that kratom is safe with very few, if any, risks.  Currently, kratom has all the regulation it needs as a Dietary Supplement.  Being that it was sold in the USA prior to October 15 1994 it should be acknowledged as a \"generally recognized as safe\" supplement by the FDA.  Access to natural products, herbs, and supplements is a basic human right.  Regulating our right to use a plant that we feel is helpful is violating our human rights.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16485","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Bang","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I feel strongly that the medical uses of Kratom should be studied before making it illegal.

I have been in dance since I was 2 years old and have always been physically fit and healthy. While in college and dancing in our university dance team, I got into a very bad accident which ended my favorite hobby and passion for dance. I was prescribed opiates and eventually stopped taking them. In 2001, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology and a year later, met my husband. In 2004, I got pregnant with my first child and started having lower back pain again. The pain was manageable at first but escalated over the years; but I was unfortunately put back onto pain medication. An MRI confirmed that the pain was due to reoccuring muscle strains; old tears that never fully healed. From 2004 to 2011, I pulled my back out and have been bedridden a total of 8 times. Each time I was working a full-time job and had to use vacation hours to be at home. By 2011, I was addicted to pain meds and suffered the adverse side effects just to manage my pain. It was then my father in law introduced me to kratom. He was born in Thailand and fought in Guam before coming to the US. Since the introduction, I no longer use opiates and have been able to manage my pain a lot better with the combination of OTC medicines such as Ibuprofen and Tylenol and other therapies and exercise. Kratom has given me new life and to take away my right to choose an herbal remedy over a narcotic, is heartbreaking to the say the least. I am not a drug-seeking, 20-year old looking for a high. I am a middle-class working mom who is just looking to control my pain naturally without fear of addiction. Unlike taking an opiate, I am able to function with a clear mind and focus to run a business and a household. There is no \"high\". There is no \"overdosing\". The worst that could happen if you take too much is that you get nauseated and have to lay down. \n\nPlease do not take kratom away from me and the thousands of other middle-class, hardworking individuals that use kratom to ease their symptoms from Endometriosis, Lyme disease, addiction, anxiety and depression issues, PTSD and a host of other diseases and disorders that kratom has helped manage.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5762","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a Special Operations veteran that currently still serves.

Pills, fentanyl, the occasional dope.  I had only been an addict for about two years, but I had already messed \nup my life big time.  I spent like 4 or 5 months total in the hospital and nursing home.  There they treated me with tons of morphine and dilaudid, which I needed to breathe.  It was probably the most IV opiates I have ever had.  Eventually my illnesses got better and I was released to the world, with a nice referral to the methadone clinic.  \n\nbecause I am prescribed clonazepam, I got kicked out of the methadone clinic twice, immediately returning to heroin both times, because I was more addicted than I had ever been.  I tried constantly, but the suboxone urinalysis were impossible for me to get into, because their policy is you have to be clean from heroin to get into the suboxen program, I tried, but if I could make it through the first week of heroin withdrawals then I wouldn't need opioid replacements.  So I struggled with those options and heroin for two more years.    \n\nI quit using heroin two years ago when my fiancee died.  I was clean for two months when I started craving and was positive I would relapse... Methadone clinics are full of junkies that just want to supplement their addiction in my experience, there was a huge risk for sudden discontinuation, which certainly would have led me back to heroin or killed me with my heart problems. (*1) suboxone gives me panic attacks (*2), and Narcotics Anonymous and therapy just makes me depressed and want to use again (because I have OCD, Major Recurrent Depression, Panic Disorder and general Anxiety, and more).  Even therapy was useless because the OCD interferes with it.  \n\nSo, two months after my fiancee died, Following advice from my psychiatrist, John Seymour Howland, Md., I have been, for two years, taking opoid replacement therapy.  Instead of traditional methadone/suboxen drugs, which, as I mentioned, have intolerable side effects and social implications detrimental to my recovery, I have been taking kratom ever since.  I drink it with water about three times a day.  It doesn't make me high, there is no euphoria from this herbal remedy.  It works similar to suboxone by not activating all 5 of the opoid receptors in our brain.  (*3).  \n\nI have had no ill effects, and full relief from my opiate cravings, without the debilitating high or withdrawl effects.  To be honest, there are withdrawl effects, but they are barely noticeable. Maybe slightly watery eyes for a few days.  I buy kratom from USA vendors only.  I think it is a critical dietary supplement for our country, and if it needs to be taxed because it comes from overseas, so be it, but it does not need to be scheduled.  I like the state laws that were recently passed, limiting kratom purchase to 18+ aged individuals.  Kratom should come with literature including its ancient origins and instructions like to not mix with certain drugs or alcohol, since the only times people have died involving kratom were mainly due to complications from something else.  Kratom is safe when used properly, and if I had a child with chronic pain I would want him or her to eat kratom herb instead of take dangerous pharmaceutals.  My elderly mother said that she would eat kratom instead of take drugs from doctors if she was in pain.  Remember, this drug saved me from heroin relapse.  Relapse killed my fiance.

For me to stop kratom and go to a methadone clinic instead would be so ridiculous, it would be legal, but morally it would really be wrong, that's much more powerful than what i need, that's way more addictive and very dangerous.

Although ending the drug war would likely put drug warriors out of work, they could get more lucrative jobs in the motion picture industry, as private investigators, or armed mercenaries in the Middle East. Or they could take up golf!

Something switched in my seemingly normal brain when I started abusing legal pain killers ten years ago. In general, my addiction just got worse and eventually led me to heroin for the last two years. My story is not uncommon unfortunately, as you know. I am not a weak person. Somehow during that time, I've managed to maintain a busy, profitable painting business, and take care of my family while I hid my addiction. As my addiction spiraled into heroin however, the game changed; I needed help. \nSuboxon is a terrible way to quit and unless in an inpatient rehab your chances of Quitting opiates are terrible. Which is a win/win for big pharmacy. Suboxon is very strong and extremely addictive despite its schedule 3. \nFor me, nothing has come close to eleviating withdrawal and eventually maintaining a healthy lifestyle. (Something that used to matter a whole lot to me). I was able to use Kratom for a few weeks and quit. There is mild withdrawals from using Kratom if you try to abuse it, but nothing compared to anything else, especially suboxon. As you know we have a growing problem with opiates in this country.  I feel for the most part, people are afraid to quit because of the terrible phases of withdrawal. Maintaining a sober lifestyle is hard but nothing compared to the fear of quitting and bowels of heroin withdrawal\nMy conclusion is that this drug needs much more scientific attention. The very fact that there have been no fatalities with Kratom (not including people that have combined other drugs with it) is very telling. A growing number of heroin addicts, however, will die.

With so many opioid deaths it is vitally important to find solutions from nature to help provide responsible pain relief that is easily available around the world.\n\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down. Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nThere is no valid reason to prohibit a natural pain reliever in the US while its use is popular in other countries.

Through my experience kratom is also a minor pain releaver that has helped myself and many others in times of need. The greatest benefit of kratom, again for myself and countless others I know, is for the treatment of opiate withdrawals. It works just as well, if not better, than the popular treatment Suboxone. It is, without a doubt, much better than the alternative, methadone. It is as habit forming as drinking coffee everyday, it's of the same species as a matter of fact. Since I have been unable to obtain kratom my unfortunate need for opiates has cost me far too much. My quality of life has severely declined. The government is here to protect it's citizens and generally help them out. I feel this is a move to benefit larger corporations.

As you may be aware by now the kratom community strongly objects to the DEA's scheduling of kratom as a drug. I, personally believe I have the right to kratom. And I believe that the manner in which the DEA has presented the proposed ban & scheduling of kratom to be unlawful and should therefore be completely & immediately dissolved. \n\tMy name is Melissa McCormick, I am a 32 year-old female from NC. I am a responsible Kratom consumer who takes kratom to improve my health and well-being. As an American citizen I believe that I have the right to have kratom & I am urging you not to schedule kratom as a drug. Kratom is not a drug; it is an Herb, a plant, not a synthetic drug, and this plant is most closely related to the coffee-family. \n\tNorth Carolina made kratom legal as of 2016 (via State Bill 830). Many other states have recently passed similar legislation. We see this plant as a beneficial supplement. To compare a coffee plant relative to the likes of morphine, LSD, Methamphetamine's & Oxycontin is a travesty. For such a beneficial, yet harmless, plant this action of scheduling seems extreme and unjustified.\n\tFor the millions of Americans, like myself, who do not have health insurance, but are exempt from carrying it because of financial hardships, we value botanicals & herbs!  If the DEA/FDA makes this herb unavailable to citizens like myself, then we will lose our God-given right to take a plant that helps improve our health & well-being. \n\tI am not a scientist or a doctor, nor do I claim that kratom cures, treats or prevents any disease; all I know is how kratom has transformed my individual health & well-being. I am now an active, productive member of society and I wouldn't be if I had never heard of kratom.  \n\tMy story goes like this: I was involved in a terrible car accident a few years ago. My normal life was halted all because a negligent person, using a cell phone, rear-ended my vehicle @ 55mph while I sat at a stop waiting to make a turn. The impact caused me to suffer severe head/mouth trauma. From that day on I had daily cluster migraines. The doctor had no real answers. My doctor just wanted to prescribe me powerful 'Oxycontin' pain killers. You see, I am a candidate for addiction because it runs in my family. My Father and Grandfather both battled this disease when I was a youth. My Father's long battle with addiction ended in suicide in September 2000. My doctor knew this because he was also my Father's doctor for many years and this information was also in my medical file. \n\tEven so, my doctor just offered me an RX of 'Oxycontin' and went on with his day, leaving me in disarray. I knew I didn't need to let this doctor 'experiment' with my future. He had no answers, scheduled no further tests, only offered me heavy opiates and sent me away. So I refused the Oxycontin & I went home in agony & I suffered every day; in a dark room, in bed, because I couldn't stand light or sound. \n\tFor nearly a year, I suffered in silence. Unable to work, drive or even shower on my own- I couldn't live a normal life because I couldn't function. The accident happened in my mid-twenties, when I should have been focusing on my career or starting a family. Instead I was forced into solitude, scared, and in nearly constant agony. Then I heard about kratom.\n\tI learned of kratom through a small, knowledgeable online community for people with cluster migraines. I am so blessed to have found this herb/plant. After taking kratom my health & well-being improved greatly. I distinctly remember the moment when I realized that I hadn't experienced a cluster migraine in nearly 24 hours and it was a life changing moment. \n\tSince then I can function, work, play and even consider having children. I can now do what most people take for granted. I have a normal life- and there is no greater treasure. \n\tWhat does the DEA/FDA want people like me to do if they label the kratom plant as a 'drug' that must be prescribed? I will lose access to a plant/herb that has drastically improved my health & well-being for the better.  You cannot prescribe an herb to someone who cannot afford to pay for the doctor's visit in order to get the prescription! Making kratom a Schedule 1 drug will change millions of American lives for the worst- and I am included in that list.\nAt this point in time the Kratom community stands united in the fact that we strongly object to the DEA's proposed scheduling of Kratom and we will not be satisfied until the scheduling of kratom is null and void. \nPlease intensely consider all of the information and relevant comments presented to you by the public, scientists, medical professionals and other stakeholders who submit their data and other relevant information on kratom. Thank you,  Melissa McCormick\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0442","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Melissa McCormick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"i have been a heroin user for about 20 years i have used kratom to help with the withdrawals and it works .our other choices are methadone and suboxone witch are even more additive then heroin .being the addict that i am i trued kratom when i was clean thinking it was going to get me high i was disappointed because it did not.but it did help  with withdrawal by some miracle .it is so much safer then methadone because there is no sedation .suboxone though there is no sedation it is highly additive as id methadone. if i had to compare kratom to anything it would be  coffee .it just does not get you stoned .i wish it did but i think it has much more to offer then just helping with withdrawal..it just does not fit  in with drugs it is not mind altering believe me i had high hopes  that it would .thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts on this Erin Lee Mc Grewi","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13063","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"erin mc grew","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please drop Kratom from your Schedule I consideration.

I am able to live a very active life, my weight is healthy for my size. Small doses of Kratom relieve pain in a very non invasive way that also last much longer than rx painkillers. I would say Kratom is as beneficial as cayenne pepper and turmeric. \n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nDB","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7940","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not Place Kratom as a Schedule 1 Drug.

Motorcycle crash or something else serious where the motrin 800 doesnt work and even then i say dont take them.  I, not knowing what they actually were, became accidentally addicted to legal herion, or oxy 30s, for about 4 years, not knowing what i would go thru when i started feeling \"good\" taking them.  I would take 5 to 10 a day and when i didnt have them I went thtu the worst \"flu\" like symptoms called withdrawals that i couldnt take it  of a drug test but because i couldmt function or feel \"normal\" without them.  I finally went to a 90 day inpatient rehab and was perscribed suboxone as maintenance to not only not have withdrawals but to not be able to take opiates and get the same results.  Problem was i was switching from a feel good drug, to crutch drug that i still needed every day or would be sick and the cycle started over again for another 5 years although i havent touched a pill since june 6th 2011.  Then someone told me about this Southestrrn asian plant that you injest and takes away not only any pain but after about 3 weeeks of taking it and not having to take subs i am now clean for 16 days of any of it.  Kratom is a god send and will get more people off opiates so why youre trying to ban it only takes away those like me who can grt off this stuff and live a meaningful life.  I could name 10 other friends i know who have also used kratom to get off opiates or subs and without it wiuld have been sick for 2 weeks and wouldnt be able to work.  I missed zero days at work using kratom and this could help the epidemic we are facing right now.  I ask that you dont ban this substance so others like myself can get off the devil of opiate addiction as it would take a kilo of the stuff to over dose on snd thats a hell of a lot more than a needle full which you cant use to injest kratom anyway.

I personally have found it extraordinarily effective for alleviating the symptoms of both my IBS and anxiety disorder.\n\nWe are in the middle of an opiate epidemic that claims thousands of lives every year, so this is the worst time to make a misguided ban on a safe herbal remedy with pain relief and addiction cessation properties, and with very little potential for abuse. This is not to say that kratom is a cure for any conditions, but it has consistently been proven safer and less addictive than the pharmaceutical and opiates that are ravaging the country.

Morphine and related painkillers are pharmacologically more dangerous and possesses dangerous qualities such as depressed breathing and being generally \"doped out\" with the potential for death. In order to overdose on kratom one would need to make it taste good, because in reality it tastes God-awful and you'd have trouble getting enough down to OD without vomiting. There are those rare people with the stomachs of billy goats that can down whole ounces at once, but they'd have to be a complete fool to consume that much. If consumed in reasonable doses it's perfectly safe, and has no effect on breathing. The reality is that the number of people helped from this herb outweighs the number of people that supposedly died because of it. If you take too much of anything or combine it with the wrong thing you can die, even aspirin and coffee. Moderation and sufficient warnings would be better than an all-out ban, we should be studying this herb instead of demonizing it because of a few people who had no idea what they were doing. It really is the closest thing to a miracle drug when NSAIDs just don't cut it and you don't want to take something chemically similar to heroin. As long as sufficient warnings are in place it's basically as safe or safer than coffee.

There is no progress without risk, and with a drug that is not new, the risk is reduced significantly. thank you.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18496","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Leonard Frieling","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I learned about Kratum from a man named Chris Bell.

I am very scared it may be banned. My story is that I have suffered from crippling depression, anxiety, PTSD and more recently chronic pain. All the fingers in my left hand were cut to the bone and sewed back on I now have severe nerve pain. and  i shattrerred my collarbone in a bicycle accident, now i have a steel rod and 9 screws there instead. Despite all this i have worked since i was 15. RIght now I am doing roofing, and itss tough. I started using druggss and alcohol when I  was in highj school. I beccame an addict from the beginning. I also have been on nearly every anti-depressant for the past 10 yearss. I abused mainly opiates- oxycontin, percocet, and eventually heroin. Then I got on suboxone to stop opiates.  I was on it  for 9 years. I got off last January, its been 11 months off suboxone, and alcohol and all illegal drugs. Its been very very paainfull and difficult, but i would do anythhing to be off hard drrugs and alcohol because it only maakess my life 10 times worse. I discovered Kratom when i was 2 months into serious withdrawls from the suboxone. I couldnt believe this plant, it helped EVERYTHING. My pain, depression, anxietyy, and cravings for alcohol and drugs. I even quit smokingg ccigarrettes. The best part of  Kratom is that its safe and legal! It does not make me feel high and i can stop taking it, and not have to constantly re-dose, liker with pills and alcohol. Its not the sole reason for my success- I have put alot of effort into sobriety and my self/, including excercise and therapy. But kratom gives me the much neeeded motivation to keep going throuigh the hard times. Pleaase do not ban it. I dont know anyone who gets high on kratom, i dont know anyone who has any problems ffrom kratom. I have buried many friends to opiate abuse, however.Thank you for your tme.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4224","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Bevilacqua","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi \nI don't think Kratom should be a schedule 1 drug.

Many more have successfully used it as a tool for quitting serious addictions to powerful drugs like heroin. The addictive potential of kratom is much lower than the addictive substances that have been scheduled in the past and is a lot lower than a lot of medications prescribed by doctors as well. The medical benefits of kratom far outweigh any potential for abuse or addiction - in fact, this plant is long overdue for serious medical research. Scheduling kratom would make it next to impossible for any research to be done. All of the Americans that safely use this plant to manage their pain will have to start getting prescriptions for narcotics that they may very well develop serious addictions to. As for everyone that takes kratom every day instead of their former illegal drug addictions, without access to any more kratom they will likely relapse and fall back into a non-productive drug-addicted lifestyle. These users of kratom lead normal lives, because it doesn't inhibit their ability to work or be productive in other ways like drugs like heroin do. Banning kratom could be likened to suddenly deciding to close down methadone clinics. What would all those people do? The answer is very simple - they would find some heroin and start using again. I'm asking that you consider the damage that a decision like this could cause. We already have an opiate epidemic in this country. Kratom has been a godsend for many Americans. My story is not as powerful as many's may be, but I feel the need to stand up for what is right here, mostly so people that have serious conditions that kratom provides a solution to don't have a safe and powerful tool in their lives taken from them. My life wouldn't be turned completely upside down if kratom disappeared, but there are many people out there where that's not at all the case. I suffer from anxiety and occassional depression, and my energy levels are frequently very low because of this. I'm prescribed xanax and take it a few times a week (Xanax can not be taken regularly or tolerance and withdrawal issues will develop) at most as needed. I have been prescribed all the SSRI's for depression and anxiety in the past, and none of them do anything for me. Having kratom as another tool on my belt has made a major impact in my life. My energy levels are much higher, and I have enough motivation and positive energy to pursue the things in life that I care the most about. I would be very upset to be told that I can no longer have this wonderful plant in my life because the government is too worried about people trying to get high off of it that they issued a ban. If the point of banning drugs is because drug addicts aren't hard-working functional members of society or that they are a danger to others, I urge you to further research the effects of this plant on the mental capacity and productivity of its users before jumping to the conclusion that it causes problems in society. Most advocates of kratom, including myself, use this plant to help increase their productivity, not to try and get high and sit around and watch TV or waste time in another way. I urge you to instead encourage the research of this plant and listen to others' stories of how it has helped them overcome obstacles in their lives. I am confident that after further research, you will realize that this plant is nothing to be scared of, rather something that should be embraced and further explored.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18659","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason Kraemer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Cassandra Leach\n\nI am a mother, wife and politically engaged citizen.

The best thing I have seen with Kratom is that there are no dangerous side effects and no respiratory depression as seen in opioid pain medicines. The only side effects I have seen are mild gastro-intestinal upset or nausea. In my experience Kratom can be habit forming and you can build up a small tolerance to it, such as the way coffee affects the body, but there is no withdrawl or risk if you suddenly discontinue it.

I have personally witnessed friends in a socioeconomically disadvantaged area of California find Kratom to be an expansive plant that enables them to go about their day, working and being functional in society rather than the hole they are placed in when abusing opiates. The side effects of Kratom are minimal and the withdrawals are almost nil in comparison to the pharmaceuticals and opiates they are replacing, and utilizing this as medicine in our society is a great benefit. Adding to the criminalization list when there are already so many drugs criminalized that are affecting society in more ways as illegal drugs - through the imprisonment of our youth, the discrimination against minority youth - than as helpful medicines that will increase function and participation in society. I'm saddened to see something that has been a herb, grown for millennia, viewed as problematic simply because it alters mind and body states, when in reality, doesn't everything - doesn't food, doesn't drink, doesn't pharma drugs do the same? Why are we vilifying plant medicines when they are our link to the earth, the closest thing we will get to bringing true healing to the disadvantaged communities and disenfranchised youth today, and a way of doing this without concerns of toxicity and overdose, of painful withdrawals and the crisis of addiction. It would be a crime to remove this from our people just as it is reaching popular use, for it is part of the medicine for our time to help us remove our country from the plague of opiate overdose epidemics.

I am a 25 year old bartender, who actually suffers from often debilitating social anxiety and depression issues. With a large portion of my job being to socialize with bar patrons and keeping a chipper attitude while doing so, I believe you understand that sometimes my profession can be quite difficult for me. That being said, Kratom is of major help on my more anxious days. In spite of this, it would be extremely displeasing for me and many others to witness such a miracle drug being put on the same list as the most dangerous narcotics known to us.\n            I first started using Kratom a little over a year ago in desperation of finding something that would curb my anxiety and depression but without being prescribed a narcotic. Well, when I discovered Kratom, I hit the jackpot. I have tried some of the most popular benzodiazepines and SSRI's in the past with some bettering my depression but doing little for my anxiety, or completely taking away my anxiety but making me more depressed in turn. Kratom successfully removes my anxiety and supplies me with a feeling of well being rather than the dark and gloomy places my mind would normally go in times of stress. To lose Kratom at this point in my life would feel hopeless. As an herb that does what no other medication I have found can do, with almost zero side effects and addiction potential, I think it would be downright irresponsible and simply wrong to take Kratom from those of us who have been so positively effected by it.\n            In conclusion, I very much hope that more research is done and more voices are heard before scheduling something so beneficial too dramatically. It is a saddening thought to know that so many people that could do without the hardcore, extremely addictive medicine and ingest this herbal supplement instead, would never know its benefits. Myself and many others are better off with Kratom in their lives and taking that away would be a large step in the wrong direction for our country and our lives as a whole.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13154","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Layton Hardin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This compound helps a lot of people.

My personal opinion of the DEA, as a legitimate organization may be forever changed by this ridiculous decision. When the ban was first announced I gave the DEA the benefit of the doubt that there could be some way of using kratom that might make it dangerous, but since i had never experienced any negative effects myself I decided to research the issue in depth. After researching each case the DEA has cited as deaths resulting from kratom use it became very clear that in almost every last case the toxicology reports showed varying amounts of other dangerous drugs or alcohol and in most cases those other substances were labeled the likely cause of death by medical examiners. It also became quickly apparent that the increase in calls to poison control cited by the DEA as another reason for the ban seemed significant that is, until I put it into context. The number of poison control calls related to kratom when compared to other fairly benign and legal substances like caffeine and over the counter medications is minuscule. I personally have used kratom for 5 years as a herbal supplement and I find the idea that it's intoxicating ridiculous. It is no more intoxicating then a cup of coffee and I find the encroachment of the DEA on our personal liberties to be childishly authoritarian. I truly hope there are still some decent people in the DEA who see this for the paranoid and ridiculous idea that it is. It's incredible that in the land of the free, we the people have to speak up and fight against a government organization to keep the right to personally use a plant that grows naturally on the earth. I must ask those in the DEA to reconsider and please by all means research in depth any evidence that kratom is a danger to the public because I have and the conclusion I reach is that at best the DEA is mistaken about the danger and at worst they are lying and they know it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0534","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Fred Fox","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Good day, \n\nKratom is an amazing plant that does not deserve to be criminalized.

I also have personal experience with hydrocodone as I was prescribed it following a surgery for a fractured tibia and fibula.  The side effects I experienced included nausea, vomiting, dizziness, euphoria, impaired cognition, constipation, and sweating to list a few.  \n\nHaving personally tried kratom tea from a local kava bar this past February at the age of 21, I can say that I did not experience any of said side effects, and while I was expecting some recreational effects, I was highly disappointed.  I personally did not notice any significant effects except perhaps some mild stimulation and a slight mood boost, similar to that of coffee (those effects may have even been placebo).  I could not believe that the same herb that was infused in my tea that night has been compared to the prescription opioids that have destroyed so many lives.  I also know a number of people who take kratom regularly and I have not seen any evidence that it is negatively impacting their lives the way potent opioid medications have affected many others.\n\nAlthough I did not personally experience any side effects from kratom, many have reported some side effects.  But there are many natural supplements that are effectively regulated and sold in large retail stores that also have the potential to produce side effects and even adverse effects, many of which may be dangerous under certain circumstances.  However the harm caused by these supllements is kept to a minimum through proper regulation, labeling, education, and the advice of medical professionals.  I believe kratom can effectively be regulated in the same way, especially given that there has been only one death from kratom in which other substances did not seem to be involved, and the number of poison control calls is extremely low on a relative scale.  Many other regulated products such as energy drinks have caused more harm to society than kratom[1], yet they remain legal and are instead regulated and must be properly labelled as a harm-reduction measure.  I have not seen remotely sufficient evidence reported by the DEA that suggests kratom should be treated any differently.\n\nAside from my personal experience, I have great concerns that the repercussions of an emergency ban will be detrimental to our society as a whole.  As it has widely been reported, scientists researching the herb to potentially discover safer and less addictive opioid pain medication alternatives will have to halt their work at a time when we need it most.  Many people may also continue to use and distribute the herb, as I believe that the majority of the informed public is against a ban and will not comply with its enforcement because they see it as unjust.  Therefore a ban may increase our rapidly growing prison population.  It may also create a black market in which adulterated and unsafe products could proliferate, and far more dangerous and addictive illegal drugs could even be sold as kratom to those that might not otherwise use illegal drugs but are familiar with kratom.\n\nAs members of congress stated in the Pocan-Salmon letter, the right to emergency ban a substance was granted in order to prevent immediate harm from dangerous synthetic substances, many of which have no existing scientific data or history of human use, and are potent enough to kill multiple people in sub-milligram dosages.  I respect and fully support the DEA's efforts in controlling such synthetic substances.  But the leaves of the kratom tree are completely different.  There is a long history of traditional use in Oceanic countries such as Indonesia, and there are growing bodies of peer-reviewed research on kratom.[2]\n\nI believe that public and congressional sentiment, as well as the opinion scientific community, indicates that kratom does not pose an imminent hazard to public health, and therefore an emergency ban is inappropriate and is also a gross abuse of power.  While I understand and respect that the DEA acts in the best interest of public health,  I do not support its intent to place an emergency ban on kratom, and I believe that such an action will do far more harm than good.  Please reconsider your intent to place an emergency ban on this herb.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. https://cspinet.org/news/documents-link-more-deaths-energy-drinks-20140625\n\n2. https://www.botanical-education.org/research/","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9240","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alexander Moore","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have chronic pain, and have tried numerous medications, including opiates.

I am 26 years old and live in Massachusetts. To give a little bit of background information about me, growing up I was very shy and had a lot of social anxiety. I was only my true self around my close friends but as I got older and was introduced to alcohol, thats when I REALLY came out of my shell. It made me feel like I could talk to strangers without feeling nervous/anxious and I felt like I could conquer the world. Over 3 or 4 years, my drinking got worse and I had some very bad consequences that came with the drinking. I lost friends, family, and got in trouble with the law. Long story short, I came around and decided to go to a rehab located in South Florida. When I was living there, that is when I discovered kratom. Even after I got sober, I always felt like there was still something missing to make me less anxious and more motivated so finding kratom was like the \"missing puzzle piece\" for me. It instantly made me feel calm, but not sedated in anyway, and more social. I loved it! I get things done that I would normally be too tired for or just not motivated at all. I can focus when I take kratom and I see absolutley nothing wrong with this plant. I am now a mother to a two year old, a pre-k teacher, and fiance. My life has changed drastically since i've been taking kratom and I feel like its for the better. For such a long time I was so depressed and felt like I had no worth in this world, but now I feel like a brand new person. If kratom were banned tomorrow, I absolutely would not be able to go to work because of my anxiety and I would DEFINITELY not have much motivation to do anything. I might even go as far to say as I don't think I would be able to take care of my son the way I do now. And who knows I might even go back to drinking which would absolutely be the worst thing that could happen now that my life is completely back on track. The only \"side effect\" i have felt from kratom is I have vomited from accidentally doing more than usual. I have had stomach aches too but that is it. I do not feel that I am addicted to kratom because I don't feel like this is something you consider being \"addicted\" to.

Kratom has helped thousands of people and has the potential to help so many more. Let's stop waisting anymore time and act! Do the reserch, find the benefits and save people's lives. Healthier, well educated and optimistic people will strengthen our country. Then and only then can we move on to bigger and better things.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11859","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sebastian Gerard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I urge that all holistic and natural remedies be given equal status as compared to pharmaceutical's and be allowed to be purchased by any patient \nin need of such remedies..\nThanks You..\nPaul Laycock\nN 3789 Flak Rd. \nElton,WI  54430 ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22878","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paul Laycock","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"With all the possible benefits that can be brought with kratom, there is no reason that this should not be researched further and not thrown into a list due to fear.

While I have no direct personal experience with this plant, I am intimately familiar with people who have had very positive outcomes from their experiences with Kratom. I have sponsored numerous people in 12 step groups over the years, and have seen a significant spike in opioids addiction in the past few years specifically. I have also seen doctors treating oxycodone and OxyContin addictions with soboxone, which they erroneously believe to be non-habit forming. The general ignorance of the medical community regarding addiction notwithstanding, I can definitely speak to the ineffectiveness of the measures used to counter this significant health problem. I personally know of four people who have used Kratom to break free of debilitating prescription drug dependencies which began under legitimate and legal medical treatment, and blossomed into addiction. Kratom is one of those rare discoveries which actually works, has nominal or inconsequential side-effects, and significantly reduces the very considerable difficulty of breaking free of opioids addiction.  It would be, in my estimation, as someone who understands with heartbreaking clarity the real costs of addiction, a travesty to see this useful and harmless tool banished, especially while the prevalence of oxycodone and OxyContin virtually guarantee that more and more addicts will be created every day. From my research, there is no credible scientific evidence of even one Kratom related death, while a person dies every 19 minutes of an opioid overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10927","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Mullin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would firstly like to thank the DEA for providing the opportunity for the American people to present our case in this debacle, and hear the personal comments and experiences of both supporters and opposers of this ban alike, in order to obtain the facts and opinions to make a well founded and educated decision on the matter. \nAt the age of 21 I was diagnosed with cancer and underwent chemotherapy. The treatments were successful and my cancer went into remission. It wasn't until some months later that I began a downward spiral into alcoholism and substance abuse due to some form of PTSD. That was five years ago and it's been an emotional roller coaster ride ever since. My alcoholism has progressed to practically debilitating and I've ruined numerous relationships and jobs because of it. I've come very close to destroying my life time and time again. I suffer from crippling anxiety and depression and in order to feel even the slightest bit of joy and normality, I self medicate in the worst way. Anti depressants are no use as they just leave me in a fog and feeling zombie-like. I've tried many ways to address and remedy my addiction but to no avail. \nIt wasn't until a couple of years ago when I discovered the substance in question that I truly began to understand and accept that I had a serious chemical imbalance. Just a small amount of kratom twice a day, several days a week and my world completely changed but it wasn't due to any kind of \"high\". I just seemed to have energy, focus, and motivation. My hopelessness had completely disappeared and was instead replaced with a newfound positive outlook on life. My work production and social life seemed to transform almost over night. I continued to incorporate kratom into my daily diet for 6 months with great success and no noticeable addiction or negative effects. When I ran out I didn't bother purchasing any more and didn't feel the need to. I had turned things around and everything was looking up for me. For the following 9 months I lived life without anxiety or depression and I had no desire to self medicate. Up until a few months ago that is. Things have been going downhill at a very rapid rate. I've started drinking again and am hopelessly  watching my life slowly fall apart again. I finally reached my breaking point yesterday and have decided that I need to make some serious changes if I want any kind of shot at a productive and healthy life. Kratom has worked wonders for me before and I plan on once again incorporating it into my life, in an attempt to detox from alcohol and find my drive again. Reclaim my passion sort of speak. In closing, I would only implore you to take into consideration the countless addicts and chronic pain sufferers that this plant has helped. For some it's nothing more than something that should be banned due to fear and concern caused by products like \"bath salts\" and \"synthetic Marijuana\" but to many others it's  quite simply a much needed miracle. So please take the time to review all of the possible facts and information before reaching a decision that could affect the quality of life for many people. Thank you.

I was, at one point, bound to prescribed pain medications for a period of approximately 4 months due to a lower back injury.  Not knowing what addiction or dependence was, I took them steadily those 4 months while my back \"healed,\" and, for the first 3 months, functioned quite well.  The 4th month I felt my strain had improved but found myself challenged to stop the medication.  I felt sick- depressed- miserable.  Not knowing why, I went to my physician, who then prescribed me 12mg of Suboxone.  Let's just say, mg for mg, the dosage was entirely too high and it became an even worse problem than ever before, taking a solid 3 years and 8 attempts to finally quit.  Since then, I've never touched a pain medication and, honestly, don't  like taking any medication.  \nNot long ago it was recommended I try Kratom for my frequent migraines, as well as some other ailments I had.  \"It's not a pain killer like you'd expect- you won't get high, you won't be euphoric, and you may still have some pain, but it's certainly a valuable tool for your arsenal,\" I was told.  Since then, I've taken Kratom here and there for headaches/migraines, back aches, and various other ailments.  I've used it for long periods of time and short periods of time, each phase stopping for breaks and never feeling miserable.  I've cut back on coffee from it!  I am a happier person because of it.  I've never felt like I was going to overdose (though once, when changing my vendor source, I did take more than usual and ending up puking twice before I felt normal, thus teaching me the valuable lesson \"less is more.\"  I've also helped others discover the benefits of Kratom and have observed them go from pharmaceutical relief to natural relief.  WHat a difference it has made for them and myself.\nI am all for regulating certain things, but to treat kratom like a vilified plant, making it a Schedule I and illegal to own or possess or consume, is not only a foolish mistake, but a violation of our rights as US citizens.  Alcohol kills more people, directly and indirectly, than kratom ever has or ever will, meanwhile has no true benefits that can be touted, whereas kratom has a wide array of benefits.  I see no reason to outlaw kratom and make it yet another street drug- which is exactly what will happen- for the police to deal with and to load up our prisons.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13671","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Richmond","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped my depression when pharmaceutical drugs let me down for 16 years I actually lead a normal life now without side effects I have never been harmed by taking Kratom and millions feel just the same way","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2171","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shannon Roden","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Kyle Spence, I freelance work for various large websites for a living. I am a 24 year old male living in Kansas City, MO.  I am opposed to the scheduling of Kratom as I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and this plant has allowed me to enter back into society when I was the most sick I have ever been. I began taking kratom when I was 17, as I was seeking out alternatives to the medications that were giving me severe side effects. I had dropped down to 120lbs  and was taking 3 medications. One of the medications that was given to me could only be taken if I signed a sheet giving up my right to sue if the severe side effects (ulcerative colitis being one) presented. It was a hormone that was supposed to help me but, just like most of the medications, it did practically nothing for me. \n\nI don't want to begin to describe the things the Crohn's disease was doing to my body, but it was painful. Other than losing all of my weight, I was having to use the bathroom almost 10 times a day ,I was nauseous much of the time, and never had the energy to do anything. When I would have a flare-up, I would be in so much pain internally. The idea of getting a job was impossible to imagine because I would have had to take too many bathroom breaks for me to work. \n\nI heard about Kratom and bought some online, and I began taking half a gram every day. On the first day I stopped having to use the bathroom so often. I never experienced constipation, only a slowing down of my digestive system, I began to gain weight. I was able to go to school and get a job. I stopped having constant, chronic pain. To this day I have only increased my dose to 1 gram twice a day, and I am so thankful to have had this medicinal plant in my life. If  it gets banned I will not have any clue what to do with myself. I do not have the ability to pay for a doctor, and at this point I have no need. My symptoms are down to the point where it feels like I have been cured. I have taken breaks to see if I experience any withdrawal symptoms, but it appears my dosage is too low to cause any. The only thing that happens is a return of my Crohn's disease symptoms. Please do not ban this plant. I have never used an illegal drug in my life. Please do not allow this plant to be taken from me, and please do not make me a felon for taking control of my health.

I have battled anxiety and depression from my early teens and was very reluctant to go on medication to treat it.  During my mid 20's I tried two different antidepressants and had a bad experience with both.  The main negative with these medications for me was that they altered my personality, basically turning me into someone with no emotions.  I just wanted to feel better, not cease feeling all together.  It took several years for me to try another antidepressant and this time I found one that helped me. It didn't completely remove the problem but it helped. I do not want to try anything else or increase the dose and see what happens because I am concerned of the potential negative effects. Instead I look for natural mood boosters to take alongside my medication. I drink kratom tea and it gives me a little energy and uplifts my mood without making me feel medicated.  Just because kratom interacts with the opioid receptors does not make it an opioid. There are several foods that interact with the opioid receptors in our brain causing cravings and mood altering effects. For example gliadin in wheat, casomorphin in cow's milk, hemorphin in meat. Kratom does not cause respiratory depression or any of the other dangerous side effects of opioids. The only negative side effects I've ever experienced with kratom is nausea if I take too much similar to the feeling of taking too much caffeine and feeling nausea.  Kratom is actually related to the coffee plant and shares other similarities with it.  Like I said when I drink kratom tea I feel a little energized, a small mood boost and a little more focused. Kratom does not make you high. I have take prescription pain medications after a surgery and kratom is nothing like it.  It might help with pain but when I take kratom I can fully function, I do not feel out of it or groggy. Kratom is not dangerous to the person taking it and  the people taking it are not a danger to others. Kratom has only helped me and I ask that you do not schedule it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20426","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"PLEASE TAKE INTO CONSIDER AND REPSPECT THE LIVES OF THE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE ALIVE AND SOBER TODAY BECAUSE OF KRATOM","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8605","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laura Maher","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Time to get over that reefer-madness mindset and take a more considered, realistic view towards regulation, not criminalization.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15920","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mitchell Diamond","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 54 year old male.

I talked it over with my wife and she gave me the go ahead.\n\nSince day one of ingesting kratom I got immediate pain relief. What can I say other then I was totally amazed. I have literally taken nothing other then kratom for the pain and it has worked wonderfully. Fast forward to today and I'm nearly recovered from my injury. I'm back to running. I'm at 15 miles a week. Before the injury I was running 25 plus miles a week. I have a ways to go.

Kratom does not get you high, it just makes you feel better and more functional (Kratom has a proven record of getting people off hard drugs and many  other life destroying substance abuse addictions .  \n \n Kratom is a legal health supplement in Canada and will give/create KRATOM drug cartels  via the large Canada / USA border.  Banning Kratom will be a disaster for millions of chronic pain sufferers who have found relief from Kratom as well as, a disaster for the US taxpayer having to imprison non violent felons for victimless crimes.\n   I would personally like to see Kratom KEPT VERY LEGAL but regulated as a natural health product. Currently Kratom has to be sold as \"Not for human consumption\"  \n  DEA has failed the drug war and is offering a cyanide capsule to the people as a solution by banning KRATOM (Millions will suffer)\n  There is no public health threat with KRATOM.  But there is a lobbyist/Bribed government official CRISIS in America that appears to control our no longer trusted institutions. I am very angry at the FDA approving harmful addictive drugs that I have witnessed ruin the lives of many people I know over the years and then trying to BAN KRATOM that saves people from these harmful substances.\n  Also, During September of 2016 My vendor stopped selling KRATOM due to the DEA's announcement of the intent to BAN KRATOM ,I was out of KRATOM for 3 weeks , I was amazed that I suffered no withdraw symptoms at all, I just felt like I didnt have my coffee and my everyday aches and pains returned, but it was nothing debilitating like when I quit using RX opiates. All you have to do is click online and search #IamKratom and you will understand the kind of people KRATOM has helped. \n  I already see the FDA and DEA as failed corrupt government institutions that runs off of bribes and will gladly hand the incoming Trump administration the blame for BANNING KRATOM and am having to decide if I went to go to alcohol (I dont drink) or opiates after KRATOM is banned.. The thought of this terrifies me. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23098","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Engineer","postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Zee","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Attn:  DEA Federal Register Representative/ODW\n\nDocket No. DEA-442W\n\nI would like to express my views on the proposed intention to assign Kratom as a Schedule 1 Controlled Substance.  I am not a Kratom user, having only tried it one time in the past at the urging of a friend who uses it for pain relief.  I would try it again, but I am awaiting the outcome of this legal limbo.  This friend suffers from a form of arthritis and has been using Kratom daily for some time with good results.  He is very concerned that his main means of pain relief could be made illegal and force him to go with a far more dangerous and habit forming opioid drug or a less effective NSAID with other dangerous side effects.  He says he has seen no bad side effects from Kratom and I saw no problem on the day I tried it.  I too suffer from osteoarthritis and would like to find a better pain reliever without the gastro-intestinal side effects of my daily NSAID's.\n  \nI read that many thousands of people take Kratom for pain relief daily without incident and it is only a problem if too much is taken at a time.  Almost all OTC and prescription drugs and even many foods are bad and cause problems if taken in excess, but that is NO reason to make them illegal.  It is time the public be allowed to get back to natural substances to alleviate pain and illness whenever possible.\n  \nI further understand that Kratom is of great benefit not only in replacing opioids for pain relief, but also as a means of treating opioid addiction and withdrawal.  With the very serious opioid use and abuse problem in this country, shouldn't we be using every means possible to help people battle addiction and keep them off narcotic pain relievers?\n\nThe pharmaceutical companies have been pushing various opioids and dangerous pain relievers for many years now, at the very least, Kratom and other natural pain relievers need to be allowed to be studied and used.  It seems that Kratom may have many benefits and not so many risks.\n\nA concerned citizen,\nGerald Getz  \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5429","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gerald Getz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been a responsible user of Kratom for the last five years. I primarily use it because it helps me to maintain my abstinence from opioids. I began to have issues with pharmaceutical opiates when I was a teenager and was overprescribed Vicodin for two minor surgeries. I am now 26 years old, and it has consistently been an issue for me for the last 10 years of my life. \n\nI know people who use Suboxone and Methadone for maintenance, and have considered this route, but these drugs have withdrawal symptoms that are almost as severe as heroin and oxycodone's. Kratom gives me essentially the same benefits as these drugs with much gentler side effects, while at the same time being comparatively un-abusable (many people can and do use maintenance opioids to get high.) Kratom is the first thing I've found that allows me to lead a normal, stable life in the wake of my addiction. If anything, we should be studying this plant and exploring ways to use it in a more medically controlled way, not banning it. I want to know more about it. If long term studies show negative effects, I want to know about those to aid in my decision making around it. If it can be used in developing a pill with consistent quality and strength, it may prove to be of great benefit to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who struggle with dependence on painkillers and heroin.\n\nIn short, there are plenty of dangerous drugs on the street, many of them synthesized in labs, completely unregulated, and sold legally. Kratom simply does not fall in that category. I urge you to lift this ban and help raise awareness about the need for further research.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3234","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Maxwell Denny","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 37 year old nurse.  I work for a large provider of mental health services with a state mental health program.  I suffer a chronic inflammatory condition that affects my joints, skin, and muscles and have been prescribed various types of pain management.  One of the hallmark symptoms of my condition is chronic pain.  I've tried several anti-inflammatory medications available by prescription and OTC, which ultimately led to severe stomach ulcerations.  I cannot use anti-inflammatory medications without having nosebleeds and worsening stomach ulcerations.  I used opioid pain medications under the care of a doctor with great success at times.  However, this came with many side effects.  And despite the negative effects, my body (and my mind) required more.  The therapeutic value decreases as the need for more increases.  I was eventually prescribed a very strong medication that caused severe and constant migraines, complete loss of appetite, severe and unrelenting depression. I was ready to end my life.  I finally destroyed the rest of my prescription because I was so sick of the constant migraines and the dysphoria.  I had missed multiple days of work during the course of my treatment related to pain and the depression that follows.  I had used my short term disability already through my employer's short term disability insurance and was planning the application process for Social Security Disability with the help of an attorney.  I spent months reading and digging for answers on suppression of inflammation, pain reduction methods, and alternative treatments.  I read about kratom and decided to give it a shot.  I was happy with the results after a few days of supplementing with kratom.  It didn't kill all of the pain like prescription pain killers did.  But I didn't expect that.  All I wanted was a tolerable level of pain without the brain fog, without the drowsiness and depression.  Kratom gave me just that.  I started eating again, as my GI tract returned to normal motility. Kratom seemed to reduce the symptoms associated with GI inflammation.  I was able to think clearly again.  I was able to have emotions again.  I started lifting weights and walking, then slowly worked my way to jogging.  When I returned to work, my work life was much more stable.  I was finally able to work 1 year with no call ins.  I made some major improvements in my life.  Kratom kept me out of the disability system.  It kept me out of the roulette wheel of pain management meds, addiction, and possibly darker paths.  I use this as a supplement just as I would any of the other herbal supplements I take daily.  \nI lift weights regularly can and I do cardio.  I work a full time job and work overtime.  I have state employment benefits and a state retirement.  I have a savings account that climbs steadily.  I have worked and paid taxes since I was 16 years old.  For 21 years I have been a hard working tax paying citizen.  My life does not fit the profile of an abuser of controlled substances.  I have never been arrested or in any kind of trouble.  It is unreasonable to make kratom a controlled substance!  There are thousands of people just like me who do not want to be on narcotic pain killers.  There are thousands of people who have multiple adverse reactions to anti-inflammatories and simply cannot take them.  It is economically sensible to leave kratom as a legal herbal supplement.  It is medically sensible to leave kratom as a legal herbal supplement.  Please do not take away our option that allows us to work and continue to be part of the economic infrastructure.  Please do not take away our option that allows us to avoid prescription narcotics that you've fought to keep off the streets.  Please do not take away our option and deny us the basic right to comfort.  Please do not make this a substance that people would get arrested for while they are trying to better themselves.

I have used kratom to treat horrible anxiety for years. This is not some drug for partying, it is a legitimate treatment for several minor ailments.

In fact, probably 75% of the people I've met who use it are military veterans.  They use it to treat ptsd.  It works wonderfully on the tension and anxiousness of anxiety. This will be directly, negatively impacting my life. I have no idea what I'm going to do. I'm certainly not going to get hooked on Xanex, or Valium. I have avoided those through kratom.

I graduated high school with honors and a 4.0 as well as being an athlete in which I had scholarships for bsseball in JUCO. Then, I was the type of person that didn't like taking ibp after pitching 7 innings. I was prescribed Lortab due to a double ear infection and I ended up wanting to feel that way every day. I quickly graduated to IVing oxy contin and fentanyl and went through my first program in 2007. From 2007 up until July of 2015 I completed a a total of 6 programs, with the last one being a year long. Even after the year in that program plus 9 months I was unable to stay clean. I was unable to hold a job, keep a relationship, and be a father. Due to my addiction, I no longer have parental rights to my 7 year old son nor am I able to even speak to him. Unfortunately, I suffer from real issues such as chronic pain(due to a fractured back), sever anxiety, ADHD, and depression. I never thought I would ever be able to live a normal productive life until Kratom. Kratom relieves me of all of those i issues. Thanks to Kratom, I have became an HVAC mechanic, I'm getting married to a very successful woman April 1st, and am finally able to be a father to my 20 month old son (a great father at that). Sure I could go get prescribed medications for these issues but they all come with a euphoric feeling that I'm unable to keep myself from chasing. Kratom is by far the safest way for me to deal with my issues and there's no euphoric or high as people have. Even misinformed. I believe that all of this nonsense started due to Vivazen which did cause a \"rush\"  but also had many other things in itt such as California poppy, kava kava, etc. but Kratom in its natural form does NOT. If this ban goes through, those of us that found relief in Kratom will turn back to the drugs that will actually kill us.

After being legally prescribed a muscle relaxer, which didn't work, to chiropractic therapy, which didn't work, to steroid shots, which definitely did not even help, I honestly gave up hope. Then, on Thanksgiving of all days, I discovered the completely scientfically harmless, completely natural and worshipped for centuries plant, currently known by Kratom. Within about a half of an hour, the muscles in my neck and back not only relaxed, they deswelled to normal levels. Not only this, my social anxiety, which has existed my entire life, instantaneously disappeared. I was able to climb flights of stairs, bend over to pick up things, and live my life painlessly for about a day.\n\nTwo days later, and after having only one treatment, I am now having to take a muscle relaxer pill, and the worst thing about it is that it will probably help about one tenth, and harm my body ten times worse, and make someone out there richer off of it. \n\nI'm sick of that. It's time we face the absolute truth about EVERYTHING as a nation. EVERYTHING. Especially this. This will save lives. If we want to be the country we tell others we are, we will look at things like mature adults, instead of gossipy preteens, and face the truth on matters such as this.\n\nThe truth is, Kratom saves lives, and is completely natural.

My name is Chris and I am a college student studying computer science. I am an active individual and exercise 4-5 times a week, but I still spent the majority of my waking hours seated at a desk. I have scoliosis and sitting for extended periods of time often leaves me in significant chronic pain. The pain detracts from my work, collegiate studies, personal endeavors, and my overall quality of life. Therefore, I began looking for solutions and ways to manage my pain. I sought out and still attend corrective physical therapy and tried over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen. But, I still had issues with pain. In mid-August of 2016, I had come across individuals online who advocate kratom after experiencing it help them reduce and manage their pain. Therefore, after researching and learning more about kratom, I decided to try managing my own pain with kratom. Now, about three months later, kratom is an important aid in my life. By supplementing with kratom, I live nearly pain-free and can focus on accomplishing my daily responsibilities and fulfilling my aspirations instead of focusing on ways to alleviate my chronic pain and discomfort. Personally, I believe the legality of kratom should stay where it currently exists, where kratom is sold over-the-counter, just as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and adults (individuals eighteen and over) are allowed the right to make reasonable and ethical executive decisions on how to live their lives and manage the problems that arise in their lives, such as chronic pain. For myself and many others in the kratom community, kratom is an important part of our lives. Within the kratom community, former opiate addicts describe their experiences with kratom and speak on how it reduced their opiate withdrawal symptoms and facilitated their transition from opiate dependence to opiate non-dependence. Additionally, suffers from chronic pain describe the relief they experience with kratom and describe themselves as more functional and effective in their lives, as many are seriously hindered by their pain. But, ultimately, kratom helps Americans live more functional, effective, healthy, and meaningful lives. Consumers of kratom come from many walks of life and serve various different roles in our personal local communities. Kratom serves consumers as individuals and helps them live better lives. But in serving individuals in our communities, personally, I believe, kratom helps our individual communities by helping some of the individuals within them to live better lives. Therefore, in removing kratom from the lives of individuals, we detract from their personal lives and in detracting from their lives, we detract from the potential of our individual communities. Therefore, before we come to a decision on whether or not to render kratom as illegal or not, we must take into consideration the effects it may have on individuals within our communities, our communities as individual units, and our nation as a whole.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17285","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Mr.","postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Rios","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I just want to say a couple things.

Plants are a gift from the Divine for mans unfettered use. \nI am vehemently opposed to any regulation of the plant Kratom by the DEA. And I find the DEAs intent to make Kratom a Schedule I drug insultingly hypocritical and astonishingly corrupt. According to your own parameters as Schedule I drug is defined as: substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\nKratom meets neither of these criteria. It especially does not meet the criteria of, no currently accepted medical use. As I am sure you are aware and if you arent certainly your agency in arms the FDA is aware that:\n \n1.)\tAt least three synthetic opioids have been synthesized from the alkaloids in Kratom: MGM-9, MGM-15, and MGM-16. They were synthesized from kratoms alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine: to make what is essentially patentable, pharmaceutical kratom.\n2.)\tIn February of 2016 the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy status to Olicerdine. Meaning it will receive preferential regulatory treatment. Its active ingriedent: mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, a  semi-syntheric compound derived from leaves of the Southeast Asian Kratom plant.\n\nAs for high potential for abuse. WRONG! (#trumspeak) Its as addictive as coffee. And there are countless cases of it helping people to get off addictions. I do not want to live in a nanny state. There will always be people prone to addictions. Much like there are alcoholics and gambling addicts. Do we ban alcohol? No! What are you planning to ban next?! Plants should not be your jurisdiction.\n\nYou should stick to regulating man- made drugs.  Man-made being key. Coco leaves being- God, (The Universe, Nature,or whatever god-like label youd like to place on it) designed and created would not be under the DEAs jurisdiction. Substances such as cocaine would be considered man made since the active alkaloid is chemically extracted from the whole plant creating a potent, dangerous drug different in constitution than its plant matter forebearer.  Any substance that is synthesized or needs to undergo chemical reactions to arrive at the final product would fall under the DEA/FDAs overview. However a salve, tincture, etc., created from whole plant matter would not be considered man-made. As long as a plant is not artificially concentrated it would remain under personal rights jurisdiction. The same way it is under our prerogative what food we choose to eat and what beverages we choose to consume. Poppy and Opium created by God and thus under our personal jurisdiction. Heroin: man-made so the DEA/FDA should schedule it and similar drugs how they see fit.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10128","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"SN Rankin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used kratom for pain treatment for my three scoliosis surgeries.

The invasive sweat began to pour onto the classroom floor, drop by drop, as I reached into my pocket for a kleenex to wipe my face.. again and again. I continued giving my speech and continued reading my report because failure has never been an option for me. That was me in 7th grade, and I will never forget it. That memory is just one scenario of thousands of others that I have suffered throughout all of my suffering years of anxiety. Even speaking with someone would cause me to experience extreme anxiety and a sweat outbreak. First, I begin to feel a wave of heat throughout all my body, then I start to feel the sweat arrive, all while my internal dialogue is hoping for this process to come to an end, even though I know that once started, it can not stop. This is suffering. If you do not suffer from severe anxiety, you are not able to understand the level of suffering that I would go through. It's psychologically damaging and extremely disheartening. I have been suffering from severe anxiety since a very young age. Kratom has provided total relief for me and has allowed me to function at 100% while removing this crushing handicap of anxiety.\n\nI have been able to overcome obstacles and accomplish great feats as an adult due to kratom, my strong determination and will to succeed. Kratom eliminates my anxiety while increasing my motivation. I have developed my business into a multi-unit retail operation that employs over 80 great people and has revenues over $10 million. I am 36 years old, a husband and father of three, and I've also donated over $100,000 dollars to students for the purpose of higher education. In summary, I am a law-abiding and productive member of society. \n\nKratom has allowed me to interact with my employees, friends, and family without popping a prescribed benzo or a beta-blocker. Yes, I was rightfully prescribed a beta-blocker and then a benzo from my doctor to no avail. The beta-blocker made me terribly depressed and the benzo made me severely lethargic. Before I discovered Kratom, I was determined to find a superior way to manage my crushing anxiety. \n\nAfter fervently searching for a natural herbal salvation online, I came across an herb from Thailand: Mitragyna Speciosa (Kratom). I read all of the tree's great attributes and lack of side effects, so I decided to make an order.  When the Kratom arrived at home, I tried approximately 3 grams and immediately felt a wave of relief that I had never felt before. I felt  productive while feeling total relief from my anxiety.! As a matter of fact, I felt some nice energy and my mind was completely functional. Benzos made my brain groggy and beta blockers made me depressed. I breathed a deep sigh of relief knowing that I had finally found my answer to life.\n\nNow, I have been safely using Kratom for the past 9 years, which coincidentally, have been the most successful and productive years of my life. I was able to get married, have beautiful children, and start a successful business during these past 9 years of my life. Kratom removes my handi-cap and allows me to function as who I really am. \n\nThe thought of my government taking my life away is indescribable! I just can't understand why my government would want to betray me and take kratom away from me. I have had yearly physicals done with my Doctor and all my tests state that I am a very healthy individual.  Kratom has given me my life back! I am living proof that Kratom does not cause death nor nasty side-effects. I do believe, however, that we should implement quality control and regulation just as with coffee or any other natural herb. Regulate it, tax it, and introduce this wonderful herb to mainstream society.  I was also able to quit my 15 year coffee addiction with kratom, which also helped relieve my crushing anxiety. \n\nI thank you for canceling the emergency action and allowing me the opportunity to share my thoughts with the world. I also trust that you will make the right decision on this. Millions of people's lives are at risk and will be immediately destroyed if you ban Kratom. These millions of people who found  no help from benzos will seek out other alternatives for their ailments, and if kratom is not available as an alternative, what will they turn to? Will they seek out dangerous drugs on the black market? What unintended consequences will the kratom ban have on society in general? Honestly, I can't find any legitimate reason to ban kratom. It makes no sense. Please understand that all of those side-effects posted in the DEA's description are plainly false. I am living proof of it.\n\nPlease Keep Kratom Legal. Thank You.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA Law-Abiding & Productive Citizen of the United States of America","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18460","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm 25 and I work in restaurant management.

Additionally I had constant underlying pain that kept me from functioning completely or reaching my potential. Nothing over the counter helped the pain and the doctors I saw were unable to give me relief. \nI decided to order some kratom, which a college friend of mine had used regularly, and which I knew could support me in managing my pain. Since then I have excelled in my job and have been able to live a life without the shadow of pain over it. I still have some pain, but with kratom I am able to function and it helps me to manage it. It's made a big difference in my life and I am very scared that I might lose it. I am a law-abiding, contributing member of society and I could be given the choice between living with constant unbearable pain, becoming a criminal, or using dangerous and addictive drugs to manage my pain.    \nThere have been no fatalities conclusively linked to kratom that did not involve other drugs.

As a sister of two members in my family, I have seen what kratom does. I know for a fact, the claims that kratom can cause hallucinations and is addictive is simply not true. I have watched my family members both suffer from chronic pain and they have both been prescribed very strong opiates. They both have suffered the side effects of those opiates as well. \nOne of those sisters suffers with fibromyalgia, a known condition many pain doctors have stated is very hard to treat. For nearly 30 years she has been on every prescription available and off label to try and get relief. Nothing has worked well for her. She is one who researches everything she can about her condition, the prescriptions and any natural supplements she takes.  She found kratom a couple of years back and said she finally gets a break from the most of the miserable pain.   This woman is not one to take medications unless they are prescribed. She is not an addict and has never been. She is not a n alcohol drinker either. She has energy to be with her daughter for a day long shopping trip. She can now clean her home, instead of being in the bed or on her couch balled up in so much pain she is crying. She can do things with her family she couldn't do until she got relief from this plant, kratom. It has given her energy, pain relief and the ability to live her life to the fullest. \nThe other family member was in a terrible motorcycle accident a few years back. Every nerve in her left arm was cut and she almost died from the injury. She has also been prescribed the strongest opiates on the market. She found kratom after  the first family member and has stated it helps with her nerve damage pain.  Not once while I've watched them take the supplement kratom, have either acted like she's not in control of herself and never has been unable to keep up with the conversations and be part of the family. Both  just feels like partaking in life now. \nPlease reconsider placing kratom on such a high level. With the opiate epidemic our country is facing and trying to get under control, from my research and watching these two members of the family, kratom could be a healthy, safe plant that  brings pain relief, is safe from any harmful  or deadly side effects,  I believe kratom possibly could be the answer to this nations opiate abuse problems.  Thank you for your consideration of this wonderful God-given plant. \n Sincerely, Angela M.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19876","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Angela M","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This natural product relieves my chronic headaches.

Kratom is not a drug and therefore should not be federally regulated as such. That is, it is not claimed to treat or cure any diseases. Rather, kratom like caffeinated beverages, supports and maintains a healthy feeling throughout the long work day. Further, if any regulation is desired by the people, the states have proven they can handle this decision without overreach from federal bureaucracy. As a personal consumer and informed citizen, it is evident that even a temporary placement of kratom on Schedule 1 is unwarranted by scientific research or historical accounts.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19570","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lauren Gidus","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not make this plant a schedule 1 drug.

It is my personal opinion that this would be detrimental to both my wellbeing and that of others who take kratom on a regular basis. I speak from experience when I say that kratom does not have any of the negative effects associated with drugs associated with the schedule 1 of the controlled substances act. \n\nFrom 2009  up until February 2015 I had been addicted to pharmaceutical pain medication and alcohol, specifically hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and codeine. My behaviors and actions during the time I was addicted to these drugs became so detrimental to my relationships and wellbeing that I was forced to sever all relationships, personal and professional, that i had made up to that point in my life and move in with my mother.  At the time I moved in with my mother I had begun taking kratom in an effort to begin a more truthful, compasionate, healthy, responsible, and thoughtful stage in my life. I am proud to say that I have been completely clean from alcohol, pain medication, and all illicit drugs since February 2015. I now heave a steady job as a cook and a healthy relationship and living situation  that I havery maintained for over a year. This is something I would never have been able to accomplish without kratom. Everyday I wake up ready to participate in society and do my best to contribute to my community rather than be a burden to it. \n It's my opinion that kratom use in this country is not an issue that is detrimental to individuals and society. In fact I truly believe that the banning of the two substances in question with have negative effects on communities and create felons out of some of the most law abiding and productive citizens in our society and I urge those with thoughts and plans to ban those substances related to kratom to reconsider and thoughtfully listen to those people who have had positive experiences related to the use of kratom, such as myself. Thank you for your time and thoughtful consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22436","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Stevenson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello. \nI am writing to ask you to leave the product kratom without additional restriction or regulation. If you are concerned about its possible negative effects, please conduct scientific studies so that those effects will be accurately demonstrated.\n My personal experience of this product is via my adult son who suffers from excruciatingly painful arthritis. He mostly just bears up with the pain but when it becomes too difficult to even sleep, he finds some relief with kratom. As a teenager he struggled with addiction to pain medication. Having overcome that, he avoids the traditional treatment for his condition, which would be heavy prescription pain medication. He would certainly get more pain relief but he would rather bear the pain with relief from non-addictive kratom than risk becoming dependent on prescription pain meds. Please consider that he is not alone among kratom users who are making this difficult life choice.  Addiction to prescription pain medication creates a much greater burden  to our society than the use of kratom. I would hope more light would be shed on the possibilities kratom holds for good. \nPlease refrain from scheduling it as a controlled substance. Have compassion on those who struggle with pain but have the personal strength and commitment to avoid opiates. \nPlease make your decision once you have more complete information from double blind studies. A hasty move to scheduling kratom will hurt more than it will help. \n\nMost sincerely,\n\nDorothy Flynn\n\nNote: I am 62 years old, my son is 32, we are college educated, I'm a business owner and he is a professional in water safety.

To those that are addicted to it, myself included, it is very hard to quit and be clean. I've not used any drugs before Kratom use when I started 2 years ago. It is an addiction for which it is terribly hard D to quit, both in terms of physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms at both acute and post withdrawal stages. The concern is not the acute physical withdrawal symptoms. Sure they are tough for a few days, but rather the sphychological issues that wreck havoc on mental state. Quiting without medical attention was not possible for me because if the imprnding doom, depression and apathy that follows. The pending state of doom and fear pushes towards a psychotic break. Unfortunately, not quiting is wrexking havik on my mental state in all areas of my life. I have various forms of psychosis and am delusional a lot of the time. My fears are amplified where I feel I cannot escape them. again, Kratom has negatively affected my physical, spiritual and mood profiles. There is no amount of Kratom I can take to get any positive effect out of it and a lot of the times I just get sick and vomit or get delusional. It is my own fault that I let it get out of control. I feel I need to go to Trestmeny a second time this year to get my life back. I am a functioning adult who has a family, a professional career and a sense of responsibility, but these aspects are slipping away. I cannot sleep any longer more then 3-4 hours a night, I feel like I am constantly in a state of withdrawal during the day and I have delusions about events around me that are in fact not how I perceive them. My libido is non existence. For all these reasons, I am pushing for Kratom to be banned in order to save people like myself. I want my life back to the way it used to be 2 years ago. Fortunately. The wife supports me through all this and wants to see.me get better. I want to be better. I am not a criminal. Fart from it. I won't do illegal drugs. There were to many glory stories about Kratom when I first started using it to treat backnpain in a natural way. Everyone online said it was non addictive. It was supposed to be a safe and natural herb to treat mild pain. All these promises which were simply not true. Again I am blaming myself for getting deeply addictied to Kratom. I have an addictive behavior. I am all in when I put my mind to something. Unfortunately this is my downfall when it comes to substance abuse. Banning Kratom will help people like myself. For most, Kratom is highly addictive. It does provide medical benefits, but you have to be more respinsi Blue about Kratom then I was. There are many like that. I am not alone. There are also many who don't get addicted to it. I wish I was that type of person. Unfortunately I am not. It hasn't ruined my life yet, but feel it could the longer this goes on. I could lose my family (of 17 years) , my career (highly successful software developer) and my sanity. Not to mention Kratom is draining my finances. Please help people like myself and ban Kratom. I am planning to go through treatment as soon as I can (and when it won't ruin my corrent set of responsibilities). I hope that is soon.

I've always been hesitant of \"natural remedies\" due to most of them not working, and occasionally hurting those who choose them over more traditional medical practices. However, kratom has proven its effectiveness by alleviating pain while not taking me to the brink of sedation. Before kratom I couldn't bend down without a flash of pain in my back and I definitely couldn't lift anything over 20 pounds without pain that would last all day. I've been prescribed opiates, that while helping numb the pain, also numbed my mind, so I stopped taking them. I became a father 2 years ago and work overnight while taking care of my son during the day. Kratom has given me the ability to be a hands on dad: playing on the ground with my son, lifting him up for hugs, and climbing through playground equipment. I don't have to worry about the pain or the sedative effects of opiates. Kratom is a safe and effective alternative to addictive medications. Making kratom schedule 1 would have an immediate and debilitating impact on not just my life, but my son's life, because it would limit my ability to interact with him. The proposed move to schedule 1 is unjustified and dangerous, the positive impacts would be nonexistent, while the negative would be overwhelming to those who use kratom for alternative pain management, anxiety, and those seeking to curb their addiction to opiates. There is no basis for kratom to be schedule 1, and the reaction by science and medical professionals has been overwhelmingly that kratom is safe.

I am a 57 yr. old psoriatic arthritis sufferer. For years  MDS. have prescribed hydrocodones, oxycodones, and various NARCOTIC man-made pain relievers these medicines always come with the obligatory side effects. Including what I refer to as narcotic fog and gastro- intestinal problems. So finally I discover kratom a safe and natural pain relief with none of side effects of NARCOTICS. So because the big drug companies aren't making billions from the sale of this product. the DEA wants to criminalize this product and turn me into a criminal as well. That's typical of the government's hollier than thou attitude. Stop trying to regulate things in my life and worry about your own. If any of you DEA know-it-alls suffer from chronic pain ...try some of this stuff!? As I said before, it has none of the side effects that narcotic medicines posses. Most importantly there are no withdraw symptoms when you stop taking kratom!!

The call for scheduling it was very surprising to me as Kratom is so helpful to so many, yet so incredibly innocuous. This is not a dangerous plant and has HUGE potential for medical research. It's effects of pain relief, anxiety reduction, and helping people to get off actual drugs (heroin, pain killers, alcohol...it goes on and on) should be studied and proven through scientific means the way it is has so ardently been proven through personal experiences of (at least) thousands. \n\nMy personal experience with Kratom has been very positive. I have been a semi-regular user for 3 years on and off. I have no issues whatsoever during my \"off-times\" and experience no withdrawal or cravings.  I use it as pain relief for my lower back, and to gain energy and motivation that my professionally diagnosed severe Panic Disorder sucks away from me. I am prescribed benzodiazepines for my panic and Kratom allows me to lower my dosage. The risks of excessive and extended use of benzodiazepines is well-documented, so this is obviously a GOOD thing. Also, for the sake of full disclosure, I have illegally obtained opiate pain-killers in the past for my back pain. This led to a near full-blown addiction. Using Kratom not only takes care of my pain, but completely eliminates ANY drive to use actual opiates for pain or recreation.  I can NOT go back to the life of drug-dealers and recreational use of opiates. \n\nMy worst experience I've ever had with Kratom (I guess you could call it \"overdosing\") was some wobbling in my eyes, slight nausea, and sweating. These symptoms lasted 2 hours max. I would have had this exact same reaction from drinking too much coffee. The difference between this \"overdose\" and an overdose of opiates or benzodiazepines are very literally the difference between life or death. Some reports of the potential threats of Kratom from the FDA and other sources are just...wrong. Unresearched fear-mongering and a huge overreach of power. \n\nMy needs and experiences with Kratom are not extreme, but very common. I have spoken with and read from people who had full-blown, life-crippling heroin or alcohol addictions. Kratom has SAVED THEIR LIVES. A ban on Kratom WILL kill people. There is no other way to put it. This is a life-saving plant and I support scientific and professional research, but please do not ban Kratom. Please do not use fear-tactics or just plain lack of knowledge on this plant to motivate an undeserved ban. \n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment and please take everyone's words who do comment very seriously.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2399","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stacy King","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 68 year old retired RN with degenerative disc disease in my neck and lower back as well as osteo arthritis particularly on my hands.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works... It uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies. http://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes... Thailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects. http://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

I stayed on the medication for a couple of years and then decided I did not want to take them any longer. I was never told about the withdrawels that the medication causes, so after several failed attempts in rehab I was sent to the methadone clinic. I was to sick to research what methadone treatment was and I trusted the doctors. I was on the methadone clinic for 8 years at 180mg daily and again I was ready to get off of the methadone. As I researched how to get off the methadone the more it seemed to look like most people are on the clinic for the rest of their lives. I finally came across Ibogaine and I researched it for over a year. I decided I had to try it and did the treatment in mexico. I still had a few withdrawals but was able to leave in four days. I was able to get off the methadone clinic but without the follow up after care needed with Ibogainein which is not legal here I started taking pain pills again. I recently found kratom and being in pain and having an addiction this was and is a true miracle plant. I only wish that I had known about about kratom along time ago, I can't even imagine how different my life could have been. This plant could help change and save so many lives. I know as an addict that one of the biggest fears of getting clean is the horrible withdrawals so having access to kratom would be a life line. So many addicts don't have insurance to access drug treatment so getting clean is just not an option. I am pleading to keep.kratom legal for all the people that are addicts or in chronic pain that should have the option to chose a natural plant like kratom instead of narcotics.

I'm a father, husband, and soon to be grandfather. I'm a responsible adult that uses kratom daily for chronic pain. I'd like to voice my opposition to the DEAs Intent to Schedule the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, which would make Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), a schedule 1 controlled substance with no medicinal value. This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose. \n\nIn 2009 I suffered an injury at work. I have a herniated disc in my neck that causes me daily headaches, problems with my vision, painful muscle spasms in my neck, head, back, and shoulder. For 6 years I took harsh and addictive prescription pain killers and muscle relaxers. This year I was fortunate enough to find kratom. I have not had one sick day from work since starting to take kratom.   \n\nKratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. I fear any scheduling will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic, maybe even my own.

I'm not sure where to begin, other than say that quite simply kratom has saved my life and my sanity.  I suffer from extreme anxiety, and ever since taking kratom (for approximately one year) my panic/anxiety attacks have completely, 100% disappeared.  \n\nI started taking kratom after being referred to it from a friend who also suffered from extreme anxiety.  Before I tried it, the ONLY thing that would alleviate my problem was taking prescription opiates, which are quite obviously illegal to obtain.  I discovered this when I had to get a tooth pulled and was given some by my dentist.  My head cleared, my pain went away, and my anxiety was GONE for the first time in probably 15 years. When my prescription ran out my problems came back though.  Rather than turn to heroin, I decided on a whim to try kratom. I am proud to say that I have not taken a prescription pill in over a year because of kratom.  I am able to concentrate at work without having anxiety, and my family life at home is also MUCH better as I simply do not worry anymore. \n\nTo be quite honest, I'm absolutely petrified at the thought of not having access to kratom anymore.  It legitimately saved my life and my mental stability.  I do not take it to \"get high\" and I have never experienced an overdose from it.  It just simply provides me with mental clarity, concentration and eliminates my anxiety 100%.  I have been able to completely function as a normal member of society for one full year thanks to it.  \n\nPlease take this into consideration when making your decision.  I am scared of losing my sanity, but I am even more scared about what I'm going to do if it becomes illegal. I've never filled out a form or anything like this before, but this decision quite simply affects me more than maybe anything else in my entire life.  Thank your for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16449","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"M Pate","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have suffered greatly with chronic pain from Fibromyalgia, RA, Degenerative disc disease for years.

This plant has saved my life. Truely. \n\nMy life started early with problems with pain shortly after a car accident that caused chronic pain in my lower back and additionally caused my to have depression also as a result. I have been prescribed pain killers which include hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, phentynal, methadone, and suboxone and none of them (especially the last two) did anything but mask the pain and in the end caused much much more pain than the initial pain I was dealing with to begin with. \n\nKratom has been a life changing plant for me. After I decided to tell my doctor I wanted to be taken off of my pain medications he refered me to a Methadone Maintenance Cliniic. I had to pay upwards to 500$ a month and make a daily visit to this clinic every day to stay on that medicine, and when I decided I no longer wanted to be on Methadone and just wanted my life back I soon realized that the last half-life of Methadone caused me to have SERVERE! withdrawl symptoms that lasted for a full 30 days! and post acute withdrawl symptoms for months afterwards. I was never able to stop the methadone treatment until I tried Kratom. I was in the Methadone Maintenance program for over 13 years and Kratom was the only thing that allowed me to finally stop the vicious cycle. \n\nI understand that the plant known as Kratom may need some regulation to provide guarentees that it is actually the plant Kratom that you are purchasing when you buy it, but to say that it should be considered a schedule 1 drug with completely no medicinal value, I KNOW is obsurd and cruel. If you are to say Kratom is to be put into schedule 1 than you would therefore need to completely ban hydrocodone, morphine, phyntnal, percocet, and all other prescription opiates that cause millions of deaths yearly and have fueled the terrible drug war that heroin has caused to all of the people and children that have fallen victim to it. \n\nI urge you to reconsider this decision. This plant SAVES LIVES TRUELY! It saved my life and gave me my life back from the prescription medicines that the DEA has determined are legal. If you want to have a tool to provide relieve to people with pain and a tool to help addicts with true opiate detox you will look into this more and reconsider banning a plant that can change our world and lower deaths and drug use in our great country. \n\nI respect my government and pray that you will not ban a plant that has the potential to be a much better alternative to Methadone or Suboxone for detox and and much better alternative to prescription pain killers. We the people look to your noble agency to have a responsible power to control what is available as medicine and ban what is non-medicinal, and if you are to look into this there is NO possible way that the millions of deaths yearly from prescription pain killers can compare to the 23 or 24 reported deaths of kratom that were mostly misconstrued as kratom when in reality other factors were the overall reason. \n\nWe the people are looking to you, the world is looking to you as a agency that we can trust and believe in and trust to have our best interest in mind, if this is true which I believe it is you will do the right thing and you WILL NOT make this plant a schedule 1 drug. \n\nWe are looking to you, your decision here WILL have a huge public reaction in whichever decision you make, If you make this LIFE SAVING plant schedule 1 the people will start to lose trust and believe in this government and agency. I as of now believe and always have believed in your agency but if you make this plant schedule 1 I will have to wonder why you would allow Oxycodone and Methadone legal but kratom illegal. If you make kratom schedule 1 I will have lost hope in my government. \n\nI pray you truely give this a genuine consideration, may god guide your way.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5106","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Alderson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There is no need for this ban.

I began an interest in Kratom because I wanted to work with an herb/plant that helps to improve mood. Through my experience Kratom was gentle, calming, soothing, and very restorative. It helped me to remember a part of Myself that I felt I had not experienced in a long time. In my opinion: anything in life can be abused. Sex, masturbation, cars, money, power, pharmaceutical opiates, cannabis, tobacco, food, fast food, alcohol, guns, knives, herbs, cough medicine, ect. I mean really, anything has the potential to be abused, and in my veiw point, it is not your responsibility to tell people what we can and can not do or consume. How many people die from tobacco related deaths a year? how many people die from eating toxic food and fast food a year? how many people die from fatal car accidents a year? how many people die from accidental overdose of pharmaceutical drugs a year? i am not here to write a research paper, but merely to bring up some points. All the people who die from tobacco related deaths a year and the DEA does nothing about it? All the people who die from car accidents a year, and no one even blinks an eye? All the people who die from alcohol related ailments? where are the DEA for these issues? Through my experience with Kratom, it is a beautiful spirit and herb to work with. But it does deserve respect, at least that's how I feel. If it is abused yes, there can be some issues, like anything that gets abused. So instead of trying to control everything that people do, most likely for corrupt reasons i add; try to move into your heart space and feel all the people this herb helps. Kratom is not a cure for pain, but it can help and guide someone through pain. Kratom will not cure depression, but it can help someone through depression and be a helping guide. Instead of banning a living life form and the medicine it shares, why not try educating people and how to safely and respectfully use and work with Kratom? this saves an endless process of innocent people/patients going to prison for working with a God given herb on this planet. I feel in life we dont need you policing everyone and creating more issues. to me, we just need everyone to learn how to authentically heal from issues and utilizes plants for what they are, beautiful guides that do not cure us, but guide us through issues.

I also had complications from the knee injury and surgery forcing a longer recovery period than normal. I was in a great deal of pain and had to extend my intake of Oxycodone, something I did not want to do.  A friend suggested I try Kratom (if you allow me to be open and honest here - I don't like marijuana, other illegal drugs, and I cannot take advil because of a stomach ulcer). I also had to stop the oxycodone because I felt myself getting addicted. The Kratom has helped me recover by giving me just enough pain relief to get through my therapy sessions. I am getting stronger now and feeling great.  It helped me tremendously and I can't fathom why it would ever be considered dangerous. It has a very mild pain relieving effect for me. Honestly its like a stronger version of camomile tea and coffee (without the jitters of caffeine).  If I hadn't been able to take it, I think I would be in trouble with an opiate addiction at the moment. I don't feel the need to take Kratom everyday but when I'm in pain it still helps me function and has helped me get back to work.  It doesn't \"get me high\" like Oxycodone but it does help my pain and I believed it has SAVED ME from a possible opiate addiction.  Please keep it legal for those suffering from pain and addiction.  A few of my friends also take it for insomnia and they say it helps them. I've urged them to comment here during your consideration period.  \n\nThanks for your time, I sincerely hope you consider our opinions and I'd be glad to help answer further questions if needed.

I started using prescription drugs to self medicate after my mother committed suicide. I was 16 at the time and living with my dad, also an addict. He had been diagnosed with cancer and he shared his OxyContin and Lortab with me. I know it was wrong of him to do that, but honestly, I think it saved my life. I often had thoughts of suicide and I suffered with severe depression. Those horrible pills kept me numb enough to get through the days. I was home schooled and managed to graduate on time with a 3.8 GPA. I tried to stop using time after time. I then enlisted in the Army National Guard for a variety of reasons, but the main reason being to stop using heroin. I went through horrid opiate withdrawals during basic training. Somehow I fought through and I graduated at the top of my class. Everything was looking up until the day I was free to go home. A real soldier now, with a stronger mind, body and soul. I relapsed less than 30 days later. For 16 years, half of my LIFE, I have struggled with opiate dependency. I tried methadone for 4 years, suboxone for 3 years, haha what a joke all that stuff is. All of that stuff gets you high and robs you of your freedom and your bank account! I was in and out of jail and in debt until I researched kratom online. I found kratom 2 years ago and I haven't looked back once. ZERO RELAPSES. Kratom helps my PTSD, depression, anxiety, sleep and my Army injury pain. No more feeling trapped! No getting fired from my job. I can be a role model for my children and I can be the man my wife knew I could be all those years ago.

I found out about Kratom after scouting the internet, looking for something to help lower back pain. I have had lower back pain issues for a while now, stemming from an old High School sports injury. You see, I had previously been prescribed Hydrocodone and Tramadol. I became addicted to Hydrocodone, without it I would feel lethargic and begin shaking. When on it, the pain would subside, but I couldn't be myself. I would become drowsy, and emotionally void. I went from one pill, to four or five a day.  It was slowly ruining my life. I found a Kratom website after looking for something else to help with the pain. Kratom helps with my pain, and gives me none of the side effects the pills gave me. The reported \"high\" is no different than a cup of coffee gives. All I need is one teaspoon a day and I am fine. Kratom has literally saved my life. There are countless stories of former heroin addicts whose lives have been salvaged by Kratom. Kratom has become a life saver for tens of thousands of people across the U.S alone. With a person lost to pill addiction every 19 minutes, Kratom could be a miracle plant, but won't if we ban everything that isn't a pill prescribed by a Doctor. \n\nThanks for reading and best wishes,\n\nHunter Smith","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16497","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Hunter Smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has tremendously helped me with severe anxiety issues.

I'd like to make an effort to advocate for kratom. My hope is that it will not be classified a Schedule I substance, but instead remain an option for myself and many other good people to use as a safe alternative to harsh pharmaceuticals. I have been drinking kratom tea for a little over one year now with great appreciation for the benefits with which this wonderful plant has presented me. My whole life I have struggled with autoimmunity. Things like asthma, eczema, cystic acne, and intestinal permeability have caused me a great deal of suffering. along side a systemic inflammation manifesting itself in the form of severe anxiety, and depression for the better part of my lifetime. Because of this, I take a great deal of caution and care into what goes into my body. Many foods can trigger the parasympathetic nervous system into an autoimmune response that can last months. All that being said, I found kratom tea to be a tremendous help in alleviating these symptoms into something manageable. On the contrary to a few of the media horror stories that one might find while searching through Youtube, I'm under the impression that kratom is completely and totally safe. I believe there is an unfair biased in news, in which media outlets have portrayed kratom to be a heavy narcotic comparable to heroin, which is preposterous. I'm incredibly thankful that such a plant exists for the benefit of the people. I ask that you please leave kratom off of the list of schedule I narcotics, so that I and so many others, may continue to benefit from kratom, in a safe and responsible manner as productive members of society.

I've taken it for relaxation purposes maybe 20 or 30 times in my life and that's just what it did.  It relaxed me without any side affects that I could even remotely detect.  There wasn't any addictive qualities about it that I could feel happening.  I had gotten an education on it from a person who's had extensive personal experience with it and I was dismayed but not surprised to learn about the economic forces that are trying to make it illegal.  They're the same ones trying to keep marijuana illegal as a schedule one drug in spite of mountains of evidence that it has many uses to cure illnesses or at least relieve mild to debilitating symptoms of many diseases. One of the greatest uses of Kratom, from my understanding, is it's ability, when applied correctly, to help people become free of very addictive drugs like opioids or heroin.

This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\nI learned about Kratom from chronic pain online forums and the research search engine Galileo. At the age of 20, I suffered a severe car accident leaving me in chronic low back pain. Throughout the years, I have consulted with healthcare providers, looking to alleviate my pain. Chiropractor medicine, epidural injections, massage therapy and over-the-counter and prescription pain medications. I was on multiple medications, including narcotics, since the age of 20, until the discovery of Kratom in 2011. My wife and I wanted to start a family and were advised the multiple pain reliving medications I was on could have adverse effects on our future children. I made the switch to ease my pain and withdrawal from all the prescription medications, which has allowed me to continue my activities of daily living, and to spare the chance of harm to our future children.\n\nKratom has allowed me to be on one substance to relieve my pain, instead of 5 medications. I am able to function in my day to day activities, i.e. getting out of bed, exercise at the YMCA, and grocery shopping, perform critical thinking skills and tasks at work, and enjoy life with my 2 healthy, beautiful, and intelligent daughters while taking Kratom. I dred the thought of returning to the use of prescription medications and time consuming healthcare consults in the treatment of my pain. The expense at treating my pain through healthcare consults and pharmacological means was immense compared to my cost of using Kratom.\n\nKratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. I'm asking you to please contact the DEA. Please send a letter or request an oversight hearing asking to delay this emergency action. I fear this action by the DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic and I do not want to return to more addictive, prescription medication. I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without kratom.\n\nIf you have questions about kratom, please visit www.americankratom.org.

I felt confident in doing this because of kratom's long and benign history in southeast Asia, combined with well-developed dosage recommendations on the website Erowid. Speaking only for myself, I cannot imagine kratom deserving DEA scheduling. Unless St John's Wort is going to be next? Their potencies and net effects are pretty similar. Kratom has a genuine and safe function as a mood stabilizer, to say nothing of its potential in opioid rehab. I have read anecdotally about concentrated mitragynine extracts being misused as a poor substitute for heroin, but the leaf powder itself has very little abuse potential. You would puke it up before you managed to take a dosage close to health-threatening. I find kratom particularly valuable for working long shifts. Driving under the influence of kratom is not at all impairing; if anything the opposite. This leaf is safer and more effective than many dietary supplements already on the market, and has unambiguous positive attributes for those interested in trying it. The DEA counterargument to that is a combination of nebulous and factually false.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12024","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Keorkunian-Rivers","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used Kratom for 2 yrs as an alternative to addictive pain medications sold by the pharmaceutical industry.

This plant has had quite a positive effect on my life over the past few years.

I was prescribed Lexapro by a physician, but I could not function to the degree I need to to live a full life, as I am not depressed and am an extremely motivated, healthy person, prescription medication that most doctors will prescribe me for OCD just has the polar opposite effect on my life as I would hope for in an ideal situation.  I have used Kratom over the past 2 Years regularly and responsibly as I did a lot of research on the plant before even considering to try it.  I love a successful life as a 27 year old engineer working on his masters degree. Unfortunately I can't tell anyone about how Kratom has literally turned my life around because of this illogical negative stigma that makes people assume I am an oppiate addict or just a scumbag in general.  Quite the opposite, before Kratom, I would drink heavily and use other drugs to numb my mind of the obsessive thoughts and anxiety. I wasn't even going to write in to you, but I just wanted you to know that there really are many good, law abiding, responsible individuals that are out there and use Kratom simply for daily peace of mind.

As a member of society contributing to the well-being of others in the mental health field, with a masters in psychology, I'm grateful to comment on why kratom should remain available to the public. Anecdotally I know people, some close and others from afar who've been able to stop taking deadly and addictive opiates by mediating their withdrawal with the use of kratom. As someone who wishes to offer scientific and experiential knowledge to those struggling with substance abuse, I began taking the supplement. What I've found is that this supplement elevates mood, enhances focus, increases energy and reduces pain. This is by only taking 1 to 2 servings. At night if I'm unable to sleep, I will take one extra serving and I am able to relax and have a great nights sleep. So on days I'm feeling sluggish or in a depressed mood, one to two servings completely turns my day around. Using this supplement I've been able to quit smoking cigarettes as well as marijuana. I feel healthier and happier, more productive than I have in years. To take this away would not only take away an amazing aid for those with opiate abuse and withdrawal, but will also encourage the use of dangerous, addictive and illegal substances. This supplement has a long history of use and is a well known fact that those who take this daily and cease to take it will experience a withdrawal profile similar to caffeine. Not only do the health benefits, including increased immune health, and better quality of life with very little if any side effects, outweigh that of caffiene, the risk to society as a whole, in my professional opinion, is much greater if this amazing, natural supplement, were to be banned. Considering this supplement in the same category as heroin and crack cocaine, is a grave misunderstanding and complete lack of knowledge as to this supplement. Take this away, and use of illicit and dangerous substances will increase. Mark my words. Thanks again.

Even though I don't use Marijuana, its use and also the use of  Kratom is an effective aide for people with chronic conditions such as back injuries. There was a huge spike of patients abusing doctor prescribed pain killers that the government was just fine with for decades. Even when the amount acetaminophen that was jammed into hydrocodone pills was excessive causing severe liver damage.  Now, there is a big push to reduce the amount of painkillers prescribed by any doctor. This directly negatively affects people like myself that rely on the drug to give me a quality of life that is manageable until a permanent solution can be found. Now in need of relief, when I go to the doctor, he just looks at me like I'm a junkie looking for a fix. Even though I've never abused my prescription, I've never ran out of my Rx early as there is a big difference between relying on the drug for a decent quality of life and being addicted to opiates of the drug. This is where Kratom has helped me very much. I'm not ingesting all the unknown and dangerous ingredients of a painkiller but with Kratom, I'm able to have some relief from my chronic pain and be a productive, contributing citizen of the state of Washington. Rather than using scare tactics and essentially making Kratom illegal to use, why not devote the time, money and resources to do some independent, controlled studies using Kratom and do what you can to find out how to use a natural drug (Kratom) to help the people that would find Kratom as a beneficial way to reduce pain and other benefits it has? Please use some logic here. Study it. Find out it's uses and benefits and find avenues to allow the general use of it. I'm sure you will find that it's benefits outweigh any other synthetic pain reliever on the market that is approved by the FDA. Just look at the potential dangers of Tylenol. Kratom has none of the potential hazards that Tylenol has.  Anyone can abuse just about anything. That potential doesn't go away. But, the potential abuse of any product shouldn't determine it's legality in this situation. Especially, when there hasn't been any documented proof of hospitalization or death from using Kratom. One could abuse water. Anyone could drink too much water, lose their electrolytes and die. It's called  hyponatremia and has documented cases of it. It's consumption isn't regulated by the government. When Kratom has a zero death rate...what are you trying to ban here? It doesn't make any sense. Use the money to do controlled, unbiased studies FIRST.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18135","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep Kratom legal.

It has helped me tremendously in the past year. I became addicted to Oxycontin and Heroin in a two-week period. I have suffered from periodic depression and insomnia for my entire life. I have had no issues with developing dependence on Kratom. I do not know if I would have been able to stop using opiates without Kratom. Kratom helps somewhat with the insomnia and depression.\n\nExperimenting with opiates was a foolish thing to do, but they helped me sleep. I had sporadically used small amounts of opiates over the last ten year, and had very minimal withdrawal symptoms. This year, I used opiates for two weeks in a row, and experienced severe withdrawal symptoms. I was aware that the withdrawals would go away in a week or less, but I simply could not quit despite having upcoming drug tests for pretrial services due to a DUI charge. Even the imminent threat of jail could not stop me! After trying to quit cold turkey for about 2 weeks, I had missed drug tests and still could not stop. A friend recommended I try Kratom, and I could quit. Tolerating the withdrawals was still very difficult. The Kratom reduced physical symptoms from unbearable to unpleasant. I have not touched an opiate in five months, and I partially attribute this achievement to Kratom.\n\nKratom helps me with my insomnia and depression. Red vein Kratom has mild sedative qualities and white vein Kratom has mild stimulant qualities. Taking some red vein before bed is a little helpful. It is not a guaranteed to put me to sleep, but it does help me wind down and give me a greater chance of sleeping. Taking some white vein helps is energizing like a small dose of caffeine, and makes interacting with others more fun. Sometimes if I do not feel like getting out of bed, I will take some white vein Kratom and get out and socialize. The small energy boost and mild mood enhancement helps tremendously with my periodic depression.\n\n I have found all forms of Kratom to have a low ceiling effect, and very mild withdrawal. Taking a larger amount does not have a larger effect. Taking too much causes me to have a headache, which can be effectively treated with Advil. The only withdrawal symptom I have experienced has been somewhat loose stool. Kratom causes mild constipation, and when I do not take any for a few days my stool is looser while my body adjusts. With a low ceiling effect and mild withdrawal symptoms, the risk of dependency is low. For me, the dependency is lower than caffeine. \n\nBanning Kratom due to a handful of deaths that all involve other dangerous drugs and/or preexisting medical conditions is foolish. Kratom is safe for adults. Millions of people have been safely enhancing their lives with Kratom for thousands of years. Further research is an absolute necessity to determine potential benefits of Kratom use.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15594","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Van Hook","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helped me immensely with my symptoms due to withdrawal from Benzodiazepines.

This plant has helped a lot of people for many things ranging from depression and anxiety, to substance abuse issues and pain. My question is this; if you find it alright to hand people prescriptions that can literally hook them on prescription drugs for the rest of their lives, which a lot of times turns into illicit drug use, and eventually death, then why would you put a natural substance on the scheduled drug list? Unless you care about nothing but money, it seems a little counterproductive.  I spent 8 years in and out of different rehabs only to end up back on the street shooting up drugs.

I am drafting this letter to convey my concern for the potential Kratom ban, and to urge my government representatives to do everything they can to postpone and prevent the DEA from scheduling Kratom as a Schedule 1 controlled substance.\n\nI am a responsible adult who has taken Kratom every day for over a year. Kratom is a plant from Asia that has unprecedented benefits for people who suffer from chronic pain and anxiety. Kratom is used by veterans, house wives, working professionals, ex-drug addicts, and many other normal people. If Kratom is banned, these people will all be criminals by this time next month. Kratom is NOT a recreational drug that people use to get high. In this regard, it is considerably safer than even marijuana!\n\nOne of the most important things to note is that Kratom its extremely beneficial for people who are trying to wean themselves off of opioids such as heroin. There is a heroin epidemic in this country and banning Kratom will exasperate it by criminalizing a natural, safe, and non-addictive remedy for opioid withdrawals. The individuals who rely on Kratom in order to avoid relapsing into harmful narcotics like heroin will be impacted by this ban the most. Many of which will either re-laps, or replace Kratom with extremely harmful, addictive, and costly synthetic drugs. The only people who stand to benefit from this ban are rich and powerful pharmaceutical companies.\n\nBanning Kratom will do a massive disservice to society. Kratom is NOT addictive, it is not toxic, you cannot OD on it. If taken in extremely high doses it can cause a headache or stomach ache at worst. There are no deaths directly linked to Kratom. Instead the fatalities reported in the letter sent to the DEA explicitly say that the deceased individual had other substances in his or her system that caused death. Kratom did not/does not cause death.\nKratom has been the most positive thing in my life for the past year. It has allowed me to find a better job, and given me the freedom to live my life without anxiety.\n\nI urge you to oppose the Kratom ban.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13415","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Jamroz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly oppose the proposed ban of kratom.

I have a B.A. in accounting and work full time as an accountant. The only reason I am currently able to work full time is because of kratom. I strongly oppose the DEAs decision to place kratom on the list of schedule 1 substances, and here is why. \n\nI started using kratom about 2 years ago. For the past 6 or 7 years I have struggled with chronic pain and fibromyalgia. Despite spending thousands of dollars and seeing dozens of doctors and specialists, I was never able to get to a place where I wasnt constantly in pain. I tried dozens (if not more) of pharmaceutical drugs, including several muscle relaxants, opioid pain killers, every type of NSAID, steroids, Lyrica, and topical creams and patches. The side effects on many of those medications was so bad that I couldnt function normally or stay awake at work. Opioid pain killers were the only ones that made a dent in my pain levels, but as so many Americans know, they are dangerous and addictive, and my tolerance quickly grew. So after years of frustration and living with this chronic pain, I came across an article online about a botanical called kratom. I was instantly intrigued. Several days later, my order was delivered and I tried kratom for the first time. I was in awe by how well it worked to manage my pain symptoms, and how alert and focused I was, unlike with opioids. \n\nSince I started taking kratom daily, Ive been able to return to work full time, start an online business, and plan a wedding and get married. None of this would have been possible without kratom. It is the only thing that allows me to feel normal again, and live without the constant, nagging pain all over my body. \n\nKratom is a 100% natural tea leaf that has been safely used for hundreds of years in Southeast Asia. It has also been used in the United States for decades by millions of people. In high doses, it does not cause respiratory depression like most opioids do. Because of this, it is impossible to overdose on kratom. If you take too much, your body will force itself to vomit, expelling it from your body. Kratom is in the same family as coffee, and is not addictive. If the DEA goes ahead with scheduling this substance, it will halt any and all scientific research, which has thus far been shown to be beneficial for many reasons. Kratom has even been helpful to many opiate addicts (including prescription pain killers and heroin), helping them wean themselves off of these drugs and stay clean. The opiate crisis is only on the rise in the United States. It would be ill-advised to ban kratom without further researching its potential as a helpful aid for opiate addiction.\n\nKratom is safe, natural, and has myriad benefits. It does not belong in the same category as synthetic and highly dangerous and addictive drugs such as heroin and LSD. Kratom is a botanical tea, and should be classified as such.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7806","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shelby Dixon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a retail store owner that sells kratom as well as an occasional user and it blows my mind to see that the DEA wants to put \na natural plant that is truly helping people with really NO side effects into a schedule 1.

Because they cause more HARM and DEATHS then what kratom does. For those of you \nwho think kratom is BAD well I sure hope you don't drink coffee (it does sit in the same plant family as kratom), drink alcohol,  \nsmoke tobacco, or better yet take prescription medication because I do know people who are in the GRAVE because of them.\nBut it just amazes me that we have a real product that is helping many people for many different reasons that may suffer from\nserve pain from injuries, aging, depression/anxiety, eating disorders, addition from illegal or prescription drugs, the list can go on.\nBut the big boys get nervous because their profits are effected (and u know who you are) and then they destroy us on many\nlevels from our rights to dictating what we can or cannot do with our life.

Kratom is a plant, not a drug.  It is an incredibly healing plant that can relieve the symptoms of many ailments.  I have chronic back pain, IBS and fatigue and dried Kratom leaf has the ability to relieve all of these.  Last week I had severe back pain that prevented me from going to work.  I took dried Kratom leaf for four consecutive days and my back pain was lessened to a tolerable level.  Kratom gives me energy and makes me feel happy, excited and hopeful about the future.  It has very little risk of abuse as I have taken it for weeks at a time and not become dependent on it.  I can take it when I need it and stop when I don't without any withdrawal symptoms.  Kratom is also cheap.  A typical dose cost only a dollar or two.  This means that people such as myself can get relief without having to purchase expensive drugs or worry about what is covered by insurance.  Kratom is natural.  It comes from the ground and is unaltered by any chemicals or unsafe processing.  There is no evidence that anyone has ever died from taking Kratom alone.  That cannot be said for FDA approved opiates that kill thousands every year.  Kratom helps opiate addicts break the cycle of addiction by replacing their opiate with Kratom.  And since the addictive potential of Kratom is so much lower than opiates they have a better chance at full recovery.  Scheduling Kratom will cause opiate addicts to die when they return to securing easily available opiates from pill mills or street dealers.  While the United States is drowning in an opiate epidemic, it would be pure insanity and completely unscientific to ban a natural healing plant that hurts no one and can help so many.

Years ago, I was in a terrible car accident that broke my pelvis and coccyx.  It has left me living in mild to severe bouts of pain, depending on the situation, and is something I have to deal with constantly, every waking minute.  I was originally put on HEAVY opiates by my doctors which left me feeling spacey and withdrawn.  And with the epidemic of opiate abuse in this country, I stopped all my pain meds within 6 months of receiving them for fear that I would become a statistic.  So i lived drug free but in pain, taking only Ibuprofen for relief.  A friend of mine told me about Kratom, he was born in Bali and said his family would use this plant for pain relief growing up and it was a miracle plant.  So I did my research and decided to give Kratom a try.  When the pain gets overwhelming, I make a cup of tea using Kratom and within 15 minutes I feel like I'm back to normal.  I don't get \"high\" or intoxicated from it, I am able to work every day at my job as a Footwear Designer for an Athletic Brand, I can play sports again (limited contact, obviously) which has helped me to lose weight and get healthy again.  I understand the concern with the opiate problem with this country, but Kratom IS NOT that.  It really is a life altering plant and that is how it should be known.\n\nVery Sincerely Yours,\n\nNick Pappas","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17389","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nick Pappas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Once again it looks like protection  from loss to the pharmaceutical companies.

I couldn't possibly disagree more with the DEA's decision to do this. In all of my experience, I have only benefited from the use of Kratom and I am certain that banning Kratom would be a huge mistake.\n\nI discovered Kratom about 1 year ago when I was searching for something that could help with my chronic back pain after my chiropractor, physical therapist, & family doctor couldn't do anything to help me. After reading information on a few different websites like reddit.com/r/kratom that essentially laid everything out, I was able to read and learn until I was more comfortable with how to take it and where to purchase it.\n\nI for one am someone that has benefited greatly from the daily use of Kratom.  I live a very active lifestyle outside of my marketing job (where I spend most of my time sitting at a desk).  So health & fitness is very important to me. Feeling less pain & anxiety has allowed me to achieve more of my fitness goals & I attribute a lot of it to Kratom.\n\nMy back pain even affected me throughout the night, so sleeping was becoming more of an issue for me. Taking Kratom before bed has helped drastically. Where I was sleeping 4-6 hours each night, I'm now able to get 7-8 and feel much better every day.\n\nAfter reading a few people's concerns about Kratom's \"addictive\" properties, I completely quit taking it for about a week after about 6 months of daily use. The only difference I felt was that all of my issues starting coming back; difficulty sleeping, more back pain, etc. I have had surgeries in past years and have been prescribed opiates for pain, so I'm very familiar what it feels like to suddenly stop taking opiates. Kratom had none of those effects that opiates have. This is what makes this plant special.\n\nI think that if there should be any change to the status of Kratom, it isn't that it should be scheduled as an illegal drug, but rather treated in the same light as any dietary supplement you take. It needs to be regulated so that consumers know that they're getting a quality item with a safety backing. Just like with any dietary supplement, I want to know the exact amount of the product I'm taking.\n\nI am not one that would revert to heroin or pain killers as a replacement (although, many people would) if Kratom was made illegal, but I am sure that I would slip back into a life that I was starting to dislike and I'm afraid that I wouldn't be the man that I am now.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17424","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"DUSTIN DYER","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am against the scheduling of Kratom\nI am a 56year old grandma that could not be active without it.

I have personally had great success using Kratom on occasions when I'm experiencing high anxiety. It is extremely effective at reliving these symptoms and putting me at ease. In other periods of my life I was prescribed many different benzodiazepines in an attempt to find one that worked for occasional anxiety/panic attacks without negative side effects. These drugs like xanax, are dangerous drugs. There is a high abuse potential with them and terrible side effects.  I found Kratom in a search for alternatives and it has worked wonderfully without the zombie side effects of benzodiazepines and without the need to use daily but only when necessary. I also use Kratom for its pain reliving properties. I am a very active snowboarder and use Kratom to ride through minor pains and aches from the sport. I snowboard regularly between 9,000 to 13000ft elevation. At these elevations it is necessary for your body to increase your heart rate and subsequently your respiratory system in order to get more oxygen from the thin air. Kratom is great for a pain reliever in these situations as contrary to claims made by the DEA it does not cause respiratory depression. Kratom is a wonderful supplement that allows me to treat issues most commonly solved by using dangerous benzodiazepines.\n\nAlso thanks to legal prescribed drugs and a massive epidemic of oxycodone overprescribing I have experienced opiate addiction. I became addicted to opiates and for several years attempted to overcome it. I tried both major opiate maintenance prescription drugs an attempts to get off opiates. Both drugs are woefully inadequate. Methadone still gets you very high, is extremely expensive, and forces you to basically not be able to maintain a real job as you try to access the medicine. Suboxone is extremely expensive and hard to find doctors for as well as causing some symptoms like Post Acute Withdrawl Syndrome to be much worse and make it less likely for people to stay clean. I again found Kratom in a search for alternatives. It is astounding how effective it as a way to get people clean from opiate addictions. It is able to alleviate the vast majority of withdrawl symptoms and allow you to get through the withdrawls while still maintaining a life and a job. Unlike the above drugs it does not itself cause withdrawls allowing you to cleanly break back to being clean. It is also extremely cheap and effective with no more processing than grinding natural leaves. It will allow so many addicts who don't have the cash or insurance to get on prescription drugs. You will be taking a giant step back and discarding one of the greatest tools there is in the fight against opiate addiction sweeping the nation right now. Please for the sake of everyone please do not do this. It is simply a supplement and should need no more regulation than vitamins and other supplements.;","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17211","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matt Chandler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI am writing to share comments on the pivotal impact kratom has had on my life.  I have suffered depression to varying levels for over a decade and have rotated through several medications for the past six years, most recently taking the maximum dosage of bupropion (450mg/day), as well as therapy for the past three years.\n\nI heard about kratom from my aunt who had been taking it as an alternative medicine to manage ongoing pain after hip surgery as she found it lifted her mood as well.  Unfortunately neither my doctor and therapist were comfortable providing a recommendation on trying this as they were unfamiliar and there is limited information available, but I decided to try it as medication and therapy hadn't sufficiently enabled me to cope with my depression.\n\nI was shocked at how quickly kratom had an impact on my mood and overall wellbeing.  I became happier, more positive, and enjoyed life in a way I hadn't in years - and my family and friends noticed the difference immediately.  I started by taking 500mg in the morning and afternoon before finding 1000mg in the morning and afternoon was my ideal dosage.  After taking kratom for a month I was pleased to find no noticeable side effects, with the exception of returning to normal levels of depression on days where I didn't take it.\n\nI have since used kratom to reduce and eliminate my need to take buproprion, and I am very happy to be consuming a naturally occurring substance on an ongoing basis to manage my depression as apposed to a chemically engineered remedy.  I have also been able to cut down on therapy from a session every week to one every other week.\n\nFor those who don't suffer from depression it can be difficult to understand how debilitating it can be and also how liberating it can be to emerge from it.  Kratom has enabled me to come out from the shadows of it for the first time in years and has given me enjoyment of my life back in a way that medication had not.  \n\nI would hate to see kratom become illegal and needing to return to my previous medication.  Rather, I would like to see funding go towards kratom research to fully document and understand the benefits it has.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15158","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eugene (Bud) Fisher","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This plant has saved me from the monster I was","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7515","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Whitney dages","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi,\n\nI am a Tech Support Advisor for Apple Inc.

I am against the scheduling of kratom. My fianc, Matt (30, office worker), and I have been using kratom for about 3 years. He has been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety and I suffer from mild to moderate anxiety. Matt spent over 3 years trying different anxiety medicine, all of them he had to stop use for various reasons (interaction with depression medicine, bad side effects, inability to function normally, etc.). \n\nAfter trying all of those anxiety medicines, his psychiatrist prescribed Valium to use as needed. It really helped and without all of the above mentioned side effects! But a benzodiazepine can't be used for the kind of constant and intense anxiety that Matt suffers from. To use 'as needed' caused his tolerance go up and he was forced to increase how many he had to take in order to feel the same effects. As I am sure you can guess, Matt became addicted. This was obviously an unacceptable situation to us, and he decided to stop use. \n\nCompletely quitting Valium was a long and arduous journey, something neither of us ever want to go through again. As an alternative, we have tried a lot of natural remedies: mindfulness meditation, chamomile, curcumin, Passion flower, kava, etc. most of them work to a certain extent but nothing helps ease major anxiety like kratom.   Being able to use kratom to help ease the harshest feelings of anxiety and depression is something that I have been immensely thankful for. It has enabled us to be able to go out more, hike, feel capable of hanging out with our friends, exercise, and plainly, enjoy the present. It makes us feel normal. \n\nWe experience no negative repercussions and are able to easily stop use without any issues. More, we both have had stable doses and dosing schedules for more than 2 years! The reprieve from the constant low level (or higher) anxiety that he feels or the intermittent panic I do, is valuable and precious. We are both planning on going back to school and I know that being able to use kratom will greatly enhance how capable he and I feel. Scheduling kratom will noticeably reduce the quality of our lives and the lives of others like us for no discernible benefit.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18572","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rachel Reid","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a law abiding citizen with a clean record who uses Kratom on occasion in the same way I drink a cup of coffee.

Our son has always been a great student, and a great asset to society. When he was in high school, he became addicted to opiates. I noticed he became depressed, moody, and did not care about things in life like he used to. I saw a completely different kid. We got him help from a doctor. The doctor put him on Suboxone. I think that was the worst  thing in the world for my son. His symptoms were the same and he was dependent on the Suboxone. In my opinion, doctors need to loose their license for subscribing this drug to people. My son stopped the Suboxone on his own. He went through hell to get off of it. He was in college. He called me one day he got off of Suboxone himself. He told me about kratom. Since he has been using kratom he became the person he used to be. He did great in college and got his degree. He is now home and working. My son is sleeping well, eating a healthy diet, and works out at a gym. He works hard at his job and his boss compliments him every day for his great performance. Our son is happy again. He smiles a lot and cares deeply for us and other people. He is a great asset to society. In my opinion I think that if all the time and effort people are using to ban kratom were placed on getting the actual drugs being sold to people it would become a better world. So many people would be happier and healthier. It would be great if there was a program in place for people using kratom to help others to discover it. We would have a better society.

I've gone through all sorts of treatments, for both cases, through my Healthcare providers over the years and have thwarted by numerous side effects caused by the medications prescribed. \n\nI researched natural treatments, and tried everything that was immediately available to me. The best treatment I found was Kratom. Skeptical at first, I researched more and read people's personal experiences until I was convinced that kratom would be safe for me to take. Once I tried it, I couldn't be more amazed. My attention was honed, my pain was immeasurable, and my mood was lifted. There was nothing I could complain about!\n\nI never had a single bad reaction while taking kratom. Nothing to the degree that other, prescribed, medications had caused. The amount taken compared to other medications was a minimum amount - nothing to the degree of things like adderall or norco. The availability to the plant was a huge shock, a surprisingly pleasing one. I had found a natural alternative to things doctors prescribed to me. An alternative that was --by far-- less harmful and more effective. \n\nThe only thing that had been a close fix to my health problems, before find kratom, was Marijuana, so the fact that kratom was available nationally  (practically, compared to marinuana) and didn't have such a misinformed reputation, really appealed to me. Until I moved out of state and found that kratom was less available, put into the same category as synthetic cannibanoids, and eventually having the DEA attempt to ban it under the same --misinformed, denial-- class of drug. Heartbreaking, frustrating, hope killing, sad, and angry. All words that only slightly describe what the situation would be if the DEA were to ban, take away, this miraculous plant that has helped me so much since I discovered it.\n\nMarijuana is already illegal for being misunderstood. Kratom is now being threatened in the same way. Please, do not take my only option away. I refuse to be a guinea pig to the pharmaceutical industry as the continue to find things that don't work. I refuse to pay thousands of dollars to not have something available that works. Kratom is a life changing alternative to this industry, for me, and I'm sure millions of people can, do, and will benefit from it continuing to stay legal. Benefit being the key word, not potentially, it DOES help and it has; please let it continue to do so for another hundred plus years.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1282","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christipher Koonz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi.

Doctors had me taking Suboxone which started to take a toll on my liver. When my liver enzymes took a nose dive I quit. Two weeks of what can only be described as Prue hell followed! After two weeks I sought another route. I wasn't going back to my \"Doctor\" because when I quit Suboxone he said \"yea, see how that goes...you cannot stop this!\" This is coming from a guy who prescribed Xanax, morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone and the dreaded OXY, after people were hooked on this he said \"maybe you should try subprime?\" Drug dealer! Killer of livers! \nWhen I was done with Suboxone I was done with the \"medical\" field. Now I have a father whose a doctor and a mother who does everything holistic...as does my dad now too! I still go get bloodwork done and monitor my liver enzymes but the only RX I have is Armour for my thyroid. My liver took a bit to get under control but with Milk Thistle and KRATOM things turned around. I used Kratom daily for 2 years or so then started to just take it 2-3 times a week...try that with Actual Opiates! Impossible. I eat quite healthy. No fried foods (living in the south it's quite hard), mostly locally grown crops and meats. I'm far from a health nut but with three young boys I want to set a healthy lifestyle example. \nUnlike Opiates I've never taken too much Kratom and I can Easily skip days or weeks without withdrawal symptoms.  I can understand regulations against plants if processed and other things added, Prue leaves should be exempt. We are allowed to use caffeine, sugar, alcohol and tobacco along with other potentially dangerous substances. The above \"drugs\" are classified as legal?? How by this reasoning how could Kratom be illegal? As for me Kratom doesn't \"get me high\" but just gives me some energy and enthusiasm for life. My friends and family are all in agreement that Kratom is a good thing, not a bad one. Our government is the only body of people who think it's bad? Why? It's not medical evidence or sound reasoning. Kratom has been used for Millenia in other parts of the world and here in the US for decades. \nI just want to say if you're going to make something illegal THINK about the repercussions first please. However, let me be cynical and say \"maybe you like the police force, legal counsel, doctors and the like that profit from illegal drug use?\" \nPlease just think, it's simple Kratom is just a plant!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8474","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joe fulgham","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am only 44 but have had two back discectomies and laminectomies.

I am a student and a writer from Houston, Texas. I am in recovery almost two years now, after almost a decade spent battling an addiction to opiates. I tried everything to get clean, with very little progress. Doctors prescribed Suboxone and that only seemed to be switching out one drug for another, though I will say that it helped for a little while. Finally I made the decision to go to rehab and enter a sober living facility. It was around this time I discovered Kratom. Kratom is a benign plant, whose effects on reducing cravings and lessening the pain of withdrawal symptoms is second to none. Stronger drugs like Suboxone only seem to precipitate the addiction, while Kratom soothes the cravings and lessens the pain. I know so many people who have benefited from this plant. It wasn't easy...it was not the Kratom alone which saved them. It took a lot of hard work and attention to other aspects of their recovery, but when that effort was coupled with the effects of Kratom, the results were always positive. \n      It is not only recovering addicts who benefit from Kratom. There are many men and women who struggle with chronic pain and want to free themselves from the bondage of prescription pain medication. I beg of you to consider the many people whose lives have been saved by this drug. Our quality of life has risen to heights we had thought impossible before finding Kratom. To ban Kratom would be to sentence thousands to pain and relapse. Statistics have shown that overdose deaths have risen in state's immediately following the banning of Kratom. To do so on a national level would be a hideous abuse of power. The people look to you to protect us from dangerous drugs....please, focus on that colossal task, and allow this highly beneficial plant to remain legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8155","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Flakus","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Gerard Andrew Eberlein.

I cannot take marijuana which is safe and effective because you folks don't think a natural plant should be legal and available to everyone. Kratom is the only safe natural and highly effective option for my debilitating pain that does not sacrifice my health and wellbeing. Banning yet another harmless and effective plant not only is stripping our freedoms of choice but also our freedom to heal, cope and be well. Banning this plant would be a great step backward in the evolution of our country. Seeing that the legality of a ancient medicinal plant is a priority of law and enforcement sheds light to why our country is in shambles. Our focus is on the mundane. Let's forget about a plant that has been around forever and has helped many people which is harmless and let's REFOCUS on actual negative behavior like crime and terrorism. One day you or a loved one may be faced with debilitating pain and because you banned this safe effective plant you will watch yourself or a loved one slowly die from taking doctor prescribed pain killers. Not cool right? How does a harmless plant have a higher priority over terrorism/ISIS, hard drug importation, illegal immigration, crooked Hillary, or even someone blowing past a stop sign...yes that's right, blowing through that stop sign is more dangerous than Kratom plant. That car can kill someone by not stopping. As for Kratom all it can stop is pain and a bad attitude. It surely won't kill anyone. Are we worried about the safety and wellbeing of our citizens? Because it really doesn't appear that way. Prove us wrong and go bust the bad guys, lower the crime rate, get people off of heroin, remove the illegal immigrants, do anything else that actually benefits society rather than making another medicinal plant illegal. Kratom madness. Seriously, if a plant is a problem in your eyes, you may want to find a different job, because we have much greater problems than that. And isnt there a law that says if something was a supplement prior to a specific date it grandfathers said supplement into being a legal supplement? Pretty sure Kratom falls into that category, maybe brush up on the laws? Make America Great Again doesn't start by taking more choice and natural options away from the people. This isn't monopoly where only harmful options are available? Right? Or is it?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14356","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern,\n\nIt has come to my attention that there is a potential upcoming ban on the Kratom plant, in all forms, in the United States.

Because of this, I think many people classify Kratom in the same category as synthetics like bath salts and synthetic marijuana (which we all know is not the case).   I personally have been addicted to pain killers in the past and then switched to suboxone.  Suboxone allowed me to get my life back on track, but it is not the end all be all.

I can stop drinking my kratom tea, and I do not feel withdrawals at all even days after I have taken a break. This was surprising to me after researching that withdrawal was a drawback. And its shocking to me considering the therapeutic and continuous usage I consume after a while. I think the reports of toxicity of kratom had nothing to do with kratom, but had to do with whatever else these people were taking. Even if it was kratom toxicity, you would have to ingest an immense amount to be considered dangerous. But the same thing goes for anything else that's legal like coffee or alcohol. I seriously have had way worse experiences with coffee and alcohol. At least keep kratom legal, but regulate it by putting out quality control measures where insidious companies cannot add chemicals to this miracle plant. I am so confident that this herb does way more good than harm.

It has improved my life so much. I would hate to see it made unavailable, or to see the very promising research currently underway on it ended because it has been placed into Schedule 1. I am a 42 year old writer, and I have been taking kratom brewed as a tea, 2-4 times a day for about a year now to help moderate fibromyalgia and arthritis pain. I started taking it because no other pain control options worked for me any more. NSAIDs cause my gut to bleed, and Tylenol in the amounts I need to moderate the pain is liver toxic. My doctor had me on Tramadol because I am allergic to all other opioid medications, but after surgery in September of 2015 I developed an allergy to that medication as well, so I was left with no options. I heard of kratom and researched it thoroughly before I tried it, because I was scared of taking something that might be bad for me - but it has been nothing but beneficial. It never makes me feel doped up or dozy like Tramadol did, it does not hurt my stomach like Ibuprofen, and I have had a full metabolic panel done twice this past year and my liver and kidney numbers are perfect. Without kratom, the constant pain makes it hard for me to work and focus. The pain also makes me depressed and anxious. With kratom I can think clearly and work effectively.

I've been taking kratom well over a year now, primarily for my back pain. I have degenerative disk disease and a protruding disk. I used to be on pain meds, everything from Percocet to roxicodone to morphine to fentanyl. There's no light at the end of that tunnel, I've been there. The tolerance factor was insane, always needing more to achieve the same effect. The pain meds eventually got me in some legal trouble and I had to complete a strict supervised probation program to avoid criminal charges. So of course I wasn't allowed to take anything whatsoever, not even Tylenol PM, throughout this program. The first 8 months or so, I learned a lot, like what opiates actually do to you biochemically, and what a trap they were. They were pointless, they just make you a slave. So I really started to hate the things I once believed I couldn't live without. Now let's talk about the quality of life I had while being off of everything. It wasn't good. My back didn't bother me all day everyday like I thought it would without opiates. But when it did bother me, when I lifted something too heavy, when I slept wrong, when I sneezed too hard, whatever the reason, I would just have to deal with the pain and pretty much feel helpless, because there was nothing I could take for any kinda relief. And that was depressing, it made me worry about my future, like what was going to happen to me once I complete the program? Was I eventually going to get back on the pain meds I hate, out of desperation? Then I discovered kratom. The first time I tried it, I was amazed. It literally worked as good as the pain meds for my back. The longer I took it, the more I realized how much better it was than the pain meds, in every way. For one, I've been talking the exact same doses of kratom since the beginning. Never had to up the dose to get the same effect. In a years time of being on the opiates, my dose had already quadrupled. So the tolerance factor isn't a factor at all with kratom. Also, unlike with the opiates, I'm not out here spending every dime I make trying to buy up more and more kratom off the street, dipping into my rent money, having to deal with shady characters who may just want to rob me. I'm not a slave to the kratom, therefore I'm not out here doing dumb stuff to obtain it. Some people associate withdrawal symptoms with kratom, or lack of after prolonged use. I don't agree. I think people who have experienced withdrawals from opiates tend to associate withdrawals with anything they're suddenly cut off from. It's mostly mental in my opinion. I've felt minor discomforts from missing my next usual kratom dose, nothing nearly as bad as with opiates. If I end up staying the night somewhere instead of being back home as planned, and I didn't bring any kratom with me, it's really not that big of a deal. So I don't believe in kratom withdrawals. Just minor symptoms. If you quit smoking after years of being a smoker, and you experience some restlessness, you wouldn't call that withdrawals, it'd just be a symtom or effect caused by the change in what your body is used to. So I see no reason to ban kratom when it helps so many people with so many different things. I mean the fact that it can help people get off heroin/opiates alone should make it a godsend. Because there's kind of an epidemic going on out here. But the benefits don't stop there, it also helps anxiety, depression, pain, I've heard people benefit from it in so many ways. I know I have. So please let me continue down this road. I've been on the other ones, they're bumpy and they all go downhill into chaos. Kratom has been my miracle and given me my life back.

I am a 20 year old male. I have haemochromatosis, a genetic disorder, which causes me to absorb too much iron and causes painful tendon problems, skeletal pain, migraines, and problems with my organs (due to iron being stored in them). On top of this, I have issues with my P450 enzyme system in my liver. I am an under-methylator which means my body doesn't break down nutrients properly. I unfortunately was born with bad genes in this regard. I have tried pharmaceuticals to help with depressive symptoms and physical pain, all of which only made my symptoms worse. Even over the counter pain medications either do nothing for my pain or make it worse. I did find some relief from gabapentin (Neurontin) but it made me too tired to go about my day. I also developed a tolerance to it and it gave me very unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, to the point where I felt mentally unstable just hours after taking a dose. I found out about kratom after I heard it was being scheduled. I decided to try some while it was still legal just to see if it helped. I was hoping it would help my physical pain, but it has done much more that just to help manage pain. It gives me clean energy that I haven't ever felt before. I don't really have anything else to take to give me energy. Coffee/caffeine gives me migraines and visual disturbances. It makes me physically sick and it doesn't actually give me energy. It just makes me unable to sleep and causes me to feel extremely stressed out. I don't know if the iron overloaded from haemochromatosis causes this, or if my other genetic issues are to blame. It probably is a mixture of the two. I do know my liver and thyroid functioning is compromised to some degree, and not reacting well to \"normal\" substances- especially MSG (glutamate) and caffeine, has been a huge problem of mine starting around the time I hit puberty. \n\nSince taking kratom, I have had energy and my pain levels are down. I don't feel depressive brain fog that used to plague my day to day life. What still amazes me to this day is, kratom gives me no \"crash\" that other stimulants do. I take some in the morning and evening usually. I end up getting a great night's rest and wake up feeling refreshed. I was actually able to come completely off gabapentin with the help of kratom and I no longer have been taking gabapentin. My quality of life is the best it has been since I was a very young child. I am able to go on long runs without experiencing tendon pain in my ankles and legs, for example. Furthermore, I can say that using kratom responsibly has yielded less withdrawal symptoms- less addictive potential than the gabapentin had, and I was taking that as prescribed by my doctor. I have read the science behind kratom addiction. It takes a very large amount of kratom powder to stimulate the mu-opioid receptors in the brain (which are the ones involved in addiction to mitragynine, the main psychoactive alkaloid in kratom) and the amounts I am using simply isn't causing me the type of addiction I experienced on gabapentin.\n\nIf kratom is scheduled I do not know what I will do. What I do know is that my quality of life will decline; I will be in significant physical pain, and I ultimately will be faced with the decision to go back on pharmaceuticals that are either more addictive or are not metabolized by my liver correctly.\n\nThere are thousands of farmers around the world who rely on preparing kratom leaves and exporting them for work. Scheduling kratom would simply not be fair to them or to me, nor would it be fair to those on opioid narcotic pain medications much stronger than gabapentin, whose quality of life has been improved since taking kratom. \n\nIn reality, kratom is just a tea leaf. It can be taken as tea or taken as a supplement, just like many teas are. It isn't anywhere near as dangerous as the few people in positions of power seem to believe. If kratom is dangerous and needs to be scheduled, please also consider scheduling sugar, MSG, caffeine, alcohol, and NSAIDs such as Tylenol. They are all more dangerous than the kratom leaf.

The reason it has been used for so many years is because it has proven useful and beneficial. Hundreds of thousands of Americans including myself use Kratom for the wide variety of benefits the various strains offer. Substitute to coffee, supplement to relax etc. The reasons are endless; the benefits are obvious, that's why so many people use and have used it. With skyrocketing costs in healthcare, banning proven natural alternatives is perplexing to say the least. The United States was founded on rights for individuals, right to choose whats best for them; governments are not supposed to make decisions on behalf of Americans. As an American and a taxpayer I demand the DEA thoroughly research Kratom, perform real scientific analysis (third-party verification), consult various economists, healthcare analysts and statisticians, and then publically answer these questions before it considers any decisions:\n\n1) Is Kratom Dangerous? - Statistically it appears to be safer than just about anything; 'caffeine' is statistically more dangerous. The DEA needs to put together some real, fact-checked statistical material comparing actual dangerous substances to Kratom. The DEA also needs to work to find logical models on how to measure how dangerous a substance is. Finally, the DEA studies need to be reviewed by leading scholars at major universities in all fields.\n\n2) Will banning Kratom actually stop use?  The US Government has banned many substances and people continue to use all illegal drugs; prohibition has always been a monumental failure. \n\n3) Cost- Benefit - Will the cost of increased enforcement outweigh the benefits of banning it? If number one and two above are false, this is an obvious answer.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21062","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to ask to keep kratom legal.

They have tried otc medications, prescribed narcotics, surgery, and anti inflammatory injections, not to mention numerous x-rays and MRI appointments. I have spent countless thousands on my chronic back to have very little success.\n\nThree years ago a friend mentioned this drug Kratom and it's potential effects. I was highly skeptical of a plant based medicine having any ability to take care of my chronic back pain. Though the first time I had taken it, that was also the first time in 7 or so years that I did feel pain in my back. It was an incredible and indescribable experience, knowing that there was a substance, that was safe and affordable that could treat the enormous amount of pain that at times made me essentially bed-ridden.\n\nSince then, I have taken Kratom 2-3 times a day, generally once in the morning, and then once when I get home from work/school. I basically take it as if it was prescribed to me and have regulate the size and time of when I take Kratom to most effectively take care of this back pain. It works, and there are no negative side effects from taking Kratom for YEARS.\n\nThe DEA is overstepping it's bounds in attempting to remedy \"this public safety concern\" to classify this drug as a Class 1 substance, which would indicate that it has no beneficial properties to it, which is factually inaccurate. If the DEA wishes to work for the pharmaceutical companies rather than the people, which this particular case makes it quite clear that the DEA is doing just that... then I suppose all of these comments and videos and protests in this regard will be in vain.\n\nThe only reason to Classify this as a Class 1 drug, is to eliminate any future or ongoing research on this drug that consistently indicate a wide variety of benefits this drug has to offer, and very minimal threats to health of those that take it for any reason, for chronic pain to recreational use, to the benefit of pharmaceutical companies so they can continue to sell highly addictive and dangerous opiate based drugs.\n\nThis is a dangerous policy and you can ensure that deaths will go up related to heroin overdoses, for individuals that take this to get off such substances, and people like me who will no longer have access to a properly legal substance (Kratom) that only needs some degree of oversight and regulation at best and not a class 1-3 classification which is clearly absurd and without any logical or coherent reasoning.\n\nAbsolute joke of the worst kind.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22714","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Zoller","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"A close friend of mine used kratom as an alternative to opiate medication to manage fibromyalgia. She swore by it and never experienced negative side effects. Currently there is a dearth of research into the use of kratom; it is a very mild buzz-like feeling and does not incapacitate like copious amounts of marijuana or opiates would. It would be nothing short of irresponsible to place something with so much potential and so little research into Schedule I, severely restricting future access to those who rely on it for pain management now -- and, of course, to research institutions. The medical community has been looking for alternatives to opiates for long-term pain management for decades now. Don't completely ban kratom over less deaths than are caused by relatively \"harmless\" OTC drugs such as acetaminophen, especially when almost all of the deaths can be directly linked to using other mind-altering substances at the same time. Also, your report was extremely misleading in numbers; only 7 percent of the calls to poison-control centers that involved kratom were deemed 'life threatening.' It is a reasonable conclusion that kratom can be dangerous when mixed with certain substances or in isolated cases. But one could say the same of alcohol and benzodiazepine, or coffee and stimulants, or one of a million combinations of readily accessible substances through legal channels in the US. The kratom report was premature and overreaching. Perhaps publish warnings about some of the negative effects of kratom and perform more research on a drug that has been used for years, almost completely safely, before banning it from the population completely.

For those of us who use this dietary supplement, it has helped us to be able to function in our lives. Speaking for myself, before I found kratom, my anxiety was so high that sometimes I could not even leave the house. With Kratom, I am able to work, be with my family and have a greater quality of life. For many, Kratom has saved their lives by helping them to get off lethal drugs such as heroin and other opiates, which kill millions of people per year. \n\nThere have been reports of people having to go to the emergency room after taking Kratom, but if you research these cases, you will find that they were taking other drugs along with it. Kratom is benign. If you take too much, it might make you tired or sick to your stomach,  but that is all. \n\nThere are many very beneficial dietary supplements available today, and Kratom is one of them. Please don't make this a schedule 1 drug. The majority of us, myself included, do not use it recreationally. It is our life saver, helping us to function in our daily lives.

When declaring a drug an imminent hazard to the health and well being of the american people you are bypassing the democratic process and declaring a substance so dangerous that the people who actually have experience with the substance should not have a real say in it's consequences on society. Kratom (mitragyna speciosa) has been used for many years by the american people and there are only 14 (questionable) recorded cases where it MIGHT have played a role in the death of an individual. The only data the American government has used to claim that kratom is dangerous has been archaic and from a region plagued with propaganda against kratom. This region is currently reforming their position on kratom and it is clear that this plant is not  the threat some once thought it was. Kratom has been portrayed as a 'legal high' when in reality its psychoactive effects are no more debilitating than the effects of coffee. The American government allows those 18 and older to consume nicotine. Nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs in existence and the threat of kratom addiction is minuscule in comparison to nicotine's torturous withdrawals. The DEA attempting to ban this substance will increase the usage of and deaths relating to both prescription and illicit opiate drugs. Allowing people to use kratom is not an endorsement of it as a substance. Mandate warnings and age restrictions be put on kratom products. This will absolve the government of any responsibility.

This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose. \n\nI have been dealing with depression and anxiety for years now. Three years ago, things became a lot worse after I lost my grandmother. I had a lot of guilt inside me after she past. I would go days being in the worst mood for no particular reason. My anxiety would get so bad that I could not willingly be around anyone. I would not talk to any of my friends or family. I would avoid the people in my every day life day in and day out. I had no will to live. There are many personal issues that lead to this I believe, but I never addressed it. I always put it off to the side and convinced myself that I did not have problems going on in my head. It was no way to live. When you have anxiety and depression, your way of life seems unbearable. I began to abuse prescription pain killers to deal with my issues but after months and months of living through hell dealing with my new addiction. \n\nI began to do my own research on natural substances that will have the same medicinal properties. I even tried to speak to close family members or friends about how I was feeling and nothing worked. I learned that just letting things out and having therapy sessions did not fix anything. So I knew I had something more serious then I thought. \n\nI then came to Kratom and tried it for the first time and it was everything I needed. I now live happily every day. My days are not grueling and unbearable anymore. I am able to spend time with family and friends. Kratom has changed my life completely. I have more clean energy to my days. I have spent over 4 years dealing with my depression and anxiety. I now have a will to live every day to the fullest. Best of all, I am completely off prescription medications and have no need or urge to take any more. Kratom and it's many beneficial properties has gotten my life back together and prevented me from going down many wrong paths in life. I now have been using Kratom daily for 9 months and it has been one of the best years I have had in a very long time! \n\nKratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. I fear this action will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic, maybe even my own.

I am opposed to the listing of Kratom for the following reasons:\n\n  I have fibromyalgia, osteo arthritis and spinal stenosis.  As time goes by I find myself in increased pain, which curtails many normal activities, especially walking and standing.  So far, the only relief I get for this pain are opiods, which due to safety regs (which I largely support) have required me to drive to my physician's office to pick up refill scripts (after calling the office and requesting the refill at least 3 days in advance).  I find this very onerous since it requires a 20 mile round trip, a lengthy walk from the handicapped parking to the building and through a good portion of the building to reach the office, and then a trip to the pharmacy, and another long walk from parking and through t he store to the back pharmacy area.  I had not heard of Kratom previously, and would like to try it since reports are that it works well with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain, is not addictive and is safe and has little side effects.  If you control it, I will be in the same runaround to the dr's.to obtain it, if it is available at all.\n\n  There really should be some provision in the new regulations to cover seniors and other handicapped people to obtain their painkillers simpler, especially when they have a long history with the provider and pharmacy, and do not abuse their drugs. It's like we're penalized twice for needing to be able to operate at our peak, limited, abilities!  Hopefully soon, my dr's office will have the required secured line to the pharmacy, so this will be easier on me, but this has been going on for 3 yrs. now, and it's a hardship.  I refuse to change the provider I have used for the past 25+ yrs.  I feel that would be an added imposition on me.\n\nFurther reasons for my opposition are:\n\n    If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\n\n    Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.  It will also, in all probability, allow yet another herbal medicine to become patented by as a drug by some pharmaceutical company and cost a small fortune to pay for it!  I'd rather take it as an herbal than some chemicalized derivative which may lose any other benefit of the natural herb.\n\n    Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it. Kratom should be legally regulated, allowing for quality control measures and product labeling requirements.\n\n    Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nThank you again for the opportunity to comment.\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2820","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Betty J.

Marijuana was a good alternative for a while but since I have young kids in my home I didn't want to keep it around and chance one of their friend or themselves finding it. Kratom is simple to keep out of reach of children and I feel if a young child was to stumble across Kratom and use it, the consequences would be less severe than marijuana. Seeing how there are no psychoactive products in Kratom there is less mystique to it than marijuana and less \"cool\"Factor.  I feel like the product should be studied and test before and major decisions are made on a plant that can real help many people with pain.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17019","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe that this substance deserves a substantial amount of research before it's classified as a schedule one drug.

Due to my addiction ive spent time in hospitals and been incarcerated in several institutions. On December 16th of this year i will celebrate my 2nd year of sobriety. During these 2 yrs i have managed to get off probation, get my drivers license back after 6 years. I have maintained a full time job and have earned back the trust of my friends and family. Today i can confidently and honestly say that im a law abiding and productive member of society. This may not impress some of you but if you only knew the person i once was, you would know this is nothing short of a miracle. Ive tried conventional methods such as methadone and suboxone to no avail. I do not contribute my entire success to kratom but it has definitely played and continues to play an intrical part in my recovery and my new and productive life. Pharmaceutical companies have enough money. Please dont allow them to take this from us. If you or anyone you know struggles with addiction or just the monotony of everyday life, try it yourself. You will see that its a good thing and one of Gods perfectly engineered gifts to humanity.

I am a 67 yr. old retired college educator and administrator of 20 years. I suffer from Fibromyalgia,Chronic Fatigue,PTSD,Migraines,arthritis, a broken back, Degenerative Disc Disease in my neck, Anxiety and Depression. I am a responsible adult consumer of Kratom to help with the above issues. \nI started using Kratom 2yrs. ago after much research and being bedridden with pain and depression for 15yrs. I lost my income, my friends, many family members and almost my child because of my debilitating issues. I lost my total support system. I have been through a plethora of muscle relaxers,opiates and antidepressants whose side effects only aggravated the situation over time. I found a milder alternative in Kratom, an organic plant related to the coffee tree. It has enabled me to get out of bed and finally start to become a more active member of my family and society in general. It has even given me the strength and clarity to stop smoking after 30 yrs. It mildly relieves my pain and gives a gentle sense of well being without the harsh side effects of past pharmaceuticals. For that, I am very greatful. \nIn conclusion if Kratom is placed on the schedule 1 list it will not only be banned but will stop any further research from being done. This plant is not a drug but an herb. I know of no one who abuses kratom to get high. We use it not abuse it. My life has completely turned around in a positive manner with the possibility of future employment to pull me out of poverty  and future activity with my grandchildren. Finally I find the need to say that this country has an opiate problem because this country has PAIN PROBLEM.  I am not a criminal.

I was a pill adict for a long tr. I have been on Suboxone for a few years now and can attribute my sobriety to Suboxone, therapy and family support. I am a successful business person with an amazing family. I would consider myself upper middle class. Opiates don't discriminate.  If you are susceptible to the drug is all that matters. I can tell you that alcohol does nothing for me. But, opiates were a love at first site. For some people it is the other way around. I hear people say that pills make them sleepy and they don't like them.  I envy those people. Pills make me feel alive and confident. The human chemicals make up is different for everyone. When your chemical makeup is susceptible to a drug taking you over it is a scary thing. I am lucky though because I have insurance and can afford years of Suboxone therapy. I would imagine most addicts cannot afford it. \n\nI have never taken Kratom. So I don't know the affects. What I can tell you is what it means to be an addict. It is incredibly difficult. If Kratom can help people from and opoid dependacne then you owe the American people the opportunity for it to best tested. \n\nDon't be one of those people who look down on addicts until it hits close to home. Please listen to people who have been through either personally or through someone close to them. Don't let people with no addiction experience tell you what to do or what it is like. \n\nMy family has asked what withdrawals are like. It is impossible to explain that kind of misery. There is a reason people will lose everything to stay on drugs. If I can become an addict then anyone can. Anyone who has the chemical make up is at such risk. \n\nThe last thing I want to talk about is my experience with Suboxone. Some would say that is went from one drug to another. Or that there is no reason for me to have been on it for years. Brig on Suboxone for years has allowed me to change my life.  It took one year on Suboxone before I deleted my dealers phone number. It took that look to break relationships that connected me to drugs. Suboxone allowed me time to start a new life. My new life now has no connections to drugs so the temptation of a relapse is much lower.  In the first quarter of 2017 I will be completely off Suboxone. .....what if Kratom can do the same for people who can't afford Suboxone?  \n\nWe owe it to the 1 in 7 Americans affected in some way my addiction to keep Kratom off a schedule 1 substance so it can be tested.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10647","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Stander","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thanks for taking the time to listen to people like myself that have nothing but positive things to say about kratom.  \nKratom saved me from a life of prescription drugs.

Last year, I nearly died. My doctors never figured out for sure what was going on, although most likely I have Chron's disease. Every time I ate, I would quickly suffer debilitating pain. I ate as much as I could, but I began losing weight. My doctors did tests, looked as much as they could within the confines of my insurance coverage, and tried to treat my symptoms. They were entirely unsuccessful. Eventually, I lost so much weight (roughly 25% of my body mass in three months) that my immune system began to shut down. I was getting infection after infection and antibiotics were ineffective in treating them, because antibiotics work WITH your immune system, and mine was wiped out because I couldn't eat. My doctors and I agreed that opioid pain medications were the wrong way to treat my pain; they may be effective for a time, but in the long run they tend to worsen pain associated with inflammatory bowel problems. Nevertheless, I needed pain management sufficient to at least stop the weight loss so that my immune system could recuperate. That's where kratom enters my story -- it's non addictive. It doesn't cause narcotic gut. It doesn't suppress respiration the way that opioids do, so while a person can take too much and cause themselves some discomfort, the overdose isn't dangerous. They don't die. Kratom made it possible for me to eat modest amounts of food until my symptoms disappeared. It did not make my pain disappear, but it managed it. I could eat. I could take care of my children. I could shower. I got some small measure of comfort and dignity back, and it allowed me to be functional again. I took it regularly for a few months until my body healed, and then I stopped. When I stopped, I didn't have to wean myself off of it; I just didn't take it anymore. I didn't have withdrawal. Kratom saved my life, and it let me manage my pain without danger of overdose or addiction. During the course of my illness, I sought support where I could and I met countless people who rely on kratom. It helped them with anxiety, with depression, and with pain. It allowed some of them to stop taking dangerous opioid medications -- the same ones that cause thousands of deaths in America every year. Numerous universities and scientific journals have begun studying kratom, and found it to be incredibly promising. Taking kratom away from people won't save lives, it will cost them. If the government wants to impose some regulations so that people can know just what they are buying when we buy kratom, I think you would find little opposition to that idea. Knowing we're buying kratom instead of grass cuttings would be great. But equating it to heroin because someone might sell us grass cuttings instead of our life-saving medication is NOT a reasonable response to that concern. Please don't take away my access to kratom. I'm symptom free right now; I can eat. But my other episodes came on without warning, and I don't have a way to safely protect myself without this. My kids need their mom. Their mom needs kratom.

I am a manufacturing technician by profession, but have spent the past five years as a caregiver for my elderly parents.\n\nI have recently learned that the DEA is considering putting some of the constituent components of kratom on the schedule one list of prohibited controlled substances. I was shocked and disappointed to hear this because kratom is and always has been a very beneficial dietary supplement and not a drug. I implore you to reconsider scheduling kratom in such a way as the benefits of this herbal supplement far outweigh any perceived negative aspects of what has long been considered a very safe and effective solution to a plethora of health needs.\n\nI first began using kratom two years ago after spending years taking ativan  for anxiety and various painkillers to treat chronic back pain. I was never happy having to rely heavily on pharmaceutical products when a natural alternative proved itself to be as effective or more so for my needs. Kratom in fact proved quite effective in treating my anxiety and was even more useful for treating my chronic pain. In fact, thanks to kratom I have stopped using all but an occasional aspirin for pain and I have discontinued the use of prescription anti-anxiety medication entirely. In addition, kratom doesn't cause withdrawal symptoms if its use is discontinued as ativan often does, so I am not required to stay on a medication if I don't currently need it just to avoid the unpleasantness of withdrawal.\n\nI implore you to reconsider putting kratom on the schedule one list of controlled substances because I - and many others like me - am now free from prescription medications thanks to this herb. It has been a wonderful and natural alternative for assisting with my anxiety and pain-control needs and I would very much like to see it remain available for all who rely on it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16288","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Doug Brown","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly believe kratom should be kept legal.

If something as strong and dangerous as alcohol can be legal surely there is room in our society for a natural herb with benefits like these. Please reconsider banning the active ingredients in this plant. It is safe and effective and we need to learn more about this new discovery so we can help people in need.

There is no threat to public safety from a plant. If that is the reasoning behind the proposed rescheduling then you might as well ban all plants that are poisonous found in nature such as poisonous berries and poisonous mushrooms. All plants should remain legal. If there is a real concern for legal substances that pose a threat to public safety then alcohol should be banned. Alcohol is a poison to the body and causes immediate damage to the liver after one or more drinks. There is almost no safe amount of alcohol, yet it remains legal and I strongly argue that adults should be able to make their own educated decision about how much they wish to harm their bodies with legal substances. With that being said, kratom is NOT a poison, does not kill people like alcohol, and does not lead people to the hospital to get their stomach's pumped like drinking too much alcohol. Kratom is a safe alternative to overly prescribed dangerous narcotic pain medication that so many doctors are unknowingly responsible for creating new drug addicts each day that are unaware of how easy it is for them to overdose themselves on their legally prescribed drugs. KEEP KRATOM LEGAL! IF THIS AGENCY CARES ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC THEN YOU MUST CONSIDER HOW MANY PRESCRIPTION AND HEROIN FATAL OVERDOSES WILL BE AVOIDED DUE TO THE CONTINUED SAFE AND LEGAL ACCESS TO KRATOM.

Very little is known in the medical community about TMJ, and most doctors I see (to this day) just try to push Vicodin, Percocet, muscle relaxers, and other harmful pharmaceuticals on my to \"fix\" the problem. I have always refused these medications as I feel they are addicting, damaging, and make it even harder for me to function during the workday (chiropractic care and physical therapy seems to irritate my jaw and make the pain even worse, and TMJ surgery has a 15%-20% success rate, at best).\n\nLuckily, 6 years ago, I discovered Kratom while looking for natural alternatives to pain medicine. .

It allows me to reach my full potential naturally and without harmful pharmaceuticals. \n\nThe DEA is now trying to ban the use of this plant by the end of September 2016 with virtually little to no research or data behind this decision, leaving millions of tax paying, law abiding citizens in dark about what to do once our lifesaver is taken away forever, or even worse, hitting the \"black market\".

It is the only over-the-counter medicine that works on the problem. I can either take 1200mg of ibuprophen every 4 hours (I am 5'0\", and 128lbs.), or 1/4tsp. of kratom every 4 hours. My dose is extremely low, and the effects are minimal, but the pain is gone, and I am awake and alert enough to go about business as usual. I don't even have to use it every month!\n\nKratom has been a game changer for me during my menstrual cycle. It kicks in fast, and lasts a long time. I know I can rely on it. Ibuprophen doesn't always work for me, and it is extremely inconvenient when the pain comes on too fast and I have to leave work. Kratom has really changed my life and made me much more able to function during the first few days of my period.\n\nI am one of many people that use this herb as a medicine. I do not abuse kratom, and I only use it 3 days per month at the most. I am extremely sensitive to opioid agonists and I have made sure that my doctors know not to give me any because they make me extremely nauseous. I usually vomit up the pills before they have a chance to work on the pain. Not so with Kratom! I'm not sure what it is about the herb, but I don't react negatively to a low dose. (The lowest dose of Vicodin comes back up again within 45 minutes.)\n\nI think that this herb should remain unregulated and available to the public. I worked in an herb shop that sold it, and I have seen at least 20 people kick dangerous opiate addictions with this herb and never go back to this day. Not to mention the positive effects it has had on the lives of other customers with chronic pain. That proves the worth of this herb alone as far as I'm concerned. It absolutely has a medical use, both as a powerful, safe pain reliever, and as a treatment for opiate addiction.\n\nI have seen this herb change lives for the best, and I urge you to keep kratom unscheduled and available to the people who need it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21309","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kimberly Piet","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 51-year-old wife, mother of three grown boys and an LPN.

I am writing to tell you about someone very close to me who does.  \n\nMy mom is the best person I know.  The kind of person who would give her last dollar to someone in need.  She has suffered from severe chronic pain for the last decade of her life.  The opiates that were prescribed to her in the past to manage her pain came with a host of undesirable side effects, such as withdrawal, brain fog, and memory loss.  Even though she always took the opiates as prescribed, her body became dependent on them, and she would become very ill if she didn't take them.  She would often spend week after week in her room, unable to get up due to crippling pain.  She was alive and breathing, but she was not living. \n\nThis changed after my mom found Kratom.  Kratom eased her pain without the negative side effects of opiates.  Kratom does not take her pain away entirely, but it does help.  She has more energy now, is able to get out of bed more, and doesn't forget what she is talking about mid-sentence anymore.  We played a game of charades last night, and laughed until we cried.  I am tearing up as I write this.  Please don't take this from us.\n\nI know you do a lot to protect us from dangerous substances, and I really appreciate that.  However, I truly believe Kratom is not something we need protection from.  It has breathed life into our family.  I have heard that kratom has killed 14 people, but upon further research, I've discovered that these people also had dangerous drugs in their system when they died.  To put that into perspective, NSAIDs (such as Aspirin and Ibuprofen) are linked to over 16,000 deaths each year.  Also, more people are hospitalized each year due to ingestion of tide pods than Kratom.\n\nPlease think about my family when you make your decision, and all the other families out there that will be negatively affected by banning Kratom.  Thank you.   \n\nSincerely,\nA girl who is glad to have her momma back.

Most of this abuse involves legal drugs prescribed for pain relief.  We need pain relief alternatives without all the addictive and detrimental effects of opiates.  Fortunately, two of these exist and are in widespread use: cannabis and kratom.  Both of these herbal remedies have been shown to bring effective and non-addictive pain relief with substantially fewer detrimental effects than legal opiates.  Cannabis has historically been strictly controlled, but more than half of the states (after this election) have seen the wisdom of legalizing it for medical use.  Kratom should also be considered in this light; not in an outdated prohibitionist vaccuum, but in context as an important harm-reducing medical tool.  Banning Kratom would take away that tool, perversely working against the DEA's goals by increasing the prevalence of drug addiction.\n\n[1] https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/testimony-to-congress/2016/americas-addiction-to-opioids-heroin-prescription-drug-abuse","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10071","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joel Thibault","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To all it may concern,\n When I was first prescribed vicodin for pain after a broken wrist over ten years ago I didn't know anything about opiates. I was only taking what the dr. had ordered at first..Of course the vicodin took the pain away when I was taking the 2 every 4-6 hours as prescribed, but, I quickly realized how much better I felt when I doubled or even tripled the recommended dosage...Fast forward to five years later and I was a full blown pain pill addict who would order tramadol online when I could not get any vicodin. the tramadol was enough to cover the need for vicodin,but once again, I was totally hooked on another pain pill. After abusing tramadol for about a year I had a seizure and fainted. I ended up with a fractured skull and a loss of both my taste and smell indefinatly. But of course that didn't stop me. I was prescribed Percocet I.R 30mg pills for the headaches due to the skull fracture that almost killed me, and from there I was on a downward spiral to heroin addiction and pain pills! One fateful day, my heroin dealer was out of my beloved heroin and suggested methadone for the withdrawls..of course I took the methadone and while it was helpful, I was finally starting to realize that I was going to never be free of the vicious cycle of opiates. While researching online one day, I came across an article about Kratom. and after further research I decided to give it a try. That was over a year ago. Since that time, I have been opiate free and alcohol free! I can't begin to express how helpful this plant has been in regards to my dependence on opiates and on alcohol. I can finally go outside without worrying that I would nod off in front of people, and I don't have to make up reasons to my daughter why we need to go to certain friends houses for silly reasons so that I could score. I can go to work again, I can be productive in my child's life again, and I can be a good wife to my husband again. The fear that I think a lot of us addicts have is that if you take away the Kratom, you take away our hope! Most of us, but not all, are recovering addicts, and Kratom,so far, has been the only thing that has helped to keep the cravings for opiates away and remind us that there is life beyond heroin and pharmaceuticals. I'm 37 years old now...if I had not found Kratom, I doubt I would have seen my last birthday. Please take my story into serious consideration.

I have had 11 months of physical therapy, and have been in pain management ever since. I have subsequently developed severe osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia,  which my doctor feels is an autonomic nerve system dysfunction. I not only have chronic pain but anxiety (due to the fight or flight mechanism being faulty with fibro), high blood pressure,  insomnia,  and several other related symptoms. I have also developed problems with my pelvis and have chronic bilateral bursitis. \n\nA friend with similar issues introduced me to kratom, she is a proponent for natural herbal therapies. \n\nI started taking kratom about 3 years ago (2013/2014) and it is helping me take less of my prescribed opiate medications.  The thing I love most about kratom is that there is no euphoria and there are no side effects. I take the powdered form, 1 tsp every 6-8 hours. While it doesn't resolve a very acute pain issue,  such as a \"flare up\" injury  or a fibro episode,  it absolutely reduces the level of pain but more specifically it helps with my mood and energy levels.  Prior to taking kratom the fatigue I experienced was severely limiting my activities of daily living. This was a great challenge taking care of a house, a husband, 2 teenage boys, and my pets. Kratom has dramatically changed my life in this way- i am able to perform most of my home maker duties quite easily now because of kratom. I even told my doctor about it and he is going to research this amazing plant.\n\nPlease don't take this herb away from us. I simply can't imagine going back to the life I had before kratom,  where I had some weeks I could barely get myself out of bed. Days when I would take double my amount of pain medicine and have NO relief.

If you guys were serious about public safety, you would enforce marijuana laws and ban Ibuprofen, both of which are responsible for thousands of deaths each year in the United States alone. \n\nAfter an exhaustive search of Pubmed and the NPDS, I was only able to locate one documented death where Kratom was the only substance found on a toxicology report, and this only provides a casual, not a causal relationship to the substance in question. In other words, the patient may have had Brugada's Syndrome or some other independent risk factor for death. \n\nThis is nothing more than intrusive big government attempting to protect the pharmaceutical industry, not a serious concern for public safety. Hopefully, with the new administration we can have some semblance of the truth restored to government regardless of their position on banning any substance. Such draconian measures should only arise when there is a legitimate concern for public safety which most certainly does not exist here.

He is a father, husband and sole bread-winner of the family. This is in response to the DEA's intention to make Kratom a Schedule I substance. It includes a great amount of information on what Kratom is and the what will happen if the DEA goes through with the emergency scheduling.\n\nThanks,\n\nDear DEA,\n \nPlease remove Mitragynine & 7-hydroxymitragynine which is in Kratom from becoming a Schedule I substance.\n \nI am 29 and suffer from a herniated disc, chronic neck pain, TMJ, arthritis in my neck. I support a family of four on a single income. I have been to many doctors with little success for treatment. I have found that Kratom improves my quality of life by being able to work. If I didn't have this herb I would be on disability from pain. It isnt comparable to any drugs, marijuana, alcohol or other stimulants.  Kratom helps to improve my quality of life that I suffer with chronic pain. Please dont make this herb illegal. Cervical injections, botox injections, chiropractic care, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, yoga exercises have not helped with my pain.\n \nKratom is a well-known, well-researched herbal substance drawn from the leaves of trees within the coffee family. The number of cases of documented harm from kratom use is remarkably low, both as an absolute matter and when considered against the extensive history of use of kratom, both inside and outside the United States\n \nMitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are two of the primary alkaloids of this plant. These two compounds are not synthetic and should not be lumped together with  \"bath salts\" or \"spice\".\n \nKratom has been used as a medicine by many people for thousands of years. It is a potent remedy for physical pain, anxiety and depression, and could be used to aid with opiate withdrawal by those who would like to quit using illicit drugs such as heroin. Kratom is NOT a hallucinogen and should not be classified as such. Adding mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as a Schedule I substance is rash and unjustified prohibition, resulting in a foreseeable increase in street drug-related crime, as well as a punishment to those who are currently using it responsibly to treat various ailments.\n\nThe reason that there are no deaths solely attributed to Kratom is because Kratom does not affect your respiratory capacity. It does not slow down your central nervous system. It's potential to do harm is virtually impossible.\n\nKratom has very limited recreational capacity.  The White House petition has over 100,000 signatures for the \"Please do not make Kratom a Schedule I Substance.\" \n\nThe federal government has invested significant resources to develop alternative pain management strategies. This includes a study funded by the National Institutes of Health in partnership with the University of Massachusetts and the University of Mississippi to investigate the use of Kratom as a remedy for opioid withdrawal. This study led the researchers to apply for a patent identifying the Kratom extract, mitragyinine, as a useful treatment for other addictive drugs besides opiate derivatives. The DEAs decision to place Kratom as a Schedule I substance will put a halt on federally funded research and innovation surrounding the treatment of individuals suffering from opioid and other addictionsa significant public health threat.

I first used Kratom for relief of chronic pain about a year ago.   I was able to relieve pain without restrictions of declined mental function that comes with opiate pain medications.  Fibromyalgia pain has interfered with activities with my children and husband, and made helping to provide for my family more challenging.  With Kratom I am able to participate in family activities fully.  Kratom also helps with fatigue that leaves me constantly feeling depleted of energy.  I can relax and relieve some of the pain experienced after a long shift at work.  \nEven with consistent use, I have no cravings or urges to take Kratom when I am not taking it.  I don't need it every day.  I only take Kratom when I need it for relief of pain and fatigue.  \n\nPlease allow research on this plant and it's effects.

It is greatly concerning that what would appear to be a hasty decision is apparently based on a paucity of data coming from a small number of poison control reports (relative to the high number of cases reported) for which confounding sources of variability (particularly, concomitant use of other substances) render it meaningless for making causal attributions between these compounds found in kratom and adverse events.  Given such lack of scientific merit or basis upon which such a proposed extreme action is being based as well as a much larger preponderance of evidence that suggests the therapeutic potential that these compounds have for an array of medical and behavioral problems, it is astonishing and concerning that the DEA is even considering assigning a Schedule 1 classification on them and thus making it impossible for research and development to be conducted on these two compounds  as well as all the other alkaloids found in kratom.  This becomes more ironic, given that the U.S. has by far the highest per capita rate of prescribing rate for prescription opioids and correspondingly (and not surprisingly) a high rate of opioid addiction and multiple testimonies of how kratom has served as a pharmacological adjunct that has helped many opioid addicts from becoming free.  As you know, many others have also reported these compounds have helped manage a wide array of pain conditions without the use or reliance on prescription opioids.  As a clinical psychologist with over 30 years of experience as a director of VA substance abuse treatment programs, chemical dependence researcher, and academician, I am quite concerned with this proposed action by the DEA.  DEAs proposed Schedule 1 action on mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine to address a putative imminent hazard to the public safety is clearly not supported by the current data.  These kind of scientific assertions would not pass peer review for publication in a scientific journal.  And the DEA wants to make a public health decision based on this?  What seems more plausible is that there is influence and involvement from big pharma over fiduciary and not public health concerns.\nThe U.S. has become a laughing stock in so many ways.  We have by far, the highest per capita cost for healthcare, yet our quality of healthcare is shamefully inferior  even compared to some Third World countries. Our public policies for addressing our high rates of addiction continue to focus predominantly on criminal justice rather than supporting and promulgating evidence-based research.  And now, at the same time that the Surgeon Generals Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health has just been published, emphasizing prescription opioid addiction (but NO mention of mitragynine or 7-hydroxymitragynine), the DEA is pursuing the Schedule 1 classification of two compounds that have many reports and testimonials of rational use and therapeutic potential.  As a citizen, psychologist, addictions researcher, and taxpayer, I am quite irritated and dismayed by this proposed action.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20226","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a healthy adult  who works full time and I also volunteer as a firefighter/EMT at my local fire department. I have never used heroin, but I have seen first hand what it does. I have been using kratom for over 3 years now. I use Kratom regularly to help manage pain during \"that time of the month\". I use it before working out to give me a little extra energy.  It also helps with anxiety and depression. I would much rather use a natural botanical to manage this rather than prescription drugs, which are addictive.  I have not had any negative side effects, and it is impossible to overdose. If you take too much, you get a headache and nausea (similar to alcohol).  Kratom also does not make me \"high\", it does not disrupt normal function, in fact, it enhances my concentration and energy.  \n\n I heard of this botanical from a friend who happened to be using it to ease the effects of opiate withdrawal. (At the time I did not know that is why he was using it, as we became close friends, he opened up to me). It seemed to really help him and also prevent him from using whatever pills he could get his hands on.   \n\nI have responded to calls of heroin and other opiate overdoses. I have administered narcan on these patients and witnessed them angry that they are no longer \"high\". I feel that if they had access to kratom, they would not be resorting to using heroin. And if they want to get off heroin, this is a much safer way to do it. \n\nThere are worse things out there for people to consume, like alcohol which is legal. Excessive alcohol use led to approximately 88,000 deaths and 2.5 million years of potential life lost (YPLL) each year in the United States from 2006  2010, shortening the lives of those who died by an average of 30 years.\n\nPlease keep Kratom legal. The people that are using it, are using it responsibly and not using it to \"get high\". The kratom tree is a cousin to the coffee tree. Please do more research and discover the good Kratom can bring to the world. There are worse things out there that are legal and some people, will resort to whatever they can \"find on the street\" if they cannot use Kratom anymore. I do not want to see that happen.

I have struggled with Lupus and Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome, both autoimmune conditions, for the past five years. I have had trouble with pain, sleep, anxiety as well as many side effects from the prescription drugs that my doctors have given me. The pain is the main problem that I have, I get severe chest pain when my Lupus flares up, so bad that I cannot even breathe sometimes. In the past, my doctors have given me prescription opioids to manage my pain and I was dependent on them for three and a half years. About six months ago, I told my doctors that I am uncomfortable with the fact that I am dependent on these drugs and I would like to stop. I got some backlash from my doctors, but I was persistent and eventually they tried to use Suboxone to get me off the opiates. I had a horrible reaction and it gave me suicidal thoughts. I could not keep taking that drug so I did some research. I heard of kratom from friends and online and so I tried it. It helped me immensely, it reduced cravings for oxycodone, the main opioid that I was on as well as almost eradicated my withdrawal symptoms. I have been off of opiates for five months and I have been off of kratom for two months and I have never felt better. I will purchase more kratom when I get another Lupus flare to help me manage my pain instead of using opiate medication which I could potentially get addicted to again.\n\nPlease consider my, and others, experiences when you decide to classify kratom on December 1st. This herb helped me immensely and I feel like it will help many others in their struggle for pain management.

I am a Combat Veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom, and have received a fairly high disability rating, all due to physical conditions sustained during my deployment, and as a paratrooper. \n\nI was prescribed, and had to take a significant amount of pain medicine, just to go about my daily life, and it made me miserable. I never suffered from addiction, but the pain was unbearable, were I not to take it in the morning. It greatly reduced by productivity levels, and made me feel sick every single night. However, a family friend, who is a doctor in Canada, suggested I try kratom as a supplement, by just taking it once in the morning. I prepared it in tea, and it made my life significantly better, and my newfound productivity has been rewarding. It does not act like a painkiller, but it helps my pain subside for the remainder of the day, and I have never felt any withdrawal symptoms: whenever I did not take the supplement, on any given day.\n\nI am now a college student, who is using the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill, and have been able to maintain a 4.0 GPA while studying Political Science, at the University of South Carolina. With pain medication, I would never have been able to work as hard as I do now, because I would either feel debilitating pain for not taking it, or feel too sick to work. Yet, kratom has simply assisted me in living a much healthier, and productive lifestyle. Due to this, I can continue to exercise 4-5 times per week, and almost feel like I did before my injuries began to manifest. My family has been thankful for the changes it has provided for me, without requiring me to sacrifice my livelihood in the process. I am afraid that this ban will force me back to pain medication, of which I never want to go near again because I will not be nearly as efficient, with my studies, work, and growth. While many may depend on kratom more significantly than I, there is no shortage of stories about those who believe their life will fall into turmoil, once again, should this supplement be made illegal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2420","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin Labelle","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please conduct medical research on this product.

I have been a full time Paramedic and Firefighter for almost sixteen years. I have always wanted to help people and my career has allowed me to do just that. Over the years I have wore my body down helping others. I am a small framed person that weights about one hundred and sixty pounds. I have constantly picked up heavy equipment and patients of all shapes and sizes. Over the course of my career I have put a strain on my back. I suffer from Spinal Stenosis, and occasional herniated disks. I have had surgery on my back once already to repair a dish that was herniated in my lower back. I used to be able to function and do my job pain free until the state of Alabama banned Kratom. I had been on Kratom for about five years. I suffered no complications from taking Kratom. It did not make me lucid nor \"high\" feeling. I also suffer from restless leg syndrome which was totally controlled by taking the Kratom powder. For the five years I took the Kratom I never had to go up on my doses. It controlled my back pain and my restless leg. Since the ban in Alabama I have had to start taking three prescription medications to try to alleviate my pain and allow me to sleep at night with my restless leg. There are times that these medications do not help me and I have to just suffer thru the day. I could ask my regular physician to prescribe me stronger medicine, but then I would be unable to do my job. My hope is that you will reconsider your scheduling of this natural leaf that has helped me in many ways. If it is left unscheduled we may have a chance to reeducate our state legislators in Alabama and allow legalization with an age restriction.

It can help reduce anxiety, relieve pain, and restore energy levels with very few, if any, negative side effects. This can't be said for \"safe\" prescription medications that are being handed out like candy in our country. Any addictive properties and tolerance are alleviated very quickly by simply cutting down or stopping use, unlike similar prescription medications, with less painful withdrawal symptoms that are not in any way life-threatening. Evidence of death or serious illness due to kratom use is extremely slim, and in most cases, kratom was used along with other, more powerful, more dangerous drugs. I believe that the case for banning or restricting this plant is very flimsy. Don't take something away from the public based on pressure from pharmaceutical companies or drug hysteria. Look at the damage that has been done over illegal cannabis, and how hard people have had to fight to prove that the majority of negative reports on cannabis were overblown to the extreme. Like cannabis, kratom has the potential to help many, many people. Unlike cannabis, it doesn't impair a person's mental or physical coordination, or cause danger in doing daily tasks like driving. Please take into account the hundreds of thousands of personal stories. Research this plant, but don't keep it out of the hands of people who can make very good use of it. Not everything that helps people needs to be kept under lock and key, or doled out by doctors for kickbacks from corporations. Let people have some autonomy in how they care for themselves. \n\nThank you for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8609","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been a natural remedy for all kinds of ailments for hundreds of years.  It was banned in Thailand not because it was dangerous but rather to help the opiod industry at the time.  People had free access to Kratom and the people who were selling opium didn't want the competition.  \n\nNumber one, Kratom is safe in all of it's forms.  You can't OD on it.  I know more than 20 people who use Kratom daily.  Over half of them are former street people who lived on the streets during the height of their heroin use.  Those same people are gainfully employed thanks to Kratom.  Yes, they stlll use Kratom.  But it is safe, legal and not prohibitively expensive.  That translates to they do not need to resort to criminal activities to feed an addiction that will kill them.  Kratom has little to no negative side effects.  I met a woman just last week who has been using Kratom 3-4 times a day for 22 years.  She is 54 years old and her skin is healthy, she is a healthy weight and she is a successful attorney.  She was a heroin addict.  Now she has a family, owns a home and lives a normal life.  That woman will be destroyed if the ban goes into effect.  \n\nShe and thousands of others, including myself will turn to alternatives when Kratom is no longer available.  \n\nIf you take away Kratom I cannot tell you I will break the law.  But I can tell you that nothing short of Heroin will manage my tolerance.  I am not alone.  Heroin today is much stronger than it was 15 years ago.  People Will DIE if you ban Kratom.  More people in ONE day than the 15 you cite as the reason for this ban.  \n\nYou think we don't understand that this is a cheap freely available product that no major corporation and no government agency controls right now.  We do.  We know that drug companies don't want competition.  Nor do they want to patent some drug from synthetic alkaloids based off of Kratom only to allow people to buy the natural form that is just as good.  This is wrong.  If you make it illegal and then allow corporations to patent it you will be doing the same thing as if you said people can't have honey because drug companies make cough syrup that works better.  \n\nStay out of our bodies.  Big Government should leave Kratom alone.  No one is dieing. Any anecdotal evidence to the contrary is outweighed by the hundreds of thousands of every day people whose lives have been saved by this product.  They know what works, how it works and manage it safely.  Leave Kratom alone.  Let people do research but like Honey, Kratom is a natural product that is perfectly safe in it;s natural form.

I was prescribed oxycodone for pain that was marginally helpful at the prescribed dosage and I was committed to not increase the dosage. The IBSD was disabling as well because I never knew when it would flare up--and it did--several times a week. I became essentially home bound for the past several years. A little over a year ago, a friend suggested I try Kratom leaf and it has been very effective at relieving my pain and IBSD symptoms. I am no longer home bound. I have not had an IBSD flare since I began taking Kratom leaf. I no longer need oxycodone. I have had no side effects from Kratom leaf as I did with oxycodone. If Kratom is banned, I will not have withdrawal symptoms; I will have pain and disabling IBSD symptoms and will be forced to return to taking oxycodone.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0844","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Virginia Howard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is, to me, not addictive at all and helps with anxiety.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9372","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Erik Burleson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like for kratom to stay legal because I finally have a life now.

In my experience, kratom is harmless enough that it requires no regulation.\n\nKratom has been used safely for millennia to address pain and other maladies. It is far safer than its over-the-counter and prescription counterparts, bearing no risk of fatal overdose and no significant side effects or interactions. Scientific research has already determined that it possesses significant medicinal value. This relative of the coffee tree also boasts some of the same constituents that make other plants, such as tea, beneficial for one's health. Furthermore, it can be a substitution for people who use true opiates that can actually be damaging to themselves and society at large.\n \nWith Schedule 1 status, however, scientists would face significant barriers in studying kratom, and, more importantly, the millions of Americans who use it safely and responsibly will be left with far less salubrious substances to treat chronic pain and other issues. And those who choose to continue using it would become instant felons, in danger of being stripped of their freedom, their families, and their livelihoods. I cannot imagine how possession of a plant that presents no real harm would justify putting someone in prison, destroying not just their own life and future prospects but the economic stability and wellbeing of their children and spouse as well.\n\nKratom has provided me with immense relief from chronic back pain, due to disc herniation, leaving me better able to enjoy time with my family and focus on work, without making me dopey or craving more. I have been using kratom sporadically for about a year (no more than once or twice a week); in no way am I addicted to it - physically or psychologically - and I can take it or leave it. But I believe it is the prudent, wise, and decent thing to do to continue allowing hardworking and law-abiding Americans such as myself access to this inexpensive and safe remedy.\n\nLet's not go down the rabbit hole of banning natural substances because we may not truly understand them. I believe we are at a point in our society where we have learned the folly of wanton prohibition.

Kratom is not a recreational drug. It is a tea that helps me in many different ways. \n\nI have started using it in the spring of 2015. I take it once in the morning, sometimes an additional helping later in the afternoon.\n\nIt improves my focus and thus lets me work two jobs per day which I absolutely need to further my career as a professional biologist, medical writer and salesman.\n\nI used to have crippling anxiety attacks when I was out to talk to customers. With kratom, this anxiety is gone and I can actually carry on with my job.\n\nAs a biomedical writer and researcher with an actual PhD in biology, I can safely guarantee that kratom is not an opiate. It is a natural herb that has 'opiate-like effects'.\n\nVeterans who suffer from PTSD, opiate addicts and people suffering from constant pain are often placed under the control of strong medication and actual opiates that have a huge potential for opiate addiction. These people literally \"cure\" one suffering, only to experience an even more devastating one. Kratom does not cause problems of addiction, yet lets people get safely off opiate addiction and relieves psychological and often even physical pain!\n\nHere are some links that help confirm my statements:\n\nKratom is taken by responsible adults for pain relief, help with addiction and relief from PTSD.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23iamkratom\nA kratom ban would put a lot of the people that lead productive lifes back into opiate addiction.\nhttps://www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2016/9/18/kratom-users-say-ban-will-lead-to-more-drug-abuse\nCase in point: after a state-wide ban of kratom, Alabama sees a significant increase in fatal opiate overdoses:\nwww.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2016/07/jeffco_sees_25_heroin_fentanyl.html\nThere are estaimated 3 million kratom users in the US, yet the CDC has only reported 660 complications from kratom use within 6 years - that is actually proof that kratom is safe.\nhttps://www.botanical-education.org/dea-ban-natural-herb-kratom-could-cause-billions-industry-losses/ \n660 complications (not even deaths) are a far cry away from 46 deaths per day from painkillers:\nwww.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/01/america-s-prescription-opiate-problem-isn-t-going-anywhere.html\n\nI personally know of no cases where minors are involved with kratom. As I mentioned above, kratom is not a recreational drug and thus usually not used by underage people. Among my friends who use kratom, I am literally the 'youngster' with my youthful 40 years.\n\nKratom should be readily available, it is safe, effective and will prevent addiction and overdoses!\n\nThank you for your consideration and God Bless.\n\nFlorian Ulrich","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21042","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Florian Ulrich","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\nI am a 36 year old mother and store manager.  I am asking that you reconsider your choice to ban the plant called Kratom. It is a natural herb that comes from the coffee family used to make tea it helps to lift mood and ease moderate pain. Kratom is not like prescription opiates or synthetic drugs in that it does not interact on the MU-Opiate receptor which is what provides those using pain meds to feel high or become dependent. This plant has helped so many people. It eases the pain in people who live with painful diseases. It might not be a cure all, but it is a safer alternative than opiate pain killers that once you start them you get sick when you stop therefore your body becomes physically addicted. I know this for certain because I have been there. I cried every night because i did not want to live that lifestyle anymore and I prayed to God to show me another way. I stumbled upon this God given plant. It grows naturally...it is not tampered with by unnatural ingredients. Kratom does not make you feel high or out of it. It does not impair your judgement. \nKratom...unlike prescription pain killers and heroin does NOT slow down your breathing. This reason alone is why you can not overdose on it. \nKratom saved my life. It allowed me to stop taking dangerous pain medication without withdrawal symptoms. I have been taking it for around 6 months now. It eases the pain i have in my back due to degenerative disk disease. \nThere is a terrible epidemic of pain meds and heroin killing our friends, family, neighbors, sons and daughters. If anything we should be pushing this plant to save them. It's a tea. Caffeine is more dangerous than Kratom. Please save this plant and help save peoples lives. Not to mention all of the small business owners that would be put out of work because of this. There are 3-5 million users in America alone. We do not use it to get high. We use it to feel normal\n \n\nThank you for your time and consideration,\n\nSincerely,\n\nLisa Copus","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3299","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lisa Copus","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban Kratom.

I am a combat veteran and also a disabled veteran. I know there are several others here that also have quite a bit to say on this matter, or would like to say something and simply can't. I'd like to speak on behalf of some of these folks, as I'm very much involved still with the veteran community and support fellow veterans that operate non profit organizations for a much greater cause than I could even put into words Over the past year, I have linked up with some of my comrades and have talked with many veterans of all sorts of settings. Regardless of the current professions or goals and endeavors, we all seem to be linked by the spirit and that is to provide selflessly to our brotherhood as well as the service to our country. Both items are of pretty extreme importance. Recently, many of us have seemed to come under attack; not by enemies of a foreign land. This time it is, what we feel, our personal freedom. Some of us are very broken people that had been shuffled through the VA and pumped fool of the same classes of pharmaceutical drugs only to yield the same result: inefficacy. One thing that has obviously been replacing some of these harsh narcotics are the ubiquitous and inexpensive supply of herbal alternatives. I used to doubt the idea of taking any substance not approved by the FDA, but I honestly believe this time a grave mistake has been made by not giving kratom the consideration or respect it deserves. I've used it for roughly 8 months and in absolute moderation. I can personally attest to it's usefulness, lack of side effects experienced and most importantly, it's ability to give back a part of my life that has been missing for some time now. \n\nKratom for many of us was a source of freedom from hard medications and lack of clarity; lack of self. A thousand times over, it has restored many of us to what most would consider \"normal\". I do not think it is a good idea to take that right away or to criminalize something that is harmless without honoring it for what it has done for many of these wonderful people. The feeling is a consensus among us and we do see the DEA's stance on kratom as a threat to our livelihood. I don't want to go on about the benefits because that is simply not my place, but I would like to speak on the very principle of what is happening here. We have elected to choose to put something in our bodies that has come with no proven ill-effects. I've looked at the information regarding kratom on many of these .gov sites, and it's insufficient. I think as the greatest government in the world, we could certainly do better on being more scrupulous with our case studies.\n\n I encourage that the DEA take a few steps back and not see kratom as another drug out there in the wild that needs to be taken on because the number of users and types of users vary so widely that it is as if you are looking at all of the faces that make up America in itself. I do not think your everyday American is a crook  or a delinquent. I urge you not to start a war against a substance that is doing so much good for the men and women that have sworn on their lives to uphold the highest code of integrity and give good for you. If you or anyone reading this is a veteran, I thank you for your service, and I thank you for sharing the burdens with me. I have a sincere passion for doing what is right, what is fair and what is honestly for the better. \n\nThank you for all that you do as an organization. I, too, appreciate the safety you try to bring to our culture and way of life. I just do not believe that kratom is here to cause anyone any harm or provide the financing to criminal activities. I've looked into it practically and economically, and I think we will do just fine with the regards we had for it prior to August 31st of this year.\n\nAgain, I'm very grateful for this opportunity to say my piece and I sure hope this address is not falling into a void among the rest of them.

I am 27 years old. Last year, at 26, I had a heart attack. It's not because I had a blockage. Not because I'm overweight or am predisposed...but because I had been so sick the entire year, my heart just stopped. It couldn't do it anymore. I had been so sick throughout the year that my doctor's couldn't figure out what was going on, other than saying I was sick. So, because my sickness didn't have a name that they could associate with it, I became labeled as a drug seeker. I vomited (NOT intentionally) multiple times a day, I had 30-40 hospital visits and admissions in the year 2015 alone, I was so dangerously dehydrated that I had an IV drilled into my shin, I was put on stroke risk because of my dangerously high BP from the dehydration and pain...and virtually nothing was done for me because of that incorrect label. I've been diagnosed now with several diseases and disorders but that didn't change anything, either, since I already had been labeled. I fell behind in school -- I went from being a 4.0 GPA student to two C+ grades in one semester. Depression settled in, disappointment, a lack of will to keep fighting because the pain was just too much. Then I was told about Kratom. I'm happy to report that I'm on track to graduate with a master's degree in journalism in a couple of months. I've had Kratom for approximately 3 months and I only take it at night because it's enough to take the edge off long enough to get me through the night and the next day. Taking away Kratom, making it a felony or schedule 1  or illegal or all of the above would take away my ability to live -- my ability and RIGHT to have a quality of life that allows me to actually live. To not have to try to apply for disability. to not become someone who cannot function and cannot get out of bed. This plant has saved my life -- it's not a matter of being \"high\" because that's not what this plant does -- it's a matter of being able to be a functional human being. Please consider the lives you'll be taking away if you choose to make this plant illegal. And if you still choose to make it illegal, know that the blood is on your hands.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5789","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anon anon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Amy Davis and I use Kratom daily.

I take my responsibility to youth and society quite seriously. And if it wasn't for kratom, I wouldn't be able to adequately serve in my roles and effect growth and positive change in the youngsters that I lead and love. I am therefore vehemently opposed to the DEA classifying the constituents of kratom as schedule 1 controlled substances.\n\nI was in a debilitating car accident 10 years ago. I have herniated discs as a result, and also have degenerative disc disease. This might also be attributed to the fact that I was morbidly obese for many years as well. I routinely took 600mg of ibuprofen 3 times daily to alleviate the constant inflammation causing my sciatic pain. In 2014, fed up with my morbid obesity, I underwent bariatric surgery. What I didn't know at the time was that I would have to give up NSAIDs, save for the occasional 200mg of ibuprofen on the worst of pain days. After having the surgery, I went through many days of regret as I suffered immeasurable pain from my disc condition. I limped through work, would be in pain if I stood too long, and similar if I sat too long. The pain was distracting and demoralizing, and affected my ability to be as present as possible for my students, staff, and loved ones. \n\nThankfully, while posting on a bariatric surgery social media group in early 2015 about pain relief options, someone suggested kratom as a remedy. I tried it and found it to give me the pain relief that I needed, without any negative side affects. I take kratom like any other over-the-counter medication and go about my daily duties of leading meetings, observing teachers, counseling students, collaborating with community organizations, training staff, responding to security issues, problem solving, parenting, etc. Kratom has never in any way affected my ability to do my job except that it mediated the pain to allow me to function and focus fully on the task at hand.\n\nIf Kratom were to become a schedule 1 substance, my pain relief options would be limited to Tylenol-- which is unhelpful for inflammatory pain-- or to seek prescription relief of narcotic pain medication-- which is highly addictive and would induce side effects that would impair my ability to function at work appropriately.\n\nKratom has been a complete life changer for me. I never thought after being contraindicated from NSAIDs that I would ever feel physically comfortable again. And frankly, it's completely incongruous to me that as an Assistant Principal for the New York City Department of Education, that I am routinely taking a supplement that could be considered a schedule 1 substance. I am not a drug user, and never will be. And as someone responsible for supporting, shaping, and cultivating the youth of today, I strive to live as a role model for both the children I work with as well as the children I live with; all of them the children I love. \n\nI am hopeful that I can continue to be a positive role model while simultaneously living a pain-mitigated life. And I am hopeful that the DEA will hear my voice, the voices of others, and educate itself on relevant research, precluding the kratom constituents from the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21089","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nicole Abrams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Why i want kratom to be treated as the wonderful herb that it is?

There are many accounts of people using kratom to ween themselves from more harmful opioid drugs (many more accounts than there are of people suffering serious harm from using it). Currently the most effective treatments for opioid use disorders are opioid substitution treatment using methadone or buprenorphine, and this are positive treatment because the reduce the harm associated with illicit drug use yet at the same time both of those drug are dangerous and addictive in their own right, and while kratom may cause dependence and may cause some harm all laboratory research to date (e.g., Vradi et al., 2016) indicates that it is a less addictive and less harmful drug than opioids. This same research indicates that kratom alkaloids may provide a safer alternative to opioids for treating serious pain. All of which suggests that kratom is not a drug without medical use, nor does it have as high a potential for abuse as do many drugs that are schedule 2, 3, or 4. While I can certainly see the value in regulating kratom, especially kratom extracts that have greater potency than the plant itself, I can see no logic in your decision to make it a schedule 1 drug. Doing so will only benefit drug companies invested in opioid medications and likely result in increased use of more dangerous opioids. I believe kratom deserves a period of serious research on it benefits and potential harms and not a rush to ban it. By all means find another mechanism to regulate it's use (e.g., through legislation) but do not take this drastic step.

Banning kratom only feeds the failed war on drugs. If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars - for treating their own addictions? It's nonsensical. kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them be free of their addictions, but now all scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids. Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.

There is no evidence of any particular threat it poses to human health. I drank some in tea and attended a local history lecture. The feeling was mild and pleasant. I have heard that is helps with substance abuse. I think this would be something the DEA would want unless the DEA wants more substance abuse. It has the effects of an opiod without the addiction and can help with pain relief. My mother is nearly nonfunctional for her usage of opiods for pain. I think this would be an alternative for her. She has had to be taken care of by my father who just retired from the Navy after 33 years of service. He could enjoy his retirement more if this was not illegal. Please also consider this may have been imported previously which grants it legitimacy for being a nutritional supplement. Thanks for the consideration and I hope you do ther right thing. Otherwise this will criminalize people who wish to take something nature has given for the benefit of humans.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16566","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason Robo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am MD, 1972 University of Minnesota, Martin A.

I have been in treatment and on a cocktail of nasty pharmaceuticals,  but when i discovered this beautiful plant kratom, that has a very long history of safe human consumption,  my whole life changed for the better.  Kratom is the only thing that has ever helped my mental illness,  the reason i was using hard drugs in the first place. When i use kratom \"twice daily\" i get a lasting clearity of life and a genuine relief from my disorders.  Its very unlike hard drugs wich give you relief but inevitably take control of your life. Its such a not drug natual feeling that of course some people are gonna be dumb and try to abuse it . like people snorting caffeine pills or kids getting high on loperamide. Theres always gonna be that, but were not gonna ban robotussin right? That would be silly right? We cant let a select few ruin something with undeniable medicinal value cuz there's irresponsible people . point is kratom has saved my life and greatly improved my quality of life and i plead with you to not ban this plant.

People chew, and make tea from its leaves. In August of this year (2016) the DEA announced that they would classify kratom as a schedule one substance. This means kratom would be in the same category as heroin, marijuana and cocaine. Simply put they are threatening to throw anyone in jail that is in possession of the product. The DEA claimed that Kratom was an \"imminent threat to public safety\" and used this slogan repeatedly as their justification for the banning of kratom. \n\nFrom this point on i will examine the reasoning behind the proposed ban and suggest why i think the DEA is willingly participating in a large scale corruption scandal.\n\nFirst I will put into perspective this \"imminent threat to public safety\". In the exert below taken directly from the DEA website they claimed 660 calls came into poison control centers over a span of 5 years with people who had been exposed (with negative health effects) to kratom. They also claimed they saw an increase in shipments coming through the borders which they attributed to an \"increasing epidemic\". \n \n \"from January 2010 through December 2015. During the stated timeframe, U.S. poison centers received 660 calls related to kratom exposure. Of the calls reported, 487 (73.8%) reported intentional exposure to kratom, and 595 (90.2%) reported ingestion of the drug\"\n\nSo, what does 660 calls to poison control look like in comparison to other products on the market? Below is a list of products and the number of calls to poison control in 2015 regarding exposure to those products. Some of these products are currently controlled substances which means the DEA regulates who can sell and posses the product. (data taken directly from NPDS aka- poison control).\n1, Analgesics (pain killers)- 291,062 calls\n2, Sedative/Hypnotics/Antipsychotics- 150,715 calls\n3, Cold and Cough Preparations- 61,288 calls\n4, Antidepressants- 112,412 calls\n5, During May 17-June 17, 2012, poison centers reported 1,008 laundry detergent exposures to the National Poison Data System (NPDS), of which 485 (48%) exposures involved laundry detergent pods\nMore examples of toxic exposure reported by NPDS include this exert below:\n\n\"Dextromethorphan is an over-the-counter cough suppressant found in more than 120 cough and cold products. Recreational abuse has become increasingly common and leads to approximately 6000 emergency room visits a year.(NPDS)\"\n\n\nThe proposed scheduling of kratom would give the DEA control over the product, Once scheduled the DEA would have a monopoly over who can study and posses kratom. If classified as a schedule one substance the DEA can choose which universities and drug companies are allowed to study and eventually sell the product. Does this sound fishy to anyone else?\n\nIf you do the math you'll find that kratom accounts for less than one ten thousandth of a percent of all calls to poison control centers nationwide. Is this the evidence of an \"increasing epidemic\" or \"imminent threat to public safety\"? Lets be honest, if we're really concerned about public safety we should boycott Tide or Bounty, it's obvious their trying to kill kids with their laundry pods right?\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming clear that kratom is less toxic than over the counter cough syrups, beer, wine, marijuana and pretty much anything else millions of americans partake in every single day. For the reasons i mentioned above i believe it is clear that the DEA is currently partaking in political corruption influenced by someone who has an economic interest in kratom. \n\nWhy should you care? well honestly if the DEA banned kratom tomorrow almost nobody would know about it. Kratom is virtually unheard of. kratoms voice compared to that of the DEA is equivalent to a mouse begging for its life in the clutch of a serpent. That being said, just because this decision affects so few people doesn't diminish its injustice. A true erosion of freedom is happening right under americans noses without them even knowing it. \n\n\n\nside note: This paper is an atrocious example of grammar, punctuation and form. I know that. The point is to illustrate injustices committed by the DEA. \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20072","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me in more ways than any pharmaceutical ever has.

As we're seeing through investigation of compounds in medical marijuana, the schedule I classification was prejudiced by popular opinion, and may have set research back on pain management and potential for other uses by many decades. More due to the Aerosmith generation and sources below the border than actual clinical evidence.\n\nNow I've never heard of Kraton, but I'm reading the same things. I work in Clinical Trials, and hope that the DEA will schedule this in such a way to mitigate the concerns being expressed by reports of medical professionals about potential dangers, but would allow for medical professionals to make determinations about efficacy for their patients, whether in the treatment of opioid abuse, as has been claimed by many, or in the investigation of the compounds that this may include to potentially find appropriate alternative treatments for patients. A schedule I classification limits research, and, ultimately consumer acceptance of products that can help. \n\nIf you want the truth about dependence, reddit.com users in general will not whitewash their experiences, and a quick search shows plenty of evidence for abuse and dependence. I expect the DEA has read many of the discussions there. from what I'm reading there, the stories of dependence are similar to opiates and benzodiazapenes. No idea why these people were interested in kraton in the first place.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/2f6j7m/how_fast_did_you_develop_a_dependence/#bottom-comments\n\nBetween medical potential that has been shown by people that are seeing relief, and potential for abuse that has been shown by discussion of \"Ween\" schedules and deterioration of normalcy, without clinical trial data this should be Schedule II or higher.

It is my belief that the banning and subsequent scheduling of the plant products from Kratom is merely a means of paving the way for highly profitable \"new drug\" patents for analogous indole compounds. This belief is indicative of the close ties and financial benefits between the pharmaceutical industry and government regulatory agencies. This, is entirely too problematic and represents a conflict of interest in regulating access to medications due to safety concerns. Rather, this method of clearing out the competition for effective pain relief by making a relatively safe plant product illegal and inaccessible to those in need of pain relief.  Secondly, this particular herb is helping addicts of illegal opiates and pharmaceutical opiates to wean off of opioids without encountering severe and sometimes dangerous withdrawal symptoms. \nI myself have used small amounts of raw Kratom leaf to treat health issues related to my chronic autoimmune diseases. I urge the DEA to use their regulatory powers for the good of all Americans, including those struggling with pain management,  treating drug dependencies, and a number of other applicable health conditions. Kratom, it may not belong on store shelves as a remedy. But, it's long history if human consumption and medical validity should stand in stark contrast to the pop-culture alarmists looking for ever-more means to expand the policies that turn patients into defendants and victims.

I've seen first hand it help people, myself included, battle and defeat addictions.  I've witnessed it help older people with pain issues, allowing them to get up out of bed and stay out of bed, allowing them to live their lives more productively.  I can only imagine how much more helpful this herbal supplement could be if it was studied in a scientific, medical environment.  If it becomes illegal and scheduled 1, it wont be available for any kind of studying, and will be taken away from all the people it has already helped.\n\nI began using kratom 2 and a half years ago.  Before kratom, I was addicted to opiates for 3 years with no sign of slowing down.  I had began with lortabs and percacets.  My tolerance went up to where I needed 5 pills at a time. Then I found 30mg IR oxycodone.  I quickly needed 2, 3 30mg pills just to satisfy my addiction.  Then heroin came into the picture.  For over a year I was spending $50-$100 a day on heroin.  I had a realization that I wasnt gonna be able to quit when I wanted to, because I would have never began using herion if I could.  \n\nOne day, I was sick, withdrawing, thinking nothing but getting my fix but I didnt have any way of obtaining any opiates so I went online looking for home remedies to help easing the withdrawals and I found kratom.  I researched it extensivily before I decided to give it  a shot.  I was skeptical but figured i had nothing to lose.  My life has been completely different since that day and I thank God every day for kratom.  It saved my girlfriends life, and mine.\n\nMy brother, at the age of 28 years, was an alcoholic.  I suggested to him to try kratom.  I had no idea if it would help but i thought that if it could help me so much, that it was worth a shot.  He hasnt touch alcohol since.  \n\nIf kratom is deemed illegal and unsafe, which I think its perfectly safe, compared to opiates, would do much more harm than good.  For each and everyone who uses kratom for the multitude of reasons, would suffer greatly.  Obviously kratom, a leaf from a tree that grows naturally, has many benefits and helps a wide range of people, more than those with just opiate addictions.   \n\nSincerely,\nTyler R.

I am doing so in the hopes that testimonies like mine may help to educate, unravel stigma and ultimately help prevent an unnecessary and potentially tragic scheduling of this herbal supplement which is in many regards comparable to coffee, yerba mate, or loose leaf tea. \n\nI began utilizing the benefits of powdered kratom leaf in 2011 after suffering from severe lower back pain, moderate depression and social anxiety as well as bouts of gastrointestinal distress.  Seeking relief for lower back pain in particular, I decided to try kratom and after just a few instances of using it and titrating for an effective dose, I found that it was simultaneously the most effective, and least debilitating pain relief I had ever experienced! Instead of feeling drowsy and unable to perform energetic or complex tasks like the prescription opiates I had tried before would make me feel, I found that kratom would actually boost my motivation and ability to get things done, while also providing enough pain relief to maintain a positive mood and enjoy being social. \n\nI continued taking kratom on an almost daily basis which made it possible for me to maintain a strenuous job as an arborist over the next two summers and to finish my Bachelor's degree in Ecological Design during the school year. Interestingly, and somewhat unexpectedly, I found that my dosage was steadily decreasing over this time, especially as my back pain subsided and my use of kratom became much more equivalent to how one might drink coffee or tea for productive stimulation. \n\nMore recently I have been relying on kratom for the painful, disruptive, embarrassing, and energy draining symptoms of IBS-D (Irritable Bowel Syndrome  Diarrhea) as well as the co-morbid depression and anxiety. At the end of August when I heard that kratom may be categorized as a schedule 1 drug, I took it upon myself to see what my life would be like without kratom. I tapered my dosage down to nothing over a week. My symptoms, both physical and mental were increasingly worse and by the last two days I was seeing blood in my bowel movements. I decided that this was a serious matter, potentially of life and death for me, and continued with my moderate but daily use of kratom. \n\nNow that reportedly millions of other American Kratom utilizers and I are facing the possibility of a schedule 1 categorization again, I am terrified for my future wellbeing as well as for the potentially traumatic impact this would have on American society at large.  In the midst of a prescription opiate epidemic ruining the lives of millions in this country, it is difficult not to perceive that only ignorance or ill intentions could motivate a sustained effort to limit access to this herbal alternative which is Kratom. \n\nThis leafy shrub hailing from SE Asia but potentially viable as a domestic crop, has the strong potential to provide relief to those suffering from withdrawal from opiates, but also presents those who are wary or tired of using prescribed pain medication with an attractive alternative. In addition, a host of other alkaloids and bioactive compounds present in varying concentrations in kratom leaf, all have potential as medicinal compounds in their own right, and likely work in a synergistic fashion with the two main pain relieving molecules mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. Not only that, some of them appear to: mitigate the physical dependance liability of kratom, help maintain focus and energy while experiencing pain relief, and protect against respiratory depression which is the main cause of fatal overdose from traditional opiates of all kinds. These are all complimentary compounds which are not found in the opium poppy plant (papaver somniferum), and therefore represent novel medicinal molecules with great potential in the study of pain relief and other fields of health.\n\nPreventing the research of mitragyna speciosa by placing it's two of many active alkaloid constituents: mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine into a Schedule 1 category, would be a grave mistake for the medical and pharmaceutical industries and the American people who could benefit so greatly from this complex yet gentle medicine. It would also be a logistical and experiential nightmare for those of us whose illnesses are managed in full or in part by Kratom, and an ethical tragedy on the part of the the DEA and federal government.\n\nI urge anyone reading this to carefully consider what power they have and how to best use it for the prevention of unnecessary suffering. Please consider the mounting evidence regarding kratom, both peer-reviewed and anecdotal, carefully and compassionately. A great many people's health, jobs, families and futures depend on the availability of this plant. \n\nThank You","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22605","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amalesh Parajuli","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"See attached file(s)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7489","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is ridiculous that a government agency would even consider banning a substance that not only has been shown to relieve chronic pain but also has been proven to aid in opioid addictions.

In 2006 I was in a head on collision which caused some pretty debilitating  back pain. I sought treatment from an osteopath who prescribed me 10 mg. Vicodin \"Norco\"  (the strongest)  6/daily.  THIS eventually led me to Oxcycontin (prescribed) 40mg. 3daily PLUS 5mg. Percocet 6daily. Four years lare I was completely cut off and MISERABLE. I want DAILY to a methadone clinic for a few years, eventually finding a suboxone doctor who helped me wean down to very littl, but it still felt IMPOSSIBLE to completely cut the cord. Then I found Kratom & things really began to turn around. Once off all of the opiate's for awhIle not only did I feel a million times better but I started realizing how reckless I'd behaved during those opiate filled years. I was still caring for my children & husband, but I wasn't near what I had been or could be. In thesee last 3 yrs the ONLY thing I've taken is Kratom. I don't spend our grocery money on it, get sick, fiend, etc. I'm involved more than ever in my children's activities & lives. Making Kratom illegal could & will cause a plethora of problems for myself & others like me, who are otherwise law abiding citizens doing our best to survive. I still stuffer from a lot of back pain, as well as depression & anxiety (professionally diagnosed) to which Kratom helps tremendously. \n\nThank you for your time.\n\nKristi L.

Kratom has changed my life, I have chronic back and leg pain. Until I discovered Kratom 4 years ago I had to take motrin, Tylenol, vicodin and countless other medications. In addition I spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours visiting doctors, chiropractors, massage therapy, physical therapy, shots in my spine and acupuncture. Now I visit my chiropractor about once a year. This leaf has saved me thousands of dollars a year, dozens of hours of lost time at my demanding job and made me in a better mood as well as  being able to be more active with my 4 children. I have not noticed any side effects. I used to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol, both of those are actually destructive to individuals and society. If cigarettes and alcohol which have no health benefits are legal it would be crazy to make Kratom illegal. The only people who will benefit from illegal kratom will be pharmaceutical companies because so many people will have to buy there liver destroying products.  Please do the right thing and keep this legal. I understand if it needs to tested for quality, etc by the FDA or another agency, but not outlawed.

I don't have much in the way of health insurance. I can only afford a plan with an extremely high deductible. I work several jobs and can only get part time work with decent wages. All 3 of my jobs require mostly manual labor. As of now I have small tears in my both hip's labrals. This causes my hip to constantly lock up with fiery pain and even worse it starts causing some pretty terrible pain in my lower back. The pharmaceutical industry would defend the use of hydrocodone ,vicodin, or some other addicting and inebriating substance to ease this pain, but frankly recent events have proved that these substances often lead to pretty terrible consequences. I discovered kratom a couple years ago via an internet search and gave it a try. The results blew me away. The yellow journalism that is used to argue against kratom is all wrong. \n\n   First off kratom is not synthetic. It is simply dried  and all natural leaves. That is it. Secondly, kratom is incredibly effective yet mild. I can continue to work with noticeable pain reduction, but not with the sedativeness of other legal pain killers. There is really no noticeable way to even realize you are on it , other than a slight lift in alertness I compare to caffeine. Kratom allows me to bend at the waist and ease the tension in my back, which otherwise makes my life hell day in and day out. Advil and ibuprofen simply do not do nearly enough to help and I don't trust the effects of these products on my stomach. Kratom has had 0 side effects on me , outside of a couple nights sleeplessness if I stop taking it for a break. Thirdly, my story is just one of many. People need this plant more than I . When you hear success stories of people getting themselves of horrific drugs like heroin ,by switching to this plant , we have to act compassionately towards keeping kratom legal. People will die if they can not access this plant. They will continue to fight heroin addiction , which is now more dangerous than ever with the introduction of Fetanyl into many batches, and have no means other than getting on dangerous detox drugs like Suboxene. By banning this plant we continue down a path of ignorance that demonizes mother nature in favor of government bureaucracies deciding what free adults can do with their body. You make criminals out of hard working Americans who want nothing more than to take an extremely mild plant to reduce chronic pain. Please , do not this . Do we really want to live in a society that punishes innocent people for trying to ease chronic pain? It is not right. Making kratom ill-rationally illegal in favor of public safety makes no sense. It makes  the public more prone to addiction of dangerous legal and illegal pain killing substances. You can spot when someone is on heroin, a high dose of Vicodin, but with kratom you would never know. Again , it is like caffeine with a non-euphoric pain killing property. \n\n    Please do  not make me a federal criminal. I just want to live my life , pay off my student debt , and follow the American dream. I don't want to live my life in pain , because I can not afford a surgery to fix my hips. Banning kratom does nothing , but compromise the integrity of our free society, give greater control for the pharmaceutical industry, destroy  an important outlet for addicts to get free of their addiction, and causes thousands to suddenly become criminals, because we wish to continue a drug policy that lacks any compassion while simultaneously living in a country with a massively broken and corrupt health care system. The idea that people's lives could be ruined , items repossessed, and individuals sent to prison, is truly heartbreaking.\n  Please ,I beg of you, listen to the people and not the sensationalist journalism. Kratom is a safe plant and a gift from God to help those in pain. If it requires regulation , then require you must be over 18 to buy it. If given over to the pharmaceutical industry , then it will again be out of reach for those with poor health insurance. Choose freedom ,choose compassion, choose to live in a society that allows adults to make decisions regarding their own body and avoid more intrusion of government into people's lives. Kratom is a miracle for me and countless others , and together we ask you to be on our side and not on the side of hypocrisy. We are ordinary law abiding Americans who suffer,but with kratom we can overcome pain. \n\nThank you for your time, in depth research and consideration. I trust you will do the right thing. \nGod bless,\nBrandon\n\nPs. I choose to remain anonymous, because the government has historically not always made the wisest choices and I do not want the government to have my full name if I were to possibly be considered a criminal if kratom were to be made illegal.I can imagine few greater injustices than to be imprisoned for this harmless plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10267","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon M","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom was the last thing I tried for my pain.

My kidneys failed 9 years ago from a genetic kidney disease and I received a living donor kidney transplant 2 years later.  Along with having a chronic disease came Fibromyalgia, degenerative disc disease and chronic pain.  Getting a kidney transplant from someone willing to save your life is thrilling and and life changing but it doesn't magically make you who you used to be.  I sat for 4 hours a day, 3 days a week receiving dialysis and my muscles atrophied. I was so stressed and so afraid and I developed Fibro which is a constant struggle with pain in all forms for me.  I have tried prescription drugs, ( non opioid), acupuncture, physical therapy and Lidocaine therapy. I have tried creams and lotion and OTC drugs of all kinds. Ice packs, heating pads, tears and prayer.  Most everything helped a little bit but nothing helped enough.  I have been unable to be part of life as I knew it as my endurance and pain level wouldn't  allow it. Pain wears you down and makes you fearful and desperate  I had basically given up on this life.  I heard about Kratom online through  a Fibromyalgia website but didn't try it until the threat of it being moved to being schedule one drug was raised.\n \nMy life has been changed. I cannot imagine being without Kratom now. I just can't.  I grocery shop, I make our bed, I make dinners, walk our dogs, visit my granddaughter, sweep the floor. I can make plans with people without canceling each and every time. I don't cry in bed every evening from pure pain and exhaustion. I can't believe that this supplement can give me back the life I once knew. I am terrified of losing my only avenue of pain relief.\n\nI believe Kratom should remain legal for all people. The opioid epidemic is so tragic and out of control and Kratom gives people a way out, a safe alternative for the wracking pain so many experience. Pain is not a weakness or a character flaw. Pain is a fact of life. Kratom gives ALOT of us that chance to be whole again.

Now in my mid 30s, I have been seeing doctors, therapists, psychiatric professionals, and other caregivers since I was 14.  I have tried more than a dozen different medication therapy regimens over the years, with minimal relief.  I haven't been able to work in nearly 10 years.  I have to live with my parents for support, to help monitor my moods, and to protect against suicide risk.  My current medications, while keeping me from talking to people that aren't there and thinking constantly about death and hopelessness, come with a number of undesirable side effects, from weight gain to restless limbs to sexual dysfunction. \nI want nothing more desperately than to be a normal, functional adult.  For the last five months, I have been taking kratom.  It has changed my life.  For the first time in almost a decade, I have felt enthusiasm, motivation, hope.  I have been considering options for returning to the work force.  I have found a fulfilling creative outlet.  I have been able to care for a pet.  I have begun to think there is possibility in my future, that I won't always feel so lost and broken.  None of this would be possible without affordable and readily available kratom.  I imagine you will be hearing a lot from recovering opiate addicts, and recovering alcoholics.  There is a very large portion of the speciosa community that depends on this medicine to free themselves from the horrors of drug abuse.  Most opiate overdoses occur after a person has been sober for a period and relapses and misjudges their tolerance.  It is not exaggeration to say people will die if kratom is banned.  But there are also a lot of us who have discovered it's effectiveness in treating otherwise nigh untreatable levels of depression.  It can save lives, in many ways.  It's benefit far exceeds any risk or danger to the public, and in fact those dangers are minimal and over exaggerated.  I have spent weeks thinking of how best to communicate my feelings on this matter, and I hope I have done so with the sincerity and urgency it demands.\nPlease, do pursue research into the medical potential for kratom.

That was when I was diagnosed with bilateral Neurogenic Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) and was faced with the prospect of multiple, highly invasive and very risky surgeries that \"might\" restore up to 60% of the use of my hands and arms or at 48 years old, I could choose to end my career, accept my disability, and learn how to adapt and pace myself in an effort to slow the progression of this chronic condition. I received expert opinions from specialists that I was not a good candidate for the rib resection surgeries that have helped some patients who are stricken with TOS and diagnosed early. So I made the difficult decision to stop working and to try to regain what health I could by learning how to manage the pain and progression with physical therapy and other physical modalities, narcotic pain meds, antispasmodic meds and muscle relaxers. \n\nWhen my pain management doctor fell gravely ill several years later and had to close his practice, I had to start all over again seeing various doctors, get my diagnosis reconfirmed and then find a pain management clinic willing to accept me. Despite having a huge binder with all my records and years of successful compliance, I was now eyed with suspicion that I might just be a drug seeker, which is even more demoralizing. \n\nI want to be very clear. I have always been a compliant patient. I have never lost a prescription. I have never requested an increase in dosage. In fact, I voluntarily decreased my dosage (with my doctor's approval) to see how well I would do on less. My medications (even my vitamins and nutritional supplements) are locked in a safe bolted to a shelf. I am NOT psychologically addicted to my pain meds. I NEVER crave these medications. I DO NOT feel or seek a HIGH and I am never pain free. And I am not a unicorn (there are more like me). Even at low doses, my body has grown physically dependent on the pain meds and I do experience severe physical withdrawal symptoms if a dose is missed.\n\nThis brings me to how I was introduced to Kratom. I am a relatively new Kratom user. I'd been researching it for a couple of months when a billing problem with the mail order pharmacy my insurance requires that I use canceled my prescription and mailed it back to me, citing that they are not allowed to hold a perfectly valid prescription while the billing department worked out the issue (my bank showed my bill had been paid electronically but it wasn't showing up on the pharmacy end). I was on the phone with the pharmacy every day three days in a row and even paid the bill a second time with a credit card. The prescription was canceled anyway and it was mailed back to me the day before the billing issue was finally cleared up on the pharmacy end. So I had to wait for the prescription to be returned in the mail before I could take it to my pain management clinic. They mailed a new prescription to the pharmacy the next day but since I only had a week left of my prescription, I had to cut my usual dosage in half hoping that it would last. This caused my body to begin withdrawal symptoms. Kratom really helped me manage the nausea, diarrhea, increased pain, and insomnia of withdrawals. Even though I paid extra to have the shipping expedited, I ran out of my pain medication while my new prescription was still being processed. I went 2 weeks at half dosage and 3 days at no dosage of my regular medication at all (then I had to titrate back up for another week). \n\nI can envision a day where I would seriously consider getting off the narcotic medications all together if Kratom were to continue to be available. If it were not for Kratom, I know without a doubt that the last few weeks would have been a living hell of pain and illness for me. It is easy for me to believe that this is a very viable choice for those unfortunate people who are addicted and trying to get off opiates. If you take this natural plant choice away from them, where to do they have to turn? I'm not saying that some minimal labeling and safety measures aren't in order for Kratom, just like any nutritional supplement or tea that I can purchase at the store. Please DO NOT follow through with the DEA's Intent to Schedule the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, which would make Kratom, a Schedule 1 controlled substance with no medicinal value. This would put Kratom on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It is a natural nutritional supplement helping many people who are suffering from chronic conditions and is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem. Scheduling it would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown that Kratom (Mitragynaspeciosa) does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.

I want to make it clear that I STRONGLY OPPOSE the intent to schedule Kratom as a controlled substance of any sort especially schedule 1.  \n\nI had an issue with opiates that stemmed from a prescription that a doctor gave me and it destroyed my life.  I was quitting a prescription for suboxone when I found Kratom and used it sparingly to cope with the withdrawal symptoms.  Suboxone helped me restructure my life by mending problems with family, making good friends, and retaining a job.  Problem I found is suboxone was more difficult to quit than the opiates I was addicted to.  When I got thru the suboxone withdrawals using Kratom I quit taking Kratom on a daily basis, I didn't find it anymore difficult to quit than when I quit drinking energy drinks.    \n\nWhen I went back to college to finish my associates degree I had trouble staying focused, keeping on task, and completing my responsibilities.  I have been treated for ADHD but had quit taking my ADHD medication when the opiates had become a problem.  I found that Kratom did a good job at helping me with my ADHD.  I found it is very difficult to get the right adhd medications as an adult.  When I had issues in college I found it very difficult to get put back on Adderall and it was the only medication that helped.  (Note: I never abused my Adderall as it helped me function as a normal person.)   I have been using Kratom as needed since college to help manage my ADHD. \n\nI cannot make any significant claims but I know that it has helped me to get my life in order: I finished my degree, found a job in industrial maintenance, met my wife, got married, bought a house, have something to show for all my hard work, and have been a model citizen.  I feel that Kratom had something to do with it and some of it may be a placebo effect.  I never found Kratom to do anything more than assist with my ADHD, help with opiate withdrawal, and give me energy like an energy drink.  I have never felt the need to take Kratom, its nothing more than needing a cup of coffee in the morning.  I was never able to get a high from it, if you take more than you need it doesn't do anything more than cause a headache and upset stomach.  I have a good friend (veteran) that uses Kratom to cope with PTSD and my wife started using it to cope with her arthritis.  My wife has rheumatoid arthritis and has suffered from it since she was two years old.  When she started using Kratom she was able to move from a part time position to full time.  The only other substance that would help all three of us would be if marijuana was legal, but its not.  \n\nI want what's best for people.  I also like to see people have access to what God has given us to cope with problems and heal.  I feel Kratom should be a regulated dietary supplement.  I want to know that the Kratom I purchase is only Kratom and not something with foreign substances laced within it.  I also feel that if Kratom was a regulated dietary supplement that the government should tax it so they can collect some revenue to help with infrastructure, schools, the war on drugs, ect.  I feel the whole point of scheduling Kratom is because it is ever so slightly cutting into the profits of the Pharmaceutical companies who lobby the government and DEA.  \n\nThe government is by the people for the people DEA included.  There have been no deaths directly linked to Kratom as the main culprit.  Silica gel packets and energy drinks are more of a problem to public health than Kratom by far.  Scheduling Kratom is going to do nothing more than: turn a bunch of productive members of society into criminal overnight, make money for the opiate black market and cartels, and put more money into the pockets of the pharmaceutical industry, and add to the heroin crisis in this country.  Its time for the DEA to stand behind the people, make Kratom a regulated dietary supplement.  In Canada Kratom is a regulated dietary supplement the same as it should be here.  Regulate Kratom as a supplement to keep its users safe and move on to coping with this country's opiate pandemic.  In short I can say Kratom saved my life and many other people should have the same access to Kratom as i did.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18354","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have seen Kratom help so many people that cant take prescription medication, it has helped so many people win the battle over dangerous addicting drugs, PLEASE keep Kratom free!!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0587","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"OPIOID USE, OVERDOSES AND DEATHS WILL ALL INCREASE IF YOU SCHEDULE KRATOM!

Eventually, I gave up on western psychiatry, and decide to use more holistic approaches to overcoming depression and sleep problems, such as meditation, diet, exercise, and herbal supplements.

It has also helped me tame my restless legs and sleep better. It has helped me find motivation to continue on with my daily life, get work done, and work on my creative projects. Things I had been previously struggling with. And all with no side noticeable side effects. Kratom is simply not dangerous. In a world where anyone can eat, drink, or smoke themselves to death, I cannot see any valid reason to ban a substance that, though understudied, has not been proven to cause death or any other adverse affects. I respect that the DEA is looking out for the public's best interest, but simply put, it is not fair to force someone to subscribe to the western medical system. I do not think children should consume or have access to kratom, but as adults it should be our right as to what kind of treatment we receive and what we put into our bodies.\nThank you.

About 10 days ago a friend of mine told me about kratom and I was having horrible withdrawals from running out of tramadol. My friend gave me some to try and it helped me with the horrible pain of withdrawals and allowed me to be able to sleep that night. The next day I purchased some more and I haven't taken anymore tramadol since then and it is more effective at treating my pain than tramadol ever was. If this gets made scheduled I will be forced to start taking tramadol or some other painkiller that I will build up tolerance to and end up having to take more just So I don't feel horrible.

I always bought online, from easily found reputable vendors. In the entire time, I never received a \"bad batch\". Previously in my life I was on the standard medical drugs for minor pain, depression and anxiety. I was an RN working ICU and I was stressed, sad, and overworked. Thanks to the standard MD prescribed medications I had TWO major car accidents and a host of other problems that came from being over-medicated by doctors. When I found kratom, I was able to get off ALL prescription drugs and improve my life DRASTICALLY. I have never had a car accident or other serious problem while using kratom. I have gone back to school for a STEM degree and I am a STRAIGHT A STUDENT. My life now is unrecognizable from the pathetic way I lived while under MD care. I have no anxiety, depression, or pain. I am a very productive member of society seeking to better the lives of everyone I can. I was able to free myself of opiod pain medication for twelve years now! If you take kratom away because 1 person died then let's be honest, you have to take away aspirin, Tylenol, etc. Heck, you probably have to take away cleaning supplies, as well. Dumb, crazy people can misuse ANYTHING!! Don't you want to ban cars because a few people have killed thrmselves with carbon monoxide in the garage? And most FDA approved drugs run the risk of death, as well. Ban all medication. See how ridiculous this is? A kratom ban will lead to a domino effect of pain and death for many people. Addicts will resume their old drugs, and may kill themselves or others.  People will seek alternative methods and find only more dangerous, less effective options. Not to mention how difficult you will make it for scientists to research kratom. Please, do the right thing. DO THE RIGHT THING. I am not in the class of a heroin user. Don't put me there. Regulating kratom would be a much better option then relegating it to the trash heap. How many people have to tell you it has a plethora of positive effects before you listen? Your job is to protect the public, NOT HARM US. Removing kratom would be devastating harmful at a time when opiod deaths are OUT OF CONTROL. Please put your energy on ACTUAL problems, not beneficial substances. Your getting your duties all mixed up over there.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1374","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Megan Meyers","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I find it completely absurd that the DEA wants to regulate kratom at this time, when for hundreds of years people have been using it as a remedy for pain, anxiousness, and depression with no ill effects reported. The cases of kratom related deaths I have read all have other drugs in the mix, which to me means that these cases shouldn't be used as reasonable cause to ban kratom completely. I personally have used kratom for mild to medium chronic back pain, and it has worked fabulously with no addictive qualities, ie: I can drink it for a week or two, and stop with no physical side effects... The same cannot be said for pharmaceutical drugs such as hydrocodon or oxycodon, which are prescribed  for such pain. These prescriptions also leave a large number of people addicted, and ultimately result in thousands of overdoses every year.

I found kratom approximately 6 years ago when my then pain management physician gave only a month's notice of retirement. It was next to impossible to get in to see a new doctor in a month's time so despite using my pain medications sparingly, I was left in severe pain after running out before securing a new doctor. I searched natural alternatives and found various natural supplements including kratom. I researched all of these supplements extensively before trying them and even upon deciding to try kratom, I was still skeptical it would even help but to my surprise, it did help. I do not take kratom for pain on a daily basis but more on an as needed basis and I have not found it to be addicting in any sense of the word. It does not alter my senses in any fashion, merely helps lessen the pain and gives a bit of an energy boost similar to the effect of drinking a tall Starbucks coffee. \n\nI do not believe kratom should be scheduled alongside such horribly addicting drugs as heroin as it simply is nothing like heroin, is not addictive and it is a natural dietary supplement, not a synthetic substance - in fact, a close friend of mine was able to help her adult child recover from heroin addiction using only kratom to lessen the withdrawal symptoms and then following that to lessen the cravings for heroin, and kratom was easy to stop after this process as it in itself is not addictive and does not cause any significant withdrawal symptoms. It also does not carry the often fatal side effect of respiratory depression making it much safer overall. The adult child is now a productive member of society again, working and raising their own children and I do not believe this benefit should be ignored at a time when heroin abuse is at an alarming epidemic rate within our country. Kratom is merely leaf material from a tree native to  Southeast Asia and it has been used for thousands of years without incident (the only problems attached to kratom involved polypharmacy or the use of other substances at the same time, such as benzodiazepines or narcotics, both of which should never be mixed with anything else without consulting the prescribing physician, or illicit substances and/or alcohol, again neither of which should ever be mixed). These instances where kratom was mixed with other substances are still far fewer in number than many household products that are deemed safe so this should not be a deciding factor for scheduling as personal responsibility plays a large role in polysubstance abuse.  Banning any of those substances will not magically cause polysubstance abuse to cease, the users will simply find other substances to abuse in their place, historically much more harmful substances as evidenced by the current rise of heroin and the illegally manufactured form of fentanyl in the face of prescription opiate medications being revoked by physicians, the latter of which were at least safe FDA-approved medications over dangerous street drugs. Addiction is not a substance issue, it is a person issue and until people address what it is inside of them that causes them to seek out escape and form addictive behaviors, whether that is a mental health issue, self-medicating a pain issue or post-traumatic stress due to prior traumas, this epidemic will rage on no matter how many substances are banned. \n\nIn conclusion, kratom helps many, many people and there simply is no reasonable logic to scheduling it alongside dangerous illicit substances such as heroin when there are so many benefiting from this plant. Those people would then be left with no help and I fear what would happen to so many who have found a better quality of life with the help of kratom. There will always be those people who trust a doctor and a prescribed medication over a natural supplement and who question the legitimacy of benefits from natural supplements, but in the end, in a free society, it should be our right to choose which is best for our own bodies and our own quality of life. At a time when pain management doctors are cutting back on prescription medications for pain, kratom and other natural supplements like are more necessary than ever to give people safe alternatives. Scheduling kratom would also halt research that is necessary and should be allowed to continue.  Please keep kratom legal and available for all free citizens of America.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18481","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Elizabeth Blevins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"kratom should be legal because it has no recorded deaths and because adults should have the choice of what they will or will not put in their own bodies.

I am 26 years old,  I have one child and currently work two jobs.  I've suffered with sciatica and arthritis for the past 11 or 12 years.\n I am writing you today in regards to the possibility of kratom becoming a scheduled drug. \nIf that were to happen, it would effect my life in an extremely negative manner.   I have used kratom (tea form) for a little over 2 years now.  Kratom changed my life in a way that's hard to even put in words.\nBefore kratom:  If I was lucky, I would get around 3-4 hours of sleep a night because to lay or sit  would put me in so much pain that I would cry.\nHolding a job down was nearly impossible for me.  \nSo, after months of physical therapy, tests and doctor visits I was told what I didn't want to hear....That the doctor was going to get me into pain management and from there I would be put on a regimen of pain pills(hydrocodone) and injections and that I would more than likely become dependent on the pills....but they said it was ok because it would be \"controlled\".    After hearing that, I panicked.  I immediately got in touch with a friend of mine who studies botany and herbal healing.   He suggested a number of things with kratom tea being one of them.  He sent me a package of sample bags of different kratom strains.    \nHere's where my story gets a little better.....\nAfter practically being up all night screaming in pain,  I put a small amount of kratom leaf into a pot of boiling water, I let it simmer for awhile and then strained it.  I poured a cup and tried everything I could to disguise the bitter taste.  I found honey helps...I drank a half cup of tea and waited....Within 10 minutes, the ache in my lower back faded away.  After 20, the sting in my legs went completely away!   That day was the first time since I was a child that for nearly 8 hours I did NOT hurt!  The pain never fully goes away but with kratom, it hurts 90% less.  \nToday,  I'm able to work a 10 hour day, in a warehouse doing manual labor and then come home and pick my daughter up over my head and put her on my shoulders.   I can now get up at 6:30am to get my daughter ready for school.  Before kratom, I could not.\nMy mood,  attitude and outlook on life are SO much different now!

I recently retired from an executive level position with State government with 28 years of service. I planned to work until I completed 35 years, then retire. My deteriorating health forced me into early retirement. Unfortunately, my pension benefits are much less than they would have been if I had been able to take a later retirement. Consequently, I am unable to afford the health insurance premiums under the \"Affirdable Care Act\". I am uninsured for the first time in my life. All my health care expenses are paid out of pocket.\n\nI suffer from multiple chronic conditions; the most debiliating of which are psoriatic arthritis, spinal stenosis and degenerative disc disease. I had several spinal surgeries when I still had insurance. I need additional surgery, and to seek the care of a specialist for my psoriatic arthritis - none of which I can afford. I have lived with debiliating pain for years, and now I can't afford even basic care.\n\nConstant pain and fatigue have greatly diminished my quality of life. A close family member had been taking Kratom for rheumatoid arthritis and she seemed to be much more mobile than she's been in quite some time. She helped me choose what and how much to use. That was over 3 years ago. \n\nKratom has definitely improved my quality of life. It has helped reduce my pain to a bearable level and gives me a slight boost in energy and mood.  My blood pressure is at the lowest it has been for quite some time. I am now enjoying my retirement and spending more time with my grandchildren. Kratom has been a blessing to me and so many others.\n\nI don't want to return to a life of unrelenting pain. Banning Kratom would be a tragedy for millions of people just like me.\n\nThank you for your consideration. \n \n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19761","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\ni am not a Kratom user but  based off of the Joe rogan Experience podcast Ep 876 ft: Chris Bell, it seems that  Kratom hasn't been fully researched, and seems to be a useful for medical purposes. i believe it needs to be evaluated and researched before we decide wether or not it should be illegal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15015","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Luis Cerda II","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was diagnosed with poly-peripheral-neuropathy in 2011.

I worked for AirEvac as a area mechanic. While working that job I had intense in my neck that required a three level neck surgery,  Two months after surgery a drunk driver hit me and my wife head on. I tried months of physical therapy and strong medication. I went back to work to AirEvac and was let go from my position due to intense pain that required heavy narcotics. Still to this day I suffer from chronic pain that requires me to stay home and can not support myself. I have tried oxycodone, percocet, opena, Valium, soma, many different anti-depressants to deal with the physical  pain and mental pain I deal with. I have had 5 epidural, radio frequency, 8 nerve blocks and 50 injections in the muscles to help for pain. I had a nuerostimulator installed on my spine to block pain signals which does not work. I ran out of hope and couldn't have any acceptance of my pain and mental prison I have been enduring. Until the I started using kratom. My pain medication has dropped dramatically to only when needed from 4 times a day, I'm able to sleep a full night now, I have weening off of my anti-depressants do to the stress release, relaxation and most of all my pain. If kratom is put as schedule 1 I will be back to the prison of pain and the mental prison that goes with hurting every second of every year. I will not be able to support my children and lead to a productive life I was experiencing for the first time in 3 years. Please do not take this plant away from people like me that strive for a better life and future with the help of kratom. I have had a very successful life before my neck and back surgery and pain. My glimmer of hope I have had will be gone with out kratom. My wife will lose her husband again and my children will lose their daddy again if I cannot use the pain relieving and antidepressant abilities of kratom. I will have a life of dependency on pain medicine and a dark view of the world again.

An estimated 40 million Americans suffer from an anxiety disorder. Unfortunately, I am one of those Americans and Kratom has helped me tremendouslya! I have been dealing with social anxiety, to be exact, since I was a little boy. After spending my high school years as a loner, I felt something needed to be done. After seeing a doctor, I was prescribed just about every anxiety medication out there trying to find that \"perfect\" one. Over the years, I began to realize this wasn't going to happen with all the negative side effects each one carried. By the end of it, I found myself addicted and even depressed that none of these medications really worked. At this point, I realized pharmaceuticals were not the answer. I began looking into alternatives. It was at this time I discovered Kratom. Being an all natural alternative for my anxiety, I was able to quite the addictive pharmaceuticals and all the negative side effects that come with them. I take Kratom on a regular basis as it helps with the social anxiety I experience on a daily basis. Kratom has been a lifesaver with barely any negative side effects. It's not addicting like the prescriptions I've been on before nor is it dangerous. Overdosing was a real concern as respitory depression is common with some of the stronger anxiety medications. Kratom does not cause respitory depression and therefor does not carry that danger. At worst it may cause nausea if too much is taken but that's it! I really believe Kratom has helped so many people just like me who want to live a more normal life without the dependence of precipitation medications. It would be a huge mistake to schedule kratom as there is so much potential with this plant. It is a safe and effective herbal supplement in coffee plant family that is nothing like Heroine or LSD that makes up schedule 1. At the very least, Kratom has medicinal benefits which would disqualify it from schedule one. I do not oppose regulations on Kratom to ensure purity and adult aged usage but schedule 1 is absolutely wrong. I hope I can continue to use this miracle plant in my life. My quality of life is so much better now and I do not want to go back to the way it was on prescription drugs. I really hope you will consider my experience when making a decision on Kratom.

I was in a great deal of pain from the donor site of the bone graft that never healed properly, as well as debilitating nerve pain from the operation.  The oxycodone relieved the pain but had unpleasant side effects; moreover, I was concerned about dependence. I decided to research alternative analgesics and found discussion of kratom on many spine/fusion forums,  I never filled my last script for oxycodone and have been using kratom since August. The kratom relieves my pain without a \"high.\" If I had wanted to get high, I would have obtained a medical marijuana card, as I qualify due to FBSS.  Pain relief and ability to function at my job and at home (college professor) were key criteria for my exploration of an opioid alternative. Both criteria have been met with kratom. If I had not come across kratom, i would have continued on opioid medications and would not be able to effectively teach my students. Please do not create barriers to obtaining kratom for pain relief.  Many individuals with chronic pain do not wish to use medical marijuana. The alternatives to opioids are slim to none.

First there is no solid proof, of Kratom alone harming anyone short of upset stomachs when taken in large amounts. Second, it is being shown to help countless people with medical issues, from chronic pain to mental health, and addiction. While there isn't any definitive proof yet of its benefits and even potential negative side affects, I believe there should be more research done before judging this natural plant. To simply label this a schedule 1 controlled substance without any evidence of either is irresponsible and could be putting peoples lives at stake who seem to desperately need this. \n\nI do not use Kratom myself, though I am not opposed to trying it responsibly for natural pain relief.

I am a 33 year old industrial radiographer. I use kratom  to manage pain from a burst fracture in three of my lower vertebrae's . I have been addicted to prescribed medication and also to heroin and methadone. I finally quit everything  when I just couldn't handle the addiction any longer. I found Kratom  when searching for an alternative to the legal and highly addictive pain killers  like Norco and OxyContin. Being able to legally  take Kratom has been life-changing because it isn't addicting like  opiates and opioids yet it still provides pain relief  without such negative side effects as the potent legal opioids. I understand it's probability  for abuse because it does have some SLIGHT euphoric attributes to it but like anything it's up to the individual to be moderate.  It is possible to take too much coffee or Redbull and die from it. Even too much water can kill you!. It's up to the person  and I believe the focus of our regulators should be to inform the people, not inhibit them. We freely give our patients synthetic opiates which are extremely addictive, to ween them off of heroin.  It is easier and quicker to get a Suboxone strip today then it is to get Kratom and that is because suboxone has an ingredient that prevents the person from using opiates but it is from my understanding many many more times as powerful and addictive as heroin and it gets you high. The reason someone would abuse Kratom or try to get high off of it is because there isn't the same stigma as there is with something like heroin. You don't  have to use a needle. Suboxone is in the same boat where as there is not such a stigma so it has  a likelihood of being used to get high. As I understand it has potency  many many more times than heroin itself and is easy to get because it is legal.  I believe I would get sick and throw up before I could take as much kratom as it would take to overdose on it.   I don't believe it is any more addicting than coffee let alone as addicting as heroin or opioids like Suboxone and methadone which are legal . If our government and the DEA would like to do something for the people they would keep Kratom legal so it can be studied for it to use as a medical treatment  opiate an opioid addicts and pain management  instead of using something as dangerous and extremely addicting as norco, Subutex, or methadone which again are legal and Suboxone is as easy to get, easier then kratom because it's so freely prescribed and used. Kratom isn't the problem with drugs and abuse. It is the SOLUTION.

However, certain extracts, which provide a highly concentrated version of its alkaloids should be outlawed or at least restricted to the realm of medicinal research and the like. It is these extracts which cause most problems with liver damage, addiction, and overuse of the plant.  Overall, kratom is much less harmful than alcohol & even most mainline medicinal opiates. It should remain easily accessible, without the requirement of a prescription, because of the high costs of medicine & health insurance. It provides a safe and affordable alternative for those who do not wish to destroy their lives with alcohol, heroin, or morphine. The fact that its effects are pleasurable should play no part in a legislative decision, because, as I have said, it is the potentiated extracts which cause the most trouble in this regard. The effects of natural, unpotentiated kratom, in its powdered form (as well as powder in capsules), are mild compared to current medicinal opiates & compared to the potentiated extracts. Furthermore, alcohol is used for the sole purpose of the enjoyment of its pleasurable effects, & causes widespread destruction, while it remains legal. If we trust our citizens to make responsible choices concerning alcohol, how much more should we trust them to be responsible about their use of a drug as h relatively harmless as kratom? Not everyone who drinks is an alcoholic. Not everyone who uses kratom is a junkie. And besides, we don't let the existence of alcoholics cause us to make the substance illegal for everyone. The same principle should apply to kratom. There are responsible users who greatly benefit from the drug & for whom it has been & continues to be a tremendous blessing in their lives which allows them to be better contributors for the overall good of our society. Kratom is a gift from our good Lord, and, used with a respectful acknowledgement of that truth, is not a hindrance, but rather a stimulus, to American productivity.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8173","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern,\n\nThank you.

I was in an auto accident 12 years ago. My back was pretty screwed up and I had a broken femur. My doctor prescribed me Oxycodone  after the first 8 months of my accident, over time it became less effective for the pain and I started experiencing withdraw symptoms although at the time I didn't understand what they were. I tried other doctors for more pain medication but it eventually led me to look for an easier alternative, I began dabbling in heroin. \n     I know what you might think but I'm not some junkie,  I'm a college educated drilling rig operator with a Class A CDL and an impressive resume. I've never once in life used a needle to inject anything. The heroin came in small stamp bags and you could snort it, you didn't have to inject it and one or two bags a day would end up replacing 8-12 oxy pills..... eventually the heroin went the same way as the pills and I needed more and more, at this point it's been maybe 2-3 years since my accident... I felt like it was starting to negatively effect my life, not just financially but the constant pressure of trying not to get caught with a schedule one drug on me.... \n     Finally I started looking into treatment, I work and i'm from a single income family so going into a 28 day program is all but impossible without failing those who depend on me. I tried a handful of suggestions online but just couldn't break away. So I signed up into a suboxone program... I spent a year there, and expected at some point they would wean me down but it never happened.... it was just another perpetual replacement for yet another addiction. After a year I decided I'd do it on my own, I took my last month of suboxone, and tried slowly stepping my way down but when I finally ran out of pills I was sicker than I ever remember, it was far worse than being sick from prescription pills or heroin, a sickness so bad that it made it hard to even function as a person and this wasn't something that disappeared quickly. I spent 22 days running to the toilet, cold sweats, restless legs every night. It was like a personal hell.... So I signed back up into another program after 22 days of trying to get over the withdraw symptoms from Suboxone... Day one I was fine, back to the same as always like it was a bad dream, but here I was, stuck back on suboxone with a family in my 30's so I  started researching things that would help so I could try again.... \n    That's when I came across Kratom, I ordered several 1oz  bags online from one of the sites with high reviews. Once it arrived I began weaning myself down from the Suboxone again, after a couple weeks I was back down to doing only an 1/8 of a pill a day and even splitting that in half. Then I quit, The first 3 days weren't bad, by the 4th day it was back to the same miserable feelings as the first attempt. I opened and mixed up 4 grams of the Kratom I had received. It was disgusting because I mixed it in a shot glass with a little milk, reminded me of eating raw cinnamon, but I managed to wash it down. I was skeptical but after an hour or two my withdraw symptoms began to ease. I'd take 4 grams in the morning, afternoon, and at night with a sleep aid. I did this for a month and then started taking 3 grams 3x a day of kratom, then cut out the afternoon dose of it, then down to 2.... Over the course of 5 months I managed to complete wean myself off of Suboxone and then the Kratom.... \n     I personally had zero withdraw symptoms coming off the kratom. I didn't crave it like I did the suboxone or the oxycodone or the heroin and I'm happy to say I've been completely drug free for 3 years this January. I sincerely don't believe that I would be able to say this if not for the relief I received from taking Kratom. With the addiction epidemic across the nation we should be looking more into safer alternatives to help people over come addiction. Please don't let lobbyists or big pharma push this alternative onto the Schedule I list without taking the time to give Kratom an honest, thorough review. It's not an exaggeration to say that people's lives are depending on it. Thanks for taking the time to hear my story.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1873","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Roger Hornberger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom works for numerous people without any harm to anyone.

I oppose the DEAs plan to  place mitragyna speciosa and it's active alkaloid mitragynine (found in the plant kratom) on the schedule 1 list. \n\nI have found great relief in taking kratom as a supplement for my depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I steep the crushed kratom leaves in water and drink it after it steeps for about 3 minutes, in addition to taking my prescribed daily medications and regularly seeing my doctors. Since my discovery of this plant one year ago, I have been much happier and healthier than when I was on my medication alone. \n\nI feel as if I have been lifted out of the anxiety, fear, and pain that have been consuming my life for the past ten years. I can go out into crowds (at a store, at the movies, etc) without having an anxiety attack and without the fear that once made me not enjoy being out in public. I am better managing my stress levels, and can stop an active panic attack from taking me over completely, whereas before I would suffer for hours on end. In fact, my panic attacks have been greatly reduced overall. In the past year, I would say Ive only had one real panic attack; where before I was having an attack a couple times a month. Kratom has also helped me increase my socialization with others - which has greatly improved my quality of life. I have been able to reconnect with family and friends in an emotional way that I was unable to do previously. This supplement has really changed my life. \n\nAlong with the many benefits that I have seen from taking this supplement, the properties of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine include a mechanism for slowing down opioid tolerance, which could help so many people get away from opioid addiction. Also kratom does not cause respiratory depression, which is the leading factor of death in opioid overdoses.

At 19 years old I was told that I would be in a wheelchair by the time I was 30 and that my life would be managed with pharmaceutical drugs and physical therapy. Determined to change that outcome I set my life course to become as healthy as I could by eating right, exercising right, and using herbs and vitamins to control my symptoms and for the most part this worked well for me. For about 15 years I managed to hold off what doctors told me I couldn't avoid. But by the time I was 35 the disease had set in and was taking over my body. I began to suffer from debilitating muscle spasms in my neck and back and this would be the first time I ever took prescription pain pill to control the pain associated with MS, degenerative disc disease and spondylosis. Needless to say it didn't take long for the prescription opioid medication to take over my life. Within five years of taking my first pill I was addicted and just like everybody else began a course of abuse and dependence on the opioid pain medication. By the time I was 40, whatever left of my life that wasn't robbed by the disease was now under siege by the pain medicine and my life resembled no kind of living. I was merely existing to wake up, take pain medicine and go back to sleep. It would be another two years before Kratom was introduced to me and I would gain control of my life again. Kratom not only helps to manage the pain associated with MS, degenerative disc disease, and spondylosis but it also helped me break my addiction to the pain medicine that I thought I would be slaved to forever. I would later learn through my experience with kratom how bad my addiction to the opiate pain pills actually was and how the opiate pain pills contributed to the problem and the pain. Now I'm able to manage my symptoms, which range from pain, to issues with balance and, restless leg syndrome and anxiety with two simple teaspoons of Kratom each morning. In discovering Kratom's fantastic benefits it has not only given me my life back but I can afford to live as well. Where I was once unable to work and function in society I now hold a managerial position and work up to 60 hours a week at times because I'm functioning in life. My days are no longer consumed by countless doctors appointments and pharmacy errands. Kratom has returned the quality of my life to me and I shudder to think what will happen to me if Kratom is taken away or made unavailable or becomes ridiculously so expensive I can't buy it. This just can't happen. I also feel it's important to mention that while I was on the opiate pain meds my blood pressure had to be control with blood pressure meds because I could it get it under 165/99. Now my blood pressure is a steady 110/88 without meds to control it and all I take is Kratom. Before Kratom I was on 3 different pain meds, BP meds, anxiety meds, depression meds, nerve meds, and steroids! I've replaced all that with two teaspoons of Kratom each day and I am not only living but I am ALIVE! \n\nKratom is safe based on my 5 years of experience. I have never had any adverse reactions to Kratom and I can't say enough how my life has steadily improved since the day I discovered Kratom. \n\nPlease don't take it away from me!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7799","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christine Veit","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is Ben I had a shoulder surgery and was taking a lot of pain medicine for the pain was starting to get dependant on them and they were less effective and had such a hard time getting them prescribed because of the abuse, then I found kratom and safe and effective alternative to pain medicine which helped me beyond any pain pill could ever do.

Though I got clean initially through an inpatient facility (at a cost kd TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars), the few lapses and relapses amI have succumbed to have been eased and banished through the judicious use of Kratom.  Other close friends and loved ones have used it to successfully cease using prescription and non-prescription opiods, and then were able to easily stop using Kratom when its intended purpose had passed.\n\nI have seen several chronic pain patients use Kratom preferential to their prescribed opioods, citing it as being \"softer\", easier on their system, and easier to take less of (or ONLY when necessary) .\n\ni have also known a number of anxiety patients who use Kratom sparingly to ease their acute anxiety.\n\nKratom MUST be fully investigated. It must NOT be placed in DEA Schedule 1 which would effectively stop not only all legal use, but ALL legal research on this truly novel plant. Its properties, which have proven themselves by and large safe at all reasonable consumption levels, must be investigated in order to replicate their effects, discover the molecular and neural bases of their actions, and begin adding to the FDA's pharmo-copia in order to supplement and replace current pain, anxiety, addiction, and depression controlling substances.\n\nPLEASE. Do NOT repeat the embarrassment of \"Reefer Madness\", consistently ignoring evidence until the rest of the world discovers strong medicinal properties and the ballot box forces the DEA to recognize this. \n\nWith Kratom, the DEA and FDA have the chance to be world leaders, fostering new lines of inquiry and new pharmacological paths to new and effectice medicines. Medicines that can, in fact, directly and indirectly affect the current prescription and non-prescriptipn opiod epidemics, the wide spread mental suffering of depression and anxiety, and a potentially effective tool in both pain control and addiction treatment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20771","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Verhoff","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"}],"totalNumRecords":23226}
