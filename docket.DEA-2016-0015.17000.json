I had taken these medications for years, but because of new regulations (not medical need), these medications were both taken away from me at the same time... I had bad physical reactions, but tried Kratom soon after I heard about it, which not only helped alleviate the pain, if only minor relief, but to my surprise, it also helped with the withdrawal symptoms I had been experiencing! \nI was very excited to share this information with others I know, and Kratom has similarly helped others who I personally know. It takes away most of the unpleasant side effects of withdrawal, and that alone makes it worth keeping it legal, especially in a time of such rampant addiction (which knows no income barrier) in these United States... Kratom is about as addictive as coffee, which has 10x more calls to the Poison Control Center each year than Kratom has had in ten years. \nOur DEA (and other Federal Agencies) are supposed to be in place to help to do what is best for The American People, as a whole... Please keep Kratom as unscheduled, as it has such potential to be a wonder supplement for everyone... \nThank you, Victoria Morgan ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8140","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Victoria Morgan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\nTo whom it may concern:\nI am a 38 year old female in the health profession,  6 years sober. \n\nI owe much of this to Kratom.

I  also have taken over seventy plus hours in the field of Plant and Soil Science through NCTC and Texas Tech University.  I also suffer from severe arthritis and back pain.  Due to this I was dependent on opiates for over 10 years.  They ruined my life, I could not hold a job, and once I could not get pills to help the pain I turned to hard drugs and weed to curb the constant pain.  Eventually it ruined my marriage and my parents got my kids because I went to jail.  I since then moved by my parents and have turned my life around thanks in a great part to being able to stay off pain meds with Kratom.  I have noticed none of the negative side effects and take aprox five grams of white vein during the day and then red vein before bed.  I have found that Kratom not only helps with the pain and can give you energy or rest depending on the strain you choose, it also helps with the anxiety and stress of chronic pain.  As well as my personal use my girlfriend of three years uses much smaller doses to deal with her PTSD from losing three babies, two to premature labor and one tubal pregnancy.  She often has mental breakdowns and feels she has failed in her goal of having a child.  She uses about two grams in capsule for and it helps her from crying and having anxiety attacks.  Please do not take this miraculous plant away I have rebuilt an active and great relationship with my kids, am doing great at work, and like I said have no side effects like from pain meds or drugs.  Making Kratom a schedule one substance only helps the pharmaceutical industry and government, and only hurts the recovering humans who need it.  Isolating its active compounds completely destroys the freedom of those of us who choose freedom and Kratom.  Those of us who have been failed by the government and the medical industry.  It is wrong and un-constitutional and those who wish to do so should be immediately removed from their position of authority.

I had a severe injury when I was 18 years old. Up until that point I had never tried a single drug in my life, never smoked a cigarette, never even drank a beer. I was very straight edge and anti drugs. In fact, I looked up to the DEA, believing that they were doing good work taking down big bad drug dealers and fighting the cartels. I was a stupid nave kid. I ended up falling two stories off a zip cord and breaking eight vertebrae in my spine. I was in a wheelchair for weeks and in immense pain. The doctors put me on a drug they told me was safe and not addictive. This drug was OxyContin&and it ruined my life.\n        I spent the next thirteen years becoming more and more addicted to the pain meds and the doctors tried me out on everything as my tolerance grew and would still not manage the pain. I began to lose jobs, act out, my family and friends were terrified and sent me to rehab. I spent many years in numerous rehabs, jails, and psych wards until I finally had enough. I tried to get clean with methadone. It didn't work. It was just another addiction. Then I was told about suboxone and my insurance covered it for three years. For those three years, I stayed out of trouble, held down a job, had my own place again and had a steady girlfriend. I ended up losing my insurance and subsequently, could no longer afford the suboxone. So I went back to pain management and was put on dilaudid. This started the worst years of my life. The dilaudid was only effective if injected I was told (BY THE DOCTOR!) so this quack who is now serving time and lost his practice actually encouraged me to start abusing my prescribed medicine intravenously. I began shooting up. This is when the overdoses started to occur. I overdosed over fourteen times in a six month period, had over a dozen friends die from overdoses, suicides or murders all related to opiates. I couldn't afford the dilaudid anymore and was introduced to heroin. I lost everything. I became homeless and even had my own brother who was married with two young kids die from an accidental overdose as he was a pharmacy tech going to school to be a pharmacologist but was introduced to the wonders of opiates by me, his own brother. And he died when I was serving a year in jail for selling fifteen of my prescribed Vicodin pills to an undercover MBI (DEA) agent and charged with first degree trafficking in heroin. After I was released on ten years probation I still abused drugs and got away with it because they were being prescribed to me. More overdoses followed and I eventually tried to commit suicide. Most of my overdoses were complete flat line ods, but this was intentional and my heart stopped, my breathing stopped and I was dead for minutes. They eventually brought me back with multiple shots of narcan and a defibrillator and put me in a medically induced coma for eight days. When I came to, I vowed never to used drugs again, and checked into another rehab after spending six months in a critical care unit of a psych ward. While in rehab, I discovered this herb, kratom which I did a ton of research and found out was about as addictive as coffee, but would help with not only the withdrawals from the opiates, but would also help the cravings subside and help with my pain. Three years later I have been completely drug free and I use kratom on a daily basis. It helped save my life. I am now married to the most wonderful woman ever (and she even uses kratom on occasion I'd her menstrual cramps are bad) and she is the most anti drug person I've ever known , my family is not only talking to me but enjoys having me around, and my Mom who abhors drugs because of what she's seen them do to her own family loves that I've found  kratom and that it not only helps my pain and cravings, but has also given me my life back. I'm writing you this letter letting you know that if you take kratom and ban it in December, many people, myself included will be in a horrible and terrifying position. I never want to be on opiates again. And kratom is NOT an opiate. It is a partial opiate agonist. I'm not going to go into the science for you, but I am pleading with you that you keep kratom legal. Regulate it if you have to. Make it 18 and up if you have to, but please don't take the plant away from me that helps me live a productive and full life. I don't want to be another statistic in the opiate epidemic that if you ban kratom will only get even worse. Thank you for your time.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAaron Thomas Gombar","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8460","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Aaron Gombar","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't ban kratom, that would be counterproductive, worsening our nation's opioid crisis.

I sustained substantial trauma to my feet and ankles. I had to undergo 3 surgeries. Now I have a steel plate and 7 screws in the heel of my left foot and no cushion between where my ankle and leg bone meet, on my right foot. I have chronic pain, Restless Leg Syndrome, and arthritis in my hips now, because of the way I walk. After my orthopedic surgeon released me, I was then referred to a pain management doctor. On my first visit, the doctor prescribed my 120 hydrocodone, 90 morphine and 120 neurotonin a month. I did what the doctors told me and, after a year, the doctor decided that I needed to see a psychiatrist. They scheduled an appointment for me the following week and, after two visits with him, I was prescribed Xanax, Seroquiel, and Paxil. Between these two doctors, I was taking 6 prescriptions. I couldn't function. I would lose days at a time. I could not do things with my daughter, and my memory was non-existent. I could not work. I was a walking zombie. I finally had had enough. I quit taking all 6 prescriptions, cold turkey, and the withdrawals were hell. I thought I was going to die, literally. I made it through the withdrawals, but my chronic pain and my diagnosed anxiety, PTSD, and depression were back in full force !!! Then a friend told me about Kratom. I did my research, and ordered a few samples. Kratom made my life better. Kratom helped me get my life back. I now enjoy refinishing furniture, which I sell. I feel better. The pain is still there, but I am a functioning member of society now. I am happy. I feel NORMAL again. (Like I did before the wreck). Most importantly, I get to enjoy my daughter again...and she's happy to have her mom back. We laugh together, we have \"girls day out\", go shopping, or, sometimes, we just sit out on the porch talking and playing with our dogs. My daughter told me the other day, \"Iam glad your back, Mama\". I just cried and smiled and said \"I am glad I am back too\".\nDO NOT take that away from me or my daughter !!! DEA, you have no idea how many lives you are going to destroy. I have no side effects from taking Kratom. It DOES NOT impair me in any way.\n I have gone several days without taking kratom and I have no negative side effects from it. It's kinda like having a really good cup of coffee in the morning. It gives me a sense of well-being. \n I am not going back to any doctors. I REFUSE !! You cannot ban something that has changed my life for the better and helped give me my family back. You will take away my freedom from something I have worked very hard to overcome, my chronic pain. I can continue to do this with Kratom. If you take Kratom away from my family and I, you might as well put me 6 feet under, because that is what it would be for me...a death sentence. \nWe, as Americans, have the right to make our own choices. That is what this country was built on. This is my body and my life !!

For 20 months now, I have been able to not only remain sober, but also to be active again. Being a better father, better artist and most importantly, helping other addicts and alcoholics with their journey through sobriety. \n\nIf the plant is banned, I fear a large amount of people will go back to their old habits, which pose risks to their physical and mental health. Especially with the current opioid and heroin issue, this plant SAVES these people's lives! By October's end, the numbers will be staggering. I have personally helped many addicts use kratom to successfully treat opioid dependence and get their lives back on track.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5167","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Kelly","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"November 21, 2016\n\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nI was asked by my patient, Dawna Thurber, to write a letter on her behalf to ask that Kratom not be placed into a DEA Schedule 1 category. This letter does not represent the stance of the company I work for in any way. \n\nDawna reports to me a history of chronic back pain. At one point she ended up on 400 mg of MS Contin daily to control her pain. She has also taken methadone, oxycodone and Dilaudid at times in the past as her pain has been severe. Dawna reports that she was able to decrease the MS Contin down to 45 mg daily by using Kratom. She states that it helps her pain, mood and energy. In addition to decreasing her pain medication, she has also been able to get off of several antidepressants. I found her story amazing and so I looked into this plant product online. I was surprised at what I read about it as there were many reports of it helping people with opioid dependence, chronic pain and addiction. \n\nBased on all of this as well as what I've read online, I do not feel that Kratom should be scheduled in category 1. Placing this plant into category 1 would not only limit patients in options to natural products that may help them wean off of opioids, but it would also limit physician's and scientist's ability to research this natural product. In a time when there is an opioid dependency epidemic, this is particularly inappropriate. While there are concerns with this natural product's potent potential for harm in the community, there seems to be much more potential for benefit. While things that can cause serious harm due to overdose, such as alcohol, are legal it makes no logical sense to classify this into a Schedule 1 category. \n\nMore research is needed on this before a decision is made as to how to categorize Kratom. Thank you for allowing input from the community at large on this.  While this is a legal matter, it would be wise to include input from the medical community, in particular doctors, before a final decision is made. \n\nSincerely,\nElizabeth Beal, D.O.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9140","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Elizabeth Beal","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement\nkratom. There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it!

Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

I am a tax paying, home owning, married father of two children.\nI  strongly oppose placing Kratom on the Schedule 1 list of controlled substances.  There are many studies that show that Mitragyna Speciosa, and  it's many beneficial alkaloids are not toxic, not dangerous, and less addictive than caffeine is.  Our country has limited resources, and Schedule 1 controlled substances should be limited to actually dangerous substances, NOT tree leaves like Kratom, which has been safely used for thousands of years.\n\nI began using Kratom over 10 years ago.  It helps me in many safe and effective ways to diminish my lower back pain, and bouts of diverticulitis.  I have never felt addicted to to it, nor have I encountered any negative side effects.  Since using Kratom my over-all health has improved dramatically. 10 years ago, I needed and was prescribed anti depressants and narcotic pain medication, which had terrible effects on my well being.  I no longer use any narcotics nor anti-depressants, and over the course of the past 10 years, have never felt better.  I am careful to only buy Kratom from vendors who test the material that they sell to make sure that it is unadulterated.\n\nThere are many studies that have been done on Kratom, and banning Kratom now drastically curtail further study of this amazing plant.  I believe that we should study Kratom further.  There are already indications that much of the plant's make up could be highly beneficial in the fight against the opiate epidemic in this country and around the world.  Banning this plant will have a disastrous impact on my life and the lives of many other law abiding citizens, who are productive members of society.\n\nThank you for all of the good work that  many in your organization try to do.

It feels safe. I've used it for 3 weeks consecutively and had no issues dropping it all for a week. No symptoms of any sort of withdrawal were noticed. \n\nPlease, do not ban kratom. Instead, I challenge you to research it first. This war on \"drugs\" (that is actually a war herbs/plants/food) has got to stop. These are naturally occurring things put here for us as humans to use. \n\nIt is infringement upon our rights as human beings if kratom is banned.\n\nThank you for reading.

It had been a slow progression that I hadn't been able to stop.  A serious incident happened because of my drinking that put my life on the line, and I finally woke up to the pain I was causing other around me.  I quit drinking, and every other substance, cold turkey.  With that, other problems that my drinking had been suppressing returned ten-fold--depression like a thick fog, day in and day out; anxiety from both problems immediate and abstract that caused panic attacks at regular intervals; and suicidal thoughts that I couldn't shake.  I didn't believe I could go on living.  I knew I couldn't, and didn't want to, drink anymore, or turn to any harder substance.  I talked to therapists and a psychiatrist but nothing seemed to help.  Then I ordered kratom, which I had heard a friend talk about helping them with anxiety and opiate withdrawal.  \n\nVery subtly, from the day I started having a half-teaspoon with my morning tea, I began to change.  Life looked different--more interesting, less dark.  I was able to get back to the things I love, reading books and writing creatively, re-establishing relationships with my family and good friends, and working hard at my college school work and my job.  I had more energy, and those around me noticed.  I was clear-headed for the first time in ages.  I didn't want to drink, I didn't want to harm myself, I just wanted to live.  I completed my history thesis, an unimaginable task in the shape I was in previously, and got top marks on it.  I graduated soon after that, moved to a new city and found a great job.  I'm reliable to my employer, day in and day out, and haven't called out sick in over a year.  I break no laws, and am engaged in my community.  I love life today.  All I want to do is live, contribute to society, and be an asset to those around me.  And all I need to do this is a half teaspoon of kratom along with my morning coffee.  Please do not make me a criminal.  \n\nI know what being drunk feels like.  I know what being high feels like.  Kratom brings on none of these effects.  My health is better than it ever has been, and my family and friends who've known me through all the ups and downs are grateful to have my back.  The scare in October made me afraid for my life.  There is nothing to gain from criminalizing this plant.  Please, I urge you, study it.  See what it can treat, from pain management to addiction to depression and anxiety.  It is non-lethal, safe, and as mild as caffeine.  I can't explain how it works, but it has saved my life.  I really, truly, hope you make the right choice.

I am a personal trainer, so my job demands a high level of physical activity. I suffered in silence until 2011, finally went to my GP, he diagnosed the issue, and did his best considering the fact I couldn't afford the surgery to repair the tears, the impingements, and the severe arthritis that had developed on my AC joint. He prescribed an opiate based regiment of pain relief. \nFinally, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, I was able to get the surgery to repair all the issues in my shoulder. The surgery worked brilliantly!  No more pain whatsoever in my shoulder. I was elated to say the least. After the surgery however, I now had a new serious problem. I had developed an incredibly severe dependence to opiate based pain pills. With no reason to prescribe pain pills any longer, and after a thorough attempt to ween off of opiates. It wasn't effective. I became incredibly ill and was not able to function as a productive member of society. I tried everything, turmeric, valerian root, you name it, if I thought there was a chance of releasing me from my dependence on opiates. The next step my GP recommended was a chronic care specialist, and I was told that suboxone or methadone would be my options. Basically I would simply have to trade one addiction for another. While out of the state on a business trip (Texas in their infinite wisdom has not banned Kratos as a narcotic...considering it absolutely is not a narcotic, rather a simple herbal supplement) I discovered kratom. This supplement changed my life forever. I now no longer need a narcotic to change my quality of life. I began using kratom as a stop gap to prevent the use of any addictive narcotics. Today I am completely opiate, or opiate substitute free. And I would never have been able to accomplish this without the use of kratom. In short, this brilliantly useful herbal supplement completely changed my life. I no longer crave opiates. I no longer need to use the black market to procure opiates to keep from being \"sick\". My quality of life has been greatly enhanced, and I am once again a productive member of society. And I owe it all to a simple herb...kratom. there's hope for the future again, and I am no longer chained to the ugly, vicious cycle of opiate abuse. \nI owe my current state of life to kratom. Making it illegal, or banning it as a narcotic is a ridiculous  witch hunt. It has none of the properties of pain pills, NO EUPHORIA, NO WITHDRAWALS, NO UGLY ADDICTION. \nI beseech you members of Congress, law enforcement, and even the President of these United States, do not categorize this herbal supplement as a scheduled narcotic, as it absolutely changes lives for the better, with no characteristics of a narcotic whatsoever! \nThank you for youre time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22437","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dakoda Buck","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"A friend who has been my friend for 40 years is having such relief from  Kratom.

However, I'm fully aware of the constant pain and agony associated with injury and arthritis and know how debilitating it can be. The answer in the United States has always been opiates. I do not need to educate anyone who has ever been on opiates or has known someone who takes opiates about the danger in these pills. We know they're dangerous. We know they kill. We know they are addictive and were designed specifically to be addictive. That is not to take away from the people who manage their opiate addiction well or have successfully gotten off opiates. Some people are successful in that regard and will continue to be successful. But we can't keep pretending this flawed system is the only solution to chronic, long-term pain. Kratom is as natural as any other substance used to alleviate pain and has virtually none of the drawbacks. Could it have some serious drawbacks? Yes, of course. We have not yet studied it in depth enough and don't have nearly enough data to know for certain. What we do know for certain is it's incredible ability to alleviate pain, elevate mood and well being (having taken ibuprofen for many years, some mood elevation is simply the fact that you are not constantly worried about pain when it is eliminated; some of that could just be a natural response to the lack of chronic pain), and it does not exhibit the addictive/toxic properties associated with opiates. When a drug such as Vicodin binds to an opiate receptor, the process of addiction has in essence already begun. Those receptors gobble up the drug like a shark smelling blood in the water. What makes Kratom unique is that when it binds to an opiate receptor, it binds in a way that is not nearly as extreme. Your body literally metabolizes it differently and in a way that makes it, possibly, non-addictive. Again, we do not have enough information to make either all positive or all negative remarks on it. But the fact that it exhibits the same healing properties as some of our most powerful drugs in a way that is totally different than what we've been accustomed to should be reason enough to at least investigate the merit of this drug. Millions of Americans suffer from chronic pain. I am not discrediting the effectiveness of opiates. I am simply suggesting that, based on evidence, there is enough reason to consider kratom for scientific study and open-minded investigation. We cannot deny that it has already had a powerfully positive influence on the people who have gone out of their way to use it. Should we decide to ban even as evidence of it's potential superiority to older methods continues to mount, I truly believe we are depriving millions of Americans a powerful tool that could assist them in their day to day lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10693","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Haden Lee Konopik","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Daniel Lloyd, I am in favor of keeping kratom legal so that consenting adults may continue to use it to treat pain and anxiety or for recreational use.\nThank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13850","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Lloyd","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not schedule this beneficial plant.

I am writing this in the hope that the DEA will decide in favor of not scheduling the plant known as Kratom. As an Emergency Medical Technician, my profession requires a lot of heavy lifting, as well as having to see and deal with situations that no one should ever have to see. I have tried numerous prescription medications for pain, anxiety, and depression, but every one had side effects that made taking them almost unbearable. For me (and numerous others from the countless testimonies I have read online), Kratom not only relieves physical pain, but it also greatly reduces stress levels and promotes a sense of calm, happiness, and general well-being. Being a pain reliever/anti-anxiety/anti-depressant all in one, it really is a miracle plant. In contrast to prescription medications to treat the aforementioned symptoms, Kratom seems to possess little to no addictive qualities, and has little to no side effects. After stopping taking Kratom after taking it for an extended period during a back injury, no significant withdrawal symptoms were noticed (nothing compared to prescription medications anyway). This plant really has helped me on so many different levels, and has given me my life back. I have also read numerous reports of people using the Kratom plant to lessen withdrawal symptoms from discontinuing opiates and opioids, making it easier for them to break their addiction and get back to leading a normal life. Referencing the definition of a Schedule I drug from WWW.DEA.GOV: \"Schedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\", for me and numerous others, this plant has had numerous benefits in treating medical conditions, with little to no potential for abuse. I hope this testimony has served to help bring to light that this plant really is doing a lot of good for a lot of people. Thank you for your time and consideration.

I can't explain it, but it works. I have never felt a tinge of addiction or craving for it and routinely stop taken it for weeks at a time without any side effects.

Cohn and I am a 41-year-old audio engineering professional in Santa Rosa, CA.  I have safely used kratom for many years to help with my anxiety, depression and, most importantly, past prescription pain medication abuse.\n\nHowever, in my opinion, mine is not a story that fully captures the most vital importance of kratom.  While I did abuse prescription opioids, at that time it did not get in the way of my ability to be a responsible, productive member of society.  However, my addiction did cause certain problems in my life, and upon discovering kratom I found myself entirely losing interest in abusing pain meds (which was not even something that I was setting out to do in the first place) and thus able to step away from a bad habit that I didn't think I had any control over otherwise.\n\nAnd, since the announcement by your organization to try to put kratom on the Schedule 1 list of controlled substances, I've now become aware that there are also millions of other US citizens who have safely and successfully used kratom to help with far worse conditions than I have suffered, including many of our military veterans who have used it to help overcome the effects of otherwise-debilitating PTSD, chronic pain-sufferers and many, many more. \n\nBanning kratom would cause the quality of life for millions of Americans to be made far worse, and in some cases it would prove to be fatal to many of our most vulnerable citizens; those addicted to dangerous drugs and those who suffer chronic pain.\n\nFor these reasons and more I am begging you to not take away the deserved civil rights of the people whose lives have been saved by kratom.  I am not against regulation of this or any other substance if necessary or truly beneficial, and I understand the need to keep this and other safe, but powerful herbs out of the hands of minors.  However, I fear that any outright prohibition of this plant is going to end up costing thousand of lives, while also further diminishing the rights of our fellow citizenry to pursue the happiest and healthiest lives they can through the use of safe and natural herbs and dietary supplements.\n\nI've been told by others in the kratom community that I should list links to relevant articles in my comment, or discuss specific statistics that prove how kratom is not only safe to use, but also has one of the best overall track records of any dietary supplement around.  However, our of respect, I will assume that whomever is reading this (and all the others at the DEA for that matter) should have access to all the relevant, credible information that is easily available to me and others that proves beyond any doubt that kratom is a helpful and safe herb that should not be withheld from the American public through scheduling, is in no way a recreational \"drug\" of any sort, and has already proved itself as an indispensable weapon in the fight against the current opioid epidemic that is killing an unprecedented 3 people a day (alright, I said I wouldn't list any stats I know, but that figure is particularly staggering I must say).  The facts are there, and hopefully the DEA and FDA will be willing to really listen and make the right decision for all of the vets, chronic pain-sufferers, drug addiction-sufferers, and others in this nation that deserve the highest quality of life that God has granted us the possibility to obtain.  \n\nI like to think of agencies like the DEA and FDA as being entities that are there to help the American public, and not reactionary organizations that are unable to see when an important food, herb or dietary supplement needs to be in the hands of the people that use it to be the best, most productive citizens they can be.  Please help me keep that vision intact (and continue to stay away from prescription medication abuse as well) by keeping kratom legal and fully available to the responsible adults whose lives it has enhanced, and, in many cases, helped to sustain in the first place.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration,","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8484","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Damian Cohn","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We are experiencing one of the biggest epidemics our nation has ever seen with the amount of accidental overdoses with prescription opiates. Someone dies every 20 minutes due to these drugs, but yet they relieve pain and understand their importance in our pharmacological tool-belt for our aging population. I've seen so many people replace prescription opiates with Kratom and live so much fuller lives. And the majority of these people are over 40 years of age. These people have made a choice to avoid much stronger mu-opioid agonists in favor of kratom which does not activate the protein channel that is responsible for activating the reward pathways that most mu-opioid agonists do such as hydrocodone, morphine, and fentanyl. \n\nI urge you to read into the Kappa-opioid activation of this plant, that very heavily regulates abuse, as users generally report heavy nausea, sweating and dizziness for a period. This only happens when a user has taken an excessive amount, but is almost inevitable. They will not lose consciousness, and if they do puke, it's generally a few heaves and the body has responded properly to their stupidity. Most people will not willingly experience this again and again as limits are quickly established, or discouraged entirely of trying to take it purely recreationally at high doses. \n\nThis plant is hardly fit for most abuse models at all when given it's pharmacological actions seen  thus far. I do urge that further research is allowed on this plant so that it's full harm and benefits can be established so that consenting adults can be allowed to use it. If that means it should be scheduled similarly to alcohol or tobacco, both of which have much worse, well established harm and contribute to some of the accidental overdoses that we have occur so regularly in our country. None of the research will be allowed to go forward if you give it a Schedule I ban immediately, I believe you could harm many many people by banning this plant federally.\n\nBy banning this plant you will be hastening people to their deaths. It simply does not have the harm profile of most opioids, does not affect respiratory functioning, which is the primary cause of death in most accidental overdoses in this country.

One of the main reason you have so many addicts is because there's not a cheap alternative for people to come off of the drugs.. it's cheaper for people to go buy the drugs than  it is for people to get the treatment. Kratom is that alternative. Kratom is less potent than Suboxone or methadone. It's basically a vitamin. You shouldn't have to go to a doctor for a any and everything.  Expecially with the rise in health care cost. Regulating this product would make it expensive therefore ineffective to addicts. Banning this product would be taking away an available option for addicts who seek help. If you are really trying to win the drug war keep Kratom legal.   Kratom doesn't get you high it simply eases withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal is what addicts fear the most. Withdrawal is the reason you have this heroin problem to begin with.  Your actions on this topic will determine your sincerity to your fellow countrymen.  Instead of spending your time and effort on kratom, use that time and resources on the real problem heroin.

I was grateful that my PCP gave me a prescription for opiates to help with the pain. After the rash healed, the pain did not stop. I received the dismal news that I  developed postherpetic neuralgia. Over the next 10 months, I took higher and higher doses of oxycodone, oxtcontin, nucynta, cymbalta, lyrica, amytriptaline, topamax, neurontin, klonazapam, flexeril, Valium, qtenza, and more. I became tolerant to opiates, to the point that I would begin to withdraw between doses. I failed every procedure to numb/burn/destroy the dermatomes affected. I was fortunate enough to have a spinal cord stimulator and felt well enough after the surgery to wean myself off of the very high doses of oxycodone (180 mg/day). The withdrawal was horrible, almost as bad as the back surgery recovery. A few months later, the stimulator malfunctioned. I was forced to return to the oxycodone. While waiting for the revision back surgery, my husband read about kratom. I tried kratom while taking high doses of opiates. When my next dose was due, I found myself not in pain, and not shaking in withdrawals. After the second back surgery, I wanted off the prescription opiates/benzos as quickly as possible. I took kratom several times daily, and the withdrawal was smooth, short, and Nearly pain free. I tapered down the kratom and within 10 days, I was withdrawn from all prescription meds. I occasionally need pain relief from the back surgery and if the breakthrough pain is difficult to be relived by the stimulator. Kratom gives me about 5-6 hours of solid relief from small doses (3-4 grams). I don't worry about tolerance or dependence because I now rarely need it. With the current opiate epidemic in our nation, we need safer alternatives such as kratom and marijuana. From a public health standpoint, decreasing the mortality rate while providing effective pain relief should be a no-brainer. Please consider doing the right thing: help make kratom more accessible to the American people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7074","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shelly Stanley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi there.

I had tried so many different medications from my doctor's office, but they did not help and I couldn't spend quality time with my family or be as productive in society as I should have been.  One day a friend had told me about \"Kratom\", I was very skeptical.  I decided, \"What would it hurt?\".  I tried it and the very first time was almost a miracle/magical.  Now after being on Kratom for over a year, my anxiety does not limit me to be a productive member of society and a great mom and grandparent.  For this drug to be banned is ridiculous.

I am a 33 year old business  owner, mother of 2 and wife, happily married for the last 13 years. I have a very active and full life. I have struggled with anxiety most of my life and kratom has been a huge help. I have been using kratom for the last 3 years to assist me in dealing with my anxiety. Kratom helps me focus and calms my nerves so that I can be more present for my family and more efficient in my business. I have experienced no negative side effects. I can take it for several days at a time and then stop taking it with no symptoms of withdrawal and no adverse side effects. I generally only take Kratom on days that I am over stressed or anxious. I do not feel that Kratom is habit forming. As I stated above, It is not something that I have to have and I only use it when my stress and anxiety levels are high. I love that I still have emotions and I still feel like myself when I take kratom as opposed to anti anxiety and depression meds that make me feel lifeless and disconnected. Kratom assists me in living a more grounded and authentic life and helps to curb the anxiety which can be debilitating. I would recommend it to anyone that struggles with the same issues that I do.  I would hate to see something so beneficial be scheduled as an illegal drug. It has helped me tremendously and I know my family has benefited from my reduced levels of stress and anxiety as well.

I am a 39 year old Emergency Room Nurse currently in Nurse Practitioner School.  I have an amazing job that requires exceptional skill and attention to detail. I live in Arizona, one of the 50 states that are being absolutely ravaged by the heroin epidemic.  I see first hand on a regular basis, 17-30 year olds dying or nearly dying from heroin overdoses.  Many of them repeated overdoses, sometimes on their 15th overdose.  I have watched prescription pills absolutely tear honorable & successful families to pieces, many that will never be put back together.  As I live in the \"Rehab Capital\" of the country, Prescott Az, I also have watched the utter failure of Suboxone and the complete lie that it is a miracle cure for heroin addicts.  Its ALL about revenue.  Just like Methadone was. Look at all the winners methadone has championed.  The devastation that I witness first hand on a daily basis  that opiates, pills, and heroin, and Suboxone cause across this once great nation can hardly be substantiated in this 5000 characters.  \n       But I too have been gripped in the clutches of addiction.   I was Once a state champion mountain bike racer, avid snow boarder, whitewater kayaker, Hunting all over AZ and the west at every chance I could. It all started with a terrible bike accident w/ a broken humerus, and severely dislocated shoulder.  24 years old. Active, healthy, clean, athletic.  Then the pills. A virtual legally prescribed destruction of my life.  I began seeing that it was everyone, & everywhere.  Lawyers, my firefighter buddies, even a few of my cop friends.  Addiction doesn't discriminate, thats for sure.  Luckily I was saved before Heroin hit the streets in my area.  I was saved By the gift of grace from God. Period. After pulling my head out of my arss, I went to nursing school. As of 4 years, Iv'e been completely sober.   Before that I was the best functioning addict you'd know.  Going through 6 months sober, then 6 months buying pills off the street. On & off, & on & off.  Clean up my act when ever my amazing wife would catch on to my behavior, Just to sneak around buying pills & lying to everyone about it.  But they all knew. Just like most addicts, I finally hit the bottom.  I almost lost everything in my entire life. And I mean everything. Words can't begin to explain all that saved me. But in a nut shell, It was Jesus, my amazing wife, amazing family, & amazing friends, & a boat load of prayers.  I still have urges after 4 years.  But I get stronger everyday.  I also still have a lot of pain from old accidents & injuries etc. Today, I work out on a regular basis, and guide trophy elk & deer hunts on a regular basis. The pain persists.  \n      As of 2 years ago, I found Kratom.  Finally something that works!!!! That isn't narcotic!!!  I was so happy!  Not only does it help me tremendously with my pain & aches from old injuries,  it has sincerely curbed most all of those evil little urges that say, \"come on Jim, just a few pills won't hurt... You can just take a few... You won't want to get more, its just a few.\"  Because I work daily in the ER, & I'm in a masters program for nurse practitioner, I decided to research as much as I could about Kratom.  \n      Its a leaf from a tree.  Completely natural.  I honestly could not find much if any negative effects of Kratom other than a little nausea depending on how active i was.  I found no proof of overdose, or anyone being hurt or killed using kratom.  The proven cause of overdoses by opiates of any sort is Respiratory Depression.  Kratom is not an opiate, & therefore It Does Not cause Respiratory Depression. I administer Opiates to my patients every day. I know the danger of Opiates. \n      I am a law abiding hard as heck working american, who loves this country.  I am educated, and work solely in the health care field.  I cannot fathom how the DEA could make Kratom a schedule-1 controlled substance.  Just the mere people that will go out & buy pills or heroin, if this coffee like tree leaf is banned will probably kill thousands of people in overdoses alone.  I wonder how much the tax payers of this country have paid in emergency room visits from prescription pills and heroin alone.  Or the financial burden to each state for the costs of rehabs and treatment facilities.  The numbers would be mind blowing I have a feeling.  I sincerely hope that whoever is reading these thousands of letters, will try to understand that the hundreds of thousands of people using kratom are no different than the millions that drink coffee, or red bull, etc... Not only is it a proven success in the battle of opiate addictions, It helps people with pain, alleviates anxieties, and helps thousands of people sleep.  There are several cases that Kratom has helped  many veterans with PTSD.  Please reflect on vast benefits of this plant, and reconsider the proposed scheduling of Kratom.  It is healing not hurting.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJim May","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11850","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James May","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have seen no studies that say this has killed anyone or endangered anyone's lives.

I submit that these chemicals not only induce little known harm to the populace, but also may actually be beneficial. In this age of freely available information, I posit that in any case the individuals of The United States of America be responsible for what substances they consume as free and available data of their effects is readily attainable through resources open to all individuals. \n\nThese are not widely used substances, and the small amount of the population that does use them are generally not adversely affected by them. I posit, also, that the small population that does consume these substances is more widely educated than the general population in regard to their effects. This I believe because one would have to research in order to even hear of the substances, as they are not pervasive enough to be peer pressured into and not generally known to the wider population. So, to hear of them unless one has an innate interest in historical herbs, would be a rare occurrence. \n\nTo place them on the Controlled Substances Act would not only be a waste of resources, but a limitation of human freedom.

I do not drink any kind of alcohol, nor have I ever done any sort of illegal drugs. I have struggled all of my life with health problems that were diagnosed as Hypoglycemic related when I was 15, but found out at age 48 after a serious seizure that I was born with a familial cavernous angioma bordering my right temporal and parietal lobes. The doctors say it is inoperable without a very high chance of rendering the entire left side of my body paralyzed, so I was put on 2,500mg of Keppra a day to stave off seizures. I was also diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy which has made my life incredibly painful for the past 10 years. I was put on hydrocodone for 4 years straight by a pain doctor, but was abruptly taken off of them and had to go through horrible withdrawal on my own when the doctors practice was being leaned on. The pain of the peripheral neuropathy came back with a vengeance and acetaminophen didn't touch the pain and I couldn't take ibuprofen because it caused the cavernous angioma in my brain to bleed excessively.  I finally read about the wonders of kratom and decided to try it and I was SO relieved to know that I had a natural way to deal with my pain that wouldn't cause the bleeder in my brain to bleed even more. I cannot even fathom why it would be made harder for regular people to use because it's natural and isn't dangerous. I don't want to spend the rest of my life in agony, and I don't want to die from taking ibuprofen to stop the pain. Peripheral neuropathy doesn't just go away, nor will the cavernous angioma in my brain. Kratom is all I have that allows me to enjoy life without excruciating pain and it doesn't make me groggy or hyper or anything other than comfortable. Please don't make millions of ordinary people pay the price for others out there in the world that abuse illegal drugs or even OTC's because we are human beings and deserve to treat our bodies with what God put on this earth to help us.\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15052","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Becky Ayers","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Much of my family suffers from anxiety and Kratom has been a godsend.

My story begins as many other peoples story. I have been in severe 24/7 neck pain for over a decade because of a fall and misalignments above the fusion. I have been on 3 different pain medications that don't really work most the time and cause serious health issues. I am one that refuses to take pain meds unless I just need a break from the pain. To this day I only take one 3 times a day just for a break. But the tolerance is making it so it only takes the edge off which makes for a real miserable day.\n\nI, as many have researched natural means of dealing with this pain when I started hearing about Kratom about 9 or 10 months ago. Because I have tried so many things and waisted so much money on things that just  didn't work. I decided to just research it more. Also because I wasn't liking the side effects I was hearing about.\n\nWhen I heard about the possible ban at the end of September, I had to try to find a way to at least try it to see if it would have worked for me. While talking to someone in town about this tree and wishing I had the money to at least try some. They told me to come over to the shop and they would give me a little to try, to see if I even liked it before waisting more money one it.\n\nShe said take this home, start with 2 grams and go up a half a gram an hour till I find my dose. I found that to be 3 grams. Needless to say I was in heaven for 3 days. I took what I had 3 grams 3 times a day and found I was in zero pain for 15 plus hours for those 3 days. Yes, zero pain. My pain medication can't do that. I also had none of the side effects that prevented me from giving this a try many months ago.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company(s) kill thousands of people every year yet you let this poison stay on the market killing even more people tomorrow. All the laws in the world will not stop people from getting their hands on it. And many doctors give it out like candy. And to hear that you call foul on a God Given natural plant that has literally saved thousands of lives makes me furious. And I ask, what is your malfunction?\n\nPlease do not take this from us. I want to know that I can spend my money on Kratom next month instead of the pain pills I have to pay cash for every month.. I would much rather spend what little money I have on this plant then give it to people that do not care about me, just the money they will make. \n\nAgain I ask with all due respect. What is your malfunction???\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22311","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cheryl Corbett","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\n   To whom it may concern,\n      I am recovering from a bad shoulder injury\n       the pain has been excruciating until I discovered Kratom\n       Keratom simply takes the edge off without serious side effects\n       Please do not ban this panacea for many\n                                                                           David Mcsweeney","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15853","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Mcsweeney","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This medicine has helped my dad get off the addictive pain killers the doctors got him hooked on and thankfully for myself it helps me sleep at night.

Three years after cancer surgery, there was evidence my cancer had returned. I saw a radiologist and began my first of 40 radiation treatments. One year later,  it was discovered that the radiation had caused some unintended damage and I had another surgery to repair that. Pain medication had become necessary after all this in order for me to feel any sort of \"normal\" and the doctor's drug of choice was hydrocodone. After a couple of years,  I knew I had developed a dependency of it. It was not reducing the pain as it once had and I began taking more and after 6 years was even more dependent and suffering extreme withdrawal if I did not continue to increase my dosage. Eventually I came to the point where I could not get the amount I needed and the pharmacies could follow the patient's prescriptions even from pharmacy to pharmacy. I suddenly came to grips with my addiction. I was so embarrassed about it but sat my wife down and in tears confessed my addiction and my plan to wean myself off of it and quit. When I was completely out of the pills and unable to get more, I stopped cold turkey. This was in January of 2016. I had no idea of the hell I was headed for. I could not eat, or sleep or function. My body screamed in agony and I refused to get medical help for fear of that stigma following me the rest of my life. I turned to the Internet at some addiction forums and there I read testimonials of a godsend herb called \"kratom\". In February of that year I rush ordered some and tried it when it arrived. I remember weeping with joy at the relief my body felt from the first dose. I am now at December of 2016, 10 months without any narcotics and still do not need any. I am able to sleep with a dose of one strain and get pain relief with a dose of another strain. If I don't need any on a given day, I feel no withdrawal at all. This herb has saved my sanity and my health. Kratom is not a narcotic, is not addictive and occurs naturally with no need for development. Restricting it's use seems ludicrous to me when  our government continues to allow the use of alcohol and nicotine and caffeine! Please don't rob me of my ability to deal appropriately with my severe health issue,  - please do not render Kratom's use illegal. - - thank you for allowing me to tell you my story! - -  sincerely, Rev.

None of the doctors or physical therapists could figure out what was wrong, and the pain would prevent me from enjoying life, and even restrict me from certain activities.  Nothing they prescribed was enough to help my pain, and the powerful prescription opiod drugs they wouldn't give me (since it was a chronic pain, not an acute one).\n\nI then found Kratom, and it changed my world.  I was completely pain free!  it was a little pricey with how often I needed it, but it really helped me get through physical therapy (and life, work, and school) this past year and a half.  Though my pain is still here, I've finally reached a point where I don't need Kratom to be functional.  One of the main concerns for Kratom by legislatures (I'm assuming) is it's addiction potential.  I will admit that when I quit taking Kratom, I did have physical withdrawals.  But all I had were flu-like symptoms for about 5 days, and even then I didn't have to miss work it was so minor (and this is coming from someone who was taking Kratom CONSTANTLY for over a year).\n\nI hate to think Kratom would be legalized for what I personally see as an invalid concern.  I believe Kratom to be immensely helpful to many people, and I don't know what I would've done without it.  Anything can be abused, but I don't think the cons outweigh the benefits in this case.

This naturally occuring plant works great for pain,anxiety,PTSD,fibromyalgia,opiate & alcohol treatment, and Yes,even endometriosis and PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) which my wife was diagnosed with 2 years ago. She has had the endometriosis for 10 years and nothing has worked for her up until recently when she started trying the kratom. So far the results have been great for her and myself. Our lives have improved drastically. So,please keep the Kratom plant and its import legal to allow further research and knowledge of its many benefits to hopefully help others with endometriosis & PCOS. I thank you for your time and ask that you keep in mind all of the facts,including the opinions,feelings,and well-being of people such as my wife,myself, and many others whom kratom has been a blessing to.\n\nSincerely,\nDaniel D Holmes","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3351","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Holmes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a chronic pain sufferer with a disability which has no cure or successful treatments available, I do not agree with the scheduling of Kratom.  Without kratom I would be forced to be addicted to opiate medications which cause a strong dependency, and many side effects.  Not to mention there is sadly an opiate epidemic in our country, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for chronic pain patients to get their medications.  Aside from the dangers associated with taking opiates themselves, there are many people being robbed for their meds.  I have successfully maintained the ability to be a functioning member of society without opiates because of my utilizing of Kratom.  Without it, unfortunately, I would ultimately be house bound and need to draw disability.  My quality of life would be awful, as would many many people who suffer from chronic pain disabilities like me.  I ask you to please reconsider your decision so that people like me can go on being able to function pain free without all the side effects.  I would be open to regulations to make sure the kratom people ingest is pure and unadulterated, however, making kratom schedule 1 will not only hinder research but will quite frankly destroy the lives of many who have found relief and life through kratom.  I also would like to note that I am quite confused this was put in motion in the first place, as kratom is proven to be very safe, especially compared to smoking or alcohol, which are legal and kill hundreds of thousands of people.  I would also like to note as a user of kratom, I have experienced no notable dependency to the plant, and find myself to be completely fine without it on days or sometimes weeks when my pain isn't flaring too badly and I decide not to take it.   \n\nThank you for considering my comment ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5422","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amanda Young","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been taking kratom for the past 3 years, which helps me greatly with stress and anxiety.

I am writing today to express my opinions, in regards to Kratom, and its potential scheduling in the United States by the DEA. I first started utilizing Kratom 3 years ago to help manage anxiety issues I have been plagued with since the time I was a teen. I was prescribed medication by my primary care physician, I did my research, and the possible side effects of an SSRI quickly led me to seek an alternative route.\n\nIt took some time, but I was ultimately able to find a supplement regimen which worked to curb my anxiety throughout the day. Unfortunately, I was still plagued by the inability to sleep at night due to racing thoughts and was unable calm down when it was time to get some rest. I had found out about Kratom online and decided to give it a try in the evenings to help me calm down. It took a few days experimenting with different dosages, but I was finally able to find a nightly regimine which worked wonders for me. For the past 3 years I have taken a small dose of Kratom a few hours before bed each night. I do not get \"high\" and it does not have any negative affects, mentally or physiologically, on me personally. It simply helps to calm my body and mind at the end of the day, allowing me to get a good nights rest instead of tossing and turning for hours on end after crawling into bed. It has truly worked wonders for me in this regard and I do not believe it should be scheduled in the United States.

Additionally, I have a form of arthritis that causes moderate pain in my muscles and joints that I have endured since I was a teenager. These issues impact my quality of life, and interfere with my ability to perform well in some working scenarios. I have found some relief from traditional opioid pain medication, but it is catch 22 that over time also impacts my quality of life, and my ability to perform well in some working scenarios.\n\nWhen I discovered mitragyna speciosa and began to use it, I found that it was able to help mitigate the pain as well as increase my mood, and I am not experiencing some of the inevitable side effects that came from traditional pain medication. After researching online about the \"less is more\" hypothesis, the \"plateau effect\", and the built in limitation that nausea ultimately imposes; I perceived that when compared, natural mitragyna versus refined opiate drugs was far safer to use and had fewer negatives attached to use. In my opinion, relegating this plant to any level of the controlled substance schedule is premature and unwarranted.\n\nConsider the cost of the so called \"war on drugs\" that has been ravaging families and ruining lives for decades in this country. Consider the prison industrial complex and the cost of keeping so many non violent people locked up for exercising the right to ingest naturally occurring substances that cause little if any harm. Consider the racial and economic disparities that are prevalent in the enforcement of existing laws. Consider the social ills of a black market, the violence of street gangs, and the proliferation of international cartels that come prohibition. \n\nI appeal to you of intelligence and conscience to reconsider the drastic effects that scheduling this plant would have. The history of prohibition is clear: Twice we have tried as a society to criminalize nonviolent consumption (alcohol and cannabis), twice it has caused unnecessary harms far in excess of the paltry side effects encountered in the normal use of those substances. In comparison, perhaps you would consider that education and harm reduction have had more success in slowing the consumption of legal products such as tobacco, alcohol and refined sugar; all of which have been shown to have far reaching consequences on health.\n\nI appreciate that you have read, and taken the time to understand the benefits and concerns that I have outlined here. Let's not repeat the same mistakes that were made a hundred years ago. Let's avoid the trauma of the decades of a war that cannot be won. Let's let people have the dignity and freedom to choose for ourselves. \n\nThanks!

Married 42 yrs. to the same man.  I dont drink or smoke.  I do drink Kratom tea.  For that I may soon become a felon.  This tea restored my life.  It is one of the best things I have ever done for my mental and physical health and the DEA is considering making it a schedule one drug along with heroin?\n\nA few years ago I damaged my spine.   Within seconds Id altered the course of my life forever.  Due to the severity of the pain I was given oxycodone while doctors exhausted every possible method of repairing the damage.  Nothing worked and surgery became unavoidable.   \n\nTime ticked on.  Oxycodone became less effective & Oxycontin was added to my pain regimen to prolong relief.\n\nThere was no negligence by doctors involved with my treatment.   This was simply a difficult situation with no easy answer.  Their choices, like mine, were limited.\n\nImprovement from surgery was minimal.  We continued to explore options while I continued to take opiate pain meds to survive.\n\nIt doesnt take long to become addicted to opiates.   Tolerance is a serious problem.  The longer you take them the more you need.  Eventually you find yourself on an opiate hamster wheel chasing doses and finding little relief.   \n\nThe solution becomes the problem.  \n\nI opted to come off  the meds.  I dont know how familiar you are with our current drug rehabilitation programs but it can take weeks or months for a bed to open up.  For a street addict this may be the difference between life and death.   Here again, options are too limited.   \n\nFor months after Id stopped opiates, I was in agony.   Scans revealed several additional and permanent spinal problems.  Unable to live a remotely normal life I resorted to excessive amounts of over counter meds.  Terrified this would eventually damage my kidneys and liver, I began searching for more natural methods of pain control.\n\nI found Kratom while researching herbal supplements and pain control.   But the real beauty of Kratom is, its not just an herbal supplement.  Its a community. Numerous sites are populated with people just like me.   They were able to tell me what to buy and how much tea to begin with.   These folks check on me daily.   We share exercises, healthy recipes, and challenge each other to keep doing better.   \n\nThis past year Ive had the pleasure of watching young heroin addicts come into our groups looking for help. Watching these pups, ages 22-34,  beat addiction with the help of a few senior citizens and a cup of tea is beautifully magical. \n\nThese kids are now attending college, pursuing careers, and buying homes.  You wont hear their success stories because our society has attached such stigma on drug abuse that coming forward terrifies them.    Theyre not willing to put their futures in jeopardy by risking open, honest contact with the DEA.   And forgive me for asking, but doesnt this feel terribly wrong to you?\n\nPeople drinking kratom tea have networked to form an invaluable community.   If you make Kratom illegal, you not only remove an herbal supplement that is genuinely helping people but you will destroy this diverse, warm hearted family of folks opening the door to significant change.   Heroin and prescription opiate addictions are an epidemic in this country.   This tea and these people are fighting to stop that.  We should be thanking them.  Not condemning them.\n\nFor that reason I believe its imperative kratom remain available in its natural, herbal form.   The last thing we should do is turn this into a prescription situation forcing people who arent comfortable coming forward to continue to hide in the shadows.     \n\nIf at some point a company chooses to use those patents pending to create an RX form of Kratom theres no reason both cant exist comfortably.   Its my belief this would be the best of both worlds.  We need to work together to stop the opiate epidemic.  In the brief time I spent as a prescription opiate addict I learned quickly this is an extremely demeaning illness.   Its difficult to feel secure.   Only other addicts understand these feelings well enough to be able to help.\n\nI began using 1 teaspoon in a cup of tea.  Today I continue to use that same amount.  There appears to be no tolerance issues.  My pain will never be gone.  But its manageable. I do all those things we take for granted daily.   Things that seem like nothing until you cant do them anymore.  Then theyre everything.  Kratom isnt a miracle.  It isnt a cure.  It wont eliminate pain like opiates do.   But it helps, enough. \n\nWere lacking effective options for pain patients and certainly for addicts. Kratom IS an option.  It could well be the difference between life and death for many people.  Please dont take this herbal supplement and the community born from it away from those of us who desperately need them to function.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1849","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Pam Goodfleisch","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"reference \"Docket No. DEA-442W\" \n\nI was introduced to kratom through my online fibromyalgia support groups. My rhuematologist told me that nothing helps with the pain... but kratom does! It's more than that. Kratom cleared up my IBS symptoms, made my anxiety manageable(When I was having screaming , crying, convulsing anxiety attacks every day), gave me energy to combat my 2.5yr depressive episode (when even TMS treatments are not helping), cleared up my migraines, made my daily vomitting spells almost completely disappear, AND reduced my urge to drink alcohol. I was cleaning my apartment, exercising, bathing regularly, and my anxiety attacks had vanished. I still had anxiety, but it was MANAGEABLE! I do not use drugs. I have my associate's degree, all the credits for a 2nd associates, and am a mother of one. I have Schizoaffective disorder, OCD, and fibromyalgia. Kratom gave me my life back. It's been so long I forgot exactly how much it helped me... but I mostly quit back in September, in anticipation of the ban. Zero withdrawals, but slowly, all my old symptoms returned. Without kratom I can not function like a normal human being. This herb saved my life. I don't know what I'll do without it. I took it long term, and if anything, my health was better for it, not worse.

She told me my friend was in the hospital and that they believe he had overdosed on heroin. We later came to find out that the heroin that he had used contained an unusually large amount of a drug called fentanyl. His heart stopped 5 times over the course of the next 24 hours. Eventually, they had stabilised him, but he stayed on a ventilator in the cardiac unit of the hospital for the next three weeks.  Needless to say, after 6 years of abusing various drugs and prescription medications none of us were surprised by this. We had all but given up hope. \n\nWhen my friend finally woke up  I had the difficult task of explaining to him what happened and how he got there. I will never forget what he said when the reality of what happened had finally sunk in for him. Staring blankly off into the ceiling, he said in a voice as cold as rain in November, \"you should of just let me go\".  It didn't break my heart that he said that though. What broke my heart was that silently, I agreed with him.\n\nI left that day with a guilty conscience and promptly began to try to resume my life as normal. Now I'm not someone you would call a man of faith, but I'll be damned if I wasn't made a believer after this.  While browsing Facebook later that day I stumbled across a post by a relatively well know nutrition and health blogger. His name is Dr. Mercola and his post was about Kratom. For some reason I clicked the link and the rest is history. I learned everything I could about Kratom and I became very interested in it's ability to help people suffering with addiction. Especially people who were addicted to heroin and prescription opiates. long story short, as soon as my friend left the hospital I brought him a tea that I made from Kratom. I told him to try not to take it but if he felt like he couldn't resist any more that he should drink it and wait a half hour. Later that night he called me. He said an old friend came to visit him and when the opportunity came he chose the Kratom instead of the needle. He was shocked at how well it worked but was not yet convinced. He believed  there had to be some downside to it but I told him that whatever it was it was less of a downside then what heroin has.  \n\nAs of 10/24/16 my friend has not used any illegal substances. This is the longest he has been sober in 6 years and counting. I believe it is nothing short of a miracle and I hate to think of where he would be now if Kratom wasn't available to help him. For the sake of the lives of those who are suffering, please do not ban this incredible plant or it's active compounds.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1795","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anthony T","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have struggled with an opiate addiction since I was prescribed Lortabs 10 years ago and Kratom is the only thing that has allowed me to stop the urges as a result of that addiction.

Don't back me into a corner by making this powder a criminal offense.  I don't want to go back to living a depressed and painful life.

My name is Jake Edgington. I am a 36 year old Marine Veteran, currently working for Gordan Food Service out of Springfield, Ohio. My job is very physical as I deliver food and restaurant supplies to restaurant chains ( Pizza Hut, Chipoltle, ect.. ).   I have done this type of work since being honorably discharged in 2001. Along with this, I have been obsessed with weight training, eating healthy and optimizing personal performance since the age of 12.                                                                                              Unfortunately, injuries are almost always certain sooner or later. Six years ago my shoulders reached a point where the pain was always there and nothing I did was of much help, including long stints in physical therapy. My physician prescribed Percocet to me and I reluctantly started to use them. At first I only took them when I was working and the pain got severe. Before I knew it I was taking them as soon as I woke up because I would feel completely miserable if it was not in my system.                                                                     Five years after filling the first bottle, having tried so many times to get off of them with no success, I heard about the Kratom plant. I actually heard Joe Rogan and another gentleman with a similar situation to my own discussing it on his podcast.                               I ordered a small bag of it the next day and finally felt like I had an edge this time to kick It for good.                                                                                                                                The Kratom worked wonders for me. I used it a couple times a day while tapering down the opiates. Today I am opiate free and there is no doubt in my mind this would not be the case had I not found out about this plant.                                                                                        I sincerely hope that Kratom remains legal and similar stories to this quickly multiply. I would have never predicted I would end up one of the millions of opiate addicted Americans. It was absolutely the darkest and most depressing years of my life. I would never wish it on anyone. Kratom was my way out, my way of getting back to who I am proud to be. I know there are so many other good people in the same situation and I am confident this plant can and will get their life back on track.                                                                                         Thank you very much for listening to me and others. I hope it shines a little light on the actual reality of kratom.                                    Sincerely, Jacob M.

It is a leaf from the coffee family used by many to help with pain issues. Its the pharmaceutical companies that petitioned a patton on a synthetic form of Kratom which seemly came days before the DEA announced ban. The pharmaceutical companies dont want consumers to have a free choice. Its parallel to big oil and big tobacco. Kratom is not additive or with the side effect as these other manufactured drugs. I would not trust a sythetic form. Like big tobbacco the pharmaceutical companies want you addicted.Allow people the right to buy kratom for their pain and mental health. Individuals have used Kratom to assist in thier sobriety from not only addictive prescriptions but illicit drugs. The report that Posion Control has seen a rise in Kratom related incidents is miss leading. If closely looked at other drugs were put into the mix. How many individuals od on prescriptions and alcohol. How many poison reports from deterrent packs. Don't stack the deck.Avoid reoccurring and future opiate addiction. In closing individuals can use Kratom and still perfom their jobs without the drowsiness or cloudiness as with an opioid . I myself have not used a prescription in over three years. The DEA would be better serving in other areas. Please leave Kratom alone.

I began taking Kratom 6 months ago to combat my Tramadol addiction. I had to come up with a dosage and schedule of taking it, and during this trial and error period the worst thing I suffered was nausea. It certainly isn't like any opiate type pill I've had prescribed as far as the health safety concerns of overdosing and side effects. I am able to reduce my Kratom intake on days when I am not feeling heavy pain, and that was just not possible with Tramodol. I don't understand why it works in that way, but I am truly grateful, and am very interested in what the researchers will find in regard to the way it works. I have various injuries dating from when I was a child doing gymnastics to a car accident where I was stopped with other traffic on the freeway and a driver came around the bend and slammed into me. I was put out on workman's comp in the early 90's due to the damage from a compressed disc injury I received while on the job. That's when the Tramadol pills were initially prescribed, and over the years I've had to have my dosage increased to the point where it's truly ineffective and had become an addiction, a devastating problem. I simply can't describe what finding Kratom has done for me. It has helped with menopause symptoms, the lack of energy, as well as the pain and discomfort of my work and previous injuries, and the relief of menopause symptoms was just a wonderful bonus! If I thought Kratom was a potential hazard and dangerous, I wouldn't be writing this letter. There's enough trouble of that kind in our country and I would not want anything to be added that would adversely affect anyone. The argument that Kratom should be legal because it's a plant does not hold water with me - heroin and opium are plant derivatives, so obviously plants can be very dangerous. I honestly don't see that kind of problem or threat with Kratom, and I am truly hoping that the DEA will allow Kratom to stay legal. Thank you so much for taking the time to read and consider my letter.

Kratom does not cause a \"high\" nor could I even imagine that it could be abused.  Before finding this plant, I was needing to go higher and higher on my pain medication dosage.  Kratom has helped my pain, allowed me to reduce my nerve pain medication and stop opiates.  It has enabled me to be a more productive member of my family (I am married with 3 children).  To say that Kratom is as dangerous as LSD or heroin is completely erroneous.  My family would tell you that they have gotten their mom and wife back for the most part, and are grateful for this plant. I spent hours researching before purchasing this plant.  I have found limited studies, but those true medical studies from peer-reviewed journals did not find what the DEA is stating could happen when taking this plant.  If you schedule this plant, there will be no easy way for it to be properly studied.  The data on calls to poison control centers, or emergency visits does not show that Kratom taken on it's own has caused the issues you are stating.  More calls or ER visits occur due to laundry detergent packs.  In conclusion, I would like to urge and plead that you do not schedule Kratom and instead let adults make these decisions for themselves regarding this (natural) plant.

My experience using kratom has been extremely positive. In general, I believe the effects are very mild, and that kratom should not be placed in the same category as opiates, etc. I do not believe that many individuals would consume kratom for a recreational \"high\", any more than one would excessively consume coffee or other natural supplements for this purpose. In addition, kratom should not be confused with synthetic compounds that have recently appeared in the US and have much higher risks and potential for abuse. Kratom is a completely natural product, derived from plant leaves. \n\nI have used kratom for joint pain and issues associated with surgeries due to previous injuries. It is very beneficial at reducing discomfort, without causing side effects that would occur if one were to take a prescription drug. I think it offers one a natural alternative to prescription drugs for light pain and discomfort. I think there are very minimal risks and potential for abuse. I believe that any reports of medical issues, instances of abuse, or damaging behavior associated with kratom are undoubtedly those by individuals with existing substance abuse issues and/or substances in their system, and has nothing to do with kratom itself. Kratom is no more dangerous than the many energy drinks and other high caffeine content substances that are readily sold across the U.S. today.\n\nIn summary, please reconsider banning or restricting the import, sale, and consumption of kratom is the U.S. It offers a natural alternative to prescription drugs for light pain and additional research could further develop it's applicability in the future.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7669","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anon Anon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.

Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down. Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.

As an older lady with significant health issues, including MS, Fibromyalgia, degenerative disc disease which has progressed to the point where the spine has started to compress cord, as well as other ongoing chronic disease Kratom has been a much appreciated alternative to conventional, and usually addictive medication.  Mitragyna speciosa/Kratom has significantly helped my pain and anxiety, with reduction in medical care and availability of conventional pain medication the prospect of losing access to this plant will substantial lessen quality of life for myself and others.\n\nAs you must be aware Mitragyna speciosa/Kratom has been used for centuries and for a multitude of illnesses. More Americans are also seeking alternative treatment, including eastern medicines and support versus typical western medications; because we are seeking more natural health care. The vast majority of those interested in using Mitragyna speciosa/Kratom  do so because the effect does not cause any opioid \"high,\" can help with anxiety, and I understand is effective when used in opioid addiction. \n\nMost people I know, who personally use Mitragyna speciosa/Kratom do extensive research prior to taking the plant. The information is readily available, both pro and con on the subject. We ask that you consider that the majority of those using the plant have faithfully researched the information, are honest in discussion, and feel that the benefits far outweigh any misuse by unethical persons, just as those who illegally provide currently available and possibly dangerous legal substances  (alcohol,  tobacco products, etc.) do not cause the government to disallow those substances. We only ask that you seriously consider the cost, not only in governmental funding, which banning a plant related to coffee will be to this community...more need for pain control and medications, addiction, hospital and nursing care, rise in health care costs as well and IMO more significant our loss of quality of life, independence, and death. \n\nFinally, there is the economic consideration. At a time when the country is concerned with employment and small businesses wouldn't it be prudent to allow this burgeoning industry to grow? Wouldn't it be considerably better to have small farmers and entrepreneurs paying taxes, securing loans and grants? To further economic growth while also supporting less addiction and better quality of life, which should translate to better health and a stronger workforce/population. \n\nAgain, thank you for allowing discussion on this subject.

I have never taken recreational drugs and on the rare occasion will consume a minimal amount of alcohol. \n\nI am also a consumer of Kratom.  \n\nI was introduced to Kratom by friends on a social level about five (5) years ago...I use neither for pain nor addiction...but to be consumed at gatherings over long talks and evenings out.  During this time, I became aware of a few things: That my menstrual cramps were reduced in intensity (I was a guaranteed 'call-out' if they arrived on a workday, due to the pain), that my once-weekly migraines were becoming fewer and farther apart, and that my outlook on life just seemed more 'up' than it had before.\n\nOver the course of the last 5 years, I have viewed Kratom being used both recreationally and medicinally.  I have friends who, like me, use it to be social and enjoy the mild relaxing benefits.  There are other friends who use it to combat the symptoms of Psoriatic Arthritis, Depression/Anxiety, and PTSD.  I have never, over these same 5 years, seen anyone even remotely close to overdosing, as Kratom is self-regulating...consume too much and your body rejects it, sometimes violently (picture *that* scene in the Exorcist and you'll have a good idea of how!)\n\nWhen I choose to stop, as I do from time to time due to travel, financial constraints, etc, I suffer from no withdrawal symptoms.  The worst withdrawal I have seen, from someone known to consume 60+ ounces of the 'tea' per day, is similar to caffeine withdrawal...bad mood, ornery, sometimes a headache.  Within 3-4 days, all 'symptoms' were gone.\n\nI realize that studies must be done to confirm all the anecdotal evidence which is piling up in these comments.  However, placing Kratom as a schedule 1 drug will prevent this from happening.  Placing restrictions upon it, as most of the Kratom community has already done itself (selling/serving to no one under 18, no one obviously inebriated or under the effects of other substances, serving only unadulterated pure leaf, etc) would be acceptable, but outright banning of it will turn thousands of law-abiding citizens into felons overnight.\n\nPlease, do not place Kratom in the Schedule 1 list. Doing so will cause more harm than good.

I'm 41 years old & suffer from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, bipolar II (no delusions or hallucinations, but extreme depression and anxiety), migraines, sleep issues, & the list goes on. I've been struggling for the last 5 years to find effective, natural remedies for my chronic pain and emotional distress. Doctors have only prescribed me opiate pain killers, schedule I muscle relaxants, neurontin, and a plethora of other pharmaceuticals, all of which have done little more than lead to addiction and, in the long run, exacerbate the long term, painful symptoms. \n\nSeven months ago, I was introduced to Kratom and my life has changed only for the better. I've overcome my addiction to opiates/schedule I muscle relaxants, been able to wean off neurontin (which, according to numerous studies, only increases the symptoms of fibromyalgia over time), and gone from 4 meds for bipolar down to one. I'm taking the least amount of pharmaceuticals since the age of 15, when I was first prescribed antidepressants.\n\nNow, I and so many other people, are facing a future where Kratom may be banned if the DEA has its way. Under these circumstances, I will have no other option than to return to harmful, addictive pain killers, and probably have to return to more bipolar medications. \n\nThis utterly scares me. Long term opiate use eventually leads to complications with my bipolar brain and  medications. These complications override the bipolar meds, basically negating their ability to control my emotional roller coasters. How do I know this? Because it's happened before, and I have a therapist to attest to it. During that time (beginning in 2009), I battled everyday not to give up and end my life. Of course, my psychiatrist changed my meds and put me through the hellish experience of weaning off opiates without any other help but more medications. However, over the years, I've been prescribed more opiate pain killers, leading to further hellish weaning withdrawals. Then, Kratom came into my life and everything changed in a natural, positive manner. \n\nNow, after sharing my personal story, I come to the meat of this email:\n\nAccording to the Bill of Rights Institute.org, \"The first 10 amendments to the Constitution make up the Bill of Rights. Written by James Madison in response to calls from several states for greater constitution protection for individual rights. The Bill of Rights lists specific prohibitions on governmental power\". Then, \"One of the many points of contention between Federalists and Anti-Federalists was the Constitution's lack of bill of rights that would place specific limits on government power...Anti-Federalists held that a bill of rights was necessary to safeguard individual liberty.\"\n\nIt is my Constitutional right to ingest what I know is good (or bad) for my health issues. Kratom is GOOD for me. Kratom is a natural pain killer, muscle relaxant, antidepressant, anxiety reducer, sleep aid, & so much more. I have benefited greatly from all that Kratom can provide, and again, I am utterly terrified the federal government is going to ignore my individual rights, and ban it without truly understanding how it helps tens of thousands (maybe more) of Americans.\n\nEven with the delay until the end of the year, I fear it's not enough time to research the benefits of Kratom. I fear Big Pharma and the DEA will get their way by ignoring the research (if any convincing research can be produced in 3-4 months) and the thousands of Americans who are sharing their stories of living free of addiction to opiates, heroine, morphine, crack cocaine, etc. \n\nSo, I am asking for further research. I am asking for our voices to be heard and our stories to be taken seriously. I am asking for the government to respect and uphold our rights as individuals, as the Constitution decrees.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9733","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Susan Cooley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Quit making things that mother nature provides to make us healthy illegal.

There are many anecdotal case reports on internet forums and other online communities of acute hepatitis, hepatic cholestasis, and other serious liver conditions developing in very close correlation (bordering on causation - but there is a lack of controlled research) with kratom use. \n\nKratom may not cause hepatotoxicity in all users, but the prevalence of anecdotal reports on the internet, my personal experience trying it (resulting each time in upper right quadrant pain and elevated liver enzymes), is concerning. This substance should not be allowed to the public freely. Especially not in \"head shops\" and other locations that sell \"legal highs.\"\n\nThere have been rat and mouse studies done on kratom which directly show damage to liver cells. \n\nThe talk about kratom \"saving lives\" and helping people is a lame excuse to keep a legal high, legal. Claiming that it is of plant origin is not a good reason to maintain its legality. There are many naturally occurring plants that are exceptionally toxic, and many man made chemicals which are exceptionally benign. \n\nThere is no quality control surrounding kratom. The shops that sell it are merely capitalizing on a high margin, addictive substance. Users think they are doing themselves a favor because kratom is \"natural,\" but that is not good logic for assuming it has not toxicology concerns. \n\nMoreover, people are just trading their other addictions for kratom addiction. The majority of people pressuring the DEA to keep kratom unscheduled, are selling it, or addicted to it. People can potentially develop irreversible damage to their vital organs by using this, all the while thinking they are doing something healthy. \n\nThe drug interactions between kratom and other substances and prescription medication are unknown. This is highly dangerous, as kratom has more than one (in fact, many) active alkaloids. \n\nIf kratom is to be sold, it should be studied, and then forced to adhere to rigorous quality control standards. People may be ingesting leaf powder (which is all coming from Southeast Asia) that has pesticides, mold, bacteria, or other toxins present.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6532","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dr. Michael Walkins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, my name is Tyler Peffer.

It has helped many people, of many back grounds. Kratom has personally helped me with my chronic pain (6 years of constant numbness and sharp pain through various parts of my back), my depression  (combination of multiple deaths, chronic pain, and major personal battles that have no connection to illegal drugs use), and overall quality of life. I can be the me i want to be with this plant. I am not constantly in crippling pain hunched over and unable to complete my job. This plant saved my career, as i have to be on my feet 8 to 12 hours a day, in the restaurant management field. Without kratom i am severely depressed as the mass majority of my family has passed away in the last 5 years. I also had a huge life changing experiance for the worst when my significant other decided it wassnt going to work out. I use to deal with depression with a deink, that turned into 3, then into 5, and so on. I can happily save i have ZERO want to binge drink to make me forget, with kratom in my life. With kratom my overall quality of life has improved drastically. My social anxiety is minimal while taking kratom. My self doubt is reduced to all time lows, allowing me to believe in myself enough to start new hobbies. While on kratom i was able to turn my health around and become physically fit. I weighed 230 lbs at 5 ft 8, abt 30 percent body fat, i am currently 165 lbs at 11.5 percent. Not to take away from my great efforts, kratom helped me achieve this. It gave me the pain relief i needed, it gave me the determination, motivation, and can do spirit to push through and turn my health around. I've kept the weight off for a complete year now, and kratom was there the entire time, keeping me positive about all life aspects.if kratom is made illegal, there will be a definite spike in heroin overdoses. I saved my brother from heroin with kratom. I am 23, if i go ask a doctor for pain killers they treat me like a drug fiend. Not to mention ive seen what prescription opiates can do. I do not want to be addicted to a pill. I simply want my right as an American citizen, to herbal medicate rather than chemically medicate with proven killers and life destroyers. Please only consider the true facts of kratom and the will of the people in mind, when making this historic decision.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20011","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Grant King","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello it has been brought to my attention that Kratom is about to be categorized as a Schedule one Narcotic.

The choice is obviously yours, for the peoples' choices are more and more limited every day by the mistakes made by our leadership to protect the people from themselves, instead of educating them properly, and providing access to such classified information, while denying qualified professionals, not just opinions, but thorough investigations.\n\nProve to us, there is reason to believe any or all we were taught in your schools, had the spine to stand alone amongst the onslaught of today's dis-information. We don't want to look up to movie stars and pop culture, but respect science and logical reasoning for the basis and premise for our culture, in-group, and too often oppressors. Have you no faith in your own systems structure? Do the people not represent the voice of nature, when machinery and industry has all but silenced Her, in scandal running unchecked through our info structure, like a pathological fever? \n\nThis is about more than one mere plant, while we choose to defend kratom for it's positive effects, or negative for those who have to learn the hard way, we must learn moderation and discipline, which clearly the plant states it's own warning with no hesitance... Instead of attacking the plant kingdom, and enslaving Mother Nature to your perverted bidding, recognize, everything has it's place and purpose and respect such, instead of turning your cheek in the name of shallow profits, from monstrous industries which the common people simply wish their right to compete fairly, upon the market, while we merely reflect our leaderships ways and teachings.... At least give the states the option to vote on it and thus be fairly represented.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9811","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used krarom on and off for pain since 2011 so that I can stay away from the addiction potential of painkillers because I have a very good friend who was prescribed a high dose of prescription painkiller and he was left addicted after the doctors had stopped prescribing it to him.

I currently work as a driver while seeking better employment by using Oregon Department of Human Services Vocational Rehabilitation services. I have a Bachelors of Science degree and an additional Associates of Science in another discipline.\nOpposition to Ban because of benefits:\nI am opposed to the ban on Kratom because Kratom is the only thing that addresses my depression issues.  It also helps me to maintain sobriety from alcohol dependence.  It also addresses the other issues that accompany depression e.g. insomnia, OCD, and anxiety. It is not a cure but it is more effective than all the other medications I have taken. I have used numerous drugs and combination of drugs that; first my general doctor, then my psychiatrist, and finally my prescriber from the community mental health clinic, could come up with over the 20 years I have been being treated for this condition.  None of the prescribed remedies works as well as Kratom. Many of these drug cocktails had nasty side effects. Kratom has none.\nTherefore, I strongly oppose the ban on Kratom. A ban would make me sick again. I have a job now and am looking for a better one, I will not be able to get a better job or even hold the employment I currently have if I sink back into depression.  I will likely become suicidal again, return to drinking, and spiral downwards from there. Now that I know what normal is, having Kratom denied to me because of the whim of some agency, is going to be much harder to handle than if I had never been normal at all. I think it will be something similar to what is said about it being harder for rich people to become poor than it is for a poor person to stay poor. It is the starkness between conditions that shocks the our outlook on life.  But this is speculation, I cannot see the future. I only know that I have been hospitalized for suicide attempts in the past.\nPeople who use Kratom know how devestating living withour it will be, but other people and agencies will feel the pain too. I expect overdoses will increase, people who can no longer work will want social services, there will likely be more crime to pay for heroin, suicides among the depressed should go up,etc..  Who knows what else, but if you are curious about what else might come, dont go to the DEA for information. They do not seem to know anything about Kratom except that they want to outlaw it and they want to do it quietly, under cover of darkness. \nIf the media is correct, less than 5 percent of the drugs coming into this country are stopped by the DEA. I think the DEA would do better to focus their attention on that, instead of on herbs that help people. Kratom does not intoxicate or have side effects. You cannot overdose. It is a wonderful help to individuals and therefore to our society.  Our society is stronger if people can overcome addictions and not require opioids to manage pain. Not to mention the relief it gives to people who suffer from mental illnesses. It is crazy, perhaps even malicious,  to want to take this away.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12906","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Neidert","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern,\n\nI oppose the DEAs proposal to make the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, two constituents of the kratom plant, schedule 1 controlled substances. From my own experience, I do not think kratom -- a plant consumed safely by thousands of people every year -- should be on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. I own a local shop in Chicago where we sell Kratom products. I found myself in the business after hearing about kratom from my best friend whose brother died from a heroine overdose. I want to help those in need of an alternative, natural pain managing supplement. Since opening the shop, I have met so many wonderful individuals using Kratom for a variety of reasons. Most are looking for a way to manage their pain, whatever that pain may be. My customers are firefighters, contractors, artists, engineers, teachers, chefs, CEOs, moms, dads, adult children and grandparents. I do not want to see their lives thrown into chaos if they are forced to turn to additive pain managers or forced to live with their pain. I have seen kratom help so many individuals. I hope the DEA will carefully consider what will happen to the thousands of individuals using kratom if a ban goes in to effect. I do not want to see any of my friends/customers forced to use additive (legal prescription or illegal) drugs to manage their pain, especially when kratom has helped so many of them. I have seen individuals use kratom on a as need basis and I do not know of anyone who is addicted to kratom. \n\nJust today, I saw a study conducted by Walter C. Prozialeck, PhD and published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association. He concludes \"based on all of the evidence, it is clear that kratom and its mitragynine constituents are not opioids and that they should not be classified as such.\" He writes that \"after evaluating the literature, I can reach no other conclusion than, in pure herbal form, when taken at moderate doses of less than 10 to 15 g, pure leaf kratom appears to be relatively benign in the vast majority of users.\" I hope his study will be taken into consideration. It can be found here: jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2588524. I have also heard that scheduling of kratom would prevent future research, which I think would be a huge disservice to entire human population. I hope more studies can be conducted to show how the primary alkaloids in kratom may be beneficial without causing respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\nI urge the DEA to halt the ban until further, in-depth studies can be performed. I believe that those who use kratom are responsible and educated. I know there is an opioid epidemic in this country- my best friend's brother died in their bathroom from a heroine overdose. However, taking away a natural supplement that could replace an opioid as pain management would only continue that epidemic. I wish my friend's brother would have tried kratom before his passing. I believe it may have saved him.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18560","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Palatnik","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi,\nMy name is Ivy, I was in a car accident about 5 years ago.

I used opiate painkillers for pain, I ended up talking to my doctor because I was having trouble taking them as directed.  (Tolerance was developing, perhaps an addiction). I found kratom, it was almost a miracle.   I could function on a much lower dose of ground up leaves than I was on painkillers, I also found it to be an antianxiety/antidepressant.   I did not abuse it, as I did not feel any euphoric effects, (which I did from Vicodin or Percocet, or other prescription opiate), but it did take my pain away and let me function.   I need up pregnant with my fourth child and went on methadone, as there are no studies about safety for a fetus.  \n That is one thing that really needs to be addressed, this plant should remain legal for free use by free people, but it should also be able to be studied.   There is a huge possibility of life saving medicine, or alternative treatments being made from the leaf.  But because it is natural, rather mild herb in its natural form, it shouldn't be taken away from the common person. \nWhen I quit, I had no ill effects or withdrawal.  \n   The thought of common people losing access to the herb in its natural, mild state is frustrating to say the least.

I do not take Kratom, nor do I use marijuana, but I feel they are similar in the sense that facts need to be determined before misinformation is spread. I hear that kratom supplements and kratom tea has greatly helped people get off of opiate addiction, which is largely caused by getting hooked on prescription drugs. I feel that finding effective alternatives to prescription opiates, which has become a widespread national epidemic, is of great value and kratom may turn out to be a viable solution.

Not only did it help with pain, it gave me a bit of energy that I haven't had since going to the doctor years ago. It's the equivalent of drinking four cups of strong coffee, without the caffeine. There was no high, there was no side effects other than sweating but since I am going through menopause, that's normal for me anyway.

It's easy to see why others would use this wonderful tea in order to work and maintain a normal life. To take it away now, after Chuck Rosenberg decided to keep cannabis on schedule one even though there is more than ample evidence that it's medicinal and not the least bit harmful, will only serve as proof to the world that the DEA is corrupt and probably throw suspicion on the FDA as well.

I am married with a four year old son.\n\nI have been using kratom for over two years. I started using kratom because it was a alternative to taking nsaid pain relievers that were not effective in relieving my chronic pain from previous injuries. I would have to take frequent unhealthy (according to my doctor and the manufacturer's label) high doses to get any relief. I do not want to take opiate or opiod analgesics due to the side effects and addictive nature of those drugs. I have tried taking vicodin and percocet for my pain but I would end up with more of the side effects than pain relief. The danger of addiction to these drugs is too much of a risk for me to take. I have too much responsibility to risk the perils of addiction. Kratom has been a blessing for me. By using kratom, I have managed to relieve my chronic pain with out putting my career and family life in jeapordy. I do not have any ill side effects with kratom use and I am able to perform at work and home effectively with out being \"doped up\" or sick. By banning kratom you will be making my life harder by forcing me to take unhealthy amounts of otc pain relievers or having to rely on prescribed pain killers and risking the perils of addiction and side effects. The way I see it, the only beneficiaries to the ban will be the pharmaceutical industry. It will certainly not make the me or the public any safer in my opinion.

Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them quit. A ban now all but promises scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment to be shut down immediately.\n\nSadly, our country is currently in the depths of an opioid epidemic.

I am 26 years old. I have used kratom for a little over a year now. I have horrible back pains from scoliosis, and have suffered from it since I can remember. I was a butcher for about 7 years before I changed careers to become a CNA. While I was a butcher, my back would flare up so bad, I would illicitly buy painkillers from older co-workers to manage the pain. I moved to Roanoke and didn't know anyone to buy them from. This lead me to alcohol while I worked. I eventually went to rehab and moved to Florida to, again, work as a butcher. Florida is where I found out about kratom. When I moved back to Virginia, I then turned to being a CNA. Lower pay, but more satisfaction. Being a CNA in a nursing home, I'm on my feet running all day. Honestly, I don't believe I could do my job without the aid of kratom. It doesn't affect my judgement or coordination in any way. When I first tried it, it did affect judgment/coordination slightly. After using it a couple times it doesn't. However, it does still ease my back, and now, leg pain.

It is a dietary supplement, no different from other common herbs such as valerian root, skullcap, passion flower, etc., that millions of people around the world have used to benefit their lives.  If the scheduling of kratom proceeds, the American People will suffer a significant negative impact on their lives, finding themselves with no access to an herbal remedy that many find to be an effective antidiarrheal, analgesic, treatment for opiate addiction, alternative to caffeine, and sleep aid, among it's many other uses.  Also, academic research into this potentially valuable plant will be unable to continue.  It's safety profile is clear cut - it has been used for thousands of years by Asian civilizations with no significant long-term detrimental impacts.  Indeed, this has been partially studied: \"Our findings suggest that chronic kratom administration does not significantly impair social functioning of users in a natural context in Malaysia.\" (1)  Regarding any instances of supposed harm that has occurred involving kratom - I strongly urge you to remember that ANY substance, even water, can become hazardous when used improperly, and this is just as true of virtually all legal dietary supplements.  The risk to public health is spectacularly minimal, as is the scope, duration, and significance of any supposed \"abuse\".  This is verified by a CDC report which confirms that in the five year period between 2010-2015, an incredibly minute grand total of 660 poison center calls were reported to involve kratom, of which an astounding 92.6% of cases of exposure were reported to involve \"minimal signs or symptoms, which resolved rapidly with no residual disability\" or were \"non-life threatening, with no residual disability...\" (2)  It is obvious from these figures that no substance with a significant actual or relative potential for abuse could possibly have that few number of calls while also being relatively obtainable to the degree that kratom is.  In fact, to this date, no deaths can be ascribed solely to the usage of kratom, as verified by a 2016 review which states \"there is no solid evidence that kratom was the sole contributor to an individual's death\". (3)  In comparison, a drug that is actually deserving of Schedule 1 status, Heroin, has resulted in over 10,500 deaths in 2014 alone, while also being far more difficult to obtain relative to kratom. (4)  In short, the facts demonstrate that kratom most certainly does not meet the criteria for scheduling (either temporary or permanent).  If you proceed with the scheduling of kratom (and/or banning it through the scheduling of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine), you will be reaching beyond your legal authority and gravely violating the trust placed in you by the American People.

It only effects my mental state, which prior to using kratom, had been in a perpetual state of suicidal tendencies.

Placing this under schedule 1 is a catastrophically wrong decision. This plant is harming no one, only helping. NOONE has died from this plant, those accounts have all included other drugs.

The combination of injury on right and left side, even with physical therapy, feels to have unbalanced my body. I do not necessarily believe in an overtly pro-drug society, or in the healing power of chemicals alone. However, when my shoulders get unbearable and my body is tense as a knot I will take a small dose of kratom for a day or two. This happens maybe once every other month or so; ingesting a number of grams of the plant. I combine the kratom with stretching. For my situation the plant has an affect comparable to drinking tea when sick. I am one of those who would rather drink tea than take nyquil.  \n     It should also be mentioned that I know a few other people who semi-regularly take kratom, each for their own reason. Never once have any of them reported any issues, nor cerebral impairment of any significance. The 'high' from this leaf is negligible, and it does not even approaches something like, say, pot (if comparisons can be made) -let alone the high from pharma-narcotics. Someone high on or addicted to kratom is like someone high on or addicted to coffee.\n     Overall, I stand with the opinion that Mitragynine remain off the Schedule 1 list. The amount of money involved in enforcing the illegalization of kratom; the annoyance that would be caused to its users; and the effects it would have on some small businesses-in san francisco and los angeles especially-are not worth it! The kratom community is much smaller than something like the marijuana community. We are in nobody's way.

My only experience with side effects has been nausea-which only happened at first and only because I didn't know the proper amount to take. For that reason, the only restrictions I feel that Kratom warrants are a warning label about the potential for nausea and information on the packaging concerning recommended serving amounts.\n\nIn my experience and observation, Kratom is a mostly beneficial plant that poses little or no danger to health, has definite positive attributes for people suffering from a range of both psychological and physical issues, deserves to be researched, and above all, kept legal.\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5118","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi Good People,\n\nThank you for reading my letter re: making Kratom illegal. \n\nI'm a 28 y/o cis-gendered male living in the SF Bay Area.

Since the end of August I have been quite concerned about the fate of this plant since it has helped me so much in my life. I am strongly opposed to the D.E.A.'s plan to schedule Kratom since I believe that it has many medical uses. \n\nThe reason that I myself take Kratom is due to my social anxiety, for as long as I can remember I have always been a quiet person. I have always had trouble making new friends or even just talking to people I did not know. Some days before I had found Kratom my anxiety would be so bad that I would almost feel afraid to leave the house for no real reason other than just being anxious. Now however, with the use of Kratom my anxiety is not nearly as bad as it used to be, I am never anxious or afraid to leave the house anymore nor do I have trouble talking to complete strangers. \n\nAround the time of my sophomore year in college I realized that I had really made no friends at school in the year and a half or so that I had been there. This realization is what prompted me to go and talk with a doctor on campus about my anxiety disorder. The doctors recommendation for me was that he put me on medication as well as have me see another doctor as a sort of therapist to talk with about my anxiety problems and how to get thru them. After hearing this I decided that seeing a therapist might be a good idea; however, I did not like the idea of taking medicine due to the possibility of addiction which often comes with anti-anxiety medication. So, I decided that it would be best to do some research on my own of different anti-anxiety medications that are typically prescribed, which was how I ended up learning about Kratom, \n\nAfter researching different anti-anxiety medications I happened across some research which was talking about natural supplements with anti-anxiety properties to them. One of the supplements that I found which had anti-anxiety properties was Kratom, the reason that I was drawn more to Kratom that anything else was that it was a completely natural remedy which was also non addictive. I figured that it sounded a lot safer to be taking a ground up leaf that came off a tree, rather than a pill that was made by someone in a lab. Of-course, just because Kratom was something found in nature did not mean that it was necessarily safe to take; so, I obviously began researching the plant. \n\nAfter many weeks of researching Kratom online I decided to give it a try and bought some off of Amazon.com. Once it arrived in the mail I made some tea with it and went back to my room in my apartment to drink it, hoping that I would return to the main room later to talk with my roommates I still barely knew. Within an hour of finishing the tea I was back out of my room talking to one of my roommates while he was cooked his dinner. Ever since that day I have been taking Kratom for times that I know I will be in a social situation since it allows me to talk with others so easily while not making me feel off or tired which many of the prescription anti-anxiety drugs tend to apparently do. \n\nTo many people without it, anxiety can sound like an excuse to not do something like leave the house, but for people like me, it is a reality that I have to face some days of my life. Thankfully however, I discovered Kratom which allows me to get over my anxiety when I need to and allows me to live a pretty close to normal life. As it stands right now, I feel that Kratom should be left alone so that the individual can decide whether or not they want to take it, since I have never found any evidence first hand or otherwise that Kratom is in any way dangerous. Lastly, I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my story as well as consider this issue from every angle before making a decision on whether or not Kratom should be scheduled; because I know that if it were not for Kratom I would not be the person that I am today.\n\nSincerely,\nAustin A.

I attended college on a full Division 1A football scholarship.  I played football since I was 7 years old.  As I got older I began to have severe back problems.  I had a cervical fusion on my neck 5 years ago.  I was still committed to working out and staying in great shape after this surgery but soon I began having severe pain in my lower back.  I was then diagnosed with a Spondylolisthesis which essentially means my lower spine shifted out of position and the only surgical solution is a major fusion of my lower back.  I am fighting to prevent this surgery because it would significantly lower my quality of life.  I also had stomach cancer during all of these back problems which resulted in 15% of my lower intestine being removed along with some lymphnodes.  Although I am now cancer free I suffer from constant diarrhea and abdominal pain.  All of these symptoms have resulted in me being on a pain killer regimen of 150 oxycodone 15mg pills per month.  To make a long story short I realized right away these pills were necessary but highly addictive and easily abused.  Kratom has allowed me to stop taking these pills all together over a six month period.  I am also able to take them as needed without feeling the addictive cravings which came from the opiates.  To put it simply, I am begging you not to make this miracle natural medicine illegal.  I have never signed any kind of petition before this in my life but without this organic medication I fear what will become of the rest of my life.  Thank you for your time and please take my comments seriously even though I chose to be anonymous.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19155","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Until Kratom is shown to be a danger to people's health, it shouldn't even be FONSIDERED for schedule 1.

I broke my back 9 years ago I have tremendous pain due to my injury. They have had me on very strong painkillers for those nine years and I was sick of having to take a pill to not get sick because it no longer helped my pain. The only reason I continued taking the medicine was because I was scared of going through the hard withdrawals from the opiates. I Was told about kratom from a friend I had never heard of Kratom before. So I saw my chance of being able to get off the opiates without having to go through the withdrawals. I took my chance after reading and doing a lot of research on kratom. So I finally decided to order some and try it out. Well all I can say is that it is a miracle I was able to get off of the opiates with the help of Kratom. Now I am still in pain but I don't have to take the medicine to not get sick thanks to kratom. I could have continued taking Kratom to help with the pain but after nine years of taking some sort of pill to relieve the pain I decided not to continue taking kratom. There is no reason to make it a schedule 1 narcotic. It is nothing but a blessing too people that are or have been in my situation. Unfortunately not many people know about it that are in the position I was so they continue to be on this medicine that is just not good. I would hope that you guys see the good in kratom and choose not to make it a schedule 1 narcotic. It needs to be out there for people to use because there is no bad side to kratom. For me it has been a miracle. So please take all of this under consideration when you make your decision and I hope that the decision you make it is to not make a schedule 1 narcotic because if you do there will be so many people out there that it will impede their life without being able to utilize kratom.

The plant has been considered a blessing for many people. For those who suffer from physical pain on a daily basis this is an option they should consider. In my opinion, this is the most outstanding benefit that the plant provides. Not only does it relieve pain but it also replaces other dangerous pain-relieving medicine such as Oxycontin, Dilaudid, Fentanyl and Heroin. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, it is impossible to compare Kratom to these highly addictive substances that have been mentioned, because Kratom in it self has not brought upon any damaging addictive behavior that other substance do bring. Kratom not only provides the pain-relieving side of opiates. In addition to that, it has a similarity to an anxiolytic, because it definitely relieves anxiety attacks. I started exploring the plant a year ago, and it has benefitted me substantially. My overall motivation and health got better over time. It has helped me cope with stress and it definitely helps with physical pain. Thank you for taking the time and let us communicate to you our stance on this issue.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4121","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bryan Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps me with my pain, and I have had no bad effects from it.

I maintained the two \ntablet level for seven years.  I have a health plan with Kaiser and they made it almost impossible for me to continue taking \noxycodone because of the widespread misuse by some people.

He became dependent on opiates due to pain, fatigue, restlessness and withdrawal. To stop using pain pills he began taking subutex / suboxone; which also becomes a dependant. I never imagined the viscous cycle would end. It was ruining our relationship and lives. I myself shortly suffered from an opioid (pain pill) dependency. I experienced loss of motivation to do everyday things, such as going to work, aches and pains and fatigue. Even with a significant amount of time without taking a pain pill, I never felt like I did before I started taking them and never thought I would return to that state nor state of mind. My boyfriend desperately wanted to quit using the suboxone all together; desperately wanted to be free of this dependency that was controlling his life. I \"discovered\" kratom about a month ago due to a public post on social media that described it as 'a wonderful herb that helped with fatigue, mood and to help people get off of street drugs.' Through this source I found someone who sells kratom and ever since I have been purchasing it, my boyfriend has not taken a single pain pill or suboxone. From my own experience of taking kratom, I have found that my mood has become better and I have found motivation to get out of bed in the morning or complete daily tasks that I was previously struggling with as I also suffer from anxiety and depression that seems to control my life some days. What's wonderful about kratom, is that it is not a drug, it isn't something that gets you high or causes withdrawal or dependency; it isn't something that needs to be used daily. Thus far, it has completely changed my life for the better. It has saved my relationship by stopping my boyfriend from opioid use. It has literally made my life better financially, physically, emotionally and mentally. My only regret is that I wasn't aware of it sooner. Since I have discovered kratom I have met someone who stated kratom helped them become clean from meth over 2 years ago, I have met opioid dependant users who no longer need to take opiates; whether they had a chronic illness or pain that began their use or were simply addicted to pills. I have met people who are / were on disability, no longer suffering. I have met people who are no longer taking prescriptions for pain and sleep.

I keenly oppose the proposal to schedule alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine . This is a tried and true means of helping myself and others live happy and meaningful lives.\n\nI am a sales/retail store manager, and work in the natural health and wellness industry.  My career is dependent on my knowledge of supplements, as well as running a business and successful development of my employees.\n\nI started out working as a vet tech for many years. Around the same time that I became disenchanted with the field, I fell ill. A slew of specialists, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, could not figure out what was wrong with me.  This was in the age of loose prescribing standards in FL, the result was a hefty diet of narcotics.\nMoving up north, I was promptly cut off from pain killers. In my youth and in desperation, I turned to heroin for pain management. \nDuring this period of time, I self educated and began trying natural remedies. This is how i came across Kratom. It worked with my body better than any pharmaceutical or illicit drug could. It allowed painless cessation of heroin, and the shame associated with it. \n\nAlmost instantaneously, I began advancing in my career and interpersonal affairs. Numerous friends/family have commented on my progress. I have become a key player in my company, and without hesitation I insist that in my history of chronic pain and depression, Kratom has vastly improved my quality of life. It allows me to be a productive member of society. Furthermore, Kratom has been a strong alliance by serving as a tool to aid as I excel at life. \nNot once has it offered a 'buzz', it simply takes the pain away. Every morning upon waking I immediately crave coffee. This must be coupled with a cigarette. Without both I am grumpy and cynical. My first dose of kratom comes much later in day, and if delayed I do not mind. Point being that perfectly legal poison is ten times more addictive than my Kratom habit. Kratom is also ten times more beneficial for me.  \n\nIn a perfect world it would not be necessary, but this world is far from.  American citizens are plagued by maladies ranging in diagnosis.  The options available and prescribed are often coupled with side effects that can make the initial disease pale in severity.  Kratom does not cure anymore than prescribed treatments, but it works in offsetting symptoms, providing an incredibly SAFE and effective management of illness(the words safe and effective rarely go hand in hand, as you know).\n\nThis past summer, my friend who introduced me to heroin passed away by OD. This was the third person in my life to meet this fate. It breaks my heart to imagine the lives who can use this plant to conquer their addictions, simply not having access to such. Countless others will benefit from using Kratom as a dietary supplement. I know my story, while my own, is not novel and that I am not alone.  \nI would think the overwhelming support for this entheogen would be more helpful than perfect, tactful wording.\n\nRegulation can be as simple as what my multivitamin says on the label: not intended to treat or cure any illness or disease, not FDA regulated.\n\nPlease don't take away Kratom. Centuries of traditional use clearly depict it's usefulness, the good outweighing any bad.  Scheduling the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine would be a devastating blow to the American people, life is already too hard.\n\n\nWith respect, outlawing Kratom will be a travesty to every American who uses Kratom, or knows a Kratom user.\nI implore your organization to consider all testimonials and medical studies in reaching an educated decision.\nThank you for your consideration and allowing the community to comment.  \n\nSincerely,\nDanielle M Cifelli","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20352","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Danielle Cifelli","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n As an American citizen who has had family members directly been effected by opioids, I would like you to advise you to not out Kratom into schedule 1.

I am 34 years old and I'm a stay at home mother to 3 children. My intent with this letter is to oppose the proposed ban on alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine that are in Kratom as this herbal supplement has helped me in many ways over the last 3 years. \nI would like to share some of my history with you as well as how I came to find Kratom and how it has helped me. Seven years ago I had injured my back at the L1 S5 area of my spine. Doctors placed me on a different pain relievers such as Hydrocodone and Percocet for relief, but said I would more than likely need surgery if managing through pain medicine didn't offer a good quality of life. Well, the pain medicine would help at first, but after a while I became dependent on them and I needed more and more to gain the same relief. After a few years I decided that I had become addicted and sought help to get off of them, so I went through a program that offered Suboxone as a means of kicking a pain medicine habit. I was in this program for little over a year when I realized I had become addicted to Suboxone. I felt like I couldn't win and the only thing I wanted was to not be in pain and not be dependent on anything. I wasn't myself anymore. \nThrough some research I found Kratom as a was to stop all medicine and relieve my back pain. So, I decided to give it a try. This was 3 years ago. I successfully stopped Suboxone with no withdrawals and found that I could use Kratom only as needed. There wasn't an addictive trait to it, unlike Hydrocodone and Percocet or even Suboxone. It has truly saved me. I have also found that for me, the pain pills would intensify my pain so that I felt I needed more and more. With Kratom I can go days or weeks and only take it as needed, and my pain is never intensified. \n\nThis herbal supplement has truly been everything I needed. I really hope that the government won't try to ban and natural plant that has given me hope in having a good quality of life and optimism. Please here my story in reevaluating the decision to ban alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine found in Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18825","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Leigh Grim","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is one of many God-given blessings to mankind.

With the political climate in this country right now, and sky rocketing costs of healthcare Americans have done what Americans have always done best...adapt and overcome. An enormous amount of people are in much better health, mind and body, solely due to Kratom and it's wonderful and most importantly natural, medicinal effects.  I don't believe at all that Kratom poses any kind of threat whatsoever to the public health. In fact I believe the very opposite. I know what kinds of things are harmful and dangerous for the public's health. Because I am the public. And I have been unhealthy. Namely from the large quantities of prescription pain killers I was being given by my doctor for a broken back and heel injury I had gotten. It took me years and years to get clean. The opiate epidemic in this country is very real, and should be very scary for the DEA and the FDA. I've heard many opponents of Kratom say that it should be scheduled based on it's \"opiate like\" characteristics, and the dependency factor. Firstly just because something is opiate like, does not in fact make it something as dangerous as an opiate. And aslo everything in our day to day lives has a dependency factor. Caffiene, sugar, alcohol, tobacco. The difference is that Kratom is a completely all natural tree leaf from a tree a kin to the coffee tree. It's important to me and to a large portion of this country that we do not lose our personal right to chose what is best for our bodies when it comes to natural medicine. This is a basic human right. I believe we should study it and learn more about it, and possible future uses for it. But to just take it away and schedule it next to heroin based on incomplete findings and hearsay is premature at best. Kratom saved my life. Literally. Please don't take away the opportunity for it to saves others' as well.

From the perspective of a pharmacist, I am extremely concerned that this ban will have far reaching negative consequences for many patients across the country. Kratom is an herb ,that has been used safely for hundreds of years and helps tens of thousands of people nationwide. It is not a new synthetic drug, which is what the emergency scheduling provision in the CSA was designed to address. Many people who suffer from chronic pain, anxiety, drug cravings and chronic fatigue use kratom to support their overall health and wellbeing. On top of that, anecdotal evidence suggests that many patients managed to completely cut opioids out of their lives because of this plant. The active ingredient in the plant, Mitragynine , does have some mild partial  effects on the mu opioid receptor but does not cause any respiratory depression. The main mechanism of action does not involve traditional mu agonism, rather from a collection of alkaloids that effect a large array of receptors in the brain including opioid antagonists. The main alkaloids in the plant also do not activate the beta-arrestin pathways, which are proteins in the brain that cause respiratory depression. Due to the lack of full agonism, kratom is unlikely to produce an effect comparable to other full agonist opioids. There have been NO deaths directly related to kratom. The 15 deaths your administration referred to all involved kratom with a large mixture of pharmaceutical drugs. The 660 poison control calls cited by your agency was not put into context.Legal herbs that have widespread use, such as Echinacea , Gingko Bilboa , St. John Worts, have all received has thousands of calls. Also the vast majority of poison control calls were ranked as mild or moderate . In 2014 an estimated 458 people died from acute liver failure from misusing Tylenol, should the DEA ban that as well?  \n\nAt this time there a lot of barriers in the healthcare system to receive treatment for their health conditions, and a large section of patients do not tolerate prescription drugs well. While there is no medical use for kratom based on evidence-based medicine, we should not stop a person who wants to ingest a plant that improves their well-being and avoid more dangerous drugs. While self-treating conditions should not be encouraged, healthcare professionals should be open-minded about the use of the herb and still attempt to forge a therapeutic alliance with patients.  Many conventional opioids and replacement therapy (buprenonorphine,methadone) have many side effects that can potentially make them hard to tolerate. Traditional opioid replacement therapy can cause serious adverse effects, such as nausea, sexual side effects, sedation and many more. This plant has a substantially better safety profile than methadone,suboxone, prescription painkillers,SSRIs,benzos based on the mortality data we have on all the substances. More long-term studies on kratoms effect on health need to be done, but nothing in the literature suggests this drug is an imminent public health threat. While clinicians should not be advocating its use, it is not appropriate for the government to turn all kratom users into potential felons. This ban will cut a lifeline for many people, and could result in a lot of death if patients choose to resume illicit drug use or start back on riskier prescription drugs after the ban.This measure will only worsen the current heroin/fentanyl epidemic that is killing thousands of citizens.I agree it is disgusting that some convenience stores/headshops are marketing this as a \"legal high\", and I support a retail ban/age restrictions so teenagers do not have access to the herb. There are many sensible restrictions that can be done; such as age limits (21) , have the FDA standardize and regulate vendors and a total retail ban of the herb a supplement, and banning alkaloid extracts. If the DEA/FDA main concern is it being marketed for consumption at smoke shops/gas stations, then encourage congress to create legislation to ban this avenue of sale. Companies should absolutely not get away with selling the herb with medical/recreational claims, and the FDA should penalize businesses that attempt to do this. The raw leaf though should be available for adult consumers who want a natural remedy to improve their wellness/quality of life. \n\nThis is a complicated issue and I urge you to consider reconsider your intention to ban the plant. Dealing with the people who return to opioids after the ban will cost the government potentially millions of dollars in law enforcement costs.

I'm a married 35 year old from Texas. I had severe back issues in my early 20's. It went something like this...... Back pain,  OK try these darvocets. Doc,  these are not working, OK try these hydrocodones. Doc, these are not working. OK try these oxycontin. By this point I somehow managed to keep my job, but at the age of 29, I was a full blown addict. I will just leave it at that. I was able to switch over to suboxone, which I am still on,  and feel like I may never get off of them. \n\nI first heard about Kratom on SiriusXM radio, so I decided to try it. It has helped me lower my suboxone intake and made the withdrawals almost tolerable. But they are still there, everyday. Everyday. \n\nThis plant is helping people when the system is obviously flawed. Look at the amount of people addicted to pain pills. I was never a drug user but trust me,  oxycontin will make you do things you would have never ever dreamt of, in order to get it. That's why so many people turn to heroin. It's easier to get and way cheaper. \n\nFor the sake of us hard working people out here, trying to live with a terrible addiction, please reconsider this plant and its great medicinal values. It helps ease the pain and suffering of addiction.

Im a 38 year old mother of two. My son Sam who is 13 years old and my daughter Lily who is 10 years old. I have suffered from Fibromyalgia for the last six years. The pain and other symptoms of my illness have grown worse as time goes by. My doctors had put me on Tramadol for the pain. Tramadol made me severely ill and I was to stop taking it. When I quit taking Tramadol, I went through increased pain and severe withdraws. Worse than I had ever experienced with my illness. I became bedridden, unable to participate in everyday task, or enjoy time with my children.\n\nI began doing research online for natural or alternative pain relief. I soon found Kratom. When I received my first sample I took it with some skepticism, not really believing it would help with the level of pain I was in. After fifteen minutes I was amazed at the relief I felt. I walked up and down the stairs, something I had been unable to do. I was able to start working again. As a makeup artist, I spend most of my time standing and bent over clients which causes strain on many parts of my body. I know I wouldnt be able to continue working without Kratom. I take this herbal supplement three times a day and four if my Fibromyalgia is flared up. I can take this supplement without side effects, and it doesnt make me loopy or drowsy. Nor does it make me feel jittery like coffee can at times. To say that Kratom has saved my life does not do it justice. Without this supplement I would not be the mother and wife I am today. I would not know all the moments of joy I spend with my husband and children because I would be in a fog of pain and misery. You cannot truly understand what it is to live in excruciating pain unless you have lived it. Kratom has let me live as a normal member of society. To not only function in society but to actually contribute.\n\nMy mother has Cancer, and because of the wonderful change she has seen in me since I found Kratom, she is now looking to use it at the pain from her disease progresses. We are truly fearful of Kratom being banned or taken from our reach. Neither of us want to be put on opiates. With narcotics comes addiction and tolerance. You will continually need more to control the pain. It will affect my life including my job and family. Our lives will revolve around doctors appointments. Not to mention the cost of doctors and prescriptions. With opiates you build a tolerance to a point there is soon nothing to help the pain. Using this supplement none of this happens. This natural plant is a gift that I give thanks for everyday and it makes my everyday possible. \n\nThank you for your time,\n\nMrs. Michelle Brown","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5544","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michelle Brown","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Good Morning, I am a single father, age 43, Director of Marketing and in recovery for alcohol and pain medication.

Much good comes from the work the DEA does, combating poisonous, life-destroying substances that lead to crime, violence, and often, death.  \nKratom is not such a substance.  As I read through many of these comments, I see how many men and women are like me; parents, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, productive members of society who have turned to a remedy that, if used responsibly, can positively change and rebuild lives.  Many have been battered or worn down by chronic pain, debilitating disease, anxiety and high stress, depression, and a host of other ailments that make them less than they can be.  For those of us who use this plant to overcome issues like these, we know that adding Kratom to the highest, most dangerous list of poisons will ultimately force us to to turn to heavier drugs, like antidepressants, opiates and opiods, benzodiazepenes...in short, things that legitimately scare me.  I do not want to adopt these as my way of functioning normally.  I do not want to learn what kind of a person they would turn me into. \nI work in a profession subjected to extremely high levels of stress.  I consider myself good at my job, and a positive influence on my employees, peers, and the customers I come into contact with on a daily basis.  I suffer from social anxiety disorder, depression, chronic fatigue, and pain from injuries suffered over the years in my profession.  I use Kratom daily, not to make these issues go away - that is impossible.  I use it to help me combat them, and ultimately, overcome them in order to be a productive, positive member of society and my community.  I have a lovely wife and three beautiful children, all of whom have a father and husband not crippled by pain, depression, and anxiety, but one who is able to teach them, love them, support them, and be the person they need in their lives.  Please do not take away the thing that empowers me to do this for my family, and for the families of thousands of other men and women in lives similar to mine.  Please make a positive decision, and allow us to continue the dignity of a fully functioning, complete life.  Thank you for your time, and all of your efforts.

I am a 32 year old hairstylist from Virginia. I am writing today to ask that you reconsider making Kratom a schedule 1 controlled substance. 5 years ago I lost my mother to a heroin overdose. She had been clean for nearly 22 years. In 2001 my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was a healthy, active woman, a crane operator with Local 14-14B, The International Union of Operating Engineers in New York. My mother underwent several surgeries, as well as chemotherapy and radiation. She was prescribed narcotic pain killers such as oxycodone by her doctors to help her with the pain. Shortly after she finished her treatment for breast cancer the doctors stopped prescribing her pain medication and she eventually relapsed and started using heroine to substitute.  On June 25, 2011 my mother was found dead from an over dose of oxycodine and heroine. Her mother, my grandmother, found my mothers lifeless body on the bathroom floor. My mother had 22 years clean before she relapsed, she had 22 years clean before heroine took her life. My grandmother lost her daughter, my children lost their grandmother and I lost my mother. \nI know that because my mother was an addict does not mean I will become an addict, however I lived in fear everytime I took pain medication that was prescribed to me. I feared the addiction, I feared for my children, that they should have to see their mother battle such a horrible disease. So I began to look for natural remodies to control not only pain, but anxiety and depression that I suffered after the loss of my mother. About a year ago I learned about Kratom and how it could be used as a dietary supplement, that could also potentially help with pain and anxiety. I decided to try Kratom for the first time 6 months ago. Since then I no longer suffer from back pain, I have energy, I sleep better at night and I dont suffer from depression and anxiety symptoms. When I dont have Kratom I dont get sick, my back pain doesnt return for several days, as opposed to mere hours with other prescribed medications such as hydrocodine. I do not have any physical dependance with Kratom, it simply helps with my pain, anxiety and depression. I no longer live in fear of addiction. I no longer feel I must decide between living in pain or risk pharmaceutical dependancy. I urge you to please reconsider placing Kratom as a schedule one controlled substance. \nThank you in advance for your time and understanding in this matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20555","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christine Henagin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nMy name is Joseph Harmon. I am 33 years old and a father of two great kids with one on the way . My issues with substance abuse began in high school. Although I drank through college I never touched any opiates until I was prescribed 30 hydrocodone 10mg for wisdom teeth extraction. At first they made me dizzy and nauseous but after the third or fourth day I began to take more than prescribed . Once the bottle was empty I asked friends if they had any leftover painkillers for my jaw even though there was no pain left . The compulsion and drive to feed the insatiable craving was stronger than my need for sleep sex or even food . Previously I had talked down to addicts calling them junkies and saying they lack willpower . I am extremely driven and have never missed a day of work and have been in my current field for the past 12 years . After I stole all the painkillers I could find from friends and strangers I began to buy off the black market . A few years ago when the opioid epidemic began to surface , regulations made it harder for people to gain prescription pain  pills . Heroin is cheaper and became everywhere . Heroin was never heard of until then . On one trip to buy pills with a guy who would go in a house and buy pain pills for me , he came out with a small bag of Heroin for me . Facing withdrawal I snorted it and felt better . I kept trying to find the pills but could no longer . Heroin was the only drug I could find . For months I snorted only but one day I decided to shoot it up . Few months later I was alone and overdosed and almost died . This was my wake up call. From that day on I decided I needed help . I tried AA but found it very judgmental. I have been to two separate outpatient rehab programs 20 weeks long . I tried vivitrol and worked for 7 months . After a year I relapsed for 2 weeks and then found an expert in opiate addiction name Dr Lori A Nation @ Kentucky Medical Group . I learned about my disease and also spoke with a therapist monthly . I credit suboxone therapy with helping me get my life together and learn to manage my triggers and understand myself . However suboxone can cause withdrawal when you stop even though it's not a full antagonist opioid. This is where Kratom helped me the final stretch of my recovery . It diminished all side effects and withdrawals from stopping a 2 year suboxone treatment . I no longer take Kratom but I am writing this with hopes that you will not take away a plant that has medicinal value in the fight against mental illness , addiction .","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10641","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joe Harmon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me tremendously along with other maintenance with my opiate addictiction.

I am 29 years old and I work as a pharmacy technician in Norfolk, Virginia. I am a veteran (U.S. Coast Guard) and I've been enjoying the benefits of kratom for about 6 months now. After seeing drugs and crime increase in my hometown of High Point, NC, I decided to join the Coast Guard to help keep dangerous drugs off our American soil. I did exactly that, while serving for 6 years, and honorably discharged. I am strongly opposed at my government's movement to ban this plant. To have it in the same class as heroin and cocaine is absolutely inexcusable and downright ignorant. I have worked retail pharmacy and I have seen real addicts consume and overdose on perfectly legal and lethal opiate medications. I have seen people turn to heroin because of Oxycodone. Kratom is about as dangerous as a cup of coffee.\n\n6 months ago, I heard about kratom and it's benefits. I was ecstatic! Something that makes me feel great and it's natural and legal. Needless to say, my joy was short-lived. I was shocked when I heard about it possibly being banned. I have struggled with depression, anxiety, and attention deficit disorder since the age of 15. I have been on and off many different medication combinations to control my mood and focus. My current meds, combined with my daily kratom use, has helped me tremendously and I know it can help others out there with similar problems. I have yet to find a negative side-effects, unlike my pharmaceutical meds.  \n\nI urge you to reconsider your stance on this issue and keep kratom legal!\n\n\nSincerely,\nOmari Robertson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15298","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Omari robertson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been making kratom tea for a couple of years now.

I am a stay at home mom, and also work from home.\n\nI am writing this comment to voice my strong opposition the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. This herb has helped me tremendously, and I cannot imagine not having access to it or not having it readily available. \n\nI heard about kratom from a friend who suffers from fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis, as well as from a family member who suffers from restless leg syndrome. I began taking kratom in March of 2016 for my chronic neck and back pain, and chronic migraines. Prior to me beginning kratom, I was prescribed several different pain medications, nerve medications, and migraine medications, over the course of eight years. Within two months of taking kratom, I was able to completely taper off of the pain and nerve medications, and have cut the use of migraine medications down over half. I feel so much better not putting those chemicals in my body multiple times a day, and my head feels much clearer. With kratom I have been able to control my chronic pain, and migraines without the use of pain/nerve medications and limited use of migraine medications. Since I started taking kratom and saw first hand the benefits, I have shared it with several family members who have been able to taper off of pain medications as well, and now use kratom to help control their pain. I now know so many people who now control their pain with kratom in lieu of pain medications. That alone is an amazing thing. All the stories I have heard of how kratom has done nothing but benefited people is a testimony in and of itself.\n\nI am so happy to have been introduced to this herbal supplement, and hope the DEA, FDA, and HHS consider how this has helped so many people and what taking it away could do, prior to making a final decision. This isn't about profit, this is about people's lives and living well, happy, and healthy without dependency on prescription drugs that have tremendous side effects.

It's a medicinal plant which has a very long history of human use, and from this we can gather that its record of safety is very good. I am a kratom user of 3 years myself and I've never had a problem with the plant, not with addiction or side effects. Quite to the contrary: this stuff has saved me time and time again. \n\nI suffer with extremely severe anxiety and insomnia as well as frequent panic attacks, and kratom has been a huge asset in my struggle. I also suffer with back pain, and a spoonful or two of kratom helps me get through the day and be a productive member of society at times when I otherwise wouldn't be able. It also has helped many people I know who suffer from addiction to real drugs which actually kill people. Whenever someone would be suffering through heroin withdrawal which is somewhat common for my town, I used to give them a bit of this plant and they would have a few hours of relief from their horrible existence.\n\nKratom is only about as addictive as caffeine in my experience. It has a stunning record of safety when compared to most substances. I can't think of any harm it's done to me or any part of my life. There is no reason to schedule it as a drug at all, honestly. Regulation would be completely understandable, and I would encourage higher standards of quality and perhaps even taxes on kratom products.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4791","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason Vavra","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, and thank you for taking the time to read this comment. I am a 25 year old male with a culinary background from Nicholls State University. I have no prior  opioid or recreational drug experiences.  I have a wonderful Fiance and four year old daughter  to take care of. We also just purchased our first home about a year ago. With that being said, I am in full support of Kratom not becoming a schedule 1 narcotic. Kratom has helped improve my quality of life more than i could ever expect. I personally use Kratom as a replacement for my afternoon coffee, as a pre workout supplement, and for minor pain relief. I've been in the restaurant industry (sushi chef) for about 9 years, and during that time I've developed pain in my wrist and back. While Kratom is not a cure for my pain, it really helps me during those 14 hour shifts, and makes me a more productive member of society. With regards to the opioid epidemic in our country, I strongly believe Kratom can help prevent deaths from over use of prescription pain killers as well as heroin. So once again I am asking the DEA from the bottom of my heart to please reconsider the scheduling of Kratom as a schedule 1 substance.

About an hour later, she was saying how she felt a lot less pain and though she suffered whiplash in the car accident, she reported having improved flexibility and less pain. \nWhen I got back to D.C., I ordered some online with my roommate who also tried kratom in California and it was great. I found that it really helped with my anxiety in a way nothing else has. It didn't make me feel different or inhibited, but was more like coffee. I felt the knee aches I had dissipate and it mitigated the social awkwardness I had been feeling. I was more social and happy overall.\nI dont think it's addictive.

I never quit looking , eventually I ran across a post for kratom and once again gave something else a shot.   After a few days I noticed that while combining kratom with my daily routine of things, I was able to better cope with things, I felt it truly gave me a spark of energy.   There is absolutely nothing \"high\" about this plant.  It only has changed the way I live on a daily basis!  I cry at the thought of it being banned and going back to days being spent in bed.   Please don't ban this plant that has given me the ability to be a productive member of society again.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5504","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Jurgens","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am commenting to support the use of Kratom as both a pain reliever and specifically as an opioid replacement.\n \nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down if you ban this substance.\n\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nPlease do not ban this substance.\n\nThank you for your consideration in this matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16943","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Maurine Canarsky","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In 2005 I was in a car accident that resulted in multiple skull fractures, a broken c1, several breaks to my jaw and face, cracks in most of my teeth, broken shoulder, many broken ribs, lacerations to my liver, lung contusions, fractured spleen, and a brain hemorrhage. As you might imagine, this has left me with much pain. As a young single mother of two, I have never felt comfortable taking the medications that my doctors offered. I cannot stand the brain fog and other side effects; I refuse to ingest anything toxic, or addictive; I won't keep dangerous products in my home. As a result of this decision, I didn't have a single pain free day for eleven years. \n\nSeveral months ago, I was introduced to kratom by a trusted friend. After doing some research I took half a teaspoon, and experienced the most wonderful thing: my first pain free day. I am able to be a much more productive and happy person. I can work longer and harder, I can play and enjoy life. Half a teaspoon, twice a day, and my quality of life is immeasurably better. \n\nI would also like to mention that on days I don't take it, I do not feel any form of withdrawal (unlike the caffeine headache I get when I skip coffee) or cravings of any kind. Kratom does not provide a \"high\" or euphoria, and the taste is very unappealing, so I feel comfortable keeping it in my home as it holds no appeal to my children or pets.\n\nIt is my most sincere wish that you consider the harm you would cause to mine and many other's quality of life, and reconsider scheduling kratom and it's alkaloids.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20472","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Emily Cook","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm very upset that the DEA is trying to ban kratom because kratom is the best thing that I have ever taken.

I didn't want to go to rehab so I started doing research on natural medicine that will ween my off of pills.The reason why I started taking pills in the first place is because I was suffering from frequent and severe migraines since childhood. I was also suffering from chronic depression since childhood along with insomnia.I started taking kratom in September of 2015 and I haven't looked back on painkillers,sleeping pills and anti depressants since. I also suffer from PCOS which causes high blood sugar among other symptoms.Since I've been taking kratom all of my physical and mental issues have gone away.I haven't been this happy or healthy since I was a very small child.I and fellow kratom users would be lost and devastated if kratom was to be banned.

Aside from extreme depression which I suffered my whole life, I was faced with a horrible prescription drug addiction, following my dad's surgery for a brain tumor when I was 13. My life was in a downhill spiral until the day I discovered kratom. \n\nBy the time I hit 17 years old, my addiction got to the point where I was taking opiate painkillers every hour. I didn't have a job, my depression was getting worse and I wasnt sure how to stop. Kratom was truly a lifesaver. I would have ended up dead if not for kratom. \n\nWithin one week of starting kratom I was able to completely stop the opiates. Completely. The kratom not only stopped withdrawals, but it also stopped my drug cravings completely. I went from a large amount of pills every hour, to one cup of kratom tea in the morning and that's it. It had no side effects at all, I have never hallucinated or gotten sick from Kratom. I had no withdrawal symptoms from Kratom either. It is no more addictive than coffee. I am now able to function completely, I immediately became employed after starting kratom, and I got my life back. \n\nWithout kratom, I would have ended up dead. I wouldn't be able to support my disabled parents. My life has truly made a complete 180 because of this truly amazing plant. \n\nAs an upstanding member of society, I feel it would be extremely asinine to ban it completely. I can only imagine the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people who have been saved by kratom. Everyday people like myself, just longing for a normal life. Kratom truly saved my life, and many many others. \n\nKratom does not destroy lives, it saves them. \n\nI do truly hope that you take everybodys' comments into consideration, and keep kratom legal for everybody. \n\nSincerely, \nJoseph Weisbrod \nSt. Louis, MO ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9887","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Weisbrod","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, my name is Mark Howson.

Throughout my life, my health has continued to deteriorate, leading to loss of employment, my home, my car, and the ability to sustain myself.  I've had numerous major surgeries, including emergency gastrectomy, total knee replacement, and emergency retinal detachment repair most recently, which lead to a macular hole and a cataract in my other eye.   I will be 44 in just a few days, and although the surgeries have had significant impact on my life, the anxiety and daily fear of losing what little I have is overwhelming.  Almost two years ago, a friend introduced me to kratom where I lived in Ohio.  I had nothing to lose, so I tried it. The difference it made in my quality of life was insurmountable.  With having no insurance and no way to obtain any medical treatment, I was left to struggle with the most simple daily tasks.  But when I take kratom, I'm able to function, focus, and relieve some of the tremendous pain that sometimes keeps me in bed for days.  When I moved to Tennessee for a family emergency, I had no clue that kratom was illegal, or that it was illegal anywhere at all.  I did my homework, I learned everything I possibly could about kratom.  Being without it is the difference between being able to be a productive citizen, and being homeless in horrific pain.  Please, take the time to do the research. See for yourself that it is of no danger to anyone!  It has saved countless lives, including mine, and the lives of thousands of people, whether they are battling addiction, orpain and anxiety, kratom provides everyone the ability to live their lives , be productive, and aavoid becoming just another statistic involving addiction to narcotics and opiates.   I have had two eye surgeries recently, and they may not be able to save my sight ,but with kratom I can at least continue to live my life without such horrific pain and debilitating anxiety Because it's already illegal in Tennessee, I have no choice but to uproot my life and move to a state where it is not banned, and I don't have to worry daily about becoming a convicted criminal for using an all natural alternative as opposed to narcotics and opiates. Please, don't take away what little quality of life I have regained thanks to kratom. Don't let greedy big pharma take away such a miraculous plant that can continue to save lives.

The War on Drugs (all drugs) has been a disaster--criminalizing matters of health and personal choice, ignoring scientific evidence, preventing research on both benefits and risks, filling prisons, militarizing police forces, breaking up families, and resulting in overdose deaths--while costing over $1 trillion in public monies.\n\nEuropean countries are leading the way to a more health-based approach to drug use. Since 1994, Switzerland has provided pharmaceutical grade heroin to its addict-citizens--resulting in no deaths, decreased crime and HIV and Hepatitis transmission, and reduced use by younger people. Only the U.S. insists that its citizens die of adulterated heroin obtained on the street.\n\nThe U.S. is slowly beginning to reexamine its policies. The recent electoral result--8 more States now legalizing marijuana for medicinal or recreational use--shows that public attitudes are shifting.\n\nThis is not the time to thoughtlessly ban yet another substance, especially one with some apparent benefits and no public safety downside. Instead of this reflexively emotional response, stop and think more broadly about why we criminalize substances, the negative collateral consequences, and how a regime of legalization, regulation and control would better serve the U.S.\n\nI urge you: DO NOT BAN KRATOM\n\nInge Fryklund, JD, PhD\nFormer Chicago Prosecutor\nBoard Member, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18036","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Inge Fryklund","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have taken kratom on various occasions with no issues for well over a year.

I am a student of information technology. I also only take it a few times per week and have never had any issues when taking a break from it. \n\nI believe the DEA \"emergency schedule\" proposal was a mistake. Although it was a cautious one, it was a mistake nevertheless. \n\nKratom ought to remain legal for adults to use as they see fit. I am strictly in any opposition to any law, proposal or scheduling which threatens to hinder the access to this herb or hinder the choice of a responsible adult to use an herb which has a proven safe track record over many years and a tradition of use in Indonesia, Thailand and many other places of Southeast Asia. \n\nThere are many common, dangerous things we have in our households which we encounter on a day to day basis, and these are absolutely a far bigger concern than some herb that helps a lot of people. Yet these statistically more dangerous things are common, like laundry pods or Tylenol. The point here is that kratom, which is overall much more safe and less commonplace should be regarded as safe for adults. Education and awareness have always helped more than fear and restriction.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22513","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please allow Kratom to be legal to allow more research to be done on it.

I began using Kratom during my Junior year in college and discovered this plant had a remarkable calming and uplifting effect on my emotional well-being. I have battled with depression and anxiety for years with no success until I began using this plant. Sadly, there is misinformation claiming this plant is a harmful drug. On the contrary, in an article by Botanical Legal Defense, Ryan Estevez, MD, PhD, MPH, says concerning Kratom:\n\nI am well versed in both good drugs that help people on a daily-basis, and bad drugs that are epidemically abused and create a tremendous burden on society. Kratom is [a natural herbal supplement] and not one of these 'bad' drugs (I have yet to admit anyone for kratom-addiction) and efforts to ban it are misguided and wasteful (Engle 2015).\n\n      This medical authority is just one of many who can tell the difference between a harmful synthetic drug, and a benign naturally occurring plant. So, I plead with you, the DEA, not to place Kratom on your Schedule 1 list. Doing so will halt the progress the clinical research community has made regarding this Southern Asian Indigenous plant. Subsequently, millions of Americans who use Kratom for therapeutic reasons will be construed as criminals. I believe no person who seeks out a cure from mother nature for their malady should be incarcerated and fined. This is simply injustice. Therefore, please reconsider scheduling Kratom until the clinical community has done extensive research on Kratom. It is science, not speculation, that should determine our polices.

I have Systemic Lupus, Fibromyalgia, Ascending Thoracic Aneurysm, Endometriosis, Severe Asthma and Allergies.  In order to just be around to see my children grown up, I take a myriad of pills and see multiple specialists to fight back to a body that hates me.  I live in constant pain, debilitating fatigue, fight to breathe, constant sickness and that all causes depression and anxiety.  I have no control over my body.  I have no control over the symptoms the 20 plus different medications I have to take every day just to stay alive,.  I've lost friends.  I mourn my old self, but most of all I mourn the fact that I miss out on parts of my children's lives due to my body giving out on me a different way, every single day.  \n\nI've been prescribed strong opiates to combat the pain.  But those only work for so long before I need more and more to even be able to get out of bed.  I've seen people fight addiction.  I do not want to be that person. The usage of those almost killed me with the way they affect my liver.  \n\nI was introduced to Kratom from a fellow Lupus sufferer as medical marijuana is not legal in my state.  Nor do I really want to take marijuana because of the way it makes me feel and I'm still not able to be the parent I need to be or really work.  \n\nFrom the first time I tried Kratom, I felt better than I had felt in years.  I have the energy to work full time and be a productive member of society.  I love being able to work.  It has improved my mood, depression, anxiety, lowered my blood pressure which is important so I won't have to have open heart surgery. It has given me the best rest I have had in years.  Without the ability to use Kratom, I believe my myriad of diseases will kill me within the next 5 years if not sooner.  \n\nI am happier, am able to practice football and softball with my children, I am a better employee, a better friend, daughter, sister, aunt, niece and co-worker.  Kratom has become my saving grace.  My will to live has returned.  My zest for life has returned.  I have been able to stop taking some of the medications that cause even worse side effects than what they are trying to 'help.'  I love that its natural.  I truly believe that if Kratom is banned, people will die, end up in jail for just trying to live a normal life and the people that have absolutely no control over their bodies will just give up.  \n\nI'm just a mom that wants to watch her children and someday grandchildren have wonderful lives.  Please don't take my son and daughter's rock away from them.  They need me, I need them and I need Kratom.  I have my life back and don't want to get back to that dark place I was when I was ready to give up.  \n\nPlease keep mine and everyone else's story about how Kratom has saved them when thinking of banning it.   All we want is a better quality of life with something natural, not synthetic.  As an American, we live in the land of the free and the brave.

To give you an idea of how bad it is, when I was in High School my doctor asked when I wanted to have surgery.  That was over 20 years ago.\n\nSome days are better than others.  But the pain is a constant.  When I was younger I would use 4 times the recommended dose of ibuprofen to get it under control.  As you can imagine, I had bouts of severe gastric distress.  \n\nAs time has progressed, so has the extent of my problem.  Bone on bone contact creates a pain that sometimes is like a throbbing fire, and sometimes like a bolt of lightning.  There are even days when my body refuses to put weight on that leg.\n\nAbout 3 years ago a co-worker introduced me to the wonderful plant kratom. I began supplementing with kratom and found that not only did I have more energy, but it also helped me to cope with hip pain.  It was so helpful that I found myself being able to do things that have always caused me trouble.  I can walk around farmers markets for as long as I want.  I can sit thru concerts.  I can enjoy spending time with friends and family without worrying about the pain distracting me.    \n\nSince my life started to improve, I have had friends and family who began to supplement their diet as well.  The changes have been profound!  I know of one person who gave up alcohol.  I know of another who was able to keep his highly physical job.  \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, kratom is a member of the coffee family.  It was been consumed for over 1000 years with no history of abuse or health complications.  I can tell you from my own experience that it does not cause respiratory depression.  \n\nI urge you to keep this beneficial plant available to the millions of Americans who consume it to improve their lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1471","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shane Lee","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After listening to Chris Bell speak about the positive uses of Kratom I believe banning the substance without more research would be more harm than good.

I have found it amazingly effective in treating otherwise disabling symptoms of PTSD. Prior to consuming Kratom, I was disabled and spent most of my time in bed. I received disability benefits from the state of Pennsylvania and was unable to work. I had faithfully gone to therapy and tried many psychotropic medications that did not help. I also received an experimental treatment by a doctor in Chicago named Eugene Lipov for the treatment of PTSD. I have gone to great lengths to recover my health and quality of life.

I urge the Government to do more thorough research on this plant before taking it away from millions of Americans who use this plant safely and responsibly for a number of health issues they are dealing with. I have been to too many funerals of young people who have gotten caught up in the terrible grip of addiction and overdosed on heroin. I have personally seen it destroy almost an entire family. I have suffered migraines for over 20 years and use kratom to help with the pain and discovered that it has helped my depression and anxiety to the point that I no longer need to take those medications that had given me unwanted side effects and can cause dependency problems.  My own family has a history of addiction and I know for certain that if kratom was not available, heroin and other opiates would be a temptation to them that they might not be able to resist. It has helped me tremendously in my life and I know that people will die if this is taken away from them. That is not drama or hyperbole. That is truth. I do believe that kratom should  be regulated and an age restriction for sale should be instated. There have been unscrupulous people looking to make profit at the cost of truly sick and hurting people who have tampered with kratom and don't care who they hurt. Those people should be stopped.  Please listen to the people. We are not strung out junkies looking for a legal high. We are hardworking Americans who get up and go to work every day and take care of our families and we are fighting so many problems coming at us every day. We request the right to make decisions about our lives and to take natural remedies that help us continue to be productive members of society. We have suffered and seen our loved ones suffer. Please do not restrict our choices but help us by making sure this plant is safe and available for people who have found wonderful benefits from it. Please listen to us.

I have been using Kratom since January of 2014 to help elevate my mood and promote a general sense of well-being, which is a great help to me as a sufferer of major depressive disorder and anxiety. I was diagnosed with depression while I was in high school, and began suffering crippling anxiety during my first year of college. A few years later I discovered a supplement called Kratom that purportedly promoted relaxation and a general sense of well-being, with minimal to no side-effects. Since then I have used it hundreds of times, and never once have I felt impaired or \"high\", and it has never caused any serious side-effects outside of a little dehydration and occasional constipation. But as a cheap, legal way to help put me in a more positive mood as well as aid focus while working, it was well worth these minor inconveniences.\n\nScheduling kratom is not only unnecessary and unwarranted, it would prevent valuable study into the inner workings of this remarkable plant, not to mention the significant number of reports from people who have shown it to be a vital factor in their recovery from heroin addiction. In short, please consider keeping kratom unscheduled.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17328","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jordan Williamson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I used to be a heroin addict 15 yrs and am in constant pain, I would not be able to sustain a job or stay clean off narcotic pain medication without kratom, it has put me back in the work force and enabled me to enjoy life once again!

It has clear medical potential as a painkiller, and it is certainly not more abusable or habit-forming than either hydrocodone or oxycontin, both of which are undeniably more dangerous.\n\nReturning to the point on its medical use: studies have indicated that 7-Hydroxymitragynine may possess an incredible pain suppression to side effect ratio, with some indications that it may be as much as 15x more effective than morphine, while simultaneously being less euphoric and less likely to trigger withdrawal symptoms. Very importantly, 7-Hydroxymitragynine causes little to no constipation, which makes it incredibly useful as a tool for treating cancer related pain, as traditional opiate pain killers only exacerbate the constipation issues caused by radiation therapy and chemotherapy. \n\nThe following study has a great rundown of the medical value of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine.\n\nhttps://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/americankratomassociation/pages/21/attachments/original/1443496612/Pharmacological_Studies.pdf?1443496612","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23189","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lukas Hostetler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I specifically use kratom to help ween off oxycodone.

After that I started searching for all natural plants and herbs for my pain, kratom kept popping up I then searched where to get it and how or if I even could, i found out a local tobacco company had it so I tried it and after finding the dosage that worked for me I started taking it regularly, I have used it now for 4 years daily, I completely quit drinking alcohol, I don't even desire it anymore.  There are some side effects, I lost weight mostly all body fat, and I believe it is triggering arthritis in my aging body but that could just be my age and career, I have shared my success story with it to friends and family and of course the best thing about it is that it's legal, something natural that works that I don't have to feel like a criminal to access.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20270","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Travis Kearl","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern; \n\nDuring my early years of adulthood I was living with a good friend from high school who I saw become addicted to Vicodin, and then Oxycontin.

I have Chronic back pain due to arthritis, Degenerative Disk Disease and bulging disks. You can name a procedure, medicine, doctor, specialist, therapy, it doesn't matter, I've tried them all. Kratom is the only thing that has ever worked...it allows me to do my job as a Software Engineer without any pain. It's a miracle herb. Without it I may have to try for disability.\n\nKratom is basically a simple plant that is commonly ingested as a tea. This plant has been utilized in Thailand for hundreds of years. The pharmaceutical companies were starting to lose money from opioid medications, so they lobbied to have it scheduled as an illegal drug even though it certainly is not. The same exact thing is now occurring in the U.S., but we can stop it. The pharmaceutical companies are in it for the money, but the people are in it to save lives.\n\nConsider the fact that a small number of people have died from Kratom, but all of those were due to them mixing the herb with drugs such as an opioid pain medication. Kratom is non-addicive and actually helps addicts get off of drugs such as heroin. It does this by plugging into the same receptors as the opiate does. After the addict has used the herb for around 90 days, the addict can then stop using Kratom entirely without consequence, such as withdrawals. In fact, the withdrawal period essentially never occurs when the addict quits taking drugs. \n\nFor people like me that are not addicts, Kratom literally works like the pain medication, but with no addictive component. If I were to be prescribed to a pain medicine I would certainly become addicted to the medication over time. This would force me to continue use of that drug and incur it's side effects.\n\nKratom saves lives. The addict can quit, the person with chronic pain cam work and enjoy their lives, and even people with depression, or anxiety can go on with their lives without any medical symptoms. If we remove Kratom, the addict will search the streets, or overdose, the pain will be unbearable again for those with chronic pain so they can't work thus increasing the number of people on disability, or commuting suicide, and finally those with depression, or anxiety will possibly commit suicide, or just can't work. Healthcare costs would soar. The government will pay more for removing Kratom then they would keeping it legal. Actually they would benefit from the tax money in the end!\n\nKeep Kratom legal and affordable. Please don't allow the government to make this natural plant illegal. Kratom will do the same as CBD oil has done sav IMG the lives of many children and others with Epilepsy. It's changed my life forever and I hope and pray we keep it that way. Please keep Kratom legal, it's our only hope. Don't let the DEA overstep it's bounds for the pharmaceutical lobbiests. Its not right. It's not fair. Look at how many Congressmen, Senators and everyday people...even scientists that have found Kratom to be harmless and extremely useful. Think of the research that can go on if we keep it legal. One day those pharmaceutical companies may even be able to produce a new pain killer from this that is non-addicive. This herb could literally change the world for the good.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1428","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jacob Lockmiller","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not stifle research into Kratom by Scheduling this plant.

I am a 45-year old professional in the finance industry and single mother. I started using kratom about five years ago, and use it regularly for minor pains and illnesses ranging from relieving headaches and menstrual symptoms to managing cough symptoms from a cold and even easing anxiety. It relieves symptoms from sports injuries much better than vicodin and without the awful side effects of opiates. I have never suffered any negative side effects from kratom nor experienced addiction or withdrawal symptoms. It is by far gentler and more natural than ibuprofen, Tylenol, over-the-counter cough syrups and other pharmaceutical remedies that often take their toll on the stomach, liver, and other organs. It has been a lifesaver for me, and I much prefer it to chemical treatments. It has been used for centuries in Malaysia, and I believe it to be completely safe when used with common sense. The effects are about as powerful as a couple of cups of coffee. To schedule this seems absolutely insane, and suggests a partnership with the pharmaceutical industry. Looking at the substances that are available to people that really do pose health risks - everything from household cleaner to sleeping pills - and watching the DEA try to remove people's ability to make tea from a plant in what is supposedly a \"free\" country is abominable. Please use your own common sense and reason, and allow people to make their own health choices.

Kratom alleviated my spinal and joint pain and helped to diminish my anxiety, it also helped me to get my blood pressure regulated within normal limits.  I am also aware of many others that have benefitted from its use, as well from listening and reading their spoken and written testimonials. I have two sons that are veterans of the war in Afghanistan, one who is disabled from PTSD, Depression, Anxiety and Degenerative Disc Disease.  He was having to use large amounts of narcotic medications prescribed by the VA doctors, to regain control of himself upon re-entry to society, and through the use of Kratom he was able to stop using all of these medications completely! He has also since stopped using Kratom altogether without any adverse side effects OR withdrawal symptoms. I have yet to see or hear of one single person exhibit or claim any adverse or negative effects from its responsible use, including the \"intoxication\" claim that is being circulated.  It is my opinion that the Kratom plant or any of it's alkaloids, simply does NOT make a person intoxicated and it does NOT cause addiction, which I am basing on my personal previous use and observations of others use.

Shortly before I started taking kratom, I had just been released from a three year sentence in prison. I was finding it difficult to cope with being out of prison and was acting out on my anxieties and fears by drinking heavily. I was making bad decisions due to my struggling to re-establish myself outside of prison and was going to quickly find myself back in there if I didn't find a better way to deal with my inability to re-adjust.\n  My first time taking kratom was upon the suggestion of a friend who told me that he had found a good alternative to drinking and offered me some that he had purchased at a local kava and tea bar. I noticed some mild mood elevating effects, but was pleased that it was nothing that was overwhelming or that impaired my ability to function. I later purchased my own kratom and slowed my drinking to a halt in only a couple of weeks. My mood toward work began to improve and I was able to cope with the same social scenarios that usually led me to drink without the trouble of being impaired or belligerent. It has such a low potential for abuse due to its tendency to make a person sick if they take any more than 10 grams and the people who I buy it from are a source I have come to know and trust. \n  Kratom has quelled my desire to self destruct by means of drinking and drug use and has helped immensely to improve the quality of my life. I have since been released successfully from my parole and have been working a highly reputable for over a year. I am Wesley, and I strongly endorse kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3428","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Wesley Taylor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm 42 years old, married with no children. I am active in my church and community. I have a 13-year daily practice of yoga and meditation. I am a multilingual editor and translator by day and harpist in hospice in the evenings. As you can imagine, both of those professions require a lot of mental and physical acuity - and working in palliative care also requires a tremendous amount of presence of spirit.\n\nI have had tremendous boosts to my health and well-being since occasionally enjoying kratom for the past decade or so.  \nI live with a number of autoimmune conditions for which medicine simply has no solutions. Kratom supports my health and energy and helps me to be the productive member of society that I am.\n\nKratom is not mind-altering. If it were, I wouldn't be able to ever use it. I need - and want - to be alert and present. It lifts the mood slightly, like coffee but without the jitters. In fact, it a relative of the coffee plant.  It could hardly be described as a drug - the effects are much closer to caffeine and nowhere near even as strong the legal herb kava kava. They do not come anywhere close to anything else in the Schedule 1 Category. This plant with hundreds of years of safe use in its native culture does not produce a \"high\" or euphoria; anyone looking to kratom for a high will be sorely disappointed. The fact that head shops market it deceptively is not a reason to deprive responsible and productive adults of its benefits.\n\nKratom is not an opioid - it is THOUGHT to act on opioid receptors - just like chocolate, cheese and exercise.\n\nIt's also not addictive, and as a former cigarette smoker who battled the addiction for a good seven years before I was finally able to quit all tobacco forever, I have personal knowledge and experience of what is and is not mentally and physically addictive.\n\nThe 15 deaths resulting from kratom use that the DEA cites ALL involve other substances; out of the TOTAL 50 deaths worldwide EVER involving kratom, NO deaths can be attributed to kratom alone, they all involve alcohol or drugs in combination. To put that into context, around 25,000 people died of prescription drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, the highest number ever recorded. Please see drugabuse.gov to see that statistic for yourself.\n\nOn the same site, you'll see, if you search for tobacco, that \"Between 1964 and 2004, more than 12 million Americans died prematurely from smoking, and another 25 million U.S. smokers alive today will most likely die of a smoking-related illness.\"\nOn the same site, you'll see, if you search for kratom, that Kratom by itself is not associated with fatal overdose.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason this supplement should be scheduled by the DEA. I am a law-abiding citizen who contributes to society and I can't imagine a peaceful person like me being put in jail for the occasional enjoyment of a tea leaf.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3097","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We need to research and test substances honestly for the betterment of humanity.

I am a 54 year old successful business woman (small business with a full time employee).  wife and mother of 2 teenage kids.  I have been taking Kratom for 5 years, and it has been instrumental in keeping me going through a crippling depression.  \n\nAfter being sidelined with depression and anxiety around 5 years ago,  My doctor began prescribing me a series of antidepressants.  I could not tolerate the way these drugs made me feel.  it turned me into a zombie, and i could not do my job properly.  I began researching online, looking for a natural alternative to help me through this difficult time... I needed to keep going with my work for the sake of my family.  \n\nI began taking moderate doses of Kratom daily and it has transformed me from a sad and non-productive person to a high functioning member of society.  This herb has helped me and so many people.  Through online forums I have heard hundreds of stories of Kratom helping people much worse off than me get their lives back together.  There are a huge amount of people that have used this to get off of opioids, including heroin. It has amazing benefits for people sidelined by painful conditions, too.  \n\nScheduling this herb is completely counterproductive to the war in drugs.  If you truly want to help people, you will let this plant remain legal. The only reason I can see that anyone would want this plant banned is because the pharmaceutical industry is pushing  the ban for its own agenda.  There is absolutely no downside to  letting people detox off of Heroin and pharmaceutical drugs with this herb.  There is no way to OD on Kratom, these people must have also taken other drugs.  Please keep it legal, and let real research be done.  I am convinced that Kratom cam help so may people and in its natural form, is way better than anything that can be produced from it by a drug company.  \n\n I would be happy to talk with you or anyone about my 5 years using this herb and how much it has helped me.  I am extremely healthy, get checked every year and have had no problems at all.. no blood pressure issues, no cholesterol no diabetes, no liver issues.    I believe this herb is about as harmful as a cup of coffee, but its benefits are huge.  \n\nThanks, \n\nDiane Pollock","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8238","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Diane Pollock","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a great herbal supplement.

I am a 31-year-old software engineer from Columbus, Ohio and I have been using kratom as needed for 3 years to manage a variety of symptoms, as kratom offers a number of diverse benefits.  Chiefly it helps me manage my depression: I have clinical depression and sometimes find it difficult to deal with life's hurdles without the help of kratom.  I have been on antidepressants and find that when I feel particularly hopeless, they are not helpful.  Kratom, on the other hand, provides enough of a nudge that I can begin to think rationally again and move past whatever is burdening me.  It's been a life saver -- literally.  I really cannot express to you how difficult it would be at times to keep going if I didn't have kratom to take the edge off and get me out the of the slump - what it does is make things seem just a little bit brighter so that thought-altering techniques like meditation and CBT can work.\n\nI also use other strains in different circumstances.  The maeng da strain energizes me like caffeine does, but without any jitters and it doesn't last quite as long.  This makes it particularly great when I need energy late at night but still want to get to sleep at a reasonable time.  It's also good at work when I need to get through a rough morning because there is no crash afterward.  And most strains I have tried have been effective analgesics.  The week before I had my gall bladder removed, I had terrible pain from the gall stones and found it difficult to be productive at work.  Tylenol didn't help and NSAIDs were not allowed because they are blood thinners (bad idea before surgery).  I took kratom and it elimintated the pain and allowed me to focus on my work and get through the week.  Without it I would have spent a miserable week doubled over in pain at home.\n\nMy experience with kratom has been nothing but positive and placing it as a banned substance will take away a significant asset from people suffering from chronic pain, chronic depression, chronic anxiety, and similar disorders.  I hope you will think about my story as you consider the ban, and question whether a substance that has been so much of a boon is really worthy of placement as a schedule I substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6003","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kelli Searfos","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"3 years ago I began using kratom for an unfixable chronic pain condition I was diagnosed with in 2011,  after the birth or my second child.

I have safely consumed kratom for some time, and it has helped me to manage chronic pain resulting from a back injury without resorting to addictive pharmaceuticals.  For the foregoing reasons, I would request that you NOT schedule kratom as a controlled substance, either on an emergency basis or otherwise.  \n\nFirst of all, there is a complete absence of any evidence whatsoever that kratom poses a danger to the public.  In support of the fact that no public health emergency exists as a result of the consumption of kratom, I would point to a recent survey of medical professionals finding that there have been no widespread concerns about the use of kratom within the medical community.  That results of that survey may be found at: http://216.30.191.148/112957_AKA_ER_Trauma_Professionals_Online_Survey_Report.pdf.  Secondly, and with regards to the DEA's contention that kratom is an opioid equivalent to heroin or other opium derivatives, I would point you towards the recent publication of an article in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, entitled \"Update on the Pharmacology and Legal Status of Kratom,\" explaining in some detail why kratom should not be considered an opioid, and further should not be considered a threat to public health.  Rather, the DEA should consider kratom an essential tool in the fight against the opioid crisis.  There can be no doubt that the opioid crisis must be addressed, and kratom provides a relatively low risk tool to fight addiction-- and one that appears far less dangerous and habit forming than traditional forms of replacement therapy such as methadone and suboxone.  It would foolish in the extreme to ban the use of such a helpful plant-based alternative at a time like this. Finally, I would urge you to take a careful look at the 8 factor analysis submitted to the DEA by Pinney Associates on November 30, 2016, concluding that there is no basis to schedule kratom at any level, and no reason to believe that kratom poses any danger to the public.  \n\nI would also ask you to disregard the biased and self-serving comments made by Dr. Daniel Fabricant on behalf of the \"Natural Products Association,\" claiming that kratom is supposedly more dangerous than the supplements touted by the industry he works on behalf of.  Not only is that claim unsupported-- as the above referenced materials demonstrate-- but the very supplements he so passionately defends have in fact been responsible for an estimated 23,000 emergency room visits, according to a July 2016 study by Consumer Reports, which may be accessed at http://abcnews.go.com/Health/consumer-reports-highlights-dietary-supplement-dangers/story?id=40919592.  The minimal number of any reported instances of adverse reactions to kratom of course pale in comparison to such a number, as you are no doubt aware. I urge you to disregard his baseless and plainly self-serving commentary, and to carefully consider the comments and materials submitted to you by thousands of American consumers whose lives have been improved by the use of this plant.  The productive, healthy lives we are leading are the best evidence you could have of the safety and efficacy of this plant.  Thank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19861","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Chronic intractable pain is a heavy chain, and having to rely on deadly, addictive opioids is a steel cage.

As a dietary supplement, Kratom is safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally; placing it on the same level as heroin would be a travesty to myself and millions of others who are in the death grip of opiate addiction. To date, research has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\nI was once prescribed 240 (TWO HUNDRED FORTY) oxycodone per month by Kaiser Permanente.  Their plan was to keep me on this medication and increasingly stronger medications (with combinations of other weaker opiates) until I turned 65 years old when they would do a full knee replacement surgery.  Needless to say, taking massive amounts of dangerous and highly addictive pain medication was a horrible action plan and I let them know that it was a horrible plan.\n\nBecause of kratom, I was able to ween off of the oxycodone.  I no longer take oxy at all anymore and I only use kratom in combination with physical therapy to help with my knee pain.\n\nThe oxycodone was causing quite a few side effects, including lethargy, severe constipation, decreased sexual function and I was hopelessly addicted as well.\n\nThe kratom also has helped me with my social anxiety, for which I don't have to be on any prescription medication due to kratom.\n\nI truly believe scheduling kratom is an irresponsible and hasty move.  There are no known incidents of harm/overdose from taking *just* kratom by itself (any evidence of death or overdose has always been in combination with multiple other substances that all interacted dangerously--and fatally--with each other).  The human body will tell itself if too much kratom has been ingested because the person will get nauseous and possibly throw up (I personally have never thrown up from it but have gotten nauseous a couple of times while I adjusted my dosage to figure out exactly what was right for me, but it was a minuscule price to pay for the incredible relief kratom offers me daily). \n\nKratom is a very safe dietary supplement alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life.  I fear this scheduling action will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic, maybe even my own. I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without kratom and I do not know how I will continue to work in my new career of diagnostic ultrasound without either taking kratom or taking absurd amounts of dangerous prescription pain medication.\n\nPlease reconsider and view all appropriate scientific data.  Kratom has been used safely in southeast Asia for hundreds, probably thousands of years and at least several decades in the US.\n\nSincerely,\nAndrew Xavier Rinne-Mignotte","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1443","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Rinne Mignotte","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.

This problem does need to be addressed.  However, scheduling Kratom as a schedule 1 drug is a bit overboard.  While I do not agree with making Kratom a scheduled drug due to the relatively safe nature of Kratom when taken in recommended dosages, a more appropriate scheduling of Kratom would be a category 4 as it seems to mimic a very weak form of a benzodiazepine especially given the fact that the primary use of Kratom is for anxiety and sleep.\n\nWhile drug abuse does present a significant problem for this country simply making all drugs illegal just will not address the problem to any significant degree.  In order to address this problem we need to address the root causes for drug abuse.  This would be much better addressed through increased education and awareness of drugs and drug abuse in our schools.  Communities could also join together to address issues such as this through open and honest discussion and programs designed to address this drug epidemic.  Simply attempting to make all drugs of abuse illegal will only increase the number of people in our jails and prisons.  Please start using common sense measures rather than Orwellian measures to solve America's problems.

From my experience, kratom is very difficult to abuse and overdosing is quite impossible.

I do not drink, or smoke. I work out 5+ days a week and am in the best shape of my life. I am a very productive member of society and of the community that I live in.\n\nI am vehemently opposed to the scheduling of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine and in turn the plant Mitragyna speciosa (Kratom) as a schedule I drug. If Kratom is going to be scheduled then Caffeine and all Caffeine related products need to be scheduled as well. They have very similar effects and come from the same family of plants.\n\nMy life has not always been at the high point it is at now. I have suffered numerous amounts of injuries throughout my life. Broken leg when I was 10, broken hip at 12, twice broken wrist in my teens, 3rd degree shoulder separation followed by 2 repair surgeries in my twenties and a back broken in three places from a 2 story fall in my early thirties to name a few. On top of all of the injuries my family has a history of anxiety which I started to develop in my thirties.\n\nTo help me cope with my numerous problems I have tried every suggestion and pill my doctor has offered. Most of these solutions were temporary at best and in the end they left me addicted to numerous doctor prescribed pills and in no better shape then when I started.\n\nAbout 7 years ago I had had enough. I quite everything I was being prescribed and began to turn my life around. I read about Kratom and how it can help with anxiety and pain. I did some extensive research about the pros and cons of Kratom and decided to try it. \n7 years later I believe my daily use of Kratom coupled with an extensive exercise/weight lifting routine has enabled me to bring my life back to normal. I still have pain and anxiety but Kratom helps enough that I can keep moving forward. I am not chained to a medication or at the will of a doctor. I am my own free person willing and able to make decisions on my own.\n\nI am a good father, a good husband, and a healthy, contributing member of society and Kratom has helped me get to this point of my life. Please do not take this away from myself and my family. Regulate it if you must, make it available to those over 21 years of age or older only, but do not take it away.

I purchased it from a health food store, and found that it not only helped with that pain, but with the pain of my fibromyalgia and genetic connective tissue disorder. Unlike narcotic pain medication, Kratom was not something that altered my mental state in any way. It didn't make me itch, it didn't make me sleepy or feel disconnected from the world, it didn't have the negative side effects that I get from things like Percocet and Vicodin. I've used it on and off since 2012 for pain relief when Tylenol does not do the trick (I cannot take anti-inflammatories due to being on anti-coagulants) and prefer it that way. It's something that, on bad pain days, makes life tolerable. I find it unconscionable that it would be placed on schedule one when there has been no research into Kratom's effects, its efficacy as a medication for pain, and it's safety. It's something that has been used for thousands of years on the other side of the world, and I was happy to be able to have access to it in this day and age as an alternative pain therapy. Banning it seems incredibly short-sighted, especially when we're in the middle of an opiod addiction epidemic in this country. Instead of going after Kratom, put some research into it instead. Don't hurt the people who are using it.\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5416","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"M Czech","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Everyone should have access to Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16626","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Karen Wolf","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 33yrs old.

I have been addicted to pain medication for years.  I have been trying to quit for awhile, but the withdrawals are always so horrible I end up giving in and taking them again.  That was until I discovered Kratom.  When people were claiming how much it helped with opioid withdrawals, I thought it sounded too good to be true.  After I tried it I couldn't believe that I could almost function normally without my pain medicine!  The best thing was that I didn't feel like I was replacing one addicting substance for another.  It felt like I drank a cup of coffee that helped with my pain, anxiety, and depression.  It was amazing!  Once I came off the pain medication I realized that not only was it helping me withdrawal from pain medication, but it helped with the horrible anxiety that I have had my whole life and am on more dangerous medication for.  It gives me energy and kills my pain so I can get up and be even more productive than I was on the pain medication.  Taking this plant from us will have devastating consequences..  Those that are battling pain and dangerous addiction will have no choice but to go back to opioid medication.  Please do not take this choice of how we feel is best to treat our pain and anxiety from us.

Kratom helps me in several ways and I can't say enough positive about it. I suffer from severe migraines due to the stress level of my school and I have tried several methods to get rid of them to no avail, but a very small dose of kratom completely relieves my symptoms. I also suffer from pretty bad anxiety and kratom is a safe and east way to relieve the stress when it gets to severe. I also utilize it to ease muscle soreness after a long day at the gym and I recommend it to any one who works out regularly. On a side note I have given some to a few friends of mine suffering from severe opiate addictions and all of them have told me this was a perfect way to get off of them without suffering from withdrawal symptoms. With all these points in my I urge you to please reconsider and make sure we can continue to use this great product.

I have chronic hip and knee pain. I began using kratom 6 months ago, here and there , instead of using the enormous amount of ibuprofen I take for bad pain days. I love natural herbs , vitamins and minerals. I suppose I could go to another doctor and have the same results , which is next to nothing. I do not want to take ibuprofen every day, nor do I wish to use narcotics. Kratom helps with my pain and makes it possible to go to work, play with my grandson and sleep at night. The effects are subtle. There is no high involved or I would not take it. I can see that research is important, I can also understand an age requirement. What I cannot understand is taking another of gods given plants away when it benefits so many. We need to be able to have a say in holistic approaches to our health care. I can honestly say that going to see another doctor and being told there is nothing they can do, is not an option for me anymore. I have to work, I need to take care of my family and have some quality of life. Please rethink your stance on natural options. Research, age requirements, are good options over an all out ban. As Americans we should be allowed to choose holistic over pharmaceuticals . We should have that option as adults.

I study social epidemiology, such as domestic terrorism, moral panics, and the spread of drug abuse.\n\nI was born with a hereditary genetic condition called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a collagen production disorder. This means that I have highly unstable joints and suffer daily or weekly dislocations of my shoulders, knees, elbows, wrists, fingers, ankles, etc., as well as gastric issues and spinal collapse from poorly-made spinal discs, the latter of which causes neurological problems. This is a degenerative chronic pain condition with a clear etiology and no cure. I will probably eventually become a full-time wheelchair user. \n\nBefore my pain was controlled, I was bedridden. My muscles were atrophying because I was unable to tolerate the physical therapy necessary to stabilizing my joints. If I attempted to tolerate that pain for too long, I would have wound up with demylinated nerves like others with my condition who suffer unmanaged pain-- that is, it would physically worsen my condition to have uncontrolled pain. When I started taking kratom, I was able to function much closer to normal levels, and I never had to increase my dose despite using it for two years. \n\nSince the possibility of a ban was announced, my doctor has switched me over to synthetic opioids. Right now I am only taking Tramadol twice daily, but I know that I will wind up going through more and more powerful drugs due to tolerance. People with EDS typically wind up with a fentanyl patches plus powerful short-acting opioids such as oxycodone. I have seen the effects of opioid habituation first-hand and it is a miracle to me that there is an opioid that does not incur such drastic habituation (nor have I had any addiction problems). I don't want to be on drugs stronger than heroin, costing the state who knows how much money to go to a pain clinic and get these powerful and expensive pharmaceuticals. The dose of kratom I currently take costs about $0.25, and again, I have never had to increase my dose.\n \nThere have been a couple of times in the beginning when I experimented with trying a higher dose-- and I just threw up and was unharmed. In fact, kratom alone has never caused a single documented overdose, nor has anyone died from kratom withdrawal. In the absence of a risk profile comparable to that of powerful synthetic opioids, it diminishes my belief that the DEA is acting in good faith by banning this drug. I saw on the (old) ban notice that one of the reasons for banning it was that people are self-managing chronic pain-- that's a good thing! Why on earth would you want us to cost the government money and become addiction risks, if you are looking out for our best interests? Is is an importation issue with Thailand? If so, please just be honest about what's going on and I'm sure there's some way around it; maybe it could be produced in the States. The whole country is wondering what your real intentions are in banning kratom at a time when medical costs are such a pressing and saddening problem. And what of addicts looking to come off of heroin? Must they be addicted to methadone for life? Is this somehow related to medical profits? I don't know what to think. It scares me. The people are losing our trust in you. Please, make a good decision with this drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5045","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephanie Zarrindast","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear whom it may concern, \n    I dont have very much to say other than I have untreatable depression.

This leads to running low, suffering until my next refill, trying to live with this pain until I get that refill.  Kratom has literally been a miracle for me.  I have no side effects with the Kratom, I don't have cravings, I don't abuse Kratom, it simply provides me with the relieve I need from both pain as well as anxiety/depression.  Please do not classify Kratom as a Schedule 1 drug.  I hope to see this supplement used to help the epidemic proportions of opiate abusers.

I'm 34. I first tried Kratom in July of this year. I've been having a lot of memory problems and trouble focusing and I'd read that it helps you focus. I didn't want to have to drop out of my school program so it was a last-ditch effort to improve my study habits. I do not do drugs. I tried pot once 15 years ago when I was physically backed into a corner and bullied into agreeing, but other than that I am and have always been completely drug free (aside from birth control and prozac). I am not someone who would do drugs for recreation or addiction. When I tried kratom, it didn't help me focus on my school work like I was hoping, but it had an even better effect. It took away my social anxiety. In fact, I found that I had less social anxiety for 2 days after using it. I've never known anyone as quiet or uncomfortable in social situations as myself so this was a major benefit. When I first have some kratom I feel a bit like I'm drunk, and even after that fades I still am more talkative. It's very noticeable. Even to my husband I usually don't say much, but after having some kratom I find all kinds of things to say. Since it still affects me after the drunken feeling subsides, I feel that it's teaching me to be less concerned and anxious about talking in general, and I have hope that if I continue to take kratom as a supplement now and then, I will eventually be a somewhat normal person even without having any. I only have some once a week or so, because I want to let it teach me rather than just relying on it as a crutch. But so far it's been nothing but helpful for me. I have also met many people online since this ban was announced, from all walks of life. Many of them are recovered from past drug addictions, and many of them have chronic pain. They've all been very friendly and inviting and not people that I'd think of as having any sort of a \"drug problem\" as kratom is being made out to be. I don't have any long-term data for you since I personally only started learning about kratom in July, but so far all I've experienced and seen and read has been very positive. In fact, the only negative I've experienced from it is my eyes and throat feel pretty dry a while after having some. Well, that and it tastes unpleasant.

This is an obvious problem because when information is restricted, it becomes very difficult to make responsible, informed decisions as individuals and as a country. It is also obvious and widely known that prohibition is incredibly problematic. We've seen this with alcohol and with the failure of the \"war on drugs\".  Criminalizing substances like Kratom almost immediately results in a black market emerging around them. I don't need to go into details about the problems these black markets create. Turning people who use Kratom responsibly for pain management or recreation into criminals overnight is a disservice to the public. More research needs to be done on the plant before it gets swept under the rug for decades only to resurface like marijuana has. It is possible this plant can help people. It is possible it can help the country deal with the raging opiate/prescription pankiller problem that in fact claims thousands of lives and harms many more.\nBut we won't know if we can't study it properly.

Especially, Methadone. For heavier users, maybe first weaning onto Subs then wean off of subs to Kratom is a better alternative. I can personally attest that the withdraw from Kratom is akin to withdrawing for room caffeine or just slighly worse. In comparison, even with a long taper, withdraw from Suboxone can last month's and is much more severe than Kratom's effects. In addition, Kratom withdrawal poses no physical danger and only lasts approximately 3 days.\n\nI have been through inpatient, meetings, intensive outpatient, and Suboxone therapy. None of the previously mentioned methods worked for me, except food or transferring from intravenous heroin to Subs, kratom, and then sobriety. Additionally, several family members have supplanted their highly dangerous opiates for chronic pain for kratom are are reaping the benefits.\n\nIt may not work for all, but the more safe options the better since it is near impossible to overdose on Kratom. It would be a logical fallacy to schedule Kratom at Schedule one since it poses proven medical use with minimal abuse potential. Now, that isn't to say that it should not be regulated for safety so people know what they're imbibing. The current research already suggests that this will be the next generation of safer, but effective pain meds.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17964","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Colin Rumsey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"A 2013 NIH paper, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670991/, states that no adverse effects have been associated with Kratom.

I haven't experienced negative effects whenever I haven't taken it and I don't have any drug seeking behaviors from it. For example, if I can't afford it one week, I don't buy it. I do not go into debt trying to buy kratom and cannot see any logical reason why this plant would be banned. Why would you ban something that is helping to fight the opiate epidemic? If you truly cared about helping society, you certainly wouldn't ban another harmless plant that seems to help so many people, mostly who are middle aged or Seniors. If you're so concerned about addiction, why is alcohol and nicotine still legal? They have been proven to harm people, but they are still legal.

For much of my life, I have struggled with excessive anxiety and mild depression. It was something that I coped with, but I rarely had relief from it. As a result, I struggled to sleep more than two-three hours a night. Doctors prescribed Ambien, which helped me get to sleep, but I would wake around 2 every morning. In an attempt to address to underlying cause of my insomnia, my doctor prescribed Celexa about three years ago. I received some mild relief from Celexa, but my doctors have had to continue to increase my daily amount to receive the same results. After the last increase, I began too notice some side effects. Mainly extreme night sweats which has greatly decreased my amount and quality of sleep. \n    I discovered kratom a few months ago, and I began taking a small dose 2-3 days a week (after extremely stressful days). The small doses in the afternoon have allowed me to properly unwind and relax. I have been able to lower my Celexa to the previous amount, and my night sweats have disappeared as a result. I am receiving a better, more restful night of sleep, and my performance as an educator has improved as well. \n   I urge you to reconsider the scheduling of kratom. Although my story pales in comparison to the countless stories of chronic and debilitating pains managed by this plant or the recovering addicts using it to regain normalcy in their lives, the few hours of calmness in my afternoon accompanied by a restful sleep is invaluable to me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5578","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gregory Benson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern:\n\n I will keep this brief as there are many comments to read through so I won't bog down the process.

I've been through a plethora of different medications that all had side effects but no actual improvement. I have also been dealing with back pain both stress and physically induced for quite some time of which no medication or treatment would help. Upon adding Kratom into my health regimen, every one of these problems has improved dramatically. While prescription medications have their place, there are bodies that respond better to more natural remedies such as mine which is why I believe Kratom should be legal and available to those who can utilize it. It's never become any kind of burden on my life such as becoming an addiction which everyone on the opposition is warning us about. Everything has its risks, but Kratom by far has the lowest of any substance I've ever seen as any too-high dose just results in vomiting it back up and being dizzy for an hour. Please let this useful plant stay available to the public so those who need and can benefit from it can utilize it.

Kratom is just that for some people.  Due to the increased opioid use in this country people who were once prescribed opioid pain medication are now stuck between a rock and a hard place.  It is all too common for someone post surgery to get a few prescriptions of oxy, Vicodin or any other opioid pain medication just to help them get through the pain of a very traumatic surgery.  Then After a few months of using a drug that was prescribed by a doctor, someone that the patient put all of their trust into, is now unable to stop use due to the terrible withdrawal effects that happen when you stop receiving these opioids.  Now they must continue to do these drugs not due to the pain of the surgery but from the pain of withdrawal.  Someone who was once a very productive professional person is now at the mercy of a tiny little pill.  If they can not get this pill they will be unable to function and will be unable to feed their family.  Along comes a 100% natural substance, a plant that grows in nature, put here by a higher power for this very reason and you are trying to ban it.  Kratom will be the leg for these people to stand on to help them break the vicious cycle of addiction.  Please give these people hope.  Please allow research on this wonderful plant and  please do not add this plant to a list of banned substances of the highest level.

And, just like marijuana, Kratom has many medicinal benefits that scheduling would deny to those who benefit from its use. Its prohibition would only drive thousands more to opiate use.  It would also block further medical research - as has been the case with marijuana.\n\nHistory tells us that when the idea of outlawing marijuana was originally posed to Congress very few sitting members of either House had even heard of the plant.  A poll of those who sat in Congress prior to the DEA announcement on scheduling kratom would be the same.  When this issue first arose I polled my entire neighborhood - not one person had ever heard of the plant.  \n\nThere is no evidence to support prohibition of this plant.  Putting it on the Controlled Substances Schedule will serve no useful purpose other than the continued survival of a massive - and harmful - out-of-control government bureaucracy. \n\nWhen the prohibition of alcohol ended it was this same bureaucracy (under another name) that found a plant to support its continued existence - marijuana.  Now that the public is educated and the prohibition of marijuana is nearing its end another plant is being proposed for Schedule One to insure the survival of the DEA rather than the health and welfare of the People of our great nation.\n\nIt is time for us to reexamine drug policy. Rather than add to the failed policies we have in place by prohibiting kratom we need to envision a world in which criminal justice and drug policies keep our communities safer. Ending the war on drugs and looking beyond the criminal justice system for a range of solutions to address society's ills will better protect human rights, reduce violence and addiction, and build public respect for and trust in law enforcement.  \n\n\n\nRespectfully submitted; \n\nStephen Downing\nDeputy Chief, LAPD (ret.)\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15238","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephen Downing","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 64 and a retired male.  I started using Kratom  in March of 2016 that was introduced to me by a friend.  Prior to to using this herb I was at the ER every weekend and sometimes had to call the ambulance during the night due to abdominal pain. I was unable to hold food down and if I ate I would throw it back up. I was severely depressed and felt that I had no hope. I had lost a lot of weight and look like death.  I see a Gastroenterologist and a  psychologist on a monthly basis and they are both aware of me using this miracle herb that has subsided the pain in my intestine and lifted my spirit back. I am able to do things that I enjoy doing again.  In the beginning I would try and not take Kratom and the pain, depression and loss of appetite would come back.  I am on a consistent dose and I am able to feel normal again.  I am gaining weight back and hopefully soon I will be able to have my surgery.  This herb does not have any affects on me as a high nor is it addictive.  Being that I am retired and on a limited budget this is the cheapest and safest way for me to maintain my health.  All prescribed medicines have been a danger to me due to many allergies to certain ingredients.  This has been the most effective to my body.

As you know, the prescription opiate epidemic is truly a public health emergency, and there is substantial anecdotal evidence that Mitragyna speciosa can be a safe and effective treatment for patients tapering and stopping chronic opiate pain medications.  \n\nMoreover, my review of the literature regarding adverse effects indicates that patients who have suffered overdoses were taking Mitragyna speciosa in addition to illicit drugs that are known to have serious and deadly complications.   For patients consuming Mitragyna speciosa in standard doses or under a supervised treatment plan, there is no definitive evidence that this medication is in fact toxic. \n\nFor these above reasons, I believe that Mitragyna speciosa warrants more formal investigation.  I have a pending Institutional Review Board application to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mitragyna speciosa for patients undergoing opiate pain medication tapers.  This will be the first step to potentially applying for a new drug application through the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIt is my belief that Mitragyna speciosa very likely has the potential to become a safe and effective standard treatment for patients suffering opiate dependence and stopping their use opiate medications and may very well prove to be life-saving in a large number of cases.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17313","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Franc, MD, PhD","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Don't make the same mistake as with scheduling marijuana.

I tried it, and for the first time in a long time, my pain levels decreased so much that I was able to things with my family that I would normally decline doing. Kratom helped me with the withdrawals from pain medications which if you've been on them as long as I have, I'd rather die then to go thru that again. My energy levels are up to normal, my moods have been so mellow that my children tell me I'm like a new person. My anxiety is nearly non existent which is HUGE for anyone who has had that experience.

I know for a fact that doing this would have severe negative impacts on the lives of many Americans. I know this because I am one of those Americans whom it would hurt immensely. \n\nI have been using Kratom for the past 5 years. I started using it in order to  wean myself off of strong prescription opiates that I was taking for a severe burn on my leg. The pain was too great for too long and it meant that by the time I no longer needed the pain medication, I had become physically dependent upon those opioids. I did not seek out the drugs to misuse them, I only wanted to live a normal existence without debilitating pain. If you have never tried to go \"cold turkey\" from opiates, you have no idea how incredibly painful and horrible the experience is. Kratom saved my life. I really think that I would not be alive without it. As soon as I started using it (a small amount, around 3g of powdered leaf, in the mornings) I was able to stop all prescription pain killers. And maybe the most amazing part - I felt better not just physically, but mentally and emotionally. I had energy again. I no longer had a clouded head and sleepiness all day long. I cannot possibly imagine the horrid life I would still be living if I hadn't discovered this miraculous plant.\n\nNow, I use it occasionally. It enhances my mood, replaces liver and kidney -hurting NSAID's, like ibuprofen, and is very inexpensive. In all my years of using Kratom, I have not had one bad reaction or problem because of it. Many of my friends also take it. Some take it instead of coffee, some take it to relax on a Friday night, some take it because it helps them deal with their insomnia. It really is amazing how many wonderful uses there are for this plant. I have never heard of a negative side-effect from any of my friends. \n\nWhy would we try to suddenly take it away from people like me. Please, please, please do not make it illegal. Allow time for it to be studied. Allow time for a regulatory system to be put into place so that the quality assurance of the products that we buy can be put into place. Allow normal, good people like me to continue living happy and peaceful lives.\n\nI would also recommend trying Kratom. Just take a small dose and see for yourself how benign of a substance it truly is. And who knows, maybe it will help you like it has helped millions of people all over the world.\n\nThank you for taking your time to consider this carefully.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChris Knox","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5418","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Knox","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please reconsider..\n\nPain management...not pain med addiction!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19122","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Melanie Owens","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, I suffer from chronic pain, anxiety, and depression.

I am 27 years old and a resident of Lockport NY. I have never tried Kratom and as  I have no reason to. But Kratom has saved my life. Please allow me to explain. \n\nWhen I was 22 I married my high school sweetheart. Andrew is the most incredibly selfless, hardworking, loving man I have ever had the privilege to know. We have built a life together by working hard and honestly. We have both gone to school, worked long hours and struggled to make ends meet. But through it all, we have been determined to succeed. My husband works in a skilled trade which requires manual labor. At only 26, he has injured his back, knees and hip so badly that some mornings he can hardly get out of bed. \n\nI don't know if you've ever had to watch someone you love struggle to get out of bed in the morning, but let me tell you... It's awful. I will never forget the day he looked at me with tears in his eyes and said \"If it's this bad now, how will I even walk in a few years?\" My heart was broken for him. I was watching the strong man I loved fall to pieces day by day. Doctor after doctor suggested medicines with side effects that ranged from stomach problems, high blood pressure and the danger for addiction. He was told his only option was surgery. That was when the fear hit a new height. We'd watched people we went to high school with die from opiate use after an injury. We'd seen people lose everything over chronic pain and drug abuse. We were terrified this would be a real possibility for us. \n\nA holistic approach had to exist. We researched everything from acupuncture and chiropractors to teas and ice/heat therapies. Nothing seemed to help. Finally in our research we discovered Kratom. To say I was skeptical would be an understatement. I spent MONTHS researching it. I found absolutely nothing to suggest that Kratom was dangerous. I gave my husband the green light and prayed I wouldn't regret it.\n\nPersonally, I have never taken a recreational drug ever in my life. My experience with drugs was limited to antibiotics, allergy medicines and the prenatal vitamins I take. I do not condone recreational drug use. I have seen far too many young lives lost to the opioid epidemic. I have seen marriages end, children end up parent less and worse. I would never give my husband the green light to get high for his own enjoyment. \n\nThough my skepticism ran deep, the results have been better than I can articulate.  My husband is himself again. He still feels pain sometimes but the Kratom has given him his quality of life back. He can go for walks with me. He can get comfortable enough to sleep at night. He does not have to worry about withdrawals or getting addicted. He has stopped taking it several times through the years without any side effects with the exception of a headace, much like caffeine causes. He is never \"out of it\" or high in any capacity. He's able to do his job and help around the house. Without laying on the drama, just understand that Kratom has lived up to the hype. It has saved our lives. \n\nI understand that it is important to regulate substrates like this. I welcome you to. Dosages, content, all should be examined. But this is not a drug of criminals. This is a natural pain reliever. It's as beneficial as a cup of green tea. The only deaths associated with Kratom have included other substances in conjunction with Kratom. Please, begin the clinical trials  and research this drug deserves. It can save lives. It already has. \n\nTo sum this up, I want to express the fear we feel right now. Kratom is our lifeline. If the scheduling of Kratom happens, I am afraid of how we will have to manage my husband's pain. He's only 26 years old - far too young for invasive surgeries or harsh drugs to help him cope. Please, please, please.... I beg you. Do not take this natural pain reliever away.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17611","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rene Breen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I love the product it has helped me so much I'm full of energy and less as stressed.

Kratom has been a life saving herbal tea for me.  I am sick with multiple chronic pain issues including mixed connective tissue disease, fibromyalgia, Lupus, inflammatory arthritis, lung disease from chronic mycotoxin exposure, degenerative disc and joint disease.  The combination of these ailments has had me nearly bedridden (about 80% of the time).  I do attend a Pain Clinic near Boston and they have prescribed opioids, including oxycontin.  Though it takes the edge off the pain the medications cause great breathing difficulty (they slow down respirations and I have trouble getting good oxygenation) and extreme lethargy.  They also fog my brain and  take away from my motivation.  I am 63 years old and I am a grandmother to 9 grandchildren, ages 7 to 17.  They live on the west coast, however, and it has been too difficult for me to go to visit them with all of my ailments.  Even when I am with them my activities are so limited.  But since I found Kratom it's a whole different story!  I want to be functional.  I found Kratom on line. I was looking for a better way to manage pain without the shortness of breath and other symptoms.  I did have to stop taking my oxycodone when I got my Kratom tea.  I knew it might be dangerous to do both.  I did not have any problem stopping the pain medication and I did get pretty good pain relief, without the fatigue and lack of motivation.  I began going to my pain clinic and joined the functional medicine classes, which are exercises to help bedridden people to gain motion and learn to be functional again.  It is very hard, but worth it!  I am finally able to do some things and to look forward to doing things.  I haven't been able to visit my grandchildren yet but two of them are graduating from high school in June, in California, and I am hoping to be there.  If you ban Kratom, I know I will not be able to go.\n\nSo please, I am certain that it would be very hard for people to hurt themselves on Kratom.  The way it is taken would make it impossible to do enough to overdose, and even if you did, I think you'd throw it up.  I don't notice any \"high\" from using it.  Not at all!  But it does minimize pain without the affects on my lungs and mood and energy.  Another benefit for me is that if and when I do need surgery I will not be tolerant to the opioids given for pain relief.  Once a person is tolerant they cannot get relief from surgical or other serious pain.  That is frightening.\n\nThank you so much for hearing me out.  I thank you in advance for your careful consideration of this issue.  I want to have the enjoyment I can out of life and I know that Kratom helps so many people!  It doesn't seem right that the few who like to abuse anything they can, for whatever reason, can take away something that can bring joy and functionality back to people who suffer chronically.  It is a horrible way to live when you cannot look forward to doing anything, or even hope to.  Kratom helps to give me hope that I will be able to do a little more each day.  It's a joy I cannot describe in words.\n\nThank you and God bless you!\n\nSincerely,\n\nCarol L Jamieson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5186","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carol Jamieson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me in more ways than you could ever imagine.

You'll be hurting military veterans, professionals, parents, grandparents, recovering addicts, & people suffering from chronic pain and/or depression/anxiety/ptsd. \nNo one replaces opiates or xanex with kratom to \"get high\". Every single person I know who uses kratom found it while looking for a natural remedy for whatever ailments they were suffering from. Just like I take melatonin for insomnia (because I don't WANT prescription medications like ambien) I take kratom (along with St Johns Wort & a B complex vitamin) to help with depression/anxiety. \nThe \"head shop\" type of advertising of kratom has raised flags about it which is tragic. Millions of us have been ordering it online from reputable vendors for years. If you truly suspect kratom to be anything that should be illegal PLEASE just try it! No exaggeration the effects of kratom are similar to a good cup of coffee- it also just happens to help with so many things in addition to boosting energy. \nCiting concern over the calls to poison control regarding kratom seems exceptionally disingenuous. A couple hundred calls to poison control in several years sounds concerning until you realize innocuous things like regular vitamins, laundry pods, etc are generating hundreds of thousands more calls than kratom. \nWhen I initially heard the DEA intended to ban kratom I genuinely wanted to understand why. I assumed there must be SOME valid reason for it. The more I researched it the more it became apparent that it is baseless. The DEA claimed it has taken about 15 lives- which was untrue. They later had to (quietly) acknowledge kratom alone has taken no lives. Even things like energy drinks have taken at least a few lives- it makes absolutely no sense to ban something that hasn't truly harmed anyone (& instead has actually helped millions) while other things that have caused harm remain legal. \nThis whole proposal stinks of government overreach & an attempt to protect the profits of pharmaceutical companies. The majority of people who benefit from kratom are not criminals, nor are they people trying to get high. We're just regular people who prefer to take a natural approach to managing our own lives & bodies. \nI pray common sense will prevail in this issue. The repercussions of banning kratom would be tragic & plentiful.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21744","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Heather Patrick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We have advanced so much as human beings.

The years that I spent in addiction were so horrible it is truly hard to think about long enough to write this letter to you. I was in bad shape, I was a horrible person.  I got to a place in my life where I was waking up praying for death just to get some relief from it. I don't think I could have made it much longer at all. I had all but alienated even my closest family members and friends. I'm sure they had all but given up hope too. Looking backit was a self inflicted nightmare from which I could never seem to wake from.\n About 2 year's ago I discovered Kratom, the first real miracle I had ever experienced in my life . A friend that was executive director at a rehab I went to told me about it and it changed everything.  You see, you can't abuse kratom. The effects of taking large amounts are just the opposite of those of drugs used to treat opiate addiction like Methadone and Suboxone. Taking too much Kratom only makes you sick at you stomach. I use about 1 small teaspoons 3 times a day and haven't used any illegal or prescription drugs in over 2 year's.  I now have my family back. I work everyday and provide a home and everything a father should provide. I am again a member of our great society.  Please, please reconsider banning this miracle.  I don't think I would have made it without it.

Which leads to the use of Heroin. Kratom is a natural herbal remedy that is VASTLY less addictive and has nearly no adverse reactions. I know this from personal experience. \n\nThere are many people using Kratom as an effective and cheap way of battling and stopping their addiction to the medications they were prescribed. Not a single person in the United States has a cause of death on their legal death certificate as \"Kratom overdoes\" yet THOUSANDS upon THOUSANDS of Americans die every year from over dosing on \"legal\" medications. \n\nIf a person takes to much Kratom they will vomit, if a person takes to many Norco's (or any other narcotic or barbiturate based medication) they will stop breathing and die. It is that simple. \n\nIn your initial proposal to ban not only the sale and use of Kratom by the general public but to effectively stop ALL research into how best to use it on a large scale. By making Kratom as schedule one narcotic listed along side Heroin you will be pushing many Americans from a safe and effective way of battling their addiction or safe use of it to help with chronic pain. Into drastic measures including increasing their risk of becoming Heroin users. \n\nMany people that use Kratom have true medical conditions causing large amounts of chronic pain, such as endometriosis which can cause crippling pain for women.  Yet when they take prescribed pain medications which can lead to lasting damage to their kidneys and livers. Just to name one of many medical conditions where Kratom can be safely, effectively and cheaply substituted for TRULY addictive pain medication pumped out by the pharmaceutical companies that want nothing more then to make money off of having a large percentage of Americans addicted to their product. \n\nPlease as someone that is truly on the front lines, dealing with the repercussions of the DEA's utterly failed \"war on drugs\",  do not make things worse by making Kratom a scheduled narcotic.

I am not a fan of trying new substances, or taking over the counter 'drugs' to stimulate my personality. But when I was going through a low point in my life, I started heavily researching Kratom. The place I obtained my information from, said it would be a natural mood and energy booster which would help increase social activities. Now, as a shy person with social anxiety, and waves of depression, I decided to try Kratom. After hours, if not days of research, I ordered what I felt would be a good experimental amount of this plant extract. In the first day or two, I noticed that at the correct dosage for my body weight, I would feel energetic, and in a generally good mood. I also realized, if the dosage was too high, I would simply fall asleep into a relaxed, comfortable state. After trying Kratom for about a weeks time, I noticed I was much happier. With or without it. I noticed If I kept the right amount in a balanced procedure, I had more energy than a Red Bull, but not extreme energy like hard drugs. I noticed it was NON ADDICTIVE, and I noticed it made me want to interact with other people again. \nAfter my original supply was out, I did not seek to purchase more. I felt it was a good mood booster, but I did not feel it had any addictive properties. Over the next couple weeks, I remained in a good state of mind, but that deteriorated slowly, and I fell back into a slump. Upon trying Kratom again, a few months later. It helped me to maintain a positive state of mind. I feel like this extract is not a treat to the public, and its impossible to abuse. If the users of this product are educated on it, I feel like it can help society as a whole. I also feel that a lot of people are uneducated on it and are either disappointed by the results, or are expecting a \"high\" like designer drugs give you. This is not the case with Kratom. There is no high. Its no different than going to a doctor and getting anti depressants... But wait. There is one difference. Feds aren't making money off of it.

Kratom allows me to stay off of disability, and to live my life. It does not have the debilitating side-effects of opiates or other pain management substances. I have been using kratom when needed for over a year, and have never felt compelled to increase dosage. I have not had any signs of addiction, and when I ran out prior to your previous attempt to ban this life-saving plant, I did not have withdrawal symptoms - though I did lose the ability to walk due to the pain of Ehers-Danlos syndrome (this is a pain I experienced before I knew about kratom, and I was unable to work for years).\nPlease understand that, although my condition is uncommon, there are thousands of Americans who suffer from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, and it has been shown in studies to be a more painful condition than cancer. Many people with EDS are relegated to wheelchairs early in life. We suffer from constant pain from tearing, bruising, dislocations, subluxations, and many other unpleasant symptoms. Many of us have to go though life with zero respite from pain because of the restrictions that exist. Many become addicted to prescribed pain medications. In my support group of about 5,000 people, there are hundreds who rely on kratom to function. It provides pain management without the brain fog, disorientation, or addiction of opiates. it has helped many people I have spoken to get over their opiate addictions. Sadly, when you initially announced your plan to ban kratom and it became unavailable,  people in the support group had to go back to enduring overwhelming pain, and there were suicide attempts because the pain is so overwhelming.\nEhlers-Danlos Syndrome is not the only condition with chronic, debilitating pain. Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of law-abiding, taxpaying citizens depend on kratom to be able to continue working, to be able to continue supporting their families, to be able to continue having a life that is more than being relegated to a wheelchair or bedridden. If you ban kratom, you are sentencing these people - myself included - to a life of pain and misery, and you are going to be responsible for thousands more people needing to apply for disability. Kratom saves lives - and banning kratom destroys them. Please pay attention and understand that you are planning to remove the best, most effective option for pain management for thousands of people, expanding the war on drugs when our tax dollars are better off elsewhere, and putting extra strain on our economy by forcing families into poverty and disability.

I am a 74-year-old retired university professor.  About 20 years ago I began to develop arthritis in all of my body joints, much of it caused by youthful trauma to those joints.  In addition to having one leg nearly 2 inches longer than the other since 9 years of age, I have also had both of my shoulders and knees replaced, my left ankle fused, carpal tunnel surgery on both wrists, and severe disfigurement in my knuckles.  I took naproxen for about 15 years, but it caused an ulcer and, after struggling with anemia for several years, I had to discontinue the use of any NSAIDS.  In the last couple years I have tried marijuana for pain relief, but it provided none.  In the middle of September of this year I learned about kratom from my son, did some research on line, and ordered it.  The very first time I took it, shortly after a revision knee-replacement surgery in August, my pain abated within the hour, almost to the point of non-existence, and has continued to do that with every dose.  In addition, the joint tension caused by trying to prevent the pain also disappeared --a true win/win situation. \n\nAs a result of going on line to research kratom, I learned about the pending action by the DEA, as well as the ownership of a patent by one of the major pharmaceutical companies, and I feared the worst --that it, by being placed on Schedule 1, would be unaffordable to the average person, like me.  My life has changed greatly in the last 2 months.  I am again able to enjoy brisk walks with my dogs, play with my grandchildren, and take care of my home and handicapped husband with a minimum of pain.  My pain does not keep me awake at night nor wake my up in the middle of the night.  I have no undesirable side effects from the kratom and it frees me to live life much as I did when I was half my age.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6155","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Margaret Tannenbaum","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been dealing with my daughter going through some very hard times and I want to get her kratom because what the doctors have been giving her for anxiety and depression has made it worse.

I have never felt any sort of addictive potential to this plant and I feel that it has great promise to be used as an alternative to opiates for pain management. That being said, I think that much more research needs to be done and over the counter sales should be more closely regulated based on such research. By giving kratom schedule 1 status we will prevent most, if not all, research which I feel is vital to the United States' progress in the fields of medicine and technology. For us to advance as a culture and world power, we must allow scientists access to kratom and other psychoactive substances so that their effects, use, and safety can be properly assessed before any bans are put forth.\n\nThe US is gripped by an addiction problem that we must come to terms with as a public health issue. The war on drugs has been a massive failure and our strict drugs laws have incarcerated millions of valuable citizens and created an epidemic of addicts unable to receive the help they need to become reintegrated into society as functional, contributing members. I believe that with help and the use of substances such as kratom, the United States can solve this epidemic. If this were any other illness it would be handled in a far more urgent manner.

Kratom is a member of the coffee tree family and similarly mild in effect. If the scheduling were to succeed, the Kratom plant would be rendered a Schedule 1 controlled substance with no medicinal value, lumped in with devastating hard drugs like heroin. That is very far from the truth. Kratom has a long history of medicinal uses and continues to help millions of people today, including myself! It is a fantastic remedy for a plethora of ailments, ranging from physical, as well as psychological, conditions including chronic pain, anxiety, depression, PTSD, but maybe most strikingly, it is a miracle remedy for opiate addiction- an epidemic in our country currently. Ive personally been diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which are emotionally crippling conditions in themselves. It has affected my family relationships, jobs, and every aspect of my life, which certainly contributes to being partial to opiates. Ive tried many medications but Ive found a system that works. Kratom is a prime factor in my psychological health, but its not just my emotional health that benefits from kratom, as Ill explain. A major concern of mine is that we would be losing out on future research of this versatile plant and I and many others will lose their saving grace. There have already been studies determining that kratom is an effective painkiller without the potentially deadly respiratory-depression that comes along with opioid medications (such as OxyContin, Dilaudid, etc), the main culprit in overdoses everyday.  People are unnecessarily dying and there is a better option that deserves our attention.\n\tSeveral years ago, while playing with my little girl I injured my back. It was the most excruciating pain Ive ever felt in my life. I had to be carried down the stairs and into the hospital and ended up having to use a walker to assist me for the following weeks. They initially gave me Fentanyl in the E.R. followed by other medications including Vicodin and muscle relaxers. Eventually, I developed a dependence to using opiate drugs. It began to affect my ability to work and to interact with my family. It was like my daughter didnt know who I was anymore. Once I knew I had to stop using these drugs, I looked to treatment programs like methadone clinics and Suboxone doctors. These prescribed substitute drugs were as difficult, if not more so, to become abstinent from than the original meds! If the meds werent available, I looked to street drugs. After trying rehab and still desperate for an answer, I began to search the internet and found that some people had positive results with some kind of tea-like leaf called Kratom. After picking some up from a local shop, I made the decision to try it instead of the synthetic alternatives with their myriad of side-effects, including drowsiness and being emotionally distant to my friends and family. The effects were nearly imperceptible but I realized I didnt feel the usual withdraw symptoms like I did when attending opioid maintenance programs. I needed less and less Kratom daily and in a relatively short period of time, I wasnt dependent on any chemicals, whatsoever! Somehow this herbal powder gave me my freedom back and made me feel normal without prolonged withdrawal effects. Now, I do not use any opiates or other drugs and its thanks to kratom. Kratom was virtually free of side effects and very mild, similar to other herbal supplements you can obtain at the grocery store.  Unlike other over-the-counter meds like Aspirin, ibuprofen or Tylenol, kratom doesnt cause any issues with the stomach or liver. I honestly dont know where my life would be at had I not found it. It saved me.\n\tWith the opiate/opioid epidemic sweeping our country and overdoses ever-rising, we need a safe alternative to pharmaceutical painkillers and Kratom is that better option. Im certain opiate use and overdoses will continue to rise even higher if a ban is placed on Kratom and even I, might become a casualty. With a job, daughter, and family that needs me, I know the standard of my life wont be the same without kratom. I humbly ask you to reconsider the scheduling of kratom.\n\tThank you so much for taking the time to hear my story!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13757","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin White","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am terribly troubled to learn that another harmless plant is being put on The Chopping Block.

My name is Carl and Im a shift supervisor at Starbucks.  Im 30 years old.  I was a opiate user for about 4 years and felt trapped and absolutely hopeless, led a destructive life from about age 17 to 21.  Had no friends and thought of drugs as the only answer.  I was introduced to heroin and I regret it tremendously.  I keep thinking about how my life could have been if i'd never been addicted to heroin.  It didn't take long until I was at a point of getting dopesick, and it was terrifying and felt like a 24/7 job.  I had to plan everything, constantly on edge, worrying about how I was going to get my next fix.  I went on Suboxone treatment for my opiate addiction and was on it for about 8 years.  Yes, 8 years seems like an incredibly long time, but I was deathly afraid of opiate withdrawal.  I have a job that requires me to be in tip top shape, very fast paced, I couldn't deal with withdrawal and lay in bed for a while.  What most people don't know about Suboxone and Methadone is that withdrawal takes longer, and its definitely not easy.  Heroin and similar opiates are short term, while Suboxone and Methadone are long term opiates that stay in the recepters and cause a long and grueling withdrawal that is hard to bear and keep up with general responsibility of life.  I couldn't stand being on an opiate that was worse to be on then heroin.  I do feel that Suboxone helped me at the time, but if i knew what I know now about the difference of withdrawal between long-acting and short-acting opiates, I wouldve taken a second thought at going on Suboxone.  If only I knew about Kratom years ago.  I was able to get off the Suboxone treatment with the help of Kratom.  My family and friends are so proud of me, and I'm enjoying not having the terrible effects of Suboxone maintenance treatment.  I am freed from the ball and chain.  Kratom is a life-saver.  Its an incredibly mild, yet effective alternative to Suboxone and Methadone.  To compare the effects of a Kratom high with a real opiate high is like comparing apples to oranges.  Kratom is not a full blown opiate, nor does it ever come close to the intensity of one.  Kratoms opiate like effects are incredibly mild: no constipation, no shortness of breath, risk of overdose is null.  On Suboxone I was having trouble with constipation, and my skin had no color.  Now that Im off Suboxone Im getting color back, Im able to use the bathroom regularly, and I feel as if I took a step in the right direction.  I was devastated to find out that Kratom was being scheduled to Schedule 1 and I found it preposterous.  There is no way you can say Kratom has no medicinal value, and addiction to Kratom is one of the most mild Ive ever seen.  Users report almost no withdrawal when compared to real opiates.  There are real benefits to this plant, and Im a living example on how Kratom can free you from the depths of opiate addiction.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7931","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carl Capodice","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\nI started using Kratom about 4 months ago.\nI have had 3 surgeries since 2012.\nMy first surgery was back surgery {Spinal fusion}\nAll went well.

When I first heard of it I was leary, but once I was educated about the plant and it's usage, it was separated in my mind from the types of narcotics that steal life from people and create junkies.  \n\nI wonder if the name scared some in the enforcement industry.  If so, I hope that learning about what kratom actually is and does will wash away whatever suspicion and stigma that had settled on it.

I was addicted to heroin, pain pills pretty much any opiate I could get my hands on. I stole from friends and family and ended up on the streets where I would steal to support my addiction and eventually tried to commit suicide because I didn't think I could get through my opiate addiction. I was able to get through my addiction but after I had recovered I was still using opiates sometimes and I wasn't living a productive life. I was constantly depressed and felt like my life was worthless. Then a friend introduced me to kratom and I was amazed! It solved all my depression and anxiety problems which were the main reasons I was using opiates. This was almost 3 years ago and since my wonderful discovery of kratom I now have a job a wife and a child and I am finally a productive member of society. I pay my bills I pay my taxes I make sure there's food on the table for my child. If kratom were to be scheduled my quality of life would suffer greatly and it wouldn't help at all I can already see the depression and anxiety I experienced resurfacing and maybe I would end up where I was 3 years ago.

I cannot speak for other kratom users. If others claim the substance has pain relief qualities I cannot judge their claim. I was inspired to try it by a two article piece by an author from Forbes who had heard of kratom and decided to find out what it was. In his second article he specifically commented that he found it perfectly safe and cautioned the DEA not to take action against the substance. I use it in small quantities and find that it's a lot like a double espresso without any acidic or sleep interruption side effects. I find it enhances mood and energy for an hour or two. The way I use it, it most certainly does not make one \"high.\" And there are no side effects - after it wears off or after sleep there is no feeling resembling a hang-over with liquor or having your \"bell rung\" after using marijuana.\n\nIndeed I think the DEA is oddly out of sync with the national mood when looking at the situation concerning cannabis. Despite being a \"controlled substance\" for years the DEA has not shown any public reaction to cities and later states for refusing to enforce laws against cannabis use. Now there are a blizzard of laws proposed to legalize recreational marijuana. And this is being done at a time when neurologists are finding more and more evidence that \"weed\" can be beastly dangerous, especially to the young. Smoking dope was part of the uniform worn by millions in the 70s and 80s, and I wore the uniform. I was ambivalent about the stuff then when the average joint was far weaker than today's equivalent. If the country is mistaken about cannabis the DEA has been mute on the debate. If nothing else, it is rank hypocrisy to roll over on the cannabis laws and then decide to replace it with Kratom on the Schedule I list. Enough people have been using the substance in the US for long enough for any self-evident dangers to be well known. (Indeed, the fact that kratom has survived in obscurity for years is testimony to it's ineffectiveness as a creator of a euphoric high. If it did that, drug dealers would have been interested in the stuff for years. But their role is taken now by small web sites and a limited number of \"new age\" herb shops.) Frankly, DEA coming down like a hammer on kratom has to appear as something done in light of the general failure of the \"war on drugs\" and DEA's eagerness to punish the vulnerable and small scale kratom community instead of the drug lords who have immense power and know how to use it. \n\nLastly I strongly doubt the assumption that something should be illegal simply because it does no clear good. (To the best of my knowledge, there have been few studies on the possible medical benefits to Kratom - and little on its inherent dangers.) The culture of the US bows to individual autonomy on issues that dwarf kratom use in potential damage to society. Why not leave the kratom community alone. If made illegal and people believe the stuff creates a serious high you will succeed in creating another illegal hole that the drug sellers will rush to fill. If that doesn't happen, then kratom is what it's users claim - a mild and safe way to take an edge off the day.

I am an educated adult with two children, one of them in college the other in first grade. I am a nurse for our state psychiatric hospital, so a government employee. I do my job, take pride in helping this population and I spend time with my kids; these are the things that were taken away from me while I was living in sickness and pain.\nI did what I thought was the right thing by going to the doctors, the specialists, had surgeries, had injections, took my medications as prescribed.\n\nAfter a couple years of slowly being killed with the meds and the life that was disappearing from me I heard of Kratom. My brother actually told me about it and I laughed, saying it won't work for what I have going on. I was thinking either it won't work or this Kratom has to be super addictive or it's poison however I set out to research this plant. I finally tried it and it seemed to help. I had gotten to the point on all these meds that I was planning my suicide, being in pain is exhausting, it hurts and effects every area of one's life. Prior to the chronic pain happening to me, I could not understand others who had chronic pain, in the back of my mind I would think these people are pansies, cry babies. Well, they are not and I am not. In fact I would venture to say people that live with these complications are extremely strong.\n\nI went through 2 months of pure hell while detoxing from RX meds, it was the worst time in my life and I commend any and all people who are able to get through it with out going back to their doctor for another RX just to get out of the withdrawal. I don't care who you are but if your body is getting fed with meds for a good length of time, it will become physically addicted, even taking the meds as prescribed; it's just a fact.\n\nAfter the detox, I began utilizing a supplement called Kratom. I did not get the side effects that RX meds involve such as being high. I paid attention to my body and mind, such as OK, my pain level is a 9 now, post Kratom it is 4; or my anxiety and mood are 9 (with 10 being the worst) and post Kratom I feel about a 4. These things sort of melted away without any weird feeling of being high or out of my own body. I was simply not in so much pain, I was simply not so anxious et cetera. There isn't a sudden moment that one feels Kratom kick in like with a pain med, one has to pay attention to notice some improvement.\n\nI understand that government workers, pharmacies, and the like are out to make money but when pockets are getting lined while we are dying I have to wonder when will these folks have a heart, morals or ethics. All it takes is one of you to stand up for what is right versus what makes money.\n\nThis is a plant, in the coffee family. It is no more addictive than coffee. Most of the people that utilize this supplement are middle aged, educated normal people that happen to be living with pain, depression, anxiety. Once the meds fail us or the side effects outweigh the benefit we came upon one of natures helpers only to be threatened to be kicked back down. Why the hell are you guys bent on coming after a natural supplement, why aren't resources being utilized in ways that will actually benefit humanity because what you are attempting to do is hurting humanity and this is just another reason why Americans are getting fed up with government.\n\nRestore faith and trust in the people you are meant to serve, people have come to believe you are dishonest, corrupt and or ignorant. Do not use your powers as a means to take away our livelihoods; by scheduling and or banning you are feeding the very monster that you claim to be having war with. \n\nIf anything, perhaps put in measures such as \"not for persons under 18\"  (even that is sort of ignorant) or get these smoke or head shops to stop selling Kratom that has been \"enhanced\". But to take nature and sell it for profit to pharmacies and very likely make some concoction using Kratom and other poisons is defeating the purpose. I feel I should not have to be writing a letter to explain why our government and big industry should not take away a leaf. What is next? Also, please do some research, this isn't killing people. Those that have died, have had other substances in their toxicology reports. I believe banning this is taking away my civil liberties and I would gladly join a lawsuit to fight this. Listen, your power and resources will get better results with focus on real issues. Do you understand? I can only follow the money with this intent and there lies what and who is behind all of this nonsense.\n\nSincerely,\nA mother, a daughter, a sister, a nurse, a neighbor, a tax payer, an American, a child of God, a victim of my own governments corrupt agenda.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5815","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chelsie Byroads","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 65-year-old retired computer systems analyst. I first heard about kratom over two months ago relative to the DEA's impending ban. Since then, I've spent a great deal of time educating myself about kratom and have become increasingly concerned that an opportunity for valuable research might be squandered in a myopic, poorly-justified governmental effort to repress the use of a substance with some opiate-like characteristics.\n\nNotice that I say \"some\" and opiate-\"like\". Over 20 bio-active alkaloids have been detected in kratom. Except for mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, those alkaloids may be present in some strains and not others, some in young leaves and not older leaves. Thus the physical effects of kratom use can vary with the strain, age and drying method of the leaves, as well as the quantity used. Some varieties can be sedating, some anxiolytic, some stimulating. Some strains are both anxiolytic and stimulating, which I don't believe can be said for opiates. Imagine a painkiller that's both highly effective for severe chronic pain AND non-narcotic (in the sense that narcotics tend to be stupefying). Imagine an opiate-LIKE painkiller that doesn't suppress breathing. \n\nThe variety of human-beneficial effects produced by kratom deserves to be exhaustively studied, and it has not been. Putting this plant substance on a narcotics schedule, particularly Schedule 1, will greatly inhibit further study in the United States. Meanwhile, highly addictive substances with no medical utility, like tobacco and alcohol, are not treated like drugs at all. The irony is inescapable. \n\nI have little hope that people's comments here, whether from grandmothers, veterans, medical professionals, the chronically ill or those recovering from opiate addiction, will have any effect on the DEA's decision-making. Rather, I must hope that pro-kratom lobbyists and legal teams will be able to sway decision-makers to take a sane course, toward scientific inquiry and away from knee-jerk reactionism. \n\nSome regulation of kratom would be appropriate, including establishing age limits and requirements for safety inspections. But designating this multi-purpose, medically-useful tree leaf as a Schedule 1 narcotic like heroin or Ecstasy would be a case of fear and bias overtaking reason. I'd hate to see this in my country. I'd hate to see so many grandmothers, veterans and professionals, like those commenting here, turned into felons overnight, and with such weak justification.

It is not only depressing for her, but me as well to have to see her like that.  She has never overdosed on Kratom.  She has never acted intoxicated on Kratom.  When she runs out of Kratom she does not go through withdrawals, except the pain coming back to its normal high rating on the pain scale.  I do not believe that Kratom is a harmful substance or I would have serious concerns with her taking it.  Kratom eases her pain so that she can function like a normal human being, please do not take that away from us or anyone else that it is helping.\n\nThank you,\n\nJoseph Zvonar","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17332","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Zvonar","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nMy experiences have been very limited with this substance but I know people who it has helped without any side effects or negative issues. Prescription pain meds are taking a hold of way to many people. Even myself after some medical issues I've had I found myself wishing there was something that was an alternative. Then the very real  issue of withdrawal is very scary for everyone even when meds are taken as directed. The information I have read that it can help lower the dose of opiates and even stop completely I think is very important. The alternative medication to help stop can be just as bad as the opiate.

The DEA will be on the wrong side of history regarding marijuana. It would be a mistake to extend that antiquated mindset to ban a plant that has been beneficial to many people. Focus on the known evils, the things that really plague the country. Please do not create straw men to increase your scope at the expense of people that could be harmed or negatively effected by the decision to remove this substance. That will leave you directly responsible for the unnecessary suffering of many people. Look to the future; the legalization of marijuana is evident. Do you want to be one of the people that will be looked at as silly, and asinine characterizations in the history of the United States? Look to the powers that would oppose a plant, but not OxyContin. Are they benefiting your family? The measure to oppose Kratom is a violation of the freedom that this country stands for. More importantly, it demonstrates the freedoms that the government (i.e. you, the reader) is willing to violate in direct opposition to your own well being. I believe FDA should fund investigation into the mechanisms of Kratom, and the possible long term effects. In doing that, it would be serving the American people. In banning the substance in a knee-jerk, and possibly political, and likely corporately influenced move, the DEA would not only be doing the people a disservice, it would be robbing us of our dignity. Making a move out of greed or servitude to rob the American people of their dignity and independence will leave this administration only to be judged by future generations. The people of the United States now judge those that created and indulged \"reefer madness\" as ridiculous and politically corrupt. I hope you do not fall into that category. Research Kratom, do not ban it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9988","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"R Z","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After using prescription drugs for years this is the only substitute that was able to help me remove that poison from my life.

Had blood work done twice and nothing was found. I was told by two Drs it was only stress. Every physician suggested SSRIs no matter how many times I explained I was not depressed and was opposed to SSRIs because of their tendency to cause suicode and suicidal thoughts. I needed something to calm me in moments of panic, allow me to sleep and funtion day to day. Because the US HAS  such a high rate of addiction to pain meds and benzodiazepines physicians are apprehensive to prescribe, and understandably so.

We currently represent over 2000 practitioners, educators, students, and others who utilize herbalism is a safe, effective, and therapeutic fashion. The AHGs primary goal is to promote a high level of professionalism and education in the study and practice of therapeutic herbalism, whether based on modern biomedical, traditional, or other approaches.\n\nThe AHG would like to publicly as well as directly to the DEA state our opposition to the classification of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as Schedule I substances according to the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)  a regulatory move that would effectively ban the plant kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) which contains these constituents.\n\nThe AHG considers such a step to be unjustified.  As noted by AHPA and others, there is no precedent for the DEA to use its emergency authority in this manner for a naturally occurring substance such as a plant.  As documented elsewhere (Yearsley - Herbalgram, McGuffin and Young - AHPA) the serious adverse health effects including deaths that have been in some cases potentially attributed to kratom are more likely due to adulteration and/or concomitant use of hazardous and toxic substances.\n\nSchedule I classification would also be highly counterproductive in terms of gaining additional scientific knowledge about kratom and its potential uses, as well any potential safety concerns, in that such a legal classification would overly restrict further scientific research into not only its safety but also its therapeutic value.\n\nThe AHG urges the DEA to permanently set aside the potential classification of kratom as a Schedule I drug as inappropriate, given all we know of its uses and safety based on both science and tradition.  We believe that it is vital that plants with a long tradition of therapeutic use such as kratom remain accessible to the public.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22716","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"American Herbalists Guild","postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Mandelbaum","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"First, as a professional now approaching my mid-seventies, I can personally affirm the efficacy of kratom for pain relief and the alleviation of the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome, anxiety and depression.

I do not believe kratom poses any significant threat to the public, and on the contrary, could offer a vast array of benefits to people sorely in need. In this era when we are witnessing many health and sociological epidemics, now is not the time to ban this plant that could be an invaluable asset in the fight against addiction, crime, and overall anxiety. \n\nI have used kratom for five years, and it has brought nothing but benefits to my life. Those benefits include pain relief, reduction of anxiety and stress, and an increase in motivation and overall life satisfaction. Since I began using kratom, I have developed into a productive member of society, a person who seeks to make the world around all of us a better place. Though this development is not fully due to kratom, I can say with full confidence that it played a large role in the process. Without kratom, I would be in more pain, more stressed, less happy, and less motivated. If kratom exists and can aid these things in reality, why should anyone be stripped of its help? Why would anyone wish that a persons right to want to live happily, without pain, be restricted? \n\nI have used roughly the same dose, between 3-6 grams, for the entirety of the last five years, and have never sought to increase the dose or chase a high. This is because kratom does not get you high, and it has a ceiling effect. What this means is that smaller doses often work better than larger ones, motivating people to remain at low doses in their own experiences. Practically this creates the opposite of drug-seeking effects, and contributes to the well being of users by offering an antidote to the habits of constant consumption found in our culture. If this aspect of dosage were to be discovered in some other supplement, or even in a traditional medicine, surely it would be hailed by the scientific community as miraculous. We should not ignore this quality in kratom.\n\nI live with pain that stems from a disease called Legg-Calve Perthes disease, which I was diagnosed with at the age of 12. Currently I have arthritis developing in the disease-affected hip, which limits which activities I can do, and causes a virtually constant sense of pain that radiates throughout my leg. Because of my young age, doctors will not prescribe me painkillers, nor do I want them to  I have seen how dangerous that road could be. On the other hand, OTC painkillers fail to work, even on a minor level. \n\nBefore kratom, I lived with the thought that there were no options for me, and that I would simply have to tough it out. Seeing doctors look down on me for simply trying to get relief made me feel that somehow, the pain was my fault. It was a twisted system that left me sad and confused, but I grew closer with each day to breaking down and accepting it.\n\nBy bringing kratom into my life, I found relief, and once again felt like a normal, pain-free person. To a person who has lived with constant pain for decades, the sudden and natural absence of pain caused by kratom is miraculous. \n\nThe relief I get from kratom is mild, gentle, and yet effective. It is not something that can be used as an escape route  I am still well aware of my life and the problems in it. Contrary to pharmaceutical opiates, kratom gives me the deep-rooted motivation to get things done, to go out and achieve for myself the things that will improve my life. \n\nThroughout history, we have seen time and again that policies of prohibition do not work. \nWe are not seeing sufficient results with these policies, yet we keep pursuing them, and people are taking notice. In a recent MTV Opioid Awareness special, President Obama himself maintained that our focus should shift from incarceration towards treatment and help for addicts. This is an amazingly relevant validation of the idea that we cannot enforce and imprison our way out of the opioid epidemic. We have been trying that for the last century, and we have only ended up where we are today. \n\nBy banning kratom, we will be taking our first steps down a path that will only intensify all the problems I have mentioned. It will remove a safe, natural tool from the hands of thousands of responsible adults, whose suffering in life will increase needlessly. The laws will put more non-violent offenders in prison, people who could not even remotely be considered criminals  people like the doctors, teachers, and nurses who contribute much to the functioning of our society. \n\nIn conclusion, I strongly oppose a scheduling of kratom, of any kind, and instead support other measures, such as regulation similar to how current dietary supplements are being handled. This, coupled with an age limit to keep it out of the hands of minors, is a common-sense way to move forward while allowing citizens the personal freedom they want and deserve. With these things easily within reach, there is no good reason to ban this plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2407","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Derek Thibault","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not restrict  Kratom as I know that it offers pain relief without the terrible side effects of other prescription drugs  thanks \nDuane","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9136","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Duane Schneider","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep kratom legal.

It grows on trees. And yet, unlike the other Schedule I substances derived from plants that grow out of the ground, there seems to be little inherent danger in utilzing its beneficial properties. The prospect of becoming addicted to the plant is no more plausible than becoming addicted to drinking coffee or buying cheeseburgers every day. Comparatively, the risk of death as a result of recreationally using the other illegal substances is astronomical. A few minutes of trolling statistics via a search engine will tell you so. Quite frankly, it can be argued that the sixteen or so deaths \"to Kratom\" EVER REPORTED can be attributed, rather,  to other drugs found in the bodies of the deceased, according to toxicology reports. Y'know, the ones that actually kill people. Some are prescribed by doctors. Some are flooding the streets, despite a valiant but seemingly failing effort of some 40-50 years to keep them off the streets.  \n\nYou see, people are using this plant so they don't have to take pills or buy street drugs to alleviate their pain. The combat veterans, the anxiety afflicted, the former addicts (some are all of these things); they will tell you themselves in this space here for the next couple of months. This personal decision, of course, slightly dents the pockets of drug dealers endorsed and not endorsed  by the state.\n\n\nI'm not here to convince the DEA, if this comment even gets approved. The idea is hilarious. Perhaps, I - and many others -commented so that people without the information on this plant and it's ensuing danger of illegality can decide for themselves what a \"risk to public health\" entails and what we should consider so. Perhaps I've commented for the people.\n\nOh, and I appreciate the unusually swift responses of those afflicted by the use of Kratom, and their horrifying first and secondhand experiences that are virtually unheard of within online circles of Kratom users as well as scientific research. They were really waiting to seize the opportunity, huh?

I've used kratom periodically for nearly 8 years with so far no tangible negative effects. I've been through significant depressions for by various causes before in my life and kratom has allowed me to continue functioning normally at work as a chemical simulation scientist.\n\nI've encountered a lot of uninformed news media over the last decade calling kratom everything from a hallucinogen to \"like heroin\", all of which are false to the point of absurdity. The alkaloids the DEA wants to ban are active at the opioid receptors but completely lack any type of \"high\". They also seem to totally lack respiratory depression, the primary cause of death by opioid overdose. Reading through the scientific literature on kratom reveals that mitragynine alkaloids have no structure in common with any known opioids. Mitragynine and 7-hydroxy mitragynine possess several properties in common with alkaloids which are known to prevent addictive behavior (G-protein coupled receptor activity, mixed agonist/antagonist activities at the mu receptor, etc.). The currently known facts of mitragynine and derivatives along with more than a decade of notable consumption by the public with no deaths or serious injuries clearly attributable to kratom means that there is no threat to the public. Attempting to ban kratom in spite of the facts will likely be perceived by its 3-5 million consumers (and likely many more) as having ulterior motives.\n\nBanning kratom in the US will result in a black market (since Canada and Mexico will not be scheduling kratom). In addition, without a harm reduction approach like regulation as a dietary supplement there will be no monitoring of kratom quality, a direct cause of deaths due to kratom which had been adulterated by hard opioids.\n\nThere is also the fact that kratom has been helpful to millions of people with insufficient health insurance coverage. Kratom empowers millions to take control of their own health when they may be unable or unwilling to get treatment for medical conditions due to cost or for social reasons (and medical mistakes are now one of the most likely causes of premature death in the US). Even more, it would be a genuine disservice to the people to ban what many addicts consider to be a godsend, allowing them to get clean from opiates without the need to come out to the world as addicts, possibly destroying their future family and employment prospects.\n\nWe are now in the midst of an epidemic of opioid addiction among Americans. There are likely many causes, not the least of which is the need to work harder and longer for less compensation. Kratom is almost certainly the best potential solution to this epidemic. Taking it away from the public's control will cause massive inflation in cost for those who do manage to get a prescription for it. It's safety profile alone should be sufficient to warrant sales of kratom as a dietary supplement as it is in Canada. But it has the potential to save the lives of millions of addicts who have only just discovered it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21553","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Daly","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To be brief, the herbal supplement kratom was a godsend.

They were aware of the addictive potential when they were pushing doctors to prescribe these medications. I did not expect to face the struggles i've had to face i've seen countless numbers of ppl in a short time go from getting pills from their doctors and when the dea tightened restrictions on prescription pills many of them tried to find a way to not be sick by moving onto heroin and alot of them aren't alive alot of them didn't get a chance to move to heroin because they o.d.'d before it got that far. We have reached athe tipping point this isn't even uncommon anymore everyone knows someone. America has gone thru several opiate epidemics in it's history at no point did criminalizing the behavior stop the problem. It's not going to stop it now what you need to do is be able to empathize i'm sure in your own lives you have some vice that you wish you could stop whether it be drinking or smoking whatever it is ppl have their weaknesses well opiates is everyones weakness if you take it long enough. Now okay you guys have done your best to reign in the abuses you could but we have got to stop thinking of this problem as something that can be solved with hard line punishments. Is it optimal? no optimally the handing out of opiates to the population on mass should never have happened but we don't live in a perfect world in order to fix this problem we're going to have to get enough ppl behind the idea of mental treatment which a great number of addicts are masking mental illness so until you do that everything else will be a stop gap measure or a way to placate the fears of mothers and fathers but do nothing to actually change it. Kratom is a means of saving money is a way of avoiding the illicit drug market and a means of surviving, drug addicts spend the majority of their lives just trying to survive to exist. These are ppl to be pitied to work on options to fix the broken system to keep ppl from falling thru the cracks. I'm currently using kratom to try to reduce my opiate dependency. I honestly don't know if it's the greatest thing on the planet or a stop gap measure to keep me from moving onto more dangerous things. I know that i can afford kratom infinately more I know i don't have to break laws to get it i don't have to stick a needle in my arm for it and i can use it relatively safely without od'ing. I know that it doesn't have the body count that oxy has and i'm sure i don't have to tell you the lengths an opiate addict will go to get their fix we have story after story of ppl who've died and the worst part about it is we have proof that shows a different method based on harm reduction has much greater impact than just banning all banning does is drive ppl underground. If you want to tax it fine if you want to ensure it's not sold to minors fine if you want to test it to make sure it is in fact pure and not containing adulterants that would only serve to make it safer for the public but please please please consider long and hard whether the move is in fact protecting the population or forcing an already desperate population to further be marginalized in a country that seems uninterested in investing the money and effort into actually fixing these problems. Ppl are who are stuck on suboxone and methodone are using kratom to make it thru that very long withdrawls. We hear suboxone and naloxone referred to as miracle drugs and I might end up on currently it's hard to get into programs for ppl who can't meet the program requirements some ppl are home bound and can't bring themselves even in withdrawl to brave the cattle call medicine as i call it of the methodone clinics. It's ironic that the drug companies created this situation and suddenly have the solution to the problem of their own making. I guess that's what america is about now a race to step on ppls throats while you grab their cash. What happens to an already desperate population when you remove the source of their medicine or criminalize them just trying to get thru the day without projectile vomitting. I know many ppl who use kratom they are aside from their addiction normal ppl who didn't do a think to warrant this scourge now you have a choice on whether you would prefer that population heroin addicts on the street desperate for a fix?

The doctor at Tampa general said my injury was one of the worst bone breaks he had seen in a year or two, and usually breaks of the kind were from motorcycle accidents, while as mine was skateboarding. Long story short, I had to have 4 plates and 17 screws put into my calf and was unable to walk for five months.  Living in Florida and seeing the epidemic of pain medication abuse, along with my troubled past, I really didn't want to use pain medication at all for fear of addiction and what that would do to my wife and son. I have been strictly only using kratom for management and not only has it helped with the post accident depression, it also helped me return to living a functional drug free life. Kratom helped immensely when I was painfully relearning how to walk, and am still in pain to this day, which kratom helps a lot. My wife is sober, no drugs or alcohol, she doesn't like drugs or alcohol, and she has seen how kratom helped me through the toughest time of my life, yet with out any intoxicating effects, like pain killers have. There is literally 0 intoxication effects of the strain of kratom I use, no effect on memory or motor skills, no withdrawals, and no Ill effects of any kind.

Of course there will be people who abuse Kratom. Just like people abuse fast food or cigarettes which definitely have no medicinal benefits. There's a thin line between so called safe and dangerous substances. My opinion places Kratom well within the spectrum of a safe product.  Although my opinion may not hold much weight, it will be heard. I now live my day to day life with a minimal amount of anxiety and apathy. Kratom is an amazing natural product which clearly has many medical benefits that the DEA knows is true.

Well I work in a smoke shop and we sell Kratom and I know countless people Kratom helps daily and had already taken it before for pulled muscles from working out too hard. So I told the my doctor I would just take Kratom instead. He had heard about it and was all for it. It took 6 weeks for my rib to heal, but during those weeks I was still able to work and I didn't cry every time I moved. When I was healed, I stopped taking the kratom cold turkey with no problem and no withdrawal. I am concerned for the people that Kratom would be banned with little to no actual research on the effects and lack of negative side effects. I'm also concerned it would be banned for the sake of drug companies getting everyone hooked on drugs when most of us don't want to be.

I am used to reading on natural plant products in various sources such as The German Commission E. \n\nAfter reading the information compiled by the American Kratom Association and the opinions of the scientists who have studied it and the physicians with personal experience with it in their practices, I want kratom to remain unscheduled. It appears to be as safe or safer than acetaminophen and aspirin. In particular, kratom would be my first choice over the use of a narcotic preparation. It can not suppress respiratory status and so is unlikely to cause any permanent damage.\n\nAdditional information is needed, such as whether it is in breast milk or if it can be used during pregnancy. Research should be funded with superior grade product. As scientists who have studied it have pointed out, scheduling it will be a hindrance to further study.\n\nWhile I personally have not taken a prescription medicine in 11 years, if I needed to have a pain medicine available, I would prefer to have unhindered access to kratom in preference to acetaminophen or a narcotic.\n\nThank you for carefully considering my over 20 years of clinical experience.\n\nCynthia Jeanne Lee MD","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21891","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cynthia J Lee","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W\nHello, I am a 27 year old software engineer with two degrees in science from Washington state, and I am against making Kratom a Schedule 1 drug. I wanted to share my personal experience with Kratom. \n     I have suffered from chronic nerve pain and severe depression/anxiety for the last 9 years following an accident. I have been put on many different medications, including Zoloft, Xanax and painkillers like Oxycontin and Vicodin. I experienced many side effects from these drugs such as suicidal thoughts, worsening depression, constipation, loss of appetite and nausea. I was at the lowest point of my life, 4 years ago, when I was told by my therapist to give herbal remedies like Kratom a try. A ordered my first package a week later, made it into tea, and drank it. It took about an hour before I noticed it, and when I did it was very mild. So, you might be wondering, if it was so mild then why does it help so much? Well, I am not sure how to put into words the relief I felt. I had never felt more hopeful, lighter or more pain-free in my life.  It was the first time in 5 years I had felt like I wanted to be alive. And that is what will be taken away from me if this incredible plant is banned.

I absolutely OPPOSE kratom being added to the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.  It's not dangerous, it's a 100% natural substance, and it's changed my life in a positive, healthy way.\n\nI'm 40 years old, married, have three amazing children, Christian, and I'm a 10-year small business owner.  I routinely have to deal with tough decisions and \"putting out fires\".  Stress from this lifestyle can be numbing at times and make it tough to breathe or think, let-alone make decisions.  Years ago, headaches, sleeplessness, and real \"stress\" were taking over me.   I was borderline depressed and couldn't get out of it.  I was prescribed clonazepam and lorazepam for years, for anxiety and racing heart.  I medicated myself with alcohol from time to time, but we have alcoholism in the family and I didn't want to tempt the fates with this choice.  My uncle died of cirrhosis of the liver a couple years ago.\n\nI discovered kratom after looking up \"all natural anxiety remedy\".  I purchased a bag of kratom powder and within a week of taking a teaspoon or two a day I felt \"healthy\" and normal.  Stress was completely gone, and my overall mood was better.  I came home from work and played with the kids, and enjoyed life.  To this day I don't feel any depression.  I don't take my prescription meds anymore.  I drink alcohol very infrequently, and it's never to \"medicate\" myself from stress. \n\nToday, I take kratom every few days as a mood boost and to keep away stress - it works.  I don't feel \"high\" or \"wasted\" when I take it - I just feel normal.  If I felt \"addicted\" to kratom I would have stopped using it occasionally years ago, because I don't want to have to rely on any substance (legal or otherwise) to feel normal.  I have not had any temptation to use any illegal substances, and I am not relying on prescription meds for headaches or mood boosts.  If I stop taking it for weeks, I have absolutely no withdrawal symptoms, because it's purely natural.  After years of occasional use, there are absolutely no side effects.  Caffeine has far more side effects than this natural substance.  My wife's essential oils are more of an \"imminent\" health threat than my kratom.\n\nI've read enough about kratom's \"nightmare\" scenarios that the DEA has outlined (death, hospitalizations, addiction) to see that they involve other deadly, highly-addictive illegal, unnatural substances such as meth and heroin.  I've read an average of 110 kratom-related poison-control calls happen a year.  This is absolutely insignificant when you compare it to the TENS of thousands of poison-control calls concerning caffeine, essential oil, alcohol, and antihistamines that happen a year.  Hundreds of thousands or controlled medication calls happen a year.  Kratom has an average of 110 calls.  Kratom is an \"Imminent health threat\" - REALLY??\n\nGrouping kratom in with other schedule 1 controlled substances is not only the wrong thing to do, it's downright ridiculous.  While you're at it, put lettuce, vitamin C, and zinc on that list(!).  Kratom is natural, it's safe, and I've been taking it for years with no longterm effects.  \n\nActually I lied: the longterm effects involve me not having to take a lab-synthesized substance to keep my stress and headaches under control.\n\nI'd be happy to answer any questions you may have.  I am not a lobbyist, nor have I been in any direct communication with anyone from a kratom business.  I'm a normal business-owning family-guy who found a wonderful, natural substance that I use once in a while instead of prescription medications.\n\nKeep it legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1774","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gavin WIGG","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Personally, I'll be devastated if Kratom is banned/scheduled, as I've been a regular user for the past several years. I'm a 45 year old mother of 4 and I live in a prominent area in the North Shore of Chicago called Highland Park. Kratom tremendously relieves my early morning arthritis in my fingers, neck, and lower back, as well as helping my husband with his lower back pain for which he's receiving many X-ray's with the diagnosis that he's bone-on-bone in many areas and needs surgery. I even gave it to my daughter for a horrible toothache when nothing else would relieve it. I also use Kratom when I run out of coffee for the energy it provides. I have a prescription for Adderall and I have to say with 100% certainty that I prefer Kratom over the Adderall, simply because it provides the energy and focus but without the edginess that comes with Adderall. In all my years of using Kratom, I've never had a bad experience and I typically consume something well short of a teaspoon full several times a day. Never a problem with \"overdosing\" and I consider it so safe, that like I said before, I've treated my kids toothaches with it. \n\nKratom is very, very safe and beneficial. I have a few online vendors that I purchase it from and it's always been of high quality and safe to use.

Although I mention that only because it took me this long to formulate a response I felt adequate and to the point....and it may still fall short of explaining the importance of this issue to so many.\n   Understanding that our country faces an opioid epidemic, one may improperly assume that kratom would add to that issue, considering how it is being portrayed. I would argue that the opposite is true; it has shown to be a safer alternative to help people wean off of them. But let us realize that most of these addictions are not by choice. People are in pain, and seeking relief from their suffering. The over prescription of legal opiates got us into this mess, and kratom is one tool that can help us get out of it. I believe adults should have that decision, not the government. \n   While they have said not enough research has been done to prove it is safe, I would argue that not enough research has been done to show it is dangerous either, and as with all natural products, they should be innocent until proven guilty.\n   Addiction is nothing new, and opiate addiction has a long history in the world. We are not the first country to face an epidemic such as this, and surely not the last. Kratom has been used for centuries with no known deaths, regardless of what the media is portraying as true. The cases used to justify this declared 'war on kratom' are misleading, and all of these cases (a mere 15 as stated) can be attributed to a variety of substances in their systems. Kratom by itself has been shown to be safe, and for the millions who use it, very few adverse reactions have occurred; no more than many of the other supplements on the market. \n   As for my personal story; I was a carpenter for several years, until I suffered an extreme sciatic episode where I would not walk for some time. I could barely stand when I did do. As a working man in his 30's, I was devastated. I did not want to take prescription opiates knowing the dangers and addictive potential, so I began taking kratom. It was amazing. Not only did it help remove the pain, but it left me clear headed, and took away the anxiety, so I could still work, and felt functional. It was something I was grateful to have found, then a few years later, we are here in the situation of the federal government trying to interfere with yet another plant that people benefit from. Only this time. It could help us defeat one of the scourges of our society, opiate addiction.\n   The claims of no medical use are false, and while I could post the links and details here, I am quite sure that others have inundated the comments with these same statistics. In the end, all we can do is hope that our elected officials will do what is right, and allow people to freely use something they claim helps them. Some of these alkaloids in kratom have already been patented, such as speciofoline, back in the 1960's. They are well known to have therapeutic use, and the research goes way back. Traditionally it was taken by Thai farmers to promote longer work days, and relieve pain. The chances of an overdose as far as we know are none. The history speaks for itself.\n\n    In essence, if it is made illegal, and scheduled, there is little chance it will ever be taken off the list. Very few changes have been made to the schedule list, and it has kept us from researching very useful substances merely out of fear there 'may' be some danger to them.  \n   Let us move forward. We are asking that it NOT be placed in ANY of the schedule lists, but is treated like any other supplement, and allowed for people to consume as they please. It is not the kind of plant that attracts people just trying to get 'high', because it does not have that profile. It is very mild, and most youth have no interest in it. However, if it comes to that issue, I think many of us would have no problem making it available for those 18 and older. \nAll we are asking is that we have fair and legal access to this amazing plant. Without interference by the federal government, or any entity for that matter.\n\nThank you for your time,\nA concerned citizen-\nJoshua Orr\n \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17871","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Orr","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't use Kratom personally but i know people who do.

It has come to my attention that your agency has decided to ban the medicinal plant commonly known as kratom.  Before finalizing such a decision please consider the following. \n\n1.\tYou Chuck Rosenberg with a stroke of a pen make me Benjamin Lining a criminal. I served eight years in the United States Navy as an Intelligence Specialist and was honorably discharged in 2012 with the rank of Petty Officer First Class. I deployed twice to Helmand Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom with NMCB5. I am aghast that you would even consider the plant kratom on the same level as the highly refined opium derived drugs. \n\nAs I do not believe you can deploy to a war zone and not be changed as a person I am no exception. After leaving the Navy I began consuming small amounts of kratom leaves as needed for its antidepressant effects. I take no prescription drugs and have never sought a disability rating from the VA. \n\n2.\tYou Chuck Rosenberg with a stroke of a pen would make my wife who consumes kratom for fibromyalgia pain a criminal. As no known cure exists for fibromyalgia taking away a plant that helps her get through the day is beyond cruel. \n\n3.\tBanning the plant would stop scientific research into the effective use of the plant for recovery from opiate addiction. You would think that the DEA would be growing entire plantations of kratom trees and distributing the medicine by way the of the Hospital Corps and Marines to the opiate ravaged cities of Marjah and Kandahar (Afghanistan). That is if they truly cared about people.\n\n4.\tBanning the plant would unjustly target the ethnic groups who have the deepest understanding of the growth and preparation of the kratom plant medicine and who have used the plant medicinally for hundreds of years. Has the DEA not studied its own history?\n\nSir I will be expecting a public apology from you and your agency that such an unwise course of action was even considered. As an appointed official, you have a grave responsibility to the people of this nation. Tearing apart families and turning people into felons by way of policy dictates is unethical and immoral. Please make the right decision and leave kratom alone.\n\nRespectfully Submitted,\nBenjamin G.

I am a Former U.S. Marine and a Father of one.  \nI had only recently learned about Kratom through a news article.  I did extensive research online before trying this medicinal herb.  I prefer the use of natural medicinal herbs over Big Pharma, lab synthesized chemicals when possible.  Unfortunately, my Leukemia is so life threatening that treating it with something other than \"proven\" traditional Western chemotherapy agents is not an option.   I suffer from significant chronic pain everyday and many, many negative side effects from the chemo and other meds that I am currently taking.  My leg and arm pain, joint and bone pain are rather significant and constant.  I suffer from seriously decreased appetite, vomiting, nausea, fatigue and difficulty sleeping to name a few.  My life has changed significantly for the worse since the diagnosis and treatment of these two diseases.  These are not the only medical conditions I suffer from.  I used to run my own business for years and it was labor intensive work.  I had to give up my business two years ago and ultimately apply for disability.  However, since recently finding and trying Kratom I have found incredible, bordering on miraculous pain relief in addition to other benefits.  It is a mood increaser and anxiety reducer.  I have personally experienced these results. The pain reduction/elimination is absolutely amazing.  It allows me to function almost normally as a person without these conditions.  If you lived my life you would know how significant this medicinal herb is to me.  I have suffered with opiate addiction in the past and am currently dependant on doctor prescribed suboxone, which is also an opiate based pain management medication.  Since beginning Kratom I have been able to reduce my suboxone dosage with hopes of completely eliminating it from my medication regimen.  I have experienced pain reduction and some days complete elimination for hours and hours at a time, increased energy and stamina, better moods and more motivation to perform the tasks I need to complete in life.  This is all in stark contrast to my life before Kratom.  There are dangerous herbal ingredients included in \"energy drinks\" and other types available in health food stores as dietary supplements that are less studied, less regulated and more injurious potentially than Kratom that has been used in Southeast Asian cultures for literally thousands of years.  \nI beg you to reconsider scheduling Kratom as a schedule I drug.  This would be a mistake of epic proportions.  Further study of this herb is necessary and would almost definitely result in the development of possibly an entirely new class of pain meds for the public that is very different from opiate based pain meds which are obviously ruining peoples lives through addiction and crime to support that addiction.  I say this based on personal experiences.  If nothing else, Kratom does not belong on schedule I where no further research can be done regarding it and it flies in the face of millions of peoples real life examples of experiences that can testify to the real benefits of this amazing herb.  It is a life changer for me and millions of others.  Please do not force me back into the shadows of society, relegated to my couch, miserable, in pain, depressed and unable to participate in life.  Please reconsider your intentions and consider millions of peoples real world experiences.  Thank you.  Paul F.

I've struggled with addiction since a very young age, having grown up with a heavy alcoholic and neglectful father, I had no direction or role model growing up and from as young as 10, I had my first beer. By 14, I was smoking cannabis every day and soon after began experimenting with hallucinogens (mushrooms, Lsd, etc) and opiates. \n\nOPIATES got me. I didn't respect the power these drugs have. I thought I was just having fun when in reality I was filling a void left from a sense of disconnection from family, life and what seemed like everything. By the time I graduated high school, I had a love affair with opiates. Friends would bring pills to school and I'd always specifically take the opiates. I was totally naive to the ease of falling into opiate addiction.\nAnyway, I'll try to cut this short. It's been 2 years now since I've been clean from opiates. I was on methadone for also 2 years which I personally feel is worse than heroin. I never felt like I was really trying to be helped, they just wanted my money. It felt like the only difference was that now instead of getting the drug I need to function in society from a guy on the street, I got something more pure, potent and dangerous from a doctor. All in the name of \"recovery\". Suboxone is no better.\n\nI take kratom, at most three a day, sometimes twice. And, while yes I am mildly dependent on the leaf, i'd MUCH rather be drinking a cup of tea twice/thrice a day than having to shoot up heroin 4+ times a day or rely on a methadone clinic every morning, then being punished if I'm unable to make it to the clinic in time. All this so I can appear like a regular functional person. \n\nYou want to help people, right? People found something that works for them, it's not hurting anyone. If kratom was causing overdoses and manic behavior, you'd have no pushback from a community like ours. Kratom is LITERALLY saving lives. I personally know veterans that no longer take prescription opioids or have significantly reduced their use because of this wonderful leaf. My own mother no longer takes hydrocodone and says kratom provides her spinal injury better relief. With the VA scandals and all the wars, don't you think you've done enough to insult the men and women that protect your freedom? Keep kratom legal please. I LIKE working full time, I LIKE being able to help my mom pay bills since she works two jobs, I LIKE BEING A NORMAL, PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY. Please don't take that from me and over 3 million others just like me. I'm not a criminal and neither are the veterans using this leaf because your govt treatments have failed them. Please do the right thing, keep kratom legal. Listen to science for once.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4867","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jorge Eddie Valle","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Greetings! I am Joe Marty, and I am a 35-year-old Cyber Officer in the United States Army.\n\nI vehemently OPPOSE the DEA consideration of putting the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. I have never used kratom (or any illegal substances), and I rarely use OTC or prescription medication. \n\nHowever, listing the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as schedule 1 controlled substances will effectively criminalize the use of kratom to curb substance abuse and relieve pain. Limiting access to kratom will end up encouraging substance abuse and exacerbate addictions. If the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are identified as schedule 1 controlled substances, kratom will be used by pharmaceutical companies to extract these alkaloids to develop concentrated, expensive pain relief medication that users of kratom are likely to abuse. In its natural form, kratom has only relieved pain, addiction, and depression. Any negative events related to the ingestion of kratom were erroneously linked, and those events should be further examined as the actual cause of the negative effects/outcomes were not related to the use of kratom, but to other factors (e.g., prescription medications).\n\nThe DEA should allow kratom to remain freely accessible to all by NOT listing the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as schedule 1 controlled substances. To limit their access and effectively criminalizing the ingestion or possession of kratom would tacitly encourage substance abuse and prolong addiction and pain for the law-abiding citizens that currently enjoy relief from their suffering thanks to the natural effects of kratom.\n\nAllow the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine to remain accessible to all through the legal use of natural kratom. These alkaloids do NOT belong on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16021","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Marty","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a Godsend!\n\nPeople have used it for a very long time with no REAL known deaths.  The deaths the DEA claims are unsubstantiated and very likely related to other drugs in the person's system.\nThere truly is no known fatalities.  \nI used it to get myself off of Suboxone which, although a \"miracle drug for addiction\", is heavily misused by many of the people that it's prescribed to.  A friend would give me two 8/2 strips every week...just for the hell of it.  I never paid him, I wasn't a user of anything else aside from marijuana....I really never understood why he would give me them but after a few weeks of him pushing them on me I was definitely hooked and continued to expect them.  After two years, one day they stopped coming.  He disappeared.  I didn't know what else to do because treatment is so expensive.  \n\nI make around 25k a year managing a small diner.  I have epilepsy which prevents me from driving so opportunity is slim.  I work 40+ hours every week and take my work seriously.   When I realized my friend had disappeared I looked into treatment but the only option I could find would've cost me around $1500 a month.  I could not have afforded that.  I don't receive any assistance or help financially.  I'm proud to say I stand on my own.  A bill of $1500/month would have been impossible.\n\nI knew about kratom from highschool.  I came upon it while researching a health paper on dietary supplements and chose to do my paper on that specifically.  I figured I'd give it a shot and so I went down to the local headshop and bought some incredibly overpriced ground leaf.  That was last May.  I never felt any withdrawal and was able to go into work everyday and function to my fullest.  \n\nI used it everyday for about a month because I wasn't sure how long to expect withdrawal from Suboxone.  After that I put it down just to see if I could.  I had no problems!  Figuratively it was like a slide that you climb up while being addicted opioids, and ride down to sobriety with ease.\n\nI've continued to use it a 3-4 days a week with one week off a month ever since.  No problems.  The days I do use it, it basically helps me relax after work, some days I use it for  a boost of energy at work if I haven't slept well.  It's incredibly mild and provides different effects at different doses....You can't overdose though, you throw up WAY before.\n\nHeadshops are a business.  They ruin many good things with their marketing.  Online shops are responsible and don't push kratom as a legal high because it's not.  It's a supplement that helps with pain but also helps ease withdrawal from opioids.  We shouldn't all suffer because of irresponsible marketing done by a few bad seeds.\n\nI live in Manchester NH.  We experience this opioid epidemic just like any other city.  We may not be a BIG city but we have a BIG problem.  I think that to ban kratom is wrong.  Plain and simple.  But to ban it at this point in time is irresponsible, careless, and a dangerous decision.\n\nAnd that's just speaking for addicts who use it to transition to sobriety of which I know many.  Most people that use it don't actually struggle with addiction but instead are victims of pain and use it for its effective pain relieving properties.  It also doesn't hurt that it's non-addictive and completely natural!\n\nPlease, stop this madness.  People are coming around for marijuana which will soon be legal anyway and kratom is much milder than even that!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21093","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tim Tompkins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a US citizen over 18 years of age and I have been using Kratom for 6 months as a general wellness herbal supplement.

It has helped immensely in my life for controlling pain. I have been able to come 100% off of opiates for pain control which has improved my quality of life more than i can even explain I have also not had cortisone injections for almost a year and prior to Kratom i was getting the max amount per year for arthritis and cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Being in less pain has had a domino effect for me. I am able to work a full-time clerical job and my depression from almost constant pain has subsided greatly. \n\nI came across it about a year ago and decided to give it a try after much consideration. I was hesitant because i am not a drug user, I am a mother and I have a very busy life so I was afraid that it would have some sort of effect on me or make me \"high\" or feel sedated. I didn't feel any of that and have been able to keep it on hand for my flare-ups, anxiety and depression. I ask that you do not make this substance illegal as i never want to go back to feeling the way i did prior to Kratom. Keeping Kratom legal is something that i believe could benefit so many people in the U.S. and help with our nation's opiate problem that seems to be getting worse all the time. \nI have attached a link to an interesting article that touches on some of the very things i spoke about above.\n\ntopshelfkratom.com/the-current-state-of-kratom-research/\n\nWith respect, \nValeri Stafford","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20999","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Valeri Stafford","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Paul Esposito and Im a retired Navy Chief Cryptologic Technician with a total of 30 years of service. I have been rated by the Veterans Administration as permanently and totally disabled due to a degenerative lower back disease, bursitis of the shoulders, cyclothymic disorder (a nervous condition/mood disorder), and several other conditions. Pain and suffering has been a daily struggle for me, yet I've resisted the option to take prescription opiates as I was once badly addicted to oxycodone and never want to go back to that hellish addiction.\n\nSince discovering the all-natural herb Kratom, my life completely changed  for the better. Superior pain relief, with no discernible level of impairment (like when on opiates), no withdrawal symptoms noted with immediate cessation after taking 3-4 grams daily for several months, and none of the horrible, unwanted side-effects of the unnatural, inferior pharmaceuticals offered by the VA. Additionally, Kratom helped my depression and anxiety and restored my low energy levels caused by my VA prescriptions. In short, the coffee-like herb Kratom has proven to be the best herbal supplement Ive ever had.\n\nI dont understand the logic of isolating a couple of alkaloids of a plant then declaring those elements illegal as a way of banning something that grows naturally from the earth and has thousands of years of beneficial use. Im even further outraged when I hear the idea of developing those alkaloids into the next generation of pain medication which will no doubt be controlled as well. The dried leaves of this plant in their natural form, as grown from the earth are sufficiently effective and harmless.\n\nAdditionally, Kratom is most likely the single best natural alternative to battling the nation-wide opiate epidemic. Why would you want to ban that?! If Kratom in moved to Schedule 1, it would make people like me and many others who are simply trying to take responsibility for our own health care, felons. Why would anyone want to make me suffer and make me a felon for simply treating an ailment? Also, Schedule 1 would even bring further research to a grinding halt. The statistics have already shown a drastic rise in heroin use in states that have banned Kratom.\n\nIn the initial notice for an emergency Schedule 1 for Kratom, the phrase is used: necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety, I couldnt stop laughing! Seriously? Are all the ERs across the country overflowing with Kratom overdoses? No. Are there pushers on every street corner selling adulterated Kratom? No. People purchase their Kratom from reputable vendors that are regulated by market competition. The best vendors, with the best products, become well known while the less reputable ones fall to the wayside. All the Kratom users I know (its a strong community) are productive, responsible people, not druggies. Its unfair to place Kratom in the same category as heroin and LSD when its closest relative is the coffee plant.\n\nI have a few fair questions that are in no way rhetorical, I feel they merit an honest answer. Going back to the wording necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety, lets review some basic statistics from the CDC. Over 400,000 deaths a year are caused in the U.S. each year from cigarettes. (What medical use do cigarettes have? Or potential for abuse/addiction? Or imminent hazard to the public safety? Why are they not Schedule 1?). Additionally, alcohol kills at least 80,000 people in the U.S. a year. Again I ask the same questions: Accepted medical use? Potential for abuse/addiction? Imminent hazard to the public safety?\n\nNow lets compare that to Kratom. In all the research that Ive have done, how many deaths have ever even had the mention of Kratom? 50 people maybe? Total. Ever. Additionally, many of these cases show that other substances were involved, and is there even an existing LD50 for Kratom? Because I dont think its any more toxic than coffee.\n\nIn conclusion, PLEASE do not place this natural, life-saving plant in Schedule 1, and allow people the freedom to make their own educated health care decisions. I feel thats a basic human right.\n\nPaul A.

The pain was unbearable and affected my ability to do my schoolwork and other enjoyable activities. \n\nI went under the care of a neurologist shortly after the wreck. Many tests were performed on me, including MRIs, that showed the extent of the damage that I had suffered.

I took prescription pain pills for 6 years and believed that this was as good as it was going to get for me. \n\nThe worst thing about being in this wreck and developing these painful conditions was that they interfered, and often prevented, my ability to play with my children. My children mean everything to me, and not being able to go on a walk with them, or play with toys with them, or even sit up and watch a movie with them, was incredibly heartbreaking. It made me very depressed. I had a very bleak outlook in regards to the future.\n\nI began to look for other alternatives, besides prescription pain medicine, to help me live a normal life, or at least improve the quality of my life to the point that I could more good days than bad. I researched alternatives and discovered Kratom in 2014. \n\nI was skeptical that Kratom would be able to help because prescription pain medicine is very powerful. I wasn't sure that a natural plant, in its natural form, would be able to help me due to the extent and seriousness of my condition. I was also very nervous, as Kratom offered a possibility for a better future, but I did not want to get my hopes up too high. I just wanted to play with my children without being in a massive amount of pain or unable to sit up for any extended period of time.\n\nI was incredibly surprised, and very thankful, that Kratom worked for me. It helped reduce the daily head pain to a point where playing with my children or being at work was manageable. It took the edge off of the worst migraines that I would experience. It allowed me to, on most days, live and function an almost normal life. Best of all, it allowed me to do things like play soccer, baseball, and hide-and-seek with my kids.\n\nIf Kratom is scheduled and becomes unavailable, all of the improvements in my life will be lost. I will have to return to taking prescription pain medicine, which will bring back all of those negative side effects. I will lose the ability to play with my children and being able to enjoy watching them grow up. My children will lose the ability to play with their father. There is nothing that I would not do for my children, and Kratom assists with my pain levels in an effective manner, which allows me to teach and comfort them. It allows me to attend their school functions. It lets me sit up and read books to them, or let them read books to me. I treasure every moment that I get to spend with them, and if Kratom is banned then most of those moments will never occur again.\n\nKratom poses no threat to public health. My story is just one of the millions that could be told about the positive changes that Kratom provides. There is no reason that it should be scheduled. I completely oppose the scheduling of Kratom.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGerald Fowler","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21525","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gerald Fowler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The use of the Mitragyna Speciosa plant in the United States is not a threat to public safety.

I owe my life to Kratom for being the sole reason I was able to overcome opiate addiction and it took away the horrible withdrawal symptoms that narcotic painkillers create. On top of that, Kratom has treated my anhedonia; I can once again enjoy my life and everything I do is fun again.

Do not put any additional restrictions on its use. With the new recommendations for narcotics and other pain relief medications, chronic pain patients are being dropped by their providers, having medication taken away or being treated like criminals. Kratom offers chronic pain patients, veterans, and those with anxiety and depression a more natural option. Pain medication is being taken away from chronic pain patients without any other effective options being available or given. Kratom provides a safe option for people with pain who are being overlooked by our government and our healthcare system. I honestly believe more suicides will occur if Kratom is unavailable because people with chronic pain will run out, or feel like they have run out, of options. Kratom is safer than alcohol, which is still legal in every state. Alcohol has killed more people, the inebriated and innocent victims, in a given year than Kratom.

Kratom helps my pain.  I have also quit a daily drinking habit since starting Kratom.  I did not even try to quit - it just happened.  I never thought that I would quit alcohol so easily.\n\nIn addition to helping with my pain, Kratom supports a sense of well-being and enthusiasm.

Kratom supports the motivation to work and to enjoy working.\n\nThe first time using Kratom in October 2015, I was paying many of my bills online for the month within the first hour after taking it.

I am a 33 year old software architect/engineer with a BA in psychology and strong interests in biology, chemistry, and neuroscience.\n\nOne of the side effects of working on the computer all day is that -- regardless of how much care one puts in to ergonomics, stretching, proper exercise, and good working habits -- it eventually takes a toll on the body. I have been to a few physiotherapists, orthopedists, and related specialists, but have not come away with anything that alleviates the issues I've had with my neck. \n\nAside from the neck issues, I am in good physical and mental condition; this makes things all the more frustrating. My experience with standard medical care was less than satisfactory. Exercises and stretching help, but cant be used as spot fixes on days when things get really bad. Pharmaceuticals can work as spot fixes, but leave me feeling worse in the long run; they reduce my motivation, make me tired, and have unacceptably negative influences on my ability to think and remember things. That leaves me with a choice between being in pain but functional, or achieving temporary relief at the cost of job performance. This is not an acceptable trade-off. \n\nEnter Kratom. After doing a lot of reading, looking for some natural supplement that might help, I came across Kratom. The research on it is limited, but its been around long enough to guess at safety for personal use, and didnt appear to have any major negative effects. In short, it sounded like a lot of herbal or alternative medicine. Not a lot of evidence for effectiveness, but nothing too adverse, and plenty of positive  reports. \n\nThat was about 2 years ago. I've been taking Kratom for about 2 years now; about 8 months continuously the first time, followed by a break for about a year, and approaching 10 months this time.\n\nI find that Kratom has a positive effect on my well being. Kratom allows me to function better. Kratom results in less pain and more energy, without forcing me to sacrifice mental clarity or physical ability. While I hesitate to say that its exactly like coffee, I would suggest that its effectiveness, tolerance, usage, and experience quitting is pretty similar. Its kind of a calmer version of the first cup of coffee for the day. I just feel better generally; the pain in my neck fades out of the picture and I can proceed through my day normally. \n\nIf I forget to take it, or skip it that day, I feel about the same as if I skipped my coffee. If I stop taking it, it feels exactly the opposite of quitting coffee; instead of being groggy for a few days, I have trouble sleeping for a few days. \n\nWhile I do believe that regulating Kratom in a very general way -- namely with an age limit -- would be wise, any measures beyond that are liable to have a significant negative impact on the well-being of millions of people who use it as an alternative to heavy-duty pharmaceuticals in dealing with mild-to-moderate pain and general malaise.\n\n\nTo state things clearly, though somewhat less personally:\n\nI believe that Kratom should be regulated as a supplement, available to those 21 and up, and with no additional restrictions. \n\n\nKratom has been around for quite some time with limited negative consequences. Millions of Kratom users represent only a small fraction of emergency room visits or poison control calls, and there is an  apparent lack of mortality in sum total when considering incidents involving Kratom alone (non poly-drug). A large body of anecdotal data suggesting that Kratom can, and has, been used to successfully transition off of opiates (either completely, or to less dangerous compounds). There are many current Kratom users, some like myself, who take it in place of powerful pharmaceuticals with severe adverse effect profiles, to generally improve their quality of life. And, there is a great deal of research interest in Kratom currently (at least two papers published in the last 6-8 months, along with a patent based on a compound derived from a modified component of Kratom) that would likely suffer a chilling effect as a result of more stringent regulation.\n\nWhile Kratom may not be entirely without downsides, it appears it has much more in common with herbal supplements than with pharmaceutical drugs. Things like Coffee, Cats Claw, Ashwaghanda, Bacopa, St. Johns Wort, Kava, various forms of Tea& all have both positive effects, and potential negative effects on the same order of those exhibited by Kratom, and all are expected to be remain legal for the foreseeable future. Please make the correct decision, and group Kratom in with its herbal supplement kin.\n\nPlease consider my comments, and the thousands of others made on the topic of Kratom during the review period in making your decisions about the fate of this plant, and, more importantly, about the potential fates of the millions of people who use it in pursuit of improved well-being.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18538","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Davids","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern,\n\nI am writing in regards to the recent news I have received that Kratom may at some point become illegal for the possibility it may be considered a drug. I am a mother of  2, a business owner and also am currently in a Graduate degree program at a University in California. I began taking Kratom about 3 years ago to deal with an anxiety disorder that I did not want to take traditional pharmaceuticals for. I do not drink, smoke or take any drugs of any sort so choosing to try Kratom was a very well researched decision I made. I honestly do not know what I would do without it. It helps minimize my completely debillatating anxiety. I get zero effects of anything feeling like a \"drug\" so for Kratom to be classified as such and taken away from honest people like myself leaves me feeling extremely frustrated and hopeless. I have done extensive research (as that is what Graduate students do) and have found not only has Kratom been used by many other countries for thousands of years but there has been little to NO documented long term side effect from consumption of this leaf. I live in California where marijuana just got legalized, and that is used for medicinal purposes but also for recreational use. Kratom only offers me relief from this awful anxiety condition however it is being considered illegal?  I am asking you to reconsider your decision and to please not put Kratom in the same category as Heroin...or any other drug for that matter. It is a leaf that helps so many people for so many different reasons and should be legal and avilable as an alternative to pharmaceutical drugs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13130","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rosie Fiore","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13781","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Maciel","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Joshua Reid. I'm an Afghan War veteran who is now a full time student at the University of Connecticut and I also work for time for an aerospace company. I'm not going to waste time by repeating what has already been said in the previous comments before this one, so I'll just settle down the points I want to make. \n\n-Kratom helps me with my mild case of PTSD and helps relieve the pain of service related injuries that I got during my time in the army. I prefer Kratom rather than taking opiate based pain medication and muscle relaxers because Kratom doesn't give me any adverse effects and it is safe. Opiate based pain medication is dangerous because as you know it slows the individuals breathing which is what causes people to overdose.I find Kratom to be a safe alternative to these prescribed pain meds that claim many people's lives.\n\n-A common misconception is that Kratom is an opiate. It is not an opiate; it is a stimulant and has stimulant effects that give me an uplifting boost in energy and mood similar to a cup of coffee. I find it helps me maintain throughout my busy and productive schedule.\n\n-The last point I want to touch on is that this plant from what I've seen an heard helps many people deal with cutting their addictions to opiates. I believe banning this plant will increase the opiate epidemic in this country, and you will see many people die or ruin their lives again because they will have to go onto some sort of methadone treatment or will just go back to hard street drugs. I believe making this plant known will help addicts out there who haven't heard of Kratom and will get them clean. This plant I believe can be the solution to the opiate epidemic. \n\nThis is all I have to say, although I can go on a lot more about this issue. Please don't ban this harmless plant that has helped so many people reclaim their lives and deal with their mental and physical pain. \n\nRespectfully,\n  Joshua Reid","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7057","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Reid","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\nI use kratom on a fairly regular basis.

My blood work returned to normal after a time and most importantly I get the pain relief I desperately need but a clear head to take care of my children.. something prescription meds had also taken away from me.\n\nI'm part of several online groups for my disabilities including Fibromyalgia and EDS (Ehlers Downlos Syndrome) and I am  just one of DOZENS perhaps hundreds of women (and men!) who have been able to replace their dangerous opiates with the natural pain relief of Kratom. So many successful stories, so many Doctors who give their approval! I only wish I could express how DEVESTATING this will be for the countless number of us who depend on this natural remedy to get through our daily life without the crippling pain of our various medical issues.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5995","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tammy Wood","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do more researching before banning another plant in this country.

I have been a small business owner since 2011 and prior to that, I've held executive and management positions in the Gaming industry in Southern Nevada.  I am a responsible and productive member of society and do not have a criminal record of any kind.  \n\nI am writing to oppose the DEA's desire to place Kratom as a Schedule 1 controlled substance.  \n\nI have chronic and daily pain as a result of a lower back injury many years ago, which has progressed throughout the years, including Sciatica.   I had spent years on prescription and over the counter medications to cope with the pain.  \n\nRealizing this was not a good long term strategy, I began searching for an alternative, non chemical solution when I discovered Kratom.\n\nI began using Kratom in early 2014 and it has changed my life tremendously for the better.  Since that time, I no longer have any need for prescription or over the counter medication to alleviate my pain.  I take it on a daily basis throughout the day and every day and have experienced no side effects, other than mild constipation from time to time, which can be easily counteracted with a little Metamucil or additional natural fiber intake.\n\nKratom does not make me high, intoxicated or loopy.  My experience is that it has a very mild stimulant  effect, similar to that of Coffee.  Nothing more, nothing less and it is very effective at relieving pain in a natural way.\n\nThe DEA has cited Kratom as posing \"an imminent hazard to public safety, by claiming that \"660 calls had been made to poison control centers about the substance over a five-year period.\"  \n\nI would like you to consider the disparity when comparing the mere 660 calls about Kratom to poison control centers over a five-year period of time with the 49,891 cases of laundry soap pod poisoning to children just 5 years old and younger.  Please keep in mind, there was not quite 5 years worth of data on the soap pods as they were introduced to the market sometime in 2012 and we are only part way through 2016.  www.aapcc.org/alerts/laundry-detergent-packets/\n\nThe DEA has also cited 15 Kratom related deaths since 2014.  It has been documented that 14 of these 15 deaths all had other drugs or illegal substances in their systems at the time.  This should also be contrasted with the 88,000 deaths annually associated to alcohol use alone.  \n\nFurther, there were 28,000 deaths associated with Heroin and Opioid painkillers just in 2014.  www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/10/12/497697627/kratom-gets-reprieve-from-drug-enforcement-administration\n\nOpioid's are a controlled and tightly regulated substance and there are many deaths each year from people who mis-use it.  Anything has the potential to be abused but the data just doesn't support that with Kratom, not by a long shot.  The DEA has presented no evidence to support that people can abuse Kratom by overdosing or dying  from it alone.  This hardly appears to pose an imminent risk to public safety.\n\nWhen I first learned of the DEA's intent to schedule Kratom, I honestly thought it was a joke.  I couldn't believe or understand why the DEA would want to ban something so harmless that is benefiting millions of people, especially something that could help reduce or even eliminate Opioid related deaths. \n\nI do not believe that Kratom should be banned for these reasons and more and I do not believe Kratom poses even a mild risk to the general public.  \n\nKratom has benefited me immensely and it would be a tragedy for me and so many others who have benefited from this wonderful, God made plant.\n   \nMaking Kratom a Schedule 1 substance would cause this wonderful plant to be put on a shelf and never to be seen or heard from again and would halt further research.  \n\nThe DEA has failed to put out anything even remotely close to a legitimate argument as to why this poses an imminent risk to public safety or to present a valid case for wanting to schedule this substance.  \n\nThis lack of evidence and poor judgment displayed by the DEA on behalf of the public has already and will only further lead to speculation by the public on the DEA's motives for the ban.  \n\nThis is frustrating and upsetting as the DEA's potential scheduling will affect me and so many others in a deeply personal way and clearly doesn't appear to have the public's best interest at heart.\n\nThank you for taking my comments into consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1902","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Maiella","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I live in a relatively small town, with some even smaller communities surrounding me.

The environment itself does not allow any drug or alcohol consumption on the premises nor does it allow anyone under any substance to partake in drinking teas at their bar. Besides Kratom they sell Kava and regular teas such as white teas and green teas. In the beginning, this place was nothing but a hangout, an atmosphere. Not because of the beverage itself, it did not make me high in any way. I just felt relaxed and there were video games, movies, a pool table and some ping pong. My partner and I spent the day sipping on tea and playing ping pong. \n\nWithin this same year I finally got my diagnosis for multiple sclerosis. I had already been living with the symptoms for six months (prior to any Kratom consumption) but it took a chain of doctors and testing to get it diagnosed. The pain in my feet was unbearable. As if I had been working a 10 hour shift on my feet. Weird, since I have been unemployed for over a year. The numbness in my hands made it impossible to feel temperatures or even textures.\n\nI went back to the tea bar to see if Kratom would relieve my symptoms. I had not come back since that first time because I did not CRAVE the substance. It was just something to drink, the same way I would my morning tea. That relaxed feeling I had felt the first time came back. The pain in my feet disappeared, as if I was walking on clouds. I felt a new sort of numbness. One that canceled out ACTUAL numbness and allowed me to feel temperatures and textures again.\n\nAlthough it relieves my symptoms, I don't go often. I don't even brew it at home. I don't feel a craving for it and I don't feel like I need it to feel better all the time. It's just nice to know that it's there for the enjoyment of a good day.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20291","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Catalina Bedoya","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"When I was 15 I decided to try and experiment  with my ADD medicine.

The disc above and below the fusion we're now carrying the full burden of my neck. At that point I started to take Tramadol and other opiate like pain relievers. I am not keen on taking pain medicines so I tried other alternative methods like nerve blocks. Anyone familiar with those know they're very scary and can actually lead to more damage.

The tea if taken in too large a quantity only forces you to vomit, and it certainly is not capable of providing the urge that leads to abuse, it just doesn't give a high, at all. Those who claim it does are either a very very minor few, making it up, or are taking tampered Kratom. Please provide documented evidence of a serious addiction epidemic of pure Kratom, like that of opiates, meth, or heroin.\n\nThere is current research being done to prove Kratom's usefulness, many doctors and ordinary people who use the supplement, attest to its value as an analgesic and anti-depressant, not forgetting a natural remedy in getting off of opioids without the debilitating withdrawals. Why on earth do we want to put Kratom on schedule 1, or any schedule for that matter? because of a handful of people who ingested adulterated Kratom over the course of several years? Is this really good science? a few calls from the cdc? Calls that also came in were toddlers ingesting laundry pods, or people who felt they may have taken too much tylenol.  Do we ban everything? \n\nPeople, since the beginning of time, have looked for ways to enhance their mood (not sure why this is a bad thing) and people will never stop at finding ways to do so, even via a cup of coffee (a stimulant). Remove Kratom (which makes for a terrible recreational drug), and there will always be something vastly more dangerous waiting in line.\n\nKratom has enabled millions of people to carry on with normal productive lives after having little to no success with prescribed drugs.  I myself have suffered from injuries, joint pain, and depression with years of trial and error with prescribed medication that only ended up making things worse or adding to the problems with side effects.  When I was recommended this plant (by a herbalist three years ago) that like a camomile tea, i could make this into a tea, and it can help with pain and depression - it is NOT a cure.  Since taking this plant, i have been able to work, take care of my son and participate in all the activities i once enjoyed including exercising.   I am an ordinary productive person with a professional tech career, a degree, and a family. I am 45 years old. My 74 year old father, a retired engineer, has also tried Kratom and finds it helps with his leg pain and prefers to take the Kratom over the hydrocodone since he does not like taking acetaminophen.\n\nBy banning Kratom, it only expands the war on drugs and mass incarceration. Which will only be worsened by the fact that both sides of our borders, Mexico and Canada, have no restrictions on Kratom. By banning Kratom, it is government overreach and a government agency is restricting individual liberty just because it feels like it; it's also an issue of states' rights. Not to mention a terrible misuse of taxpayer money.\nI request your support in a fair review of this plant before any final decision is made as regards to its benefits and subsequent banning, and thus ruin the lives of so many it has helped.  Please instead consider regulation and better labeling as with other supplements. \nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSupporting Information:\n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2016/09/28/top-kratom-researcher-discusses-potential-medical-use-in-opioid-withdrawal/#4a20bbaa265b\n\nhttp://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-23/45-congressmen-ask-dea-not-to-ban-kratom-next-week?src=usn_tw\n\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/2109087-kratom-ban-rethink-is-a-hint-of-sanity-in-failed-us-war-on-drugs/\n\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2016/09/08/kratom-ban-hinders-research/\n\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b00360","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6160","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephanie S","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped with my anxiety, depression, and motivation in a way that I could never believe would be possible with the help of a naturally occurring botanical.

These guys use kratom and seem normal, never exhibiting signs of addiction or other similar problems. I personally have not ever taken kratom, as I don't feel I have a need for it.

I'm a mother who's 42 years old. I've battled addiction with pain pills for over 20 years. It started innocently with a doctors appointment for severe menstrual pain. The pills the doctor gave me completely turned my world upside down! I was addicted in a very short period of time. I have tried quitting so many times. Finally I went on suboxone for two years. I gained 40 pounds and the swelling in my lower legs and ankles made me a prisoner in my own home, not to mention the fog I was in. I was here with my kids but I was a million miles away :(  I finally decided to get off of the subs. Ten days off I was still dealing with withdrawals. I knew I couldn't go that path again on Suboxone. I wasn't living my life. I finally found Kratom and it has taken all of the withdrawals away. If it wasn't for kratom I'd have been back looking for pain pills or worse. This plant may not be the miracle cure for people like me but it dang sure beats pills or suboxone!! My two daughters have their mom back finally after two years of subs.

The Doctors prescribed me painkillers and anti-inflation meds, I felt myself becoming addicted to these meds so I stopped taking them.

My current profession is as a federal correctional sergeant has me working a grueling schedule, Kratom helps me get me through my days. I don't understand why the DEA has tried to put Kratom as a schedule 1 drug when it clearly has many health benefits, where as cocaine, methanphanmines and heroin are all schedule 2 and lower and have NO health benefits. I am a responsible adult that makes good decisions and I feel that putting Kratom as a scheduled drug with no benefits is a mistake. I use Kratom as responsible as possible. I hope the DEA seriously reconsiders placing this wonder plant as a scheduled drug. Thank you for taking the time to read this, have a good day.\nSteven A.

I oppose any restrictions on the use or distribution of Kratom or any of its alkaloids as it relates to the DEA or any governmental regulatory agency. I began using Kratom in August of 2015. I have used it almost daily since then, avoiding any withdrawal on the days I do not take it. I also, do not feel cravings or have any addiction symptoms on the days I do not take the kratom. Not only has it helped me to completely eliminate the use of any drugs both prescribed and otherwise, I have also witnessed it's positive impact in the lives of several close friends, many of whom have battled the use/abuse of opiates and other drugs for many years. It has helped many of these people restore normalcy and break the cycle of addiction in their lives. These people are restoring broken relationships with family and friends, attaining and maintaining employment and just enjoying a much higher quality of life in general. These things previously were not available to them when addicted or even when trying to manage addiction with the use of medical alternatives such as Suboxone or Methadone. Also, friends and family that were taking pain pills, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medications among many other medications for many different ailments, have been able to completely cease the use of the pharmaceuticals by turning to this very natural substance. I have had many friends and family members try kratom without any ill effects and nobody that I have ever given kratom to has ever died. When it comes to the deaths associated with kratom, I urge you to look further into the cause of these deaths and investigate whether the combination of drugs in their system or any other environmental factors had contributed to their deaths. In closing, any ban or restriction on the sale, purchase or distribution of Kratom or its alkaloids would adversely affect the lives of myself and many of my close friends and countless others who are using it without any ill-effects to better their lives.

I could actually start to build real relationships with people which was something i had struggled with for my whole life. so 6 months goes by and everything is fine and i actually start to enjoy life and i got a girlfriend as well. then hell began. one day i ran out of my xanax and didn't really feel like i needed it anymore anyway so i just stopped taking it and within 24 hours i had a seizure. i was in tremendous pain and nothing but xanax helped me until i found kratom. one of my friends who had problems with opiates used kratom to ween off and i figured i would do the same and to my surprise, it actually helped tremendously. i was finally able to live life again without taking more benzos. i could go to class and talk to people without feeling like i was going to have a panic attack. eventually i stopped taking kratom and did not require any other drug or substance afterward to help with the xanax withdrawal, it just went away from the magic that is kratom. i personally do not use it anymore but I truly believe that kratom has the ability to save lives because it saved mine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14127","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"jakob haroldson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't need or use kratom, but many people seriously need it for their health and well-being, and it seems to be far less\ndangerous than many other drugs...

My name is Patrick Mulhern, I am 20 years old, and I am a student at the University of Vermont. Although I have personally never tried kratom, it is apparent that this plant may help people recover from opiate addiction. School of Pharmacy faculty member Christopher R. McCurdy is one researcher of many who is studying the effects of kratom on opiate addiction. During one of McCurdy's mice studies, he and his team \"...isolated the plants most abundant alkaloid, mitragynine, and tested the pure compound.\" After studying the effects of mitragynine on mice, \"Results indicate this compounds activity is superior to methadone in the mouse withdrawal assay and that carefully created chemical variations may provide an alternative to methadone in treating addictions to opiates.\" Following the experiment, McCurdy also noted that Mitragynine completely blocked all withdrawal symptoms and could provide a remarkable step-down-like treatment for people addicted to hardcore narcotics such as morphine, oxycodone or heroin. The compound has been known for years, but were working to come up with an improved synthetic analog or a better formulation of the tea for testing in humans. \nGiven that opiate addiction is rampant in our country due to the over prescription of opiates for ailments such as pain, this plant has the potential to aid our country towards an opiate free path. I hope that as the plant is researched, many other uses for the plant will be discovered. Therefore, it is pertinent to keep this plant legal in order to research its affects instead of making the short sighted decision to categorize the plants alkaloids as Schedule I before its composition is even studied. If the plant and its alkaloids is banned after being found to not have therapeutic effects on humans, then at least an educated decision is being made rather than the plant being banned out of an act of fear and ignorance. It is my hope that the DEA approaches this plant with an open mind and allow academia to make a decision of whether or not the plant is beneficial for human beings.\n\nWorks Cited\n@OleMissRebels. \"New Hope for Addicts - Ole Miss News.\" Ole Miss News.

I have had depression, anxiety, abuse in my life sexual and otherwise. I have struggled with abusing substances yet never crossing that fine line into full blown addiction. I have lyme disease and chronic pain from an injury. I have had a back surgery at 18, and Lyme brings on a whole list of horrible symptoms - none of these things have been helped by prescription medication. Not the depression, the panic attacks, the pain, the ptsd, the fatigue, the insomnia, the lack of motivation. When I found kratom, suddenly all these symptoms went away, or were finally manageable. I had been on pain killers this last time for about a year. From vicodin, to percocet,  to oxycontin and finally when I decided I was done, methadone. I can't begin to explain how awful the withdrawal was - even with careful tapering with the help of a doctor. For a month and a few days I was miserable and thought it would never end. I couldn't take care of my kids. I was done. A friend shared some kratom with me and within 10 or 15 minutes of taking it, I was back. I was normal. I was out riding a scooter with my kids and playing in the sun. I cried and my kids just looked at me like they finally had their mommy back. My kids need me. They need me and without kratom we will all suffer. I am not addicted to kratom. It has never giving me any negative effects aside from a belly ache because I didn't drink enough water. Kratom is safe, and has never harmed a soul. Without it people will go back to deadly pills, or they will be in agony from chronic pain and chronic illness. Or, they will die. I have personally experienced people saying they will end it there. We can not deny people their right to natural and safe plants.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1723","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nicolle Hess","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am not a person that uses this to get off of any other type of drug.

The DEA has more than enough work to do on well established harmful illicit drugs such as meth, crack,etc. As a citizen and taxpayer I want the DEA to stick to it's primary function. The rates of substance abuse and distribution and sales are not under control. Put your efforts into these issues.

This as well as various triptans ( or ergotamines if I couldn't afford the triptans ) during migraines.\n\nCURRENTLY  I only take 120 mgs of Armour Thyroid and 3-5 gms of Kratom as a powdered leaf.\n\n I suffer from a chronic illness related to multiple sclerosis. Officially described as HHV6 of the CNS. Not only is the virus active but it's caused an autoimmune response. I've had it since 2003 and it is both painful and debilitating and has caused me great anguish.\nI've been treated with Valcyte to reduce the viral load and Rituxan to mediate the autoimmune response. My current physician is Andreas Kogelnik, MD and infectious disease specialist who practices in Mountain View California.\n\n Because of my illness I have had to take pain relieving drugs for many years and struggle with the usual host of symptoms associated with their use.\n At one point I was taking OxyContin 10mg 2xd, but because of the need to increase the dose and how incredibly addictive I'd heard the drug was I discontinued its use. To replace it,  are used tramadol and gabapentin along with various other over-the-counter analgesics such as ibuprofen, naproxen sodium and others. For the migraines are associated with my disease, I used a variety of triptans and ergot based drugs. Also many preventative drugs, calcium channel blockers, Topamax etc were tried. Along with Excedrin which is oddly the one drug that's proved somewhat effective in aborting the migraine after onset.\nAll the drugs that I used were prescribed by various neurologists and rheumatologists etc, and I used them according to directions and never abused them.\n With constant pain from the disease as well as up to 15 migraines a month, the drugs barely kept me functioning at a very minimal level.\nOne of my physicians, the now deceased  Harvey Caplan, M.D., suggested that I try various herbal drugs since the pharmaceutical drugs I was using we're not working very well.\nI tried various marijuana preparations and unfortunately they made my migraines worse. Then a very good friend ( a Rheumatiod arthritis sufferer) suggested Kratom. After several months I purchased some and tried it another several months later.\nI'll try to shorten this as much as I can but the bottom line was until I found kratom my life was a living hell. My migraines are currently down to about 3 a month. Still severe but because of the relatively short duration they are bearable. My mobility is about 50% increased from its pre Kratom level. I can walk without assistance and no longer use a crutch or cane. I wish I could say Kratom cured me. Of course, this is not the case. But it has increased my quality of life tremendously. Although I know that the statement from one person can be viewed as anecdotal, I have heard similar stories from many people. My only regret is that it took me so long to find something that has helped me as much as Kratom leaves have.\nPlease enter my statement into your record and feel free to contact me at any time regarding my experience with Kratom.\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nBarbara Brodsky\nbarbaralyn.brodsky@gmail.com","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20121","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Barbara Brodsky","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The scheduling of drugs in intended to restrict only those drugs which are actively identified as purely harmful with no redeeming medicinal properties. In the case of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, components of kratom, the benefits are discernable and obvious from examination of its medical effects among current domestic users as well as users abroad. As other countries have already acknowledged its beneficial properties and allow the usage of kratom, it is reasonable and appropriate to allow US citizens access to the benefits of it.\n\nWhile it is possible to abuse almost any substance, that only argues for rational use, but not a complete ban. Even caffeine in coffee has hospitalized individuals who have gone to extremes with it, yet coffee remains a favorite among Americans and people the world over.\n\nThat kratom has not resulted in significant problems and has provided  significant medical benefit, specifically managing pain and assisting in withdrawal from opioids (opioid addiction being a significant problem in the US requiring more solutions, not fewer) indicates that the continued availability of kratom  be maintained.\n\nPlease do not criminalize components of a natural herb that can continue to be of such great benefit to many, many Americans dealing with chronic pain or opioid withdrawal.\n\nFurther, I recommend a review of the current scheduling of other materials to determine of there is actually reason to maintain them under their current schedules or if their scheduling be relaxed and that this review be performed periodically on all currently scheduled materials to be sure that all current medical information be applied in making medically valuable materials available to American patients for treating their medical conditions.\n\nThank you.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0017","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Peter Makus","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am commenting anonymously because it should not matter who I am when making a decision as to whether kratom should be illegal or not. I am a 22 year old male in my senior year of college. I started using kratom around January of 2016. I used to be a huge marijuana smoker and in the state I live, it is not legal for recreational use. Last winter, I made the choice to stop with my use of marijuana due to the legality of it. I didn't feel like the risk of smoking was worth it anymore. I turned to kratom because it was a legal, safe alternative. I know these two drugs are polar opposites, but kratom helped me stop using marijuana. However, that is not the reason I chose to continue with my use. Kratom not only boosted my mood, but allowed me to focus more on my classes. When using kratom, it feels like you have a nice security blanket on. It doesn't hinder your thinking process like other drugs do, which allowed me to continue my work even when I was enjoying its effect. When the summer came around, and I had no more class to worry about, I stopped using kratom entirely because I had no more use for it. Now that I am in the middle of a new semester, I have started using kratom again. It relieves my stress and keeps me focused. Kratom is the only drug I use. I'm not a crazy party goer. I just enjoy the effects of kratom and believe it is an enhancement to my life currently. The majority of people in our prison systems today are in on drug related charges. So much of our tax dollars are going into paying to keep drugs off the street. There is no need to make kratom into just another street drug. The thing that really confuses me most about making kratom illegal is the fact that it helps people who are addicted to harmful opiates like heroin. Heroin is on the rise in the US. Everyday I hear on the news about the heroin epidemic. If kratom has the ability to help these people and reduce heroin use, then why would we make it illegal? It simply doesn't make sense to me. just by doing a google search, hundreds of success stories about opiate users turning to kratom can be found. I am an advocate for kratom. That shouldn't make me a criminal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6349","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Don't Place Kratom as a Schedule 1 Drug.

During these five years, I have had a few experiences that I would like to share here and which seem pertinent to this inquiry that the DEA is performing (for which I am very appreciative.)\nFirstly, I would like to speak on behalf of the hundreds of individuals who we have had the pleasure of serving (we offer and sell many other herbs in addition to Kratom, but of course for this issue I'm referring to Kratom.) The benefits that have been reported from our customers have been profound and varied - such as reduced dependence on dangerous and addictive opiate pain drugs, effective pain relief without addiction, reduced use of (again addictive and dangerous) alcohol and other recreational drugs, and relief from debilitating symptoms of anxiety and depression. I can not overstate the joy and relief that has been expressed to us through the years as people have discovered the ways that Kratom has benefitted their life. \nSecondly, closer to home, I have seen firsthand the great benefit that Kratom has brought into my wife's life for relieving extremely painful period cramps. Far beyond the relief found from any OTC pain reliever, Kratom has allowed her to be productive and find peace on days which would otherwise be lost to her cramps. \nLastly, on a personal level, I have found Kratom incredibly helpful during a bout with an ear infection which was extremely painful and during a couple moderate injuries that I sustained while rock climbing. Powerfully effective with NO side effects and no feeling of dependency afterward. I feel like this point is important to dwell on: there have been times when I have used Kratom daily for months at a time - and after these times I was able to stop using Kratom without any trouble. (I have had more trouble stopping coffee at times in the past!) \n\nI think that there's an important distinction around the addiction issue that I haven't seen expressed often (if ever). The people I have seen struggle with stopping Kratom were using it to wean off of opiates. We would never suggest that someone do this, but I do feel that Kratom, which has an incredible safety profile, is a far better option than the opiate family which kills ~40,000 American individuals per year! From my vantage point of having seen many hundreds of people try Kratom for various reasons,the only addiction that I've seen is addiction based on months or years of opiate use - and after using Kratom for weeks or months, the addiction has reduced but remains present to a more manageable extent. Of course addiction is often a multifaceted issue which requires attention beyond the physical addiction, but offering people a safe alternative from deadly substances while a person finds their way through the challenging waters of addiction seems like a great idea. \n\nFrom my years of experience - both personal and related from our many customers - the question of efficacy is certain. This is an amazing plant from God's green earth which has the potential to bring relief for many  people on many fronts. \nRegarding the issue of safety, I understand that there have been a number of people who have used Kratom and died. I also understand from reading about these cases that most deaths involved other substances, so to call Kratom the cause is not necessarily accurate. This question could certainly use more inquiry, but deeming it a threat to humanity, when it has already helped so many individuals escape the clutches of a truly deadly class of chemicals is, I think, doing far more harm than good (i hope the point of harm versus benefit will be thoroughly examined in this process!)\nAnd regarding the addiction question, I think it's more complex than how it's often looked at. By far most people who have used Kratom as non opiate-users have found it to be nonaddictive or on par with coffee. If someone is using it to wean off of opiates, it's not the Kratom which has caused the addiction. Kratom has just helped the individual find safer ground on which the healing can begin. \n\nI hope that this comment process will open the eyes and minds of the honorable DEA administrator to the many reasons why Kratom should remain available to the public for the foreseeable future. The opitae epidemic needs this, and the responsible public is benefitting greatly from this herb. \nMany thanks.

Please do not ban kratom, it is certainly not the same as heroin! I have been using kratom for about a year now. I wish I would have found it sooner! I first heard about kratom from a random stranger at the airport who I opened up to about my opiate addiction with. I tend to tell people to much, in this case it was a cry for help. I was addicted to opiates and couldn't get away. When you have an addiction like that it very quickly causes you to turn into someone you never thought you'd be. Someone you can't stand! You start out innocently trying to take the edge off pain and the Dr prescribes you opiates. What they don't prepare you for is that your body will quickly become used to the dosage your taking and will require more and more pills to even touch the pain. If you try to stop, the pain is worse then what you originally went to the Dr for. You are now stuck! I was abusing over 160 mg a day of narcotics! With kratom I was able to suffer very minimal withdrawals pains. It was a miracle! I was able to completely get off the opiates and gain control of my life back to become \"me\" again! A plus is that it helps my pain greatly and I am able to function. It does not give you a \"high\" like opiates. It is safe! What happens if you overdose on opiates? Death can occur! Especially since people up their dose and make opiate cocktails so they won't get sick. What happens if you take to much kratom? You puke! It is not the same as heroin at all. I guarantee you can't pick the people out of a crowd and point out who is using kratom and who is not based on their actions. You can however point out someone who has just injected heroin. Kratom also does not require you to keep upping the dose. You find what works for you and it will forever help you function at that same dose. It is tangible help for those who were like me or those who are in pain instead of starting narcotics! Please don't make this about more money for the pharmacy. Kratom is something even people of low incomes can have access to in a legal manner and without insurance.  Please keep kratom legal and stop so many people from abusing far worse substances!

I researched an herbal product that might help me cope with the relentless emotional trauma. Once I found Kratom, I was able to continue working, paying my bills, going to the gym, participating as a drummer in two musical ensembles, supporting my husband's fire department and Masonic organization, and volunteering at a local nursing home (I do a weekly Storytime for Seniors). I approach the days tasks with a clear mind, hope in my soul, and a sense of purpose. Kratom has helped me face life without my dad.\n\nThe Kratom community is composed of many people, including those who suffer from chronic pain, depression, and anxiety. Were from all age groups, all walks of life, and hold down responsibilities for which family and employers depend upon us.

Doctors want to give me opiates, but I refuse to take them. I watched my mother suffer from an opiate addiction for 7 years that destroyed my family (literally -- my parents are now divorced and there are many extended family members who will not speak to my immediate family members any more) and nearly cost her life. She has recovered now, but that experience taught me that opiates are POISON -- they poison your body, your mind, and your relationships. \n\nI have been without any source of significant pain relief for most of my adult life because of my refusal to take opiates. This has caused me problems with severe depression -- it is difficult to do or enjoy doing just about anything when all you can feel and all you can think about is pain. The pain comes to envelop your entire consciousness, leaving no energy or willpower to deal with anything else. \n\nAs of 2 years ago, I was suicidal and had already tried to end my life, when I found kratom. I have taken this plant for two years without ANY adverse side effects. It has changed my world. It has made my life worth living again! I can now keep up with my friends and family, go out and do things, pick up hobbies like gardening that had been too painful for me to enjoy, have a job again and work a full 8 hours. You have no idea how meaningful it is to be a productive member of society, until you cannot anymore. \n\nI beg you, please do not take this miraculous plant away. Kratom has saved my life, and without it I will be doomed to a colorless life of suffering and exhaustion. I have never once felt withdrawal symptoms, or any other adverse side effect. It has not been dangerous to my health at all -- in fact, it has helped me to become healthy and active again and lose nearly 30 pounds! I feel healthier and happier now than I have since I was 16, before my accident. \n\nServe the best interest of the people, NOT the best interest of the pharmaceutical industry! They want to capitalize on my suffering... I only want to overcome it. \n\nThank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5596","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christina Burt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is donald dlugos.

Then I had got dropped from my doctor who I had since the accident because I was a cash patient, because of DEA pressure upon doctors in Las Vegas where names like \"glorified drug dealers\"  were being given to doctors who prescribed prescription pain killers to cash patients, and all kinds of threats were being made to get doctors to stop prescribing pain medication to cash patients. After trying and having a very hard time getting any doctor to see me because I was a cash patient, I became worried, but my Hope and Trust are in my SAVIOR and LORD JESUS CHRIST and I know GOD uses all things for good for those who love HIM and are called according to HIS Purpose. I had already wanted to get off opiate pain medication and was working to reduce my dosage and quantity of medication, so I knew GOD was going to use this for my good. This is when I was searching on the internet for alternatives to opiates for pain, and GOD led me to an article on forbes about Kratom and I began reading testimonials of people saying how much it helped with there pain without the effects of opiates, and it sounded so promising but I was skeptical, but I tried it. \n\nThe first day I got kratom I had an unbelievable experience with pain relief that I would argue is equal too if not better than the opiate but without the side effects of the opiate(which makes it far better than opiates). So that night I cancelled my appointment I has with a new doctor, and I haven't had any opiate medication since, HalleluYAH! This doesn't just happen, you don't take opiates for 13 years everyday 4-5 times a day and just quit without any withdrawals and no more pain. One time I ran out of pain medication because the pharmacies were all closed for labor day, this was one of the hardest nights of my life, I got absolutely no sleep and was in horrible pain and my body was going through pretty serious withdrawals, that was what happened to me the first time I had no opiate pain medication for over 24 hours. But when I had Kratom there was none of that, and I feel a 1000 times better than I have felt since the day of my accident. So in closing I give all The Glory to GOD WHO is my Strength and my Hope and my Peace, for always being there for me since the day I called upon JESUS as my LORD and SAVIOR in February 2011, and for leading me to this wonderful plant  HE has made that has helped me rid myself of the pharmaceuticals that had my body in bondage. I Pray that you do not ban Kratom, more so for others than for myself, for I know and am well certain that my GOD will supply and give me Strength to overcome should you ban it, but there are many in far worse pain and who do not know JESUS CHRIST, who will resort to damaging alternatives some who I am certain will choose suicide. I Pray you make the right choice and choose not to ban this natural plant, and not bow to the pharmaceutical overlords. look at the stats you have sighted as to why Kratom needs to be banned, then take a look at the deaths caused by \"legal\" opiate prescription medication, and truthfully ask your self how Kratom is an \"immediate public hazard\" but prescription opiates are what you would rather have people taking.

Kratom also helps with overall feelings of well being and easing anxiety, allowing consumers to use a natural substance to aid their anxiety and depression rather than continue to be dependent on prescription medications. Here are some benefits of Kratom: \n\nKratom leaves have had a wide range of uses, starting with the people of Southeast Asia who have known and utilized the benefits of this miracle plant for centuries. Its popularity has grown in the western nations of the world as more and more people are becoming aware of the versatility of this plant. In smaller doses kratom is known to cause pain relief, produce stimulation, mental acuity, a heightened desire to work, extended energy, fatigue relief, increased focus, increased social and communication skills, relief from depression and anxiety, and a feeling of euphoria.\n\nKratom taken in larger doses is known to cause more of a sedative effect in addition to pain relief or analgesic effects. Some of the most commonly reported benefits are listed below.\n\nFeeling more optimistic/happy\nPain relief\nIncreased energy-level\nEnhanced communication skills\nEnhanced motivation\nRelief of depression\nLower blood pressure\nWeight loss\nDecreased anxiety\nLower blood sugars\nDecreased hypertension\nDecreased fatigue\nIncreased and extended energy\nAntidiarrheal effects\nIncreased mental acuity\nLower blood pressure\n\nMore recently reported benefits of Kratom include the relief of symptoms associated with drug (opiates) and alcohol withdrawals. Kratom has also been used for allergy and cold symptom relief, as a cough suppressant, fever reducer, to normalize blood pressure and blood sugar levels, to fight intestinal parasites, treat diarrhea, increase melanin production in the skin to aid in protection from the sun, and to prolong sexual intercourse.\n\nA noteworthy benefit of Kratom use is in fighting immune system disorders. This may be due to Kratom's rich, antiviral compounds which contain 20 times the amount of antioxidants found in green tea.\n\nPlease keep Kratom off the schedule list.

No deaths have been attributed to its use (except in conjunction with other drugs; I understand this brings the number of fatalities world-wide to a whopping 20). It is not dangerous. It is legal in most of the countries of the world. It is *not* an opiate. It does stimulate opiate receptors, but so does breast milk. Shall we now ban nursing?\n\nIt is the height of hubris, and governmental overreach, to declare illegal a plant that grows ubiquitously in many parts of the planet, that has distinct medicinal value, and harms no one. \n\nThe DEA owes its existence to the declaration of a \"drug war\" that has proven to be an abject failure. I see the banning of kratom as merely a reason simply to perpetuate the drug war and the DEA, in order to preserve jobs that shouldn't exist in the first place - and to give the \"powers that be\" yet another tool to persecute and jail \"offenders.\"\n\nPeanuts and eggs and penicillin kill more people than kratom, yet they are not banned. The explanation, presumably, is \"peanuts and eggs and penicillin don't get you high.\"\n\nFirst, if someone wants to get high, that is their own business, not the DEA's. Second, the notion that kratom gets one \"high\" - I would argue that if that is the case, then so do coffee and tea, ginseng, St. John's wort, valerian root, chamomile, and numerous other plants. And tobacco, of course, and alcohol, which we know have killed millions, yet remain legal.\n\nBanning kratom is a misguided attempt by the government to insinuate itself even further into the private activities of private citizens. That is government oppression, and it is wrong.\n\nI wonder if the private prison companies have a hand in this idea; it would not surprise me in the least to learn that they do. I wonder how much of a part \"big pharma\" has in this contemplated ban, to give the industry a leg up in isolating and marketing the active ingredients that are found in the kratom leaf.  Banning the source certainly eliminates the opposition and paves the way for huge profits.\n\nI urge the DEA to give up the idea of banning kratom. I cannot see anything good coming from it. Kratom consumption does not pose a \"public health risk,\" as the DEA claims. Banning it is a public health risk. \n\nIf the DEA intends to function as the protector of public safety, I suggest it investigate the pharmaceutical companies, which invent diseases and then peddle chemicals for them via TV ads to an ignorant, credulous audience. Ban TV ads for prescription medicines. Don't ban kratom. \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22024","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tesa Hayashi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have recently been on the scariest ride EVER withdrawing from all of my prescribed Chronic Pain Management medication.

If I would've known about how dangerous Oxycodone, Percocet, Vicodin, Flexeril were - I would  never have taken the prescribed medication for a long duration of time.  I had no idea what the long term affects would cause.  I'm now terrified after going through an unsafe withdrawal process. \nIf I did heroin I would've gotten methodone or suboxone....as a chronic pain management patient I was abandoned by our medical system. \n\nHowever, those medications gave me a quality of life for well over a decade.  I was able to live my life without severe pain.  They kept my heartbeat down to an acceptable level. I felt that I had no other choice.  I must admit - somedays - I prefer death versus living with chronic pain.  No human should have to endure such agony.  It isn't right.  We would never make a beloved pet suffer in the same way.  The tea Kratom offers me that quality of life again.  Once I switched from big Pharma medications to something natural and holistic - once I began drinking Kratom tea, I felt that I could live my life once again. I'm sure there are millions of other patients such as I living with severe chronic pain.  Please don't take away something that works well for so many of us.  I do not know how I will live my life if Kratom goes away.  I want to live my life without severe pain. I want my heart beat to be at a low level. Kratom never makes me feel cloudy headed. It never messes up my thinking like opoid medication do.  It's beneficial in so many ways.  Please don't classify something that is an herbal tea the same as you would a prescription drug. They are not the same.  I will always hesitate before taking a terrifying medication such as Oxycontin.  I do not fear Kratom in the same way.  Please reconsider your decision.

Kratom has allowed me to live a mostly normal life with minimal pain and faster recovery time after muscle pull and nerve pinching incidents. Before Kratom it would take at least 7-10 days for me to be able to recover after my neck vertebrae slipped due to my joint issues. This results in a very very painful and long recovery time. With Kratom I have been able to reduce my pain levels dramatically and reduced my recovery times to just 2-3 days. Please consider how many lives of responsible citizens the DEA will disrupt and ruin if the DEA schedules Kratom. I personally would very much approve of the FDA/DEA regulating Kratom the same way that other safe herbal supplements are regulated. This would benefit the community greatly through making vendors and farmers follow regular methods for processing and selling Kratom which will keep it safe, clean and free from fraudulent additives that some under handed vendors might do for increasing their profits.

This has led me to write you about the upcoming \"Kratom\" ban, in hopes that you will see the side of reason in trying to stop this. \n\nKratom is by no means a dangerous \"drug\". No matter what has been said or more likely not said about the substance, it is clear to a large population that Kratom has beneficial effects. I like to have a drink (alcohol) as much as the next man and maybe some nights a few more then I should, but I have found that after taking Kratom, even as little as once a week, I have almost no urge to consume alcohol anymore. I can drink for pleasure or if I want a particular type of drink, but the end result is no longer to get buzzed or drunk. I just don't crave that feeling like I used to and I definitely don't depend on it at the end of a long week like I used to. I know that's not great for alcohol sales and taxes from it, but I feel that on a personal level it makes me a more productive and generally more upbeat citizen.\n\nThe benefits are numerous and not all of them apply to me. I have read research that says that Kratom can help wean people off of more severe drugs such as Heroine and other opiates. Studying Kratom for medical use could prove beneficial in slowing or stopping the opioid overdose epidemic that is plaguing our great country. As of 2014, 78 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose. That is from the CDC's own website. (source: https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/) The numbers are at record levels and 60% of drug over dose deaths are opioid related.

Once I heard that the DEA planned on banning Kratom I immediately thought to my self \"Ohh great now I will end up illegally abusing prescription pain pills again\". I have struggled with opiate dependency for the past 10 years and Kratom has allowed me to stay off of pain pills for the past 2 years. I make a Kratom tea once in the morning and once at bed time and I am able to go through my day stone cold sober with not one craving for prescription pain pills. Kratom DOES NOT get you high, what it does however is relives my back pain, kills any opiate cravings I have, and allows me to function like a normal person, and all for less then $5 a day (Compared to $100 a day for a pain pill habit). I know multiple people who consume Kratom and have not abused illegal drugs ever since they found Kratom. If Kratom is outlawed I promise the DEA will see a very sharp increase in prescription pain pill abuse and higher crime rates due to people stealing and hurting others so they are able to afford pain pills or heroin. Kratom is far less dangerous then alcohol yet Americans are allowed to freely consume alcohol. By outlawing Kratom, the Federal Government will be forced to incarcerate more and more people who will continue to use Kratom, and will only add to the problems our nation experiences due to mass incarceration. I will say right now that if Kratom is baned, many people who do nothing more than consume the herb, and go to work and school just as I do everyday, will either turn to heroine or prescription pain pills and many people will overdose and die or end up in prison. Some countries prescribe Kratom to opiate abusers to help them stay off of opiates, so it confuses me as to why the U.S. Government suddenly wants to ban it. I believe that the evil pharmaceutical companies who lobby our government hard so that they can continue to flood our streets with highly addictive and dangerous medications (Knowing full well that a significant portion of them will be diverted and abused) have lobbied hard for the ban on Kratom as is will cause a sharp increase in demand for their pain pills. I just ask that the Government please take into consideration the lives and safety of the public that will be jepordized if Kratom is banned, and do the right thing by allowing the citizens of America to personally decide on whether or not they will consume this natural herb.

Over the last 5 years, I have witnessed an increasing number of patients successfully using Kratom to alleviate a variety of symptoms, with no documented negative events. Therefore, I am adamantly against the banning of Kratom. Most of these patients turned to Kratom have chronic pain, are over the age of 50, and have been on opiod therapy for 10+ years. \n\nSince Kratom has not been approved for consumption by the FDA, I cannot specifically recommend my patients use it for it's medicinal properties, however I sincerely wish that I COULD recommend this supplement due to the reasons I will outline below.\n\nMy patients are very open with me about their medications, including herbal supplements. In the past 5 years, I have witnessed over 50 of my patients successfully substitute Kratom to alleviate their chronic pain in lieu of narcotics. Every time they come to the clinic for follow-up and I review their blood panels, I have noticed a marked improvement in their lab values (such as liver transaminases). However, most importantly, the improvement I have seen in their QUALITY OF LIFE, has been nothing short of miraculous. \n\nPatients who were previously disabled by their chronic pain and side effects of narcotic therapies, have been much more active, many have been able to return to work, and often describe Kratom as a \"life-saver\". When the DEA announced a sudden ban on Kratom and its alkaloids, the concern and panic our clinic received from patients was extremely concerning. One patient actually stated, \"If this ban happens we are moving to Canada\", because she refused to resume taking narcotics for her chronic back pain.\n\nAs a physician, I believe that the DEA's motion to ban Kratom is reckless, irresponsible, and not based on scientific facts. I have yet to see a patient who was negatively impacted by Kratom in any way, and the published articles I have read support this. Furthermore, In speaking with my colleagues at the hospital, we have yet to see a single patient present with a Kratom \"overdose\", \"addiction\", or negative lab values. Upon further research, I have come to understand that Kratom has a unique \"ceiling effect\", which prevents users from achieving any sort of euphoric \"high\" that is present with the majority of the prescription pain medications available for severe chronic pain. Patients who used Kratom simply reported alleviation of their chronic pain, along with some mild anti-depressive/anxiolytic benefits. Additionally, patients reported increased energy levels that had plummeted since beginning narcotic pain management.\n\nThe botanical relative of Kratom, the coffee plant, is a great example what happens if a patient attempts to somehow abuse Kratom. I am actually more concerned about patients abusing coffee and caffeine than a patient abusing Kratom . If a patient drinks 10 espresso shots, they will become nauseated and experience GI distress...which is exactly what happens with Kratom. However if a patient were to accidentally ingest too much Kratom, they are less likely to have the severe cardiac arrhythmias that occur with a caffeine overdose. In this way, I feel that a ban on Kratom would be analagous to the DEA attempting to ban caffeine. In our clinic, we have not seen any patients complain of \"Kratom withdrawal symptoms/addiction\". \n\nQuality of life for my patients is of utmost importance to me, and the simple fact is, every patient we have seen in clinic who has discontinued narcotic therapy in lieu of Kratom supplementation has had a *significant* improvement in their quality of life. These patients vehemently do NOT want to return to narcotic therapy. \n\nIf the DEA chooses to ban Kratom, I have no doubt there will be a marked increase in the number of narcotic-related morbidities and deaths. \n\nFurthermore, when the DEA attempted to swiftly ban Kratom in September, I came to understand more about the Kratom community. These users are not teens chasing a \"legal high\". From what we have seen in clinic and in the published studies, there is no physiological euphoric \"high\" seen with Kratom. The majority of the community is comprised of parents, grandparents, and responsible members of society who are simply trying to manage their chronic pain with a natural remedy and regain control of their lives after years of narcotic pain management. I am far more concerned about my patients who are on narcotic medications than patients who decided to help alleviate their chronic pain with Kratom. A review of the published articles will reveal that there have been 0 deaths or negative outcomes associated with Kratom use. \n\nIn summary, I sincerely urge the DEA to make the responsible and informed decision to allow Kratom to remain legal so that we can keep the number of deaths/morbidities caused by narcotics as low as possible.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21576","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I urge a second consideration in view of the rehabilitative uses for these drugs.

Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...  It uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.  http://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...

U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.  http://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

None of these drugs enabled him to live a productive, normal life until he was introduced to Kratom.  He takes a daily dose of Kratom and he has turned his life around completely - it was literally a miracle.  Kratom not only enabled him to quit all the other prescription drugs, but they have also made him more productive than he's ever been.  He is now able to sustain a full-time job, raise a family and be a great friend - before Kratom, his life was a complete mess.

It always seems unfortunate when the general population begins to distrust and hate a government agency that is not a monolith and is itself not relegated to a singular dogmatic perspective on any given subject. \n\nI am an ex-heroin addict. Many people think that opiate addicts are just weak and/or stupid people but that is not the case. I was a model student and son and I simply was trying to find a way to cope with an emotional response to sexual abuse in my childhood (that is the case with many addicts). \n\nI heard about Kratom years ago when a friend of mine told me it helped him ease withdrawal symptoms. Since then, I have used it to get clean over 10 times. Frankly, the looming fear of the pain of withdrawal makes it terrifying for me to even think about getting off of opiates without it. Unlike opiates, kratom has never caused withdrawal symptoms for me (other than a runny nose). I have never gotten \"high\" on kratom, it simply eased withdrawal symptoms. I'm sure if you took enough it would have a stronger effect but it never had any abuse potential for me nor have I ever heard of someone becoming addicted to kratom in the same way that someone becomes addicted to opiates. \n\nAny drug, including caffeine, has some potential for abuse but if the benefits of the drug outweigh the detriments, it should not be illegal. This is a boon for mankind. Especially with the opiate epidemic. It keeps me going to work, reading, writing and being generally productive. It keeps us on the straight and narrow and allows us to become functioning members of society again. \n\nPlease reconsider making kratom illegal. It is not going to be as easy for people to fight withdrawal; and by extension, opiate addiction, if it simply becomes a prescription medication. Whenever an opioid is synthesized by pharmaceutical companies, they isolate the single molecule that has an opioid-like effect. The net result is that it becomes more addictive and more potent. I would guess that it is the other alkaloids in the mitragyna speciosa plant that produce the overall effect of kratom (that is, an effect which eases withdrawal without getting the user high and thus causing them to fall into yet another cycle of addiction). The overall response to kratom legality on a state by state basis should give you some direction as to whether or not kratom should be added to the controlled substances list. By and large, local politicians have seen the positive role it has played in their communities. \n\nThank you again for your time. The American people need help with opiate addiction. For most of us, it was the pharmaceutical companies that tricked us into getting into this mess in the first place and we have a lot more faith in a natural plant remedy than anything they may be putting on the market with kratom alkaloids in it. We hope that you see reason and join us in the real fight against drug abuse!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18363","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Krug","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a chemical engineering major, I have a lot of background with pharmaceutical chemistry.

In addition to fueling the war on drugs, a government programs that has caused so much unnecessary suffering and is based of the unrealistic idea of the creation of a drug free utopia, the ban on kratom will simply be denying Americans the right to put what they want into their bodies and would cause people that use kratom for pain relief to simple switch to opioids, a far more harmful and addictive substance. While concerns with some types of drugs like heroin are justified, America needs to learn how to pick and choose its battles and the war against a drug like kratom. Expending effort on the prohibition of a drug far less harmful then legal drugs like alcohol, tobacco, and prescription opioids is clearly something not worth fighting for.

I think that there should not be a ban on Kratom to allow for more research on it.

Kratom has enriched my life greatly over the past 6 months. I have been dealing with a serious health issue that remains unresolved as I do not have health insurance. I have pain and numbness that kicks in every night and travels down my arms into my hands. I lose countless hours of sleep, and in the morning I often have slightly swollen, claw-like hands. Kratom has allowed me to live with less pain and brighter, more energetic spirits on the days following my long, sleepless nights. I am a firm believer in the power of plants, and I strongly dislike the unwanted side effects and addictions that come with using pain killers, sleep aids or other synthetic chemical creations that are often prescribed for conditions like mine. I have been again and again to the chiropractor, a therapeutic masseuse, a free health clinic...all of which have contributed to the management of my painful condition, but none of which have compared to the results that Kratom provides me. Just a teaspoon of Kratom up to four times a day takes away my stress headaches, any residual arm/hand pain, and my fatigue associated with my unknown condition. I have reduced the amount of wine I drink at night, and I am able to maintain a healthy exercise routine since introducing Kratom into my life, both of which reduce my high stress levels resulting from my persistent pain. My daughter and entire family is happier and healthier when I am happier and healthier. I am on the path to getting an MRI and hopefully pinpointing my exact problem and then completely resolving it, but it is not even scheduled yet (after nearly 4 months of trying to get one) and will probably not happen until 2017. If it weren't for Kratom, I would have lost the past 6 months plus many more months to come of my life to pain, sleep deprivation and depression from this health issue. Please don't deny our access to this wonderful plant that has changed so many peoples lives for the better, without any harmful side-effects as a result.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJordanya Gonglach","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6490","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"jordanya gonglach","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't ban Kratom.

For a little over 10 years I had been battling an on-again-off-again addiction to opiates which culminated in a two year run with Heroin. Like many young people I got sucked into the current opioid epidemic first via a family member's prescription Oxycontin and then finding my own sources. There were many times that I almost lost everything  and I was constantly  having to associate  with seedy people who i otherwise would have had nothing to do with. In addition to suffering from anxiety and depression I also have sciatica and an autoimmune disease and opiate drugs took the edge off but also created a devastating addiction and put me in compromising situations, I became a slave.\n\n 2 years ago I discovered kratom and it has absolutely changed my life. Both I and a close friend of mine have been completely free of heroin and any other drug for over 2 years now. I still enjoy taking it on a daily basis because it gives me the relief of the problems that cause me to want to use opiate drugs in the first place (anxiety depression and pain) but without the harmful effects of actual opiates. I have never gotten what I would consider High from taking kratom the most it does is give a motivated and pain free feeling of contentment and energy. It truly is a godsend of a plant and I believe it was perhaps God's Gift of Grace to those who misused the poppy plant. My demographic is only 10% of the overall kratom consuming community what I've learned the past few months is that most people who take it take it to deal with pain symptoms and are middle-aged or seniors. I'm only 29 and I know what it's like to live with pain but because I was always honest with my doctors in seeking help with my addiction I am now flagged at every hospital and without kratom would never be able to obtain help for my pain because of my past drug abuse. \n\nPart of the reason (and a large part in actuality) for the current heroin epidemic is the over prescription and overuse of morphine based drugs, it is unfathomable to me that the government would even consider for a second outlawing  such a natural harmless alternative that has helped so many people. I am personally skeptical of the fda's ability to properly evaluate the chemical components of Kratom in such a short time span, but I can tell you for sure that if it is made illegal there will be no favours done for the heroin epidemic in the United States. If you just look at Alabama they outlawed Kratom and they're overdose deaths doubled a very short time after as a result. Many consumers of Kratom would agree that some form of Regulation should be applied to ensure quality and limit sale to minors, but placing the natural plant in schedule I along with Heroin is a harmful and Grave mistake. I can tell you firsthand having moved from heroin to kratom that they are certainly not in the same category. The transition definitely hurt and was painful to go through but it was at least bearable to do while simultaneously running a company and managing my responsibilities which is something that I could have never done trying to quit cold turkey or having to pause my busy hectic life to enter residential drug treatment. It is not possible to overdose or get high on kratom and believe me during that transition time due to the discomfort of the withdrawal from heroin even with the kratom, I tried. There is a ceiling on the effects, which makes it a wonderful natural and self-regulating alternative to drugs that routinely kill people and require ever-increasing dosages to achieve the same effect.\n\nIt is my Earnest prayer and plea that the administration would very carefully consider the pros and cons of removing such a wonderful natural remedy from the market.

These two extremes in its potential therapeutic application deserve examination in view of the current opiate epidemic and need for therapeutic alternatives.  These compounds are not likely to be examined by pharmaceutical companies for any therapeutic use due to their inability to be patent protected.  However, academic examination through NIH or other funding mechanisms could provide valuable information, and getting FDA approval for human or even animal studies with Schedule 1 substances is very difficult, even when the compounds themselves can be relatively easily obtained for such testing.  If scheduling appears necessary for other reasons, then I suggest that a lower category such as schedule 3 be considered.  These substances do not appear to be widely abused in the USA in my experience in the emergency departments of our hospitals in Houston or in the patients coming to our addictions treatment programs.  Opiate addicted patients are using Kratom to relieve opiate withdrawal symptoms, but do not describe any euphoria that it produces.  These observations need replication in controlled human laboratory studies with both opiate abusers and non-abusers.  Doing such studies with a schedule 1 substance will be extremely difficult and obtaining funding for such studies will pose further difficulties or impossibilities because of the schedule 1 categorization.  We need more scientific information from human studies, and this scheduling to schedule 1 will prevent such human studies.

I have been practicing criminal defense for four years, and in that time have watched how the criminalization of drugs does very little to stop drug use, manufacturing, and sales, and more commonly exacerbates the situation by extending the cycle of poverty and failing to deal with the disease of addiction. Adding additional substances to the federal schedule will only commit us further to the failed policy of the \"war on drugs.\" Kratom and the active chemicals within it are especially inappropriate for criminalization because they hold low potential for harm to the user (when used alone) and hold high potential for the treatment of much more serious addictions, such as opiate and heroin addiction. I have used Kratom in small doses for pain relief, and have taken it approximately 1-2 times a month for 5 years. It has never negatively impacted my life in the way even alcohol can, and has done much to improve my pain and even depression. To add Kratom to the schedule of controlled substances would baselessly deprive millions of safe and healthy treatment for addiction and pain, and eliminate the medical field's ability to research the substances within Kratom to improve its efficacy for treatment.

I am a single mom who broke her back in a boating accident. I was on extremely potent pain killers and like many people, became physically addicted. I was on fentanyl patches with morphine for break through pain. I fell asleep at my grandpa's funeral and would fall asleep folding clothes. I couldn't function and couldn't work and was on food stamps and having a really hard time paying my bills. I was depressed and wouldnt attend family functions. I stopped doing everything i loved and was just getting by. I found kratom and haven't had a single opioid in 5 years. I have a good job and no food stamps and look forward to each day. I am a damn good mom. I don't drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes anymore because kratom helped me get rid of all the crutches I once needed. Without kratom, I fear I will head back down that horrible road of depression and anxiety. I fear I will lose my job and crawl back in that miserable hole.

Kratom has improved the lives of many people in my family, & it has certainly improved mine. I have enjoyed the gentle benefits of Kratom tea for the last 3-4 years. I suffer from anxiety, PTSD, & chronic pain. When I was 13, I was in an accident where I was literally set on fire. I endured a large 2nd/3rd degree burn to my lower right leg/foot, & experienced my first of many surgeries, the beginning of what was to be over 10 years of medical nightmares for me. To date though, I've had at least 15 surgeries, all proceedures (but 3 of them) were on my chest/abdomen, including a botched procedure for a full hysterectomy due to painful ovarian cysts & cervical cancer. It's all caused me a lot of lasting pain, & the accident has left me a lot of emotional trauma. With my chronic pain, anxiety, & PTSD, I needed medication, most of which I needed daily for several years starting in the burn unit as a kid, & had grown dependent on them. Between the symptoms, dependency, & side effects... I felt like I wasn't living my life, I was missing out on my family & friends, I wasn't able to dance or focus on my web work. With herbs, specifically Kratom, I have found some relief, & don't experience any of the unwanted (& sometimes truly debilitating) side effects that I dealt with when taking prescribed medications - which I basically never need anymore. Kratom tea provides me with a gentle mood & energy boost similar to coffee, with the added bonus of some pain relief. I'm able to focus & do things like cook, clean, & play with my kids again, things that I very rarely did over the years before discovering Kratom. I agree with thousands of other responsible & informed adult consumers in the Kratom community - I don't crave Kratom, or get \"high\" from it, Kratom has positively impacted my life, & I do feel like it is similar to my coffee & other teas, so it is absurd to me to think that Kratom could be taken away from the many who enjoy it. If Kratom gets banned, I (as well as so many others) will have no choice but to go back to medications, pills that helped me very little & caused things like constant nausea & drowsiness. So many people have reported such positive experiences with Kratom on so many levels, & especially with even the science agreeing with us that it could potentially eliminate cravings/withdrawals for opiates, provide mood boost for anxiety or depression, & alleviate some chronic pain - with many of us in the community feeling like Kratom is our \"last hope\" - why would anyone want to take that away? It's just truly horrifying for me to think of all of us in the Kratom community losing this wonderful & beneficial tea leaf. Please do not schedule or ban Kratom.

If you add kratom to a scheduled substance you will effect hundreds of thousands of people who are simply trying to make the best decision for their own health.

Once I retired I had severe lower back pain, I have gone through the shots to ease the pain, but they only worked for a short time. I was given Oxycodone to help with the constant pain, eventually I started to crave the Oxycodone. It got to where I did not feel normal without it. I heard about Kratom, and decided to give it a try to help me through the times when I ran out of the Oxycodone. about a week after I started with the Kratom my cravings for Oxycodone went away, even when I tried to take the Oxy it did nothing to me, before I started the Kratom, the Oxy would give me a slight euphoric feeling. But that no longer happened once I was using the Kratom. after a few months of taking the Kratom I was able to tell my Doctor I no longer wanted the Oxycodone. Which I thought was awesome, now I am pretty much pain free, and I kicked the Oxycodone habit. \nKratom does not give me any kind of High, I am able to function at work without any side effects. The only thing it does to me  is give me energy, sort of like I had had two cups of coffee. \nI have heard all the stories about how we are going through an Opioid epidemic crisis here in the United States, Since that is the case, I believe we should make Kratom fully available for Scientific research to see what it is about Kratom that helps as much as it helped me.

I am contacting you because I am gravely concerned about the DEAs announcement that it plans to add the leaf kratom to its list of Schedule I substances.\n\nI used to suffer from anxiety, depression, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and though I have not seriously experienced these issues for a long time, I am still prone to anxiety and unwanted thoughts on occasion. I have taken kratom for about two and a half years. When I drink kratom, I feel less anxious and more like myself. Thats it. I have never experienced any negative or unpleasant effects from kratom. The only effect I notice at all is a slight increase in alertnesssimilar to a cup of coffee. Actually, kratom is less strong than coffeeI had to give up drinking coffee about nine months ago because it was exacerbating my anxiety. \n\nIn addition to being mild, kratom is not addictive and has never produced any withdrawal symptoms in me. The first time I took a week-long break from kratom after taking it regularly for a couple months, I wondered if I would notice any negative effects. Expecting that I might feel sick or drowsy, I experienced nothing of the sort. Thats when I knew that this was an amazing plant, and fully understood the potential benefits it holds for people. \n\nKratom is an herb that has helped me immeasurably to be a healthier, happier, more productive person. I cannot express in words how relieved and thankful I am to have learned about this plant. My quality of life has improved in ways I did not expect were possible a few years ago. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my letter. Knowing I will never be able to fully explain what this plant means to me, I can only hope that I have been able to communicate to you the importance of kratom to my health and well-being.

Speaking from my personal experience and that of many people I know the benefits outweigh the negatives when it comes to this plant. I have seen first hand my brother in law go from using opioids for years due to originally being over prescribed opioid pain killers from a physician for a shoulder injury that he became physically dependent. Then the prescriptions ran out but the withdrawals did not stop so he began to take heroin just so he wouldn't be sick.  To taking no opioids at all and return to being a normal functional person in society after my wife and I introduced him to kratom. My mother also suffers from dependence on opioid prescription painkillers and has just recently discovered that she has liver disease due to the very thing that was suppose to help her. If she would have known of kratom 15 years ago this would have never happened.  I myself take this to go to bed and stay asleep at night as I suffer from sleep disorder. I am a productive member of society who gets up in the morning and goes to work, takes care of my family,  and my responsibilities as a wife and Mother of three. There are numerous people I know who suffered from addiction and dependence on painkillers / heroin  that were able to get clean as a result of kratom. It sickens me that you (DEA) are so bought off from the big pharmaceutical companies that you guys are willing to ban a plant that has never killed anyone so that they can keep pumping out there painkillers, methadone, and suboxone. That you (DEA) are willing to let people die because big pharma is the one that you guys all answer too and they can't stand the thought of losing money at the expense of peoples lives and well being. I read an article that said the poison control centers received around 660 calls for kratom and zero deaths over a period of several years. I also read that the poison control centers recieved over 50,000 calls for incidents relating to opioids in a span of several months which translates to thousands of deaths and overdoses  and for some reason there is no rush to ban those drugs and save all those lives because I don't think your bosses (big pharma) would like that very much. In all, this plant in my opinion, should be as freely available as tee at the store or a bottle of tylenal. I have taken it for a year in varying doses and at the worst I had an upset stomach. I have had worse experience from drinking to much coffee and definately worse experiences from drinking too much alcohol which by the way kill more people every year than kratom has.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17996","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The agenda that Kratom is like morphine is not factual in any way.

It does not cause respitory depression, unlike opiates, which is why you never hear of kratom deaths.  My research says the 13 deaths as part of your agenda, all of them had lethal doses of another substance in their system.

Around 2005, I was in a motorcycle accident that did some damage to my AC joint.  It's an injury that is slow to heal, I had some degree of pain or discomfort for over a year.  During this time, I became addicted to the prescribed pain medication.  Once the pain was gone, I fell into a life-consuming addiction.  I drove myself into debt, ruined my credit and personal relationships - sadly, it's not a unique story.  I pulled myself out of this cycle by using Kratom as a substitute.  I stopped using opioids in 2012, went back to university, got an advanced degree, and now I contribute by teaching biological sciences.  \nI feel as if there is a great deal of misinformation about kratom's effects on the user, particularly the 'high'.  I find it to be just ever-so-slightly more profound than a cup of coffee.  It is nowhere close to the high experienced with alcohol or marijuana (a drug that looks as if it may be legalized in the near future), and miles from the all-encompassing effects of an actual opioid.  To compare to another category of drug, stimulants, Kratom is to opioids as coffee is to methamphetamines.  There is a certain pleasant lift to Kratom, but it doesn't disorient, impair coordination or destroy judgement.  What it does is lightly tickle the opioid receptors to completely eliminate craving.  I tried unsuccessfully for several years to get myself out of my cycle of addiction and the part that always led to relapse was the craving and depression experienced daily.  I couldn't concentrate on anything, my thoughts were consumed with drug fantasies.  There is an initial temptation for the novice user, something along the lines of \"I wonder if I triple my intake, will I feel that old overwhelming high?\"   One quickly learns that the answer is a resounding \"no\". What the user gets by following through with this train of thought is, put simply, a headache that lasts for about 2 hours. Drug abusive behavior is self defeating and self limiting.  To go back to the coffee analogy, there is a certain point where caffeine over consumption becomes unpleasant, and that point is well before it becomes life threatening. Kratom is similar in that regard. \nIt is for this reason that I believe scheduling Kratom is an overreaction.  Kratom's effects are mild and abusive behavior is self limiting.  It has dramatically improved my outcome and outlook as it has for many others. I thank you for taking the time to read my opinion.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2045","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In 2011 I was cutting my yard using my ridding mower on a hill.

I think it would be a discrace and dis service to the nation to ban Kratom. \n\nSincerely John Jay Booeas","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4816","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Booras","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern:\n\nKratom has saved me from a miserable existence on prescription drugs. Prior to discovering kratom, I had to make a choice between physical and emotional agony an sobriety. Kratom has allowed me to stop taking highly addictive prescription and illicit drugs rife with negative consequences. I am not a criminal.  I am a well educated professional with a young family.  For the past three years I haven't felt it necessary to take a drink or drug thanks to a low dose of kratom powder. I have exceled in my career and my family life.  I am present and available and not in physical or emotional duress.  I have experienced no negative side effects from using kratom and I cannot fathom why the government would seek to make it illegal.  Kratom is a miracle plant and I believe that it should remain freely available.  Kratom itself does not constitute a public health crisis, however, I believe that by banning it, hundreds of thousands of people with similar stories will fall back into addiction and that will be a public health crisis.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17027","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kalen Keach","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to urge you to not reschedule mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. My wife has had crippling health problems since age 25, at which time her Physician put her on a regimen of pain medication - namely Vicodin and Oxycontin. After spending some time on this medication her health deteriorated further and her mental condition worsened. At that time, she thought that she ought to stop taking the prescribed pain medication. Well, as I am sure you know, this is no easy task. After feeling sick for over a week she went to a specialist that prescribed her with Suboxone. This is what they give heroin addicts, my wife is not a herion addict! After a few bouts of depression and trying to get off of suboxone we finally found Kratom. This stuff is magical. This is the ONLY thing that she has ever found that she can take a small quantity of and not have pain. You know what else she doesn't have? Cravings, depression and anxiety - all because of this plant. She is living a normal life after her physician ruined it by prescribing her prescription opiates rather than getting to the route of the problem. If you take kratom away this all gone. And not just for my wife but for many, many addicts. People will turn to the streets to find whatever it is they need to feel \"normal\" again. DEA I understand why you think you need to do this, but this is not a designer drug or a dangerous substance. It's a plant that gives hope to millions of people that need it.

It has helped my life tremendously in various ways. The most helpful way has been to fight my depression.  I have been diagnosed with major depression disorder for about 10 years. I have tried nearly every antidepressant that is available. Most were not helpful at all and caused terrible side effects. I do remain on one called fetzima that has not caused me to have bad side effects, however, it had remained a constant day to day struggle until I tried Kratom.  I have been using it for about one year.  I feel that you believe that it is resulting in a \"high\".  I want to tell you that is not true.  The Kratom makes me feel normal. Before my major depression started when I was around 22. It makes deep feelings of overwhelming sadness go away.  It gives me an increase in my energy where I am able to work now,  before the Kratom I was not able to.  It relieves a lot of anxiety for me. People that do not suffer from depression and anxiety sometimes do not understand how these can affect the quality of one's life. I can't even put a price on that. I feel that it should be researched more and could only pray that one day a pharmaceutical company will make these ingredients in a antidepressant pill or anti anxiety pill.  I have not experienced any negative side effects. I would be willing to be a participant in any research study for it.  Please. Please do not ban this natural substance. It will hurt alot of people dearly. If you or anyone you know has suffered through these ailments like I have,  please think if they finally got relief from this it is not fair to just take that away from someone. Especially not even giving it the chance to be fully researched and studied. This is not a dangerous substance. This is not cocaine or lsd or any of those drugs. Please do not take away this,  it has had the greatest positive impact on my quality of life. I am able to do the things for my children that I could not even get out of bed for before. It also helps tremendously with restlessness in legs. That is another thing I used to suffer with which would cause me not to be able to sleep. Sleep is a very important part of your health and directly affects your life as well. Please, listen to every individual who fills this form out. We may have some different individual needs but this substance truly helps. I try to live as healthy a life as I can,  both physically and emotionally. Kratom plays a very positive role in that. Not just for me,  for anyone I've even known who takes it as well.  Please contact me if you or anyone have any questions or concerns that you have about it. I will answer with compete honesty always from my heart. Kratom is a good thing. It is not just some drug. Not every pharmaceutical drug will work for everybody either. For example,  there are so many kinds of antidepressants.  Why? Because we are all different. Every person is unique and may require something different. And there is nothing wrong with that. But what about the millions of people who never find any relief?  I have finally found this and it is being turned into something negative when there aren't any facts to really support that. I would not think there would be any problem to at the very least regulate it. Like I said I believe anything that has this many people getting relief from whatever it is that they may suffer with,  deserves to be researched. Deserves to be given that chance. If it will not be,  then the same label which states \"this is not intended to prevent, cure or diagnose...\"  should be put on the label. Just like any other natural supplement. People have had a more proactive role in maintaining their health are the very same people that have come across it and have tried it. I have heard many more positive results from its use than I myself am just stating.  I wanted to give you my story. My reasons. But I pray you will read these forms with an open heart. And really listen to the individuals and how it has helped them. Thank you for taking the time to read this. And for the others you have already read and will read.  \nSincerely,\nTiffany Diane Gerhart","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3042","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tiffany Gerhart","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\nMy name is Linda Shirley and I am a 31 year old part time customer service coordinator.  I learned about kratom two years ago while doing some research on natural supplements that could help with pain and anxiety.  I did a lot of research before I decided to start taking kratom.  I wanted to be sure that what I ingested would be safe.  Upon trying it I was delighted.  My moods balanced out, I felt relaxed.

I've been taking it for two years now and if I stop taking it I don't have withdrawal symptoms.  It's a very helpful herb. I've seen it save lives, and I've never seen it take lives.\nKratom should be available to anyone who wishes to take it.  It has health benefits that help many, many people.  Putting it in a schedule 1 would eliminate the chance of doing further research into kratom and its health benefits.  Please, keep kratom legal so we can research this herb further!

Kratom has been a lifesaver for me and It would be a great personal tragedy if this supplement is removed from the shelves.

I have never taken hard drugs of any kind. I have been taking Kratom on a daily basis for the last 4 years. Scheduling Kratom makes absolutely no sense to me. I understand fighting drugs that harm people. Not the ones that fix them. I have always had ups and downs, struggled, but managed without prescriptions. A few years back, I lost my job and went down a very dark path. I was prescribed anti depressants but I went online to seek a safer alternative instead. Kratom has been my sidekick ever since. I was able to stabilize myself, find work again and be a productive member of society...without any chemicals. Like many others, I am scared of being addicted to pills and I feel we should be able to decide how we want to medicate. I agree there should be a minimum age to be able to purchase Kratom and possibly a better control of the channels (gas stations for example should not be able to carry it) If people want to purchase the plant without alterations to brew a tea that makes them feel better, they should be able to. Weed is slowly but surely getting legal everywhere either for medical or recreational use (which I completely agree with). Kratom cannot even be compared to Cannabis! I do not get high when I drink my tea but I do get an lift that gets me through the day with a smile on my face. Please do not take it away from us. I hope my voice matters. I hope the DEA will make things right and agree we have a right to find relief in a harmless plant.

After I crashed a longboard and went headfirst into a fire hydrant leaving two deep giant gashes in my forehead, I had some trauma mentally. I felt for a while after this accident a mental fog and headaches. When I started taking Kratom I was going to school and would take it in the morning. As an occasional use on weekdays, Kratom removed my mental fog and helped improve my mood as well. Never did I feel that Kratom got me \"high\" so to speak, but felt like it was a substitute for coffee as well as a headache prevented. I noticed that while using Kratom my headaches became much less frequent and that I had a boosted mood and felt less out of control from my traumatic head injury.  I also stopped drinking coffee, and felt that simply drinking some chai tea and some Kratom tea mixed together was ample for my morning and was much less problematic for me than the addictive qualities of drinking caffeine rich coffe. So Kratom helped me 1- with headache pain, 2- with reducing  incidences of headaches from head injury, 3- with caffeine addiction, and 4- increased positive outlook and general mood improvement. I noticed no withdrawal whenever I stopped taking Kratom. Also, I've known a few friends who took Kratom and said it improved their mood and they never seemed to be getting \"high\" and they never exhibited signs of being addicted to Kratom. \n\nSincerely, \nJonathan Dale Lathrop.\n\nNeedless to say, I think it's ludicrous this is even being considered for being banned.

I write this comment with a heavy heart and an anxious mind. A completely natural, safe, and effective alternative to potentially harmful and addictive pharmaceuticals, kratom has been one of the most important and life-changing discoveries of my life. I suffer from two chronic, debilitating conditions, Cyclic Vomiting Sydrome, and chronic lower back pain from a car accident. Kratom has been an essential and effective remedy for both. Because of kratom's analgesic properties, it serves as an efficient healing agent, allowing me to get through the majority of my day with little to no pain. Over the counter medications such as Tylenol and Aleve, just aren't effective for chronic pain, and depending on the severity of the pain, many of those who suffer from a painful condition may sometimes take more than the recommended dosage, which can be extremely dangerous, possibly, fatal depending on the circumstances. Typically, my only option at this point would be to request a stronger medication for pain. There are two reasons why this can be a bad thing. Generally, the stronger the medication, especially opioid pharmaceuticals, the greater risk there is for addiction. Because of the severe opioid epidemic currently plaguing the country, I'm honestly scared to be on a potentially addictive medicine for the rest of my life. The second reason is that the Dr. more than likely wouldn't prescribe a stronger pain medication, for the exact same reason, the opioid epidemic. Dr's, under significant outside pressure to cut down on opiate painkiller prescriptions, have become reluctant to prescribe them at all, leaving a patient who truly needs them with little alternative but to live in pain for the rest of their lives, or turn to illicit drugs such as heroin. For me, and for many, many more, kratom has been the answer to that conundrum. Because it has been used for thousands of years by indigenous peoples it has a strong historical record of being safe. Kratom doesn't depress the respiratory system like other, stronger medications for pain, so the potential for overdose is minimal, if not altogether impossible. Kratom, being in the same family as coffee, a plant that has been ingested safely by nearly everyone on the planet, also has extremely low potential for abuse. While possible, withdrawal symptoms are minor, often commonly compared to caffeine withdrawals. Because of these reasons and many more, kratom should remain legally available for safe, responsible treatment of pain and anxiety, as well as the many other conditions it can provide relief to. Banning it would be a grave mistake, especially as a Schedule I substance. Research, which could lead to relief for hundreds of thousands of people, would be nearly impossible under this Schedule. Kratom has only begun to be studied, and there is empirical data that supports the claims of kratom's many proponents. Halting such possiblities would be potentially damaging to the population. Lives could possibly be saved. It is our responsibility as a society to make sure that we help one another, not take away avenues of assistance. It is for all of these reasons, that I believe Kratom should not be subject to a ban. Research should not be hindered. Pain should not be allowed to continue when it can so easily be treated. People should be encouraged to pursue natural medicinal alternatives, not prosecuted. We owe it to ourselves to create the reality we would like to live in, and we can easily start living a reality with lower numbers of pain patients, lower rates of opiate and prescription painkiller abuse, and higher rates of happiness and comfort.

At 19 years old I was told that I would be in a wheelchair by the time I was 30 and that my life would be managed with pharmaceutical drugs and physical therapy. Determined to change that outcome I set my life course to become as healthy as I could by eating right, exercising right, and using herbs and vitamins to control my symptoms and for the most part this worked well for me. For about 15 years I managed to hold off what doctors told me I couldn't avoid. But by the time I was 35 the disease had set in and was taking over my body. I began to suffer from debilitating muscle spasms in my neck and back and this would be the first time I ever took prescription pain pill to control the pain associated with MS, degenerative disc disease and spondylosis. Needless to say it didn't take long for the prescription opioid medication to take over my life. Within five years of taking my first pill I was addicted and just like everybody else began a course of abuse and dependence on the opioid pain medication. By the time I was 40, whatever left of my life that wasn't robbed by the disease was now under siege by the pain medicine and my life resembled no kind of living. I was merely existing to wake up, take pain medicine and go back to sleep. It would be another two years before Kratom was introduced to me and I would gain control of my life again. Kratom not only helps to manage the pain associated with MS, degenerative disc disease, and spondylosis but it also helped me break my addiction to the pain medicine that I thought I would be slaved to forever. I would later learn through my experience with kratom how bad my addiction to the opiate pain pills actually was and how the opiate pain pills contributed to the problem and the pain. Now I'm able to manage my symptoms, which range from pain, to issues with balance and, restless leg syndrome and anxiety with two simple teaspoons of Kratom each morning. In discovering Kratom's fantastic benefits it has not only given me my life back but I can afford to live as well. Where I was once unable to work and function in society I now hold a managerial position and work up to 60 hours a week at times because I'm functioning in life. My days are no longer consumed by countless doctors appointments and pharmacy errands. Kratom has returned the quality of my life to me and I shudder to think what will happen to me if Kratom is taken away or made unavailable or becomes ridiculously so expensive I can't buy it. This just can't happen. I also feel it's important to mention that while I was on the opiate pain meds my blood pressure had to be control with blood pressure meds because I could it get it under 165/99. Now my blood pressure is a steady 110/88 without meds to control it and all I take is Kratom. Before Kratom I was on 3 different pain meds, BP meds, anxiety meds, depression meds, nerve meds, and steroids! I've replaced all that with two teaspoons of Kratom each day and I am not only living but I am ALIVE! \n\nKratom is safe based on my 5 years of experience. I have never had any adverse reactions to Kratom and I can't say enough how my life has steadily improved since the day I discovered Kratom. \n\nPlease don't take it away from me!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7798","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christine Veit","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My mom uses kratom for Fibromyalgia.

This combination dulled my emotions and destroyed my memory.  During the sixth year my daughter was born.  On her first birthday, I was inspired to stop.  Up until that point I thought I would be on the prescription drugs for the rest of my life however, for my daughters birthday we stayed at a hotel for the weekend and I left my medications at home and only brought kratom.  I took kratom during the times when I felt terrible.  This went on for two weeks and I felt renewed.  I never thought I would get off of xanax because I have  had seizures and have been on a controlled dose of .5 for so long but kratom made me forget all about the withdrawal.  As for the anti-depressants, the withdrawal from those sucked as well but kratom helped be comfortable through that.  The best part was the kratom was not anywhere near as dangerous as either drug.  Nobody has ever died from kratom alone.  It's been a 7 months now since I've stopped the prescription medications and my memory has never been better.  I take kratom at times I feel anxious and have trouble sleeping yet it is not addictive.  The key thing is including kratom as a part of a healthy, balanced diet and drinking lots of water.  Kratom synergizes with healthy things such as cayenne, grapefruit juice, black pepper, vitamin c and turmeric.  It must be healthy if it synergizes with so many good things. In other words, it inspires a healthy diet.  In fact, it works optimally if you are eating right.  It has had such a positive effect on my life as it has helped me get through the anxiety of and have the energy to finish college and work.  I implore the DEA to please listen to the facts and leave kratom alone.  At the most, please create age restrictions.

It isn't a pain killer so much as it just seems to prevent it with regular use. In addition, I can no longer tolerate caffeine but find that a small dose of kratom has about the same effect as a cup of coffee but without the jitters or digestive problems that anything with caffeine gives me. This natural herb has really been a boon to us in our elder years and has saved us a lot of money on OTC drugs that would likely be less good for us in the long run. Please don't make us go underground for this, with the dark web everything is still obtainable, but just costs a lot more iand is of dubious quality.

I enlisted in the Army and served from 2003 through 2009 supporting a number of units all over the world, from Fort Bragg to Korea, with stops in plenty of places in between.  I am so thankful for my time in service, but unfortunately, and all too common amongst my Veteran brethren, it has left me partially disabled, with chronic pain (repetitive injuries to my knees and back), and with a heart condition.  I was actually separated from service early due to a Medical Board that found me unable to continue serving with these injuries.  I finished school and got a desk job after service, and in late 2009, I continued treatment for my ailments through both the VA and through private physician. In both cases, the specialists that I met with didn't really offer too many options for treatment (steroid injections near my spine, shaving the discs to help with herniations/ruptures, PT, anti-inflammatory drugs, surgeries down the line, and prescriptions opioids to manage pain finally).\n\nThere were varying degrees of success with each course of treatment, but as I continued with all of my treatments, they all became less and less effective, and the pain grew to unbearable levels.  I always took the prescribed amount of medication, but every month, the dosage and number of pills would increase as they seemed to lose their effectiveness.  Then, couple that with the awful side effects, the constant lethargy, where my only options seemed to be either (1) be miserable and in agony, or (2) be in slightly less pain, but perpetually exhausted. There were many sleepless, emotional nights where I would break down and wonder if every day would be like this for the rest of my life.  Would I have to call out of work a few times a month if I couldn't bear to move out of bed?  If I was married, or had children: How could I manage an active lifestyle with them without dragging them through this?  From experience, I know how frustrating and powerless it is to watch your loved ones suffer, and I never wanted to put anyone in the position where they would have to worry about me like that.\n\nIn 2011, the stars aligned for me: I grew tired of the shots, MRIs, the PT and pills; I was tired of being tired; my VA physician left for another position; and by chance, I had heard of a plant named Mitragyna Speciosa, or Kratom for short.  I first tried the plant a few days after I had stopping traditional treatment as my pain had returned. I was about to call out of work (again), and I figured that this innocuous plant couldn't do more harm than good, so I made a tea out of it, choked it down, cringed at the taste, and waited. It wasn't the most pleasant taste, but after about 20 minutes: My pain was not gone completely, but it was manageable. I felt the familiar sense of numbing that the pain meds had provided me, but at a fraction of the strength, and not intoxicating in the least bit.  Something else happened though that really got to me: I felt energetic and optimistic, not in the artificial caffeinated sense, but in an \"excited for life\" type of way.\n\nSince that time, I have been a proponent of this herb, waxing poetic to anyone who will listen since the plant is not a drug that was created in a laboratory that comes with a laundry list full of effects.  It is naturally balanced, and it has a personality all to its own.  Those who partake, must treat it with respect, because unlike opioids and most pharmaceuticals; there is a limit to the plant's effectiveness, and taking more does only leads to uncomfortable (but not serious or fatal) effects including headache or nausea at worst.\n\nThis is too long as it is, but I feel that it is important to make sure that my voice is heard because the DEA is about to make a grave mistake that will cost lives.  I am in a good place in life right now. I met my wife that same year in 2011, we have a lovely home together, with an awesome dog, and we still may have kids in the future.  I am active, healthy, and rarely miss work.  I still use it regularly, and my heart, back, and knees are all holding up better now than they did years ago when I started this journey.  I have communicated with thousands of people, each with their own story and ailments, all of whom have used Kratom to great effect with minimal downsides, and I really fear for the next group of Vets and people with pain/depression/anxiety who can benefit from this plant.\n\nI was lucky to have found Kratom when I did, and if the DEA bans it, I am truly horrified at what might be the outcome.  How many people will fall to their conditions because they weren't offered the same opportunity and tools that I was?  How many will turn to the already increasing number of prescription Opioids, or Heroin, or Alcohol, or any other terrible substance that only leads to more pain, suffering, and negative outcomes?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4726","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Howe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe this ban on Kratom will do extreme harm to our country and cause a greater rise in our countries opioid/heroine pandemic. Kratom has helped me in more ways than one; pain, anxiety, appetite gain, mood lift, relaxation yet alert and more. I was on hydrocodone and other pain medicines as well as xanax and soma. Since I had discovered Kratom through a friend (whom I doubted it worked) I had since moved on from all prescription narcotics, soma, though I still take Xanax, I have decreased my dosage by half. I would like to add that I have no negative reaction or adverse effect while taking Kratom. Being on all of those drugs turned me into a zombie who was unhealthy and  not happy with my life's path. Since I've gotten off these prescription drugs and have used kratom, I have gained 20 pounds, eating regularly, it has helped me stop smoking and caused  me to have no impulse to turn back to these drugs after transitioning off of the prescriptions and onto Kratom. I believe it has saved my life and thank god every day to live my life. I have a beautiful girlfriend now, a kid on the way. I urge the DEA to reconsider the ban as a whole and let us live. I also urge the DEA and FDA to try this plant, I have given and suggested it to multiple people, not a single person said it did help them in some way positively. There is so much to benefit from this plant, I'm not urging anyone to try it, though if you have issues like mine or similar and don't want to complete rely on prescription drugs, this is definitely worth a try. I ask the DEA to please reconsider, I don't want to live in pain, especially when there is a plant that can help, and not just for me, but millions of others now and I'm sure just as many that could use Kratom in the future.

Although relatively unheard of in our American society, this herbal plant is no more dangerous than one's morning cup of coffee or tea. \n\n\nIn a time of rampant prescription drug abuse, it stands to reason that taking this plant and subjecting it to the harshest scheduling available would only cause more problems. Statistically, opioids have proven to be a far more dangerous threat to public safety and health, causing new addictions and fatal overdoses daily. \n\n\nTo classify, and thereby ban Kratom, as a schedule 1 drug, is a move which is unprecedented and uncalled for. The scheduling of Kratom into a class 1 drug would not only severely limit any future research on this beneficial plant, but would also turn functioning, productive members of our society into criminals overnight. Just as we would not ban or regulate one's daily coffee intake, so too should we not inflict such unreasonable restrictions on the Kratom plant.\n\n\nIt is the DEA's responsibility to act in the best interest of the American public, however to ban a substance which has gotten significantly less calls to Poison Control than everyday laundry detergent pods would be to jump to damaging conclusions. Like any substance, the unbiased studying of the Kratom plant may help us to better understand its effects during use. However, a schedule 1 classification would lead to a severe restriction on such research and ultimately cripple the possibilities that this plant could offer to many suffering Americans. Many polls suggest that the average Kratom user is none other than your average, productive member of the Baby Boomer generation, rather than someone simply seeking a recreational high. \n\n\nPersonally, I have witnessed the numerous benefits that can be experienced from the responsible consumption of the Kratom plant. After a surgical malpractice which left a hole in his rib cage, my husband was diagnosed with Post Thoracotomy Pain Syndrome (PTPS). PTPS is a rare condition which leaves the sufferer struggling with debilitating chronic pain, and oftentimes, missing rib cage bones. Due to this, my husband is partially disabled and in severe chronic pain everyday. Traditional modern medicine prescribes my husband intense opioids to treat and manage the pain and nerve damage. However, these opioids come with their own set of side effects, many of which only add to his daily struggle. His prescribed use of opioids left him with no appetite, constipation, and dulled senses among other debilitating side effects.\n\n\nAfter discovering Kratom, my husband was able to buy it legally over the counter from a reputable source. He was not subjected to the dangerous underground market, but was treated like a normal human being looking for natural pain relief. In the two years since, I have watched how the incorporation of Kratom into a holistic lifestyle has significantly helped his quality of life. Not only was my husband able to wean himself off of the highly addictive opioids, but he also functions better on a daily basis due to his consumption of Kratom. When he uses Kratom as part of his holistic pain management, he is able to have substantial pain relief, eat regularly, and in general, function better. Through the use of Kratom, my husband has been able to not only actually function in his daily life but also be a better father when he otherwise would be in too much pain to even get out of bed. \n\n\nTo ban Kratom would not only negatively affect my husband but would damage our entire family, leaving my newborn daughter without the dad she could otherwise have. Without Kratom, my husband would suffer from disabling chronic pain too much to be an active part in her life and she would be unnecessarily robbed of the possibilities of such an important relationship. Like so many other children, the Kratom plant plays a significant role in the quality of life of parents across the nation which results in a positive effect for our daughter among others.  \n\n\nIn conclusion, America is the land of the free and to take away our God given right to consume an herbal plant without harm to others is to disgrace all that we have fought for.

This is problematic for someone who suffers from deep and widespread chronic pain all over my body from my 20 years of service. I was introduced to Kratom five years ago and have been using it on a near daily basis for pain management on top of the only two OTC NSAIDS that I can tolerate gastrointestinally. I am as dependent on Kratom for my pain management as many Americans are on opioids for their own pain management. The removal of Kratom from the open market would negatively impact my quality of life to an extreme level. I have been using this medication for years and can say without any reservations that Kratom is superior to opioids for pain management due to the fact that you can not become intoxicated or \"high\" as you can with opioids nor would your body tolerate a dose high enough to be fatal without making you nauseatingly and violently ill, there is just no physical way to OD on Kratom unlike a eight pills of OxyContin to kill you. All of the opioid side effects are negated with Kratom, so there is no need to be on three other medications while using Kratom, unlike opioids. If the FDA does its research properly instead of relying on dollars to push a new drug to market they will finds that Kratom truly is a medication while all the pills from factories are the harmful \"drugs\" that society is killing itself on.  The removal of Kratom is not just problematic for myself but would be a crime against the citizens of this nation as a form of cruel and unusual punishment for those of us who can not tolerate most big pharma drugs.

I do not think that this is an effective strategy to achieve that goal.\n\nAlmost everyone who does hard drugs knows that their habit is negatively affecting their life. The problem is that the pull that these drugs have over addicts is an extremely powerful force that is unknown to anyone who has not been in that position. I have been in that position.\n\nIt is not possible for a person regularly using heroin, Oxycontin, Fentanyl, or similar drugs to quit cold turkey. And I say this as a person who believes anything is possible through massive will power and a bit of luck. The best way to quit is to slowly taper down over a series of levels. This is a fact supported by the prescription tendencies of medical doctors. Even addicts jailed for periods of time are provided with Methadone, another Scheduled narcotic. Kratom provides a very effective intermediate step between addiction and sobriety. Not only is it effective in reducing withdrawal symptoms and muting urges, but it also is effective in providing a former addict the confidence needed to achieve sobriety.\n\nNow, I don't know if whoever reading this has any experience with the plant, but it is absolutely disgusting. (Literally awful, I'm gagging just thinking about it) There is no way to consume this plant without the extremely unpleasant taste and texture. For former addicts, this experience is worth enduring for the chance to achieve sobriety. But this is a barrier that a regular, healthy person would not dare to try and hurdle. This simple fact is the reason why it is, and will always be, a niche plant.\n\nI believe that by scheduling the plant, much more harm than good will be done. Addicts will be deprived of an extremely important route to sobriety, which will in turn increase the likelihood of hard substance abuse. Regular folks will not be affected by this new rule, as the sawdust texture and flavor keep most people from using it in the first place.\n\nI urge the government to reconsider their policy decision.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16360","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Hassan Mason","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Found kratom when googling homeopathic alternative to Percocet.

In fact, there is very little evidence for or against the use of kratom at all. For example, a PubMed search from 11/30/16 returns only 86 results for the term kratom, and only 131 for the term mitragynine. This is hardly a large enough body of empirical work on which to base decisions about banning kratom. (For comparison, a PubMed search for alcohol returns over 855,000 unique articles.)\n\nThis empirical literature is mixed. While there have been reports of toxicity related to kratom use,1 a review of the literature reveals that these appear to be a uniquely Western phenomenon, and in these cases, kratom was largely being used with other drugs.2 In Southeast Asia, where kratom originates and has been used for centuries, death has not been known to result from kratom use.2 Kratom has been found to have potential for both therapy and abuse.3,4 More research is desperately needed on kratom and its constituents,2,5 and placing kratom in Schedule I would effectively prohibit this research. \n\nThis research would be especially timely, as America is in the midst of an opioid epidemic. Overdose rates are skyrocketing, and I see this borne out in epidemiological studies as well as in the loss of my loved ones. We need every tool we can get to fight the devastation caused by opioid addiction. Importantly, kratom has been identified as a potential tool for helping people who suffer from addiction: it can act as an analgesic itself, and users report that it is a great help in the painful process of opioid withdrawal.6 This can help people detoxify from opioids, which is one of the major barriers to entering recovery. I argue that we should be promoting research into any avenue that can help end the opioid epidemic. Research in this area is limited, and scheduling kratom would further limit this research.\n\nI do not support the scheduling of kratom, or its constituent chemicals, at this time. This would not be an evidence-based decision, as there is too little evidence to draw from. A Schedule I placement would further limit empirical research. While waiting for this research, people suffering from chronic pain and addiction are already using kratom to improve their health and functioning. Scheduling kratom at this time is simply not sensible for patients and scientists, nor a good use of the DEAs resources. \n\nThank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this proposed rule. \n\n\nReferences\n1.

Eventually my doctor recommend suboxone as solution for kicking my hydrocodone addiction. When I started taking suboxone my problems only became worse, as I grew dependent on it as well. I was not a the same person I once was, feeling un motivated, agitated and extremely depressed. I often had thoughts of suicide, feeling like a junkie and losing the will go on each day. I fealt I would never be the same energetic happy person i use to be. Then one day I heard about kratom and at first I admit I was sceptical knowing nothing about it. Having no other options I broke down and tried it. Right away I fealt relief from stress and pain. After just two weeks I was able to conquer my addiction to opiates and immediately fall out of depression. I even noticed it gave me energy and motivated me to be more social. The best part is I didn't feel addicted, being able go a week or two without it if I didnt have the money for it. Kratom truely is a miracle plant, it's saved my life and so many others. There is no documented deaths from kratom alone and is proven to be safer than alchohol, pharmaceuticals, and even caffeine. Please dont take this life changing herb away from us that could potentially rid america of the dreadful opium disease thats sweeping the nation!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1096","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Clifford Mcgee","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir or Mam,\n\n I started taking Kratom 5 years or so ago ... I take it about 3 times a week or so to help with RLS and pain that can not be treated with long term opiate that doctors prescribe .. Long term opiates can hurt my life but Kratom is very light and has saved me from going on the street for drugs .. I can not afford doctors that do not prescribe the right things and are worried about what you have them worried about .. I use kratom and it helps , If you take it away I will go on the street to get whats needed .. and then you will arrest me .. I don't think that is the correct course of action for a person that has Restless leg Syndrome and cant sleep , I don't think I should be arrested due to a sleeping illness but if you think that is wise then you are the law makers and I am not . It should not be a doctor prescribed medicine because I dont have a doctor for asprin so I dont need one for kratom ... If you take too much asprin it hurts , If you take too much of ANY medicine it hurts the body . If you eat too much SUGAR it hurts the body , Dont make sugar a prescribed medicine that doctors dole out just because it hurts the body and kills people who take too much .. Also dont do that with kratom beacuse you are putting good people on the street to find what they need , Putting them in danger , and then arresting them for doing that . I have no criminal record and am in my 30s , The thought of you doing this scares me and many others .\n\n\nThank you and respectfully ,\n\nj","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16872","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason Meyer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe that Kratom should be studied further before making it illegal.

I am submitting this comment to tell how kratom has helped me. I am a lifelong Scheuermann's Disease sufferer. I have severe pain that was helped for a long time by prescription painkillers. I no longer have access to them and kratom has allowed me to at least function on a day to day basis. I don't know what I would do without it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13092","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Edmund Blazek","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello. I am a regular kratom user and have been for three years. I have had no negative effects from it this whole time. I've had plenty of positive things. I was a heavy IV opiate user for 15 years. Was in a methadone treatment program for 4 years. Since I found kratom I have not used any opiates of any sort. It has literally changed my life. I've got a wife and two kids and it has saved my marriage and family. I know many more people who have benefited from this plant and I hope you take all of this into consideration.
