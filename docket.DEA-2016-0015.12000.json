Pills, fentanyl, the occasional dope.  I had only been an addict for about two years, but I had already messed \nup my life big time.  I spent like 4 or 5 months total in the hospital and nursing home.  There they treated me with tons of morphine and dilaudid, which I needed to breathe.  It was probably the most IV opiates I have ever had.  Eventually my illnesses got better and I was released to the world, with a nice referral to the methadone clinic.  \n\nbecause I am prescribed clonazepam, I got kicked out of the methadone clinic twice, immediately returning to heroin both times, because I was more addicted than I had ever been.  I tried constantly, but the suboxone urinalysis were impossible for me to get into, because their policy is you have to be clean from heroin to get into the suboxen program, I tried, but if I could make it through the first week of heroin withdrawals then I wouldn't need opioid replacements.  So I struggled with those options and heroin for two more years.    \n\nI quit using heroin two years ago when my fiancee died.  I was clean for two months when I started craving and was positive I would relapse... Methadone clinics are full of junkies that just want to supplement their addiction in my experience, there was a huge risk for sudden discontinuation, which certainly would have led me back to heroin or killed me with my heart problems. (*1) suboxone gives me panic attacks (*2), and Narcotics Anonymous and therapy just makes me depressed and want to use again (because I have OCD, Major Recurrent Depression, Panic Disorder and general Anxiety, and more).  Even therapy was useless because the OCD interferes with it.  \n\nSo, two months after my fiancee died, Following advice from my psychiatrist, John Seymour Howland, Md., I have been, for two years, taking opoid replacement therapy.  Instead of traditional methadone/suboxen drugs, which, as I mentioned, have intolerable side effects and social implications detrimental to my recovery, I have been taking kratom ever since.  I drink it with water about three times a day.  It doesn't make me high, there is no euphoria from this herbal remedy.  It works similar to suboxone by not activating all 5 of the opoid receptors in our brain.  (*3).  \n\nI have had no ill effects, and full relief from my opiate cravings, without the debilitating high or withdrawl effects.  To be honest, there are withdrawl effects, but they are barely noticeable. Maybe slightly watery eyes for a few days.  I buy kratom from USA vendors only.  I think it is a critical dietary supplement for our country, and if it needs to be taxed because it comes from overseas, so be it, but it does not need to be scheduled.  I like the state laws that were recently passed, limiting kratom purchase to 18+ aged individuals.  Kratom should come with literature including its ancient origins and instructions like to not mix with certain drugs or alcohol, since the only times people have died involving kratom were mainly due to complications from something else.  Kratom is safe when used properly, and if I had a child with chronic pain I would want him or her to eat kratom herb instead of take dangerous pharmaceutals.  My elderly mother said that she would eat kratom instead of take drugs from doctors if she was in pain.  Remember, this drug saved me from heroin relapse.  Relapse killed my fiance.  Do the right thing and let the states keep their momentum in regulating this herbal supplement.\n\nSincerely,\nRichard J Howard\n\n*source needed\n(1) www.news-journalonline.com/news/20130420/methadone-treatment-raises-questions-about-profit-motive-patient-care\n(2)suboxonetalkzone.com/are-you-anxious-are-you-sure/\n(3)https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18259963","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11937","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Howard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 50yrs old & due to a workplace injury in 1999 which resulted in permanent nerve damage to my upper back & neck left me in chronic pain, as I still work 40+ hours a week over the course of years I have been prescribed every pain pill imaginable, the last one's I was prescribed I tried to stop taking because of the side effects, but to no avail, then about 6yrs. ago I was introduced to a natural herb that not only stopped the pain, there were no withdrawals from stopping the pharmaceutical pain medication, & I have told everyone I know about this amazing natural pain remedy, & I believe to make this herb illegal would be a great injustice to the people that use it as for its many therapeutic properties, & I urge you to reconsider.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20937","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bruce McComas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not limit my ability to try Kratom to heal my opiate addiction.

They came away clear headed and \"well\" from their sickness. All they had to do was stay clean, in which kicking the drug and going through detox can be the hardest part of getting sober. I personally feel that this is all for show, asking for public opinion on the topic of banning kratom. When has the government ever allowed the people to determine what natural remedies are healthy and beneficial to them. The farce is to allow the 'people' to falsely believe that this situation is in their hands, and the DEA will work in their best interests. In reality I believe that this pause of banning kratom, a natural beneficial product, is a way to pretend to care about the 'people'. The result of this farce is the DEA will just criminalize this plant too. It is criminal the way the government is banning natural, safe treatments and cures, just because it can't be patented. This is the same garbage as the war on cannabis alongside Patent No. 6630507, held by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. They hold a patent for treatments with a substance that is labeled so bad that there is no medical use for it. How is this? One agency, the DEA, states no medical benefits and lists this substance with heroin; and another,  the United States Department of Health and Human Services, holds a patent on particular medicinal properties of the exact same plant. I believe this farce of reaching out to gather public opinion is to cover the true path of the DEA, to continue on with the war on drugs, or as Nixon said, criminalize substances to keep the hippies in check and criminalize the black population.

It has recently come to my attention that your agency is considering adding kratom to its list of schedule I banned substances.  Speaking from my experiences, I believe that such a decision would be in error, and I am writing to you to let you know why I think so.\n\nI myself have only tried kratom a couple of times.  I was told by friends that it caused a pleasant and relaxed state of being; when I tried it, I found that it actually didn't affect me very much at all (though I suppose there was a mild sense of relaxation).  I haven't repeated it since, because honestly, it didn't do much for me - but I have several friends who still swear by it.  I have a friend who suffers from extreme anxiety, and for her, kratom is the only thing she's found that allows her to function in her day-to-day life.  I have another friend who has a chronic pain condition that normal pain medications do nothing for; for him, kratom is the most non-invasive, affordable, and effective mitigant for his pain that he has yet found.  \n\nI had never heard of kratom until the last year or so, and since then have been interested in it and done a bit of reading around.  No one I know, or have heard of, has had a negative experience with kratom; everything I've seen or heard of it has been either positive or neutral.  When it comes to preventing free Americans from consuming whatever herbs, supplements, or \"drugs\" they wish to consume, I believe that there should be a compelling argument from the government regarding the public good, or prevention of public harm, that would come from such a restriction.  Through my informal, personal research, I have found nothing that would indicate that such reasons exist.\n\nI personally know people whose health and happiness depend on kratom.  I've never met or heard of someone who was harmed by it, or harmed secondhand by its effects.  I urge you to continue to allow its use, as to do otherwise would cause much more harm than good.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRyan D","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19967","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan D","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 36 year old male. I began using kratom a month ago because I heard that it might help me because it helps people with mental illness. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder  in 2007, which means I have moods and paranoia, and I have been receiving disability benefits and unable to work since then. On a dose of 5 grams in the morning and 3 grams in the afternoon, I noticed I was much more effective at getting things done and was no longer upset and scared all the time. \n\nIn the past in social situations, I often did not understand what was going on, and spent a lot of time being afraid, making grandiose stories up based on what people were saying ( doctors call this psychosis ). In the past two weeks, I have been involved in two important social gatherings where I was more functional than I have been in the past 10 years, able to understand what people were saying, able to express my ideas, and even able to laugh. This is important because I had become isolated with almost no friends due to my mental illness.\n\nIn the past month, I have started working as a tutor and website designer in a large part due to the effects of kratom. A week ago, I was involved in a difficult tutoring session that would have normally scared me so much I would have been paranoid and had difficulty completing the lesson, but instead, since I was on kratom, I completed the lesson successfully. I have had three five-star reviews from students on the site where I receive my tutoring jobs, and I am in the process of being paid for making a website for a non-profit organization.\n\nIn the past month, I have made friends and been able to work because of kratom.

Please understand that by placing this medicinal plant on a schedule 1 substances list, you will effectively be outlawing an herbal supplement that has helped me and some of my family members relieve moderate pain from various medical conditions from which we suffer. Kratom has helped me personally with minor to moderate muscle aches as well as with occasional depression and has also helped me maintain my energy during times of fatigue. When I take Kratom, I do not feel intoxicated nor is my judgment, motor skills, or impulses affected. Also, I do not ever have any withdrawal symptoms after taking Kratom. I prefer taking Kratom to taking other prescription or over the counter medicines due to their potential side effects and also because of my personal philosophy in which I believe in seeking out a herbal and/or natural remedy as a first step in personal health management during times of illness or injury.\n\nKratom should stay available because it has been effective for me and others in my family who suffer with pain and has done so at a lower financial and personal health cost than using traditional pharmaceutical and over the counter medications. I personally began using Kratom when researching herbal cures for aches, depression, and low energy. The end result of that research was an informational web page which described the benefits of Kratom and how they could help my specific health issues. I ordered a small amount not expecting too much but began to realize after two small doses of about 4 grams each, that it seemed to work better than any herbal, prescription, or over the counter medication that I had previously taken. It has also helped my wife alleviate her period cramps, and my father with his chronic back and joint problems. \n\nMaking Kratom Schedule 1 is effectively outlawing it by putting it in a class of substance equal to heroin with similar penalties for possession, use, or sale. This would effectively make people like myself, members of my family, and many others across America like us into a criminal class for using a natural herbal supplement to manage their own health. We don't deserve that, as an American, part of the freedom of living in this great nation is  for making personal health choices that have had real positive effects on our lives. \n\nMy wife and I both work, raise a family, and make current payments on all of our bills, and ingest Kratom occasionally to relieve aches, pains, and fatigue which helps us remain productive in all of these endeavors. We follow the laws, we pay taxes, have excellent credit, and make our best attempt at a middle class lifestyle without receiving any social help from the government. We are not drug addicts or criminals and do not deserve to be considered as such; I pay for my Kratom and everything else in my life through honest means; please don't take that away from myself or my family by making Kratom  a Schedule 1 substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21366","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Schurr","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has NOT been adequately studied to determine its toxicity or danger - or to assess it's usefulness in treating drug abusers seeking to curb in their more dangerous drug habits.

My sister has been using heroin via smoking for several years. She would use kratom when she was off opioids/heroin to avoid withdrawal. I had been prescribed opioids for approximately 1.5 years due to pain from a bad epidural and a jaw disorder. I found myself taking my medication more regularly than prescribed. I decided to try kratom for my pain and withdrawal symptoms. Kratom has been a miracle for me. I take it a few times per day to help with my pain and have found that it helps with my anxiety as well as mood. When I found out there was a ban against kratom I was understandably upset. I was afraid I would be forced to begin taking opioids again and feared my pain would increase and my mood would suffer. I signed the White House petition after finding out  the proposed ban via Reddit. The Reddit community has been a great support for myself as well as many other people. I've read countless stories of people using kratom to stay off of narcotics specifically heroin. The proposed ban on kratom would be devastating for myself and other people who use kratom to help with pain, mood, opioid dependence etc. Please reconsider making kratom a schedule I drug, as this could be potentially fatal for many people who count on kratom to stay off of opioids. I beg of you to do more research on the potential benefits of kratom versus the risks. I can almost assure you that you would find the risks are basically nil. Thank you for your time.

I am a 36 year old professional woman with a college education. I have struggled with endometriosis, which is at times so painful that me knees will buckle and leave me physically unable to stand. The pain from my condition has only grown worse over the years. I also cope with PTSD as well as the anxiety and depression that come along with that disorder. I am under doctor supervision and I am pursuing another surgery for endometriosis. \n\nNow that you have an idea of where I am coming from I'd like to tell you what I have tried. I've been prescribed every opiate under the sun to control my pain. I have been under the care of psychologists and psychiatrists since I was a teen. I had NEVER been able to manage my pain and my PTSD (stress exacerbates both conditions for me). Opiates did nothing other than make me disconnected and irritable.  They did not even touch my pain.  Add to that the fear I experienced while taking opiates - my step father is a psychiatrist who specializes in addiction and I have lost many friends to opiates. Opiates are not something I want to have in my body for those reasons.  \n\nI lived with the pain after I decided that there was no point in even trying to work with opiates any longer (that was in 2012).  I found kratom this year, 2016.  I have gone from being in pain so intense that I miss 2-3 days of work in a row a few times a month to able to function well enough to only miss 1-2 days a month.  I have also noticed that since I started utilizing kratom, my anxiety has lessened.  I am still on alert and still work with PTSD every day, but I no longer shut down or explode as easily.

Deaths that involve Kratom being a persons' system have always been from the result of mixing Kratom with other drugs, rather than Kratom alone. In states that banned Kratom, Alabama specifically, opiate usage and deaths went up after Kratom was banned in the state. Please stop the scheduling of Kratom as Schedule I, there are many people who will suffer from this. I being one of those people. \n\nThree years ago I was addicted to opiates. I started out taking them for pain management due to injury. However it became a habit. Although I was still living in pain I knew I had to get away from the addiction. I could never have done that without Kratom. Kratom literally saved my life! It is the only thing aside from opiates that helps reduce the miserable pain I live in daily. It does so without clouding my judgement or leaving me feeling drugged. The only major side effect I have seen from taking it in three years is the slight stimulant effect it has. That of a cup of coffee. A more subtle and unexpected side effect was how it reduced my social anxieties and depression. Kratom is far safer than even Tylenol. There have been some studies proving this but I say this from my own experience. It is far easier to overdose or harm ones self taking Tylenol than Kratom. \n\nAs for Kratoms addictive properties. Yes it is slightly addictive. However it is far less addictive than coffee or nicotine. It is a whole world less addictive than opiates or any Scheduled Narcotic. Again there have been studies showing this but I speak from my own personal experience. I thought I was going to die from withdraw when first quitting opiates. Until I found Kratom.  When quitting Kratom the only withdraw was a mild fatigue. And of course the pain I live in returning. \n\nIf not for Kratom my life would not be much of a life at all (To say the least). I am not technically disabled just so you know. The pain I live in kept/keeps me from performing properly at my job. I am not able to do many of the things I would normally do. Without effective pain management of some kind even getting out of bed is difficult. Having sex is nearly impossible and pretty much pointless. The pain I live in destroyed my marriage. Took nearly everything I love away from me. If not for Kratom I am fairly certain I wouldn't even be alive today to write this. This is no exaggeration. I am putting this mildly. I was homeless jobless alone and addicted to opiates. Within three months of taking kratom I had found a job doing what I love and found a home again. My life has been on track ever since. Nothing special but I am happy.\n\nI've always thought the talk of Big Pharma was a little crazy. I am not so sure now. I can see no other reason for Kratom to be a Scheduled substance other than the fact it reduces the use (sale) of opiates. With the proper studies and evaluation I know Kratom could replace opiates. It can cure opiate addiction across the country and the world. A less addictive, just as effective pain remedy with a fraction of the side effects and virtually no danger/risk. One that doesn't cloud judgement or leave you feeling Inebriated. \n\nTo make Kratom illegal is absolutely absurd. Kratom is an herb like ginseng or coffee . Not like marijuana or poppies. It DOES NOT get you high. It does cure a great deal of pain and help with the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Making Kratom a scheduled substance will undoubtedly harm a great many people. Kratom has helped so many. It brought me back from the brink of destruction. I know I am not alone in that. Thousands of people have used Kratom to get away from addictions like alcohol and heroin even. It has saved many lives!

She has become about 80% homebound and symptoms continue to have adverse effects on her quality of life.  She found the supplement kratom six months before it became illegal to use or possess in May, 2016 in our home state of Alabama.\n\nDuring the six months she experienced a dramatic relief from her symptoms: pain, brain fog, and lack of energy.  For the first time in over 5 years she was able to attend church services regularly.  She attended our childrens school activities.  She even flew to meet me in New York for a quick getaway (a few weeks before the ban in Alabama) on a business trip.  Friends and family noticed the change when they saw her smiling and enjoying life again.  They asked us what was helping her to feel and look so much better.  The answer:  kratom.\n\nLorrie is currently living her life without kratom because she is a God-fearing woman who obeys the law.  Without kratom, she has returned to being homebound.  It has now been over six months since she experienced its benefits. Once again, she is not able to attend school activities, or church services, and it is unthinkable for her to consider travelling.  The state of Alabama has unsympathetically passed legislation that has taken away my wifes ability to function and her right to take a supplement that provides relief and allows her to enjoy life.\n\nOn my honor... begins the Boy Scout oath.  And so, On my honor I would never encourage or promote something harmful in my family.  Kratom did not produce any unwanted effects while Lorrie was taking it, nor did it produce a harmful reaction when she stopped taking it.  There was no addictive behavior or withdrawals as has been purported.  And there was certainly no high effect.  She would never have continued if that were the case.\n\nAs a husband, I will get on my knees and beg that you do not schedule kratom.  Because I have seen and witnessed how helpful and beneficial it is for my wife.  Lorrie and I are hanging on and hoping and praying that you do not schedule kratom as Alabama has done.  In the event that it remains legal, we will likely move to another state where Lorrie can enjoy life.\n\nRegards,\nTim Richter\n102 Brookwood Dr\nAthens, AL 35613","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3973","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tim Richter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Personal responsibility and not over government regulation should dictate the use of Kratom.

I suffer from a as-of-yet uncharacterized global pain syndrome that shares many traits with fibromyalgia and diabetic neuropathy, but fits the diagnostic criteria for neither.  As the case stands, a doctor cannot in good faith treat an undiagnosable medical condition, even when they are confident the symptoms are genuine. \n\nThis leaves one to fend for themselves.  There are extremely harmful effects of large and sustained usage of NSAIDs and APAP.  In fact they are quite deadly.  The yearly fatalities due APAP alone forces one to consider scheduling Kratom into the most restrictive level as a good starting point to questioning the purpose behind this proposed action from the very start.\n\nI have been taking a stable dose of 6grams of powder leaf Kratom daily for over three years now.  Any negative issue with it has been negligible.  Interestingly, for my particular condition, it actually is superior to TRUE opiate/opioids. It is not a perfect drug but I can assure you that without it, extra-legal options will have to be sought.  Those are the effects of banning Kratom that should be most seriously considered.  Any guilt over breaking the law will be quieted by knowing why I have to and who caused this situation.

Dealing with an unreasonable ex husband has caused more anguish and stress that anyone should have to deal with trying to create the best life for her children.  When seeking professional help, my doctor prescribed me cymbalta than to Prozac to lexapro to help my teeth grinding and migranes along with panic attacks.

This is and was no way to live a happy successful life.  My best friend of 18 years has been knowledgeable and friendly with Kratom, he suggested I try a strain and see if it would extinguish these problems I was having.

I am a retired Fishery Biologist, age 61. I suffer from arthritis in my  hips as a result of doing stream surveys during my career in order to estimate salmon populations in Northern California.\n\nMy hips flare up often, particularly upon rising from sleep.  I have difficulty putting on my pants and squatting to defecate in the morning. The pain at night can keep me awake. To treat my conditions I take three grams of kratom powder in the morning and evening. Kratom  powder, Advil, and physical therapy in the morning and evening allows me to have a productive life where the pain is manageable.\n\nI am puzzled why the DEA is declaring kratom has no medicinal value and is thinking about banning the substance. A simple Google search would reveal evidence  of its value.  I believe the DEA is overreaching on this issue. I believe the DEA may be worried about addiction, its recreational use and considers it a opioid.\n\nPerhaps I should explain. An opioid is derived from the poppy plant family while Kratom hails from the coffee plant family. These families are not closely related and to consider Kratom an opioid is quite off the mark. The DEA should consider consulting a botanist.\n\nKratom has little recreational use because you are not able to get very high on the substance unlike an opioid. You  reach a ceiling of well being and additional amounts will not increase this feeling. Also, Kratom has little effect on the respiratory system unlike opioids and overdose resulting in death is very rare.  The cases where overdose has occured were situations where many drugs were mixed and taken, not just Kratom. \\\n\nWithdrawal from Kratom is mild, similar to coffee withdrawal but a little tougher. Withdrawal in some individuals will last for three to four days.  Opioid addicts do take Kratom to relieve their pain of opoiod withdrawal, then stop taking Kratom. This is another example of a medical use for this plant.\n\nLastly, by banning Kratom you will restrict research on this medically valuable plant.  Would it not be better to let experts and researchers weigh in on this issue?\n\nI hope you reconsider your ban. If you need to contact me, feel free to do so. \n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael R Lau","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13369","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Lau","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please compare the pros vs cons on a kratom ban.

My main interest in Kratom is for the benefit of my wife, who is 90% bedridden from chronic pain due to Fibromyalgia, Heavy metal poisoning and degenerative disk disease.  For over a year now, her pain management has been sketchy, with regard to availability of doctors who would prescribe the high doses of opiates she's been on.  And while the opiates are largely ineffective at this point in managing her pain, they've made life sort of bearable.  She is now being forced to get off all her opiate medications; no doctor will even accept her as a patient for pain management as long as she's taking opiates.  This is such a cruel blow; however, i am immensely grateful to the existence and availability of Kratom.  Once she is completely out of opiates and has no other means of controlling the pain, at least a little bit, the Kratom will really come in handy.  Both of us have used it, and have benefitted immensely from it.  I have nerve pain, sometimes severe, but which is currently being well managed with non-opioid prescription medications.  Kratom has definitely helped me when I am in a pain flare; and my wife has also been helped by Kratom when even her opiates were not working.  There have to be options for people who are in pain.  The crackdown on opiate painkillers has drastically narrowed the options.  Kratom is one important component of the options that definitely has to remain available. As one doctor said to me, \"How many people will have to commit suicide due to pain before the government starts to care?\"  Good question.

I had to plan the times that I would use an enema to empty my bowels. The enemas were creating additional damage to my rectum and colon. I have been prescribed 4 of the newest medications for constipation and opiate induced constipation. None of them worked and they made me sick as well. I stopped taking them because they never even gave me a single bowel movement. Now for the first time in years I ask am able to use the restroom without an enema! \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6098","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have listened to many podcasts about Keaton and done my own research and don't understand the stigma in regards to Keaton.

Over the past 7 years I have retailed, wholesaled, and personally consumed kratom. The volume of people in our local community that our three stores have served on a regular basis averages 500-600 people per DAY, and that is a conservative number.  Over the past 7 years my distribution company has sold millions of dollars of kratom to other retailers throughout the nation.  If our customers were getting sick, or worse suffering life threatening reactions from kratom I would have been informed, and people would not come back to purchase or order it again.  It really is common sense.  \n\nWhile I believe that it is possible that there may be kratom products out there being sold that are inferior, overall the kratom community, manufacturers and importers are genuinely trying to offer a quality herbal option for people to use as supplement in their lives. There are several reasons that I believe this supplement should be kept legal, and readily available for adult Americans. For ease of communicating the most critical points I have outlined them below.\n1) Adult Americans should be able to choose what type of alternative herbal therapies to supplement their lifestyle. Especially when they are a fully functioning participant in their own lives as well as society.  Just as we allow people to choose melatonin, valerian root, chamomile, vitamin C, echinacea, coffee, tea, or papaya enzymes to supplement their lifestyle without negative consequence. \n2) Keeping kratom legal allows responsible adult Americans to purchase a supplement where tax dollars are collected at both state and federal levels. Prohibition always, literally always (it is US history) pushes money into the \"underground market\" where no tax dollars are being collected. Plus when it is legal it is providing jobs in our local economies where again taxes are paid. No street \"dealers\" are reporting their income and paying taxes. \n3) If kratom is legal there can be accountability for how it is imported, processed, packaged, transported and sold. Should it become an illegal substance the DEA will be opening the door for the herb to be turned into the \"beast\" that they are claiming it to be by pushing it to the streets where it can be cut pr mixed with dangerous substances, or worse, may not even be kratom while being sold under the guise of kratom. \n4) The economic impact on our nation overall would be huge.  The amount of loss in tax dollars pales in comparison to the amount of jobs that would be lost.  Our retail stores have already suffered 4 layoff's due to the initial announcement and the actions that were taken by the City and County of Denver. My distribution company also had layoffs due to the proposed ban. The economic impact of this decision on our nation can not be ignored. \n5) Addiction seems to be a big concern when it comes to kratom. Personally my belief is that anything can be addictive and our society in particular is a testament to my stance. We glorify coffee, alcohol, fast food, perscription medications, cigarettes, designer clothes, and so much more through our marketing, advertising and social media. What I think is the most important factor in human addiction is whether or not the person can maintain a productive and healthy lifestyle. Meaning that if someone is addicted to coffee and has to have two cups each morning but then proceeds through their day working, parenting, etc. without negative consequences then it is simply a part of who they are.  If someone is going in to debt visiting coffee shops, gaining weight with sugary coffee drinks, possibly getting sick from too much caffeine or sugar, than their addiction is causing negative consequences and they may need help. Be honest with yourself, if you look around your own life you know someone who bites their nails, smokes cigarettes, drinks too much soda, possibly takes perscription pills unnecessarily,  or binge shops, addiction is a part of our society. And something that really only needs intervention if it is causing a negative impact on the lives of either the person with the addiction or others. \n\nWith all due respect I ask that you take an honest look at the facts, including the number of people who use kratom that have not had any negative consequences versus the number of calls from concerned individuals who have reached out for medical help.  More people get sick from caffeine, sugar, alcohol, cleaning products and improperly handled foods each year than from kratom. \n\nI appreciate your consideration in keeping kratom safe and legal for adult Americans. \n\nSincerely,\nJennifer A.

However, the pharmaceutical company Trevena is synthesizing Kratom alkaloids into a new safer painkiller called Oliceridine.\n\nHow can you claim it has no medicinal benefit while at the same time, trying to patent it as medicine? \nKratom needs to go the route of Kava.

Kratom is a great help to me.  I have Fibromyalgia, Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease, and Rheumatoid Arthritis with other autoimmune diseases.  Because Multiple Chemical Sensitivities is part of my symptoms my doctors have told me to use herbs to supplement my diet and help with the uncomfortable times I go through.  I have been using allopathic medicine to treat my illnesses for 25 years but because I am sensitive to synthetic chemicals I frequently suffer from intensely negative side effects from many of the medications. Through experience and personal research I have found avoiding, as much as possible, synthetic chemicals in food, products, and medications alleviates the problems associated with side effects.  Kratom is one of the herbs I have found to be most effective.  Kratom helps me get up in the morning similar to how many people use coffee.  It is also useful to drink Kratom tea during the day as it gives me that little push of energy in order to work past the extreme pain I experience every day and have suffered from for more than 25 years.  For the last 20 years I have suffered from insomnia due to the consistent pain I experience.  Since finding herbal Kratom 9 months ago I can finally have restful replenishing sleep.

I say limited experience because I only recently discovered kratom during a quest for an alternative to opioid pain medication, which I have been prescribed for nearly three solid years. I do live in a state where medical marijuana is legal, but it is costly and requires time to obtain (I have many doctor appointments as it is). I also do not like the side effects from smoked marijuana and, until recently, edibles and alternative forms were not available to medical marijuana patients in my state. After doing some research on kratom I decided to give it a try and I am not exaggerating when I say it was nothing short of a god send for me. Let me tell you my story.\n\nI am a 38 year old woman born and raised in the great state of Michigan. I grew up in a middle class family and went to public schools where I graduated with honors and was a member of the National Honor Society. I earned an Associate's Degree in Business from a community college and graduated Magna Cum Laude. I've worked since the age of 14, starting out as a Subway Sandwich Artist and landed in a Customer Service role around the age of 21 and I am still in that field today as a CSR Trainer. Also around the age of 21, I was officially diagnosed with Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). A brief description of HS is that is an inflammatory condition which may be auto-immune related and causes painful abscesses, typically in the armpit, groin, back and abdomen. There are different stages and patients with HS can have varying degrees of severity. It is chronic. There is no cure, there is very little known about its cause and no consistent treatment...what works for one person may not work at all for the next. Many patients will have multiple surgeries, numbering into the hundreds. The best an HS patient can hope for is remission. I have yet to reach that point. \n\nOver the years since my diagnosis my symptoms have become progressively worse. I have severe lesions in my armpits and groin, continuous abscesses with tunneling and scarring. They are constant, they are numerous, and they are extraordinarily painful. The abscesses vary in size from that of a pea to as large as a lemon. They can become infected in which case the pain level is magnified exponentially. I've had a surgical consult. The prognosis is that I may lose all range of motion of my arms with no guarantee that the surgery will be successful in preventing recurrence. Every day activities are painful for me, starting with the simplest of tasks...like getting dressed. Therefore I've been prescribed anti-inflammatory medications (ibuprofen) and opioid pain medication. \n\nWith all of the recent publicity of opioid addiction, overdoses, and fatalities; naturally, I've become concerned about the long term use of narcotics. Also, there are harmful side effects to consider, such as liver damage, kidney disease, and heart disease from long term use of ibuprofen. I needed to find an alternative and I found one, kratom. From the first use I was astounded. The relief was almost immediate after ingesting a relatively small amount (about one and a half teaspoons mixed with juice). I haven't experienced any negative side effects, beyond the awful taste. I don't experience any dizziness, nauseousness, or sleepiness as I sometimes do with the opioid pain medicine. It doesn't always get rid of the pain, there are times when I still need the opioids; but since I discovered kratom I've been able to significantly reduce my use of prescription pain meds and ibuprofen. And I can function completely after taking kratom; there is no impairment like there can be with opioids. \n\nWhen I learned that the DEA was seeking to classify kratom as a schedule I narcotic I was deeply dismayed. I'm only one person but I know how much it has helped me and to classify this plant, a cousin to coffee, as a dangerous narcotic with no medical potential is short-sighted and arbitrary. It needs to be studied and researched and a schedule I classification will make it extremely difficult, if not impossible to do so. I urge you, I implore you...table this emergency classification and allow the scientific and medical community to continue its work regarding kratom. Discovering kratom was life changing for me; I know I'm not the only one. The community of Americans suffering chronic debilitating diseases deserve for every, and any, potential treatment to be fully examined. Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21147","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, Kratom has been a life-saver to myself and my finances for a number \nof years now and cannot be banned.

I am 55 years old and work hard to be a responsible member of our great country. \nAfter a spine injury 20 years ago, i was prescribed Tramadol. Tramadol is a great mild pain killer but EXTREMELY adictive, but was pushed as non addictive....  at that time.\n Well it was later found out to be more adictive than Heroin. Tramadol was also very effective for Narcolepsy, which i was diagnosed with 16 years ago.\n\nAfter finding that tramadols were seriously affecting my Testosterone levels, i opted to attempt withdrawing from the tramadols. Something i NEVER though could be possible given Tramadols grip on me.\n\nKnowing a few cancer patients led to a conversation about pain meds and alternative safer options, i was educated on Kratom and its pros & cons. \n Other than the taste, there were Zero cons. I spent 5 months studying Kratom and reading real life accounts on how it gave addicts (Heroin etc) there Lives back. \n  Kratom, a simple leaf off a tree, was found to be the tool needed to give them trapped souls, an effective way to become productive members of society again.\n\nI did two trial runs using Kratom to withdraw from my Dr prescribed Tramadol. The first test was not done to permanantly withdraw, but to see if it would work. It did work and even though it took a month, i was off of a drug that i NEVER thought i could stop. \nBeing it helped with Narcolepsy, i went back on Tramadols again, for its wake up ability, But This was before i realised i had extremely low testosterone. Six months later, after suffering from low Test, I decided to PERMANANTLY get this drug out of my life. One month on kratom , using it every 4-6 hours, 24hours a day, gave me the ability to withrdraw AND run my Transmission shop. \n I stopped the Kratom on the day i took my last weened amount of Tramadol and suffered Zero withdrawl symptoms, other than a few days of feeling like i stopped drinking coffee.\n\nThis is an honest account of my experience.\n\nDeath from Kratom??? I understand 15 foolish people figured out a way to do this in the last 15 years. \nThe death from Heroin 10,000 and counting\n\nIt does not take a college education to figure out the math. \n\nHaving said all this, I cannot for the life of me, figure out how anyone could possibly abuse Kratom. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE, unless your eating it dry and suffocate. There is no way possible way to overdose on it without throwing up way before its effects are even felt.\n\nKratom saves lives and this is quite evident. To make it a crime to use it, IS a crime in itself. \n The backlash the FDA is getting over this obvious knee jerk decision to ban Kratom speaks very clearly.\n\n Its a choice of doing the right thing for the people. We pay taxes and we vote. A line was crossed with a total disregard for the truth. We as Americans, have a duty, to protect ourselves against a government that lost touch with the people. We need to see accountabilty for any action taken,  We are thankful that The DEA has the wisdom try to correct a serious mistake.\n\nThe act of banning Kratom has a \"follow the money\" corrupt smell and its time the FDA changes its prorities and starts HELPING people, instead of persuing an agenda that alienates the millions that are in need of help. \n\nDo the Right thing here. \n Drug addiction has no social boundries. The Heroin epidemic is exploding in the USA. Kratom is the key that unlocks that addiction. \n\nI, John Kutzler, stand behind this statement.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5533","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Kutzler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom tea cannot be over dosed on, and has many medicinal benefits.

I started using Kratom about 2 months into my recovery and I have not craved anything since. I was addicted to them for 3 years. Kratom has saved my life.

I live a very active and productive life, and in part that is due to the plant kratom.\n\nI was in two major car accidents in the 90's that left me with damaged muscle tissue in my neck and back, which causes me a lot of pain and discomfort. I began using Mitragyna Speciosa (kratom) about a year ago after researching alternatives to the prescription painkillers I have used that  make me feel really weird and are addictive. I talked to friends that had tried it, and read various testimonials online about how effective it is in treating pain. I found out it has been used safely by people for thousands of years. What I have found in kratom is amazing. It relieves my pain, gives me energy, and relieves my anxiety that I was suffering regularly in not being able to get enough done because of pain. I take it about 3-6 times per week, depending on my pain level, and so far I have not experienced any side effects, other than occasional dry mouth. I have not found it to be addictive,  and have stopped using it abruptly on several occasions with no problems. I do choose to use it regularly, however, because it is so helpful with relieving my chronic pain and anxiety.\n\nThis is a plant that has helped many, and could potentially help many many more that suffer from chronic pain and other conditions. More research should be encouraged about this plant, and by placing it as a schedule one drug, that research will be hindered. I will also not have access to an amazing medicine that has helped me more than anything else I have tried. Please don't take away my hope of leading a healthy, active, pain-free life.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRhea Wiersema","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21970","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rhea Wiersema","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please reconsider your decision to ban Kratom.

He had become a slave to opioids, the efficacy of which was steadily decreasing, until a pain-management specialist suggested we give Kratom a try. I had my doubtshow was this herb going to provide the same relief as the strong pain pills that my son had been prescribed? My son, however, was adamant about giving it a try, and he was elated to discover that it actually worked. A simple tea made from ground up leaves! And it didn't make him drowsy or spacey or dull feeling. It was a miracle, and it opened my eyes to the therapeutic potential of plants. If we can find a natural remedy that is as effective and costs less than pharmaceutical drugs, we'd be crazy to prohibit its use. Since my son started taking Kratom in 2013, I have come to know many, many people who benefit from its use, and I have never heard a single story about Kratom harming anyone, other than a little nausea.

I am an artist, have been a computer programmer, and am currently washing dishes for a job. I suffer from a condition called ankylosing spondylitis, and it causes my spine to slowly fuse together. I have battled this discomfort since my early 20s and spent more than 10 years on powerful narcotic pain medicines, including the dependence/addiction that often accompanies them. In 2009 and I got off of the narcotics and began to accept the fact that I would be in constant pain without reprieve. During this time, alcohol was often used at the end of the day to get a break from the pain. Due to the turn in the economy, I have had to take jobs as a janitor and dishwasher, the latter of which I am currently still employed as. These types of jobs are much harder to accomplish when you are in pain than a desk job programming software. Middle class people often times have no idea how physically hard these types of jobs can be.\n\nThis is about where I found kratom. 5 or 6 years ago I began to try it out to lessen the pain I feel, and to my surprise it worked better than the pain killers, for me. Kratom never takes the pain away completely, as the narcotics do, but it drops it down to a level that is very manageable. The amazing part in my experience has been the lack of the SEVERE dependence that happens when you have to take the pain killers every day. The withdrawals from those pills is by far the worst feeling I have ever experienced. This does not happen to me with kratom; I may feel a little tired, but there is no all encompassing horrendous withdrawal if I choose to not take it. For me this was, and is, very important, because even though I am always in pain, I do not want to be dependent on narcotics, so taking them is not an option for me. All other alternatives I have tried have done virtually nothing to lessen my back pain, but kratom allows me to lower those pain levels to what I imagine a regular 38 year old male to feel. I also rarely consume alcohol anymore, as I do not feel as though I need to have a drink to subdue the pain I am in. This is another amazing aspect that kratom could offer to millions of people who suffer from alcoholism, as I know I was not the only person who drank to dull physical pain.\n\nIf kratom is banned, what shall I do? It would seem as though my only alternative would be pain management with narcotics. As i stated before, this is not an option for me, so the banning of kratom will sentence me to being in pain, with little to no chance of controlling it.\n\nIn this time where opioid addiction is at an all time high, how many people like myself do you think are out there that will be sent back into the throws of addiction/dependence upon opioid pain killers? The fact that there are thousands of us out here that CHOOSE a natural alternative should please the government agencies that regulate \"drugs\"... as that is thousands of people who will NOT be on opioids. It seems backwards to me, as if the government is saying \"well opioids are dangerous, but we would rather you be addicted to them\".\n\nWhat natural supplements we as Americans choose to take, I am of the opinion that it is none of the governments business. With all of the problems our country is facing today, I cannot understand why the DEA wants to make a new problem by turning thousands of us out here into criminals by banning kratom. \n\nI am no criminal. I am just a man who is always in pain, and am thankful to have found a natural alternative so that I can live a life free from the darkness of opioid dependence and pain. I am not claiming that kratom cures pain... but I am sharing my story, and if it isn't the kratom that has lessened my pain to manageable levels, then I am at a loss to figure out what is responsible. I understand the dangers of making medical claims that have not been established... but I better understand the day and night difference between my pain with kratom, and without.\n\nPlease do not attempt to turn me into either a criminal, or back to opioids, by banning kratom. In nearly 20 years of fighting this disease, the only two things that ever helped were opioids and kratom. Other alternatives that medical professionals have suggested have done nothing for me. Kratom could be a miracle for millions of opioid dependent people out there... but not if it is classified along side heroin as a schedule 1 drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22122","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"brandon douglass","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello to everybody.

I graduated with an accounting degree from the University of Georgia  who has one of the top ten public accounting programs in the country. I came across Kratom maybe seven years ago as a supplement to help with joint pain from years of soccer and cross country. Not to mention for my shoulder that was torn during a soccer game. As a bonus despite being a successful real estate agent I have social anxiety and Kratom helped me dramatically with that. From the time I came across it I took it daily and would credit it with helping build my successful real estate flipping business. It also allowed me to avoid dangerous drugs like alcohol, opiates, or benzodiazepines. In fact I know a number of people who were able to get off those drugs after years of addiction with the help of Kratom. To be a schedule one drug would be absolutely ridiculous. It's as safe as a strong cup of coffee and should be treated as a herbal supplement, which is exactly what it is. That is how it is handled  Canada without any drama. Any reports of people overdosing and going to the hospital is a joke. It is impossible to overdose solely on Kratom, the worst that may happen if you take way too much is you'll throw it up and feel immediately better vs opiates that will kill you. Most likely any claims like that were people on multiple other drugs. In closing if just like to say that it would be a crime to outlaw such a helpful supplement that has helped not just me dramatically but many people I know also. Regulating as a supplement should also protect those taking it from unscrupulous people who might be selling adulterated product because of the governments backwards way of dealing with it.

The night I was proposed to was the very same day, (earlier) a friend of mine told me about Kratom. I could not believe what I was hearing. My now fiance had surgery on 2 discs in his lower back and as a result was prescribed 45 ml opiate painkillers per day since 2010. I had no idea the effects and withdrawals that goes with it. But I knew that in order to marry him and raise my children in a healthy home, it was absolutely neccessary for him to stop taking opiates for a multitude of reasons. He was in tears that something could possibly help him AND thinking how in the world do doctors not \"know\" about this. Quite an evening! I researched it for days. Because of Kratom, he had NO withdrawals from opiates. It also helped him with PAWS( post accute withdrawal syndrome) which is no joke either, and soon after discontinued use of Kratom with no withdrawals or side effects. He was so sick of taking \"pills\" that he did not want to take anything.  He has not and does NOT desire to use opiates OR Kratom since March of 2016.  I never thought in my life I would be contacting the DEA. Everytime I turn around Im hearing about someone losing their life to herion and opiates. Its clearly a known epidemic. I have now witnessed 3 people get off prescription narcotics due to Kratom. I am still in shock over this plant. I was in shock when I heard about the ban and in joyful shock after I checked the internet for updates to find that this subject would be further invesigated, rightfully so. I want to be clear that there is not one indication I have observed that the effects of Kratom are a \"high\" or display abnormal behavior like associated with other drugs, including my own experience with it. I am 43 years old, Im a mother, a student, I work, take care of my home, have hobbies, make goals to meet most of them, and happily live to be a healthy, productive person. There are people in this country who are JUST NOW being introduced to Kratom, ( Still boggles my mind), who can be remedied of an array of physical concerns, in addition to mental health issues and addiction!! I am putting my faith into everyone involved in this. Lets all of us, please see the benefits.

I got hooked instantly and starting abusing them within months. That went on for about 4 years until I was left divorced and my parents had enough.  They brought me to a dr to get put on subutex and also to a drug abuse therapist. I was on subutex for over 6 years which is 2 years longer than my addiction!! I wanted to get 100% clean for the first time in over a decade but really struggled with the withdrawals from the subutex. I stumbled across kratom in my desperate attempt to get off the perscription meds and decided it was worth a shot. To my surprise it worked wonders and I was free and clear of the subutex within days.  I stayed on the kratom for about 6 months and was able to taper down my dosage to my goal of 100% clean! Subutex saved my life but when it was time to move on I found myself  in the same position as the opioids, addicted to another prescription! Kratom took over from there and made it possible for me to reach my goal. It scares me to think future opiod addicts won't have the same option to have kratom to help better their lives. It's a miracle plant and my entire family and myself are so grateful for. Also this wasn't a fluke, I shared my story with a few friends(4) of mine that were in the same situation, addicted to subutex trying to get sober from opioids. They followed what I did and they are ALL now  free from addiction to prescription drugs. Due to my experience and what I've seen, kratom isn't the problem, it's the solution! If protecting the community is really the goal here we need to look at prescription opiods and how easy they are to get and how addicting they are. i think banning kratom will do more harm to the community than keeping it legal. Thank you for taking the time to do what's right and I really hope our messages/stories  get through to someone.

Why take a plant that helps so many people and make it illegal when thousands of people will be forced to return to addictive opiates and other drugs. Why make Kratom illegal when it can get people off of opiates and other hard drugs. \nAs far as not knowing currently the scientific properties and studies, I believe a natural substance should be my choice to take. We pay taxes for the DEA to help us stay safe and to regulate pharmaceutical drugs. But why would I pay someone to remove me off a product that saved my life, just because the DEA hasn't done enough research on it, and also have flawed information. To be honest I see no legitimate reason to ban Kratom when thousands of people die from opiates  that are legal. Kratom has barely any side effects and is something I depend on, and the DEA wants to take it from me because they seem to think they have adequate proof and research in it, when they do not.  \nI hope this is read and taken into consideration as I am a taxpaying American citizen that pays the DEA to work. I would like to see the DEA son proper research and prove that Kratom is as bad as they say it is. When in all reality it's a lifesaving plant for thousands of people. Do not let judgment be based on big corporate pharmaceutical companies and Sony make the decision because it might have some side effects. Alcohol and opiates kill thousands of people and it happens under the eye of the DEA. But a last is found that people need and it's made out to be bad.  \nThere should be no ban on Kratom, there is not enough information collected and there are many false facts. Imagine yourself having a family member with constant pain, being told they can't take a product just because it might be dangerous. The citizens of the USA should be able to decide what good for them and what isn't.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0843","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeffrey Fischer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe the potential health benefits of kratom far outweigh any adverse effects and should be thoroughly researched before any schedule 1 ban is enacted.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9359","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyle Andrejczyk","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Over the past few years I have been very interested in a handful of podcasts - which are designed like radio talk-shows in which they deliver current events and interesting information.

They treat it with commonly accepted pain medications but their pain either continues on without relief or their chronic medication use develops into an even bigger problem.  Kratom is a miracle drug and should not be banned.  I've seen firsthand how it can positively affect patients suffering from health problems.  In my own studies, I've found that it has a novel mechanism of action on pain modulation.  It seems to work without causing the negative side effects of opiates (with the exception of constipation...that one seems to still happen!).  It creates both a positive effect and helps to reduce dependence and drug-seeking behavior on more \"traditional\" pain therapies.  The fact that it's all natural is an even bigger plus for those concerned about clouding their bodies with artificial substances.  Kratom has caused one (questionable) death in it's thousands of years of existence.  Inevitably statistics will prevail and someone somewhere may find harm from a substance.  The fact that only one person has found harm speaks to the awesomeness of Kratom.  And who's to say what else that one person had going on with them.  Many other substances cause much more harm and we don't even give them a second look.  Stop trying to over regulate everything in existence.  People have been using Kratom responsibly for a long time.  It has positive benefits.  It treats pain and emotional imbalances with surprising efficacy.  I recommend it directly to my patients that are tired of the same old therapies pushed on them by uninformed doctors year after year.  I stand beside Kratom wholeheartedly and I wish more of my patients would seek out natural alternatives in place of more dangerous medications or substances.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1565","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chase Ballinger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think that Kratom needs to be researched to find out if it is actually dangerous or if it is safe.

I am a 47-year-old married woman who works as a medical transcriptionist.  I am writing on behalf of my husband who has been diagnosed with failed back surgery syndrome (yes, this is real) and chronic pain.  Kratom works differently from the Norco and Butrans he is prescribed in a synergistic way and helps his pain immensely.  In fact, it is more efficacious for him than either the Norco and the Butrans put together without making him \"high\" or fatigued or interfering with his job.\n\nYou may be concerned about the potential for overdose with kratom, but you should know that the amount of kratom required to overdose is a substantial amount and almost impossible to take without vomiting as it is a very bitter herb.  For example, my husband takes 7 GRAMS of kratom powder in orange juice about every 6 hours with his prescribed Norco.  He has taken the same dose for approximately 2 years without developing a tolerance to the herb.  Even mixed with orange juice, the taste is disgusting, and he has to rinse his mouth out with water afterwards or risk losing the contents of his stomach.  \n\nIn terms of addiction, before my husband started using kratom, he had experienced withdrawal from prescribed Oxycontin and Percocet when discontinuing them after his back surgery.  That was a horrific experience that included among other things, vomiting, diarrhea, overwhelming depression, body aches, insomnia, and a sensation of fire ants biting his skin all over.  He was successful in ceasing the prescribed medication, but it was a terrible experience and his doctors were of no help in managing his withdrawal symptoms.  My husband has upon occasion stopped using kratom with NONE of those symptoms.  At worst, there is a mild desire to take the kratom which is easily overcome and comparable to wanting a favorite food.  \n\nWe need to have scientific investigation into kratom's properties which cannot be done if it is determined to be a Schedule I drug.  Only through scientific query will we be able to find serious pain relief that is much less addictive than our current alternatives of opioids.  Also, the DEA has a limited amount of funding, and it would be best to spend that money fighting to get truly dangerous drugs like heroin, meth, cocaine, and designer drugs off our streets.  \n\nPlease do not place kratom onto the list of Schedule I drugs.  According to the DEA's press release, there were 14 deaths related to kratom use between 2014 and 2016 even though during that time there were 55,000 kilograms of kratom (12 million doses) imported into the US.  On the CDC's website, they list cigarette smoking as causing 480,000 deaths PER YEAR and the cause of 1 out of every 5 deaths (20%).  From 2006 to 2010, alcohol caused 88,000 deaths PER YEAR and was the cause of 1 out of 10 deaths (10%).  I think it is accurate to say that the legal drugs of alcohol and tobacco are much more deadly than kratom.\n\nIn conclusion, kratom is an already regulated herbal supplement that does not belong on the Schedule I drug list.  It has a very low addiction profile comparable to coffee and much, much less than the already legal drugs of tobacco and alcohol, and it is almost impossible to overdose on due to the sheer quantity required (I say almost, because everything can be overdosed on, including water).  Kratom also has a much higher safety profile than alcohol or tobacco based on CDC information.  \n\nThank you for your consideration of this issue.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21962","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Maria Stahl","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Gary I'm a 58 year old male and I feel that I am healthier with kratom.

I first discovered kratom after a friend suggested it. He was trying to quit alcohol and heroin simultaneously and did so successfully. The reason I tried it for the first time was because he told me I'd get a decent buzz. This was certainly true. I wanted to address some things I've noticed since I started using kratom. None of these things are in anyway based on facts, just anecdotal evidence and some personal observations.\n First off my alcohol use has decreased dramatically. I have never considered myself to be an alcoholic however at times it was pretty obvious that I might have been drinking a little too much. I never tried to stop or anything, and it is important to note that this is not why I take kratom. Before kratom, I drank nearly every day. Now I drink maybe once every other week and when I do I drink much less. The desire is just no longer there like it was. I feel like I'm happier as a result.\n As time went on I continued using kratom more as a performance enhancer. It makes me feel clear headed and motivated to work hard. I ride a bike for a living both as a messenger and a bike taxi driver. Many days I work 12 hours, sometimes for weeks at a time. I put more miles on my bike annually than many people put on their cars. This sort of work can really take its toll. Before I used to be exhausted easily from my strenuous routine and now it is not nearly as bad. It can be dangerous and nerve wracking riding quickly in heavy traffic. Safety is my number one priority. If I am hurt working, I loose my job. I need a very clear head. This plant allows for that. It's not like other substances that might make you loose focus, become disoriented, or become sloppy. There is a buzz but it's not anything that would put me at risk on the job otherwise I would abstain. It is most easily compared to a Very,very good cup of coffee.\nAs I said I have been taking kratom for two years and I would like to adress my view on weather it is addictive or not. In my experience it isn't. Last winter work was slow and I got into some other hobbies and stopped taking it for a little more than two months. I had been taking just over a teaspoon three times a day. I quit easily with no real side effects other than possibly being lethargic however I am not sure if this was just in relation to the energetic state I was used to prior to quitting or an actual withdraw symptom. Either way it was quite mild and I really couldn't imagine it being a problem for anybody. During this period I did drink more frequently.\nI feel that is pretty absurd to ban this plant. I personally have nothing but positive experiences with it and I couldn't believe it was going to be scheduled at 1 no less. I really can't imagine anyone hurting themselves with this plant although I hear some have. I'd like to point out that it is far less than alcohol, opiates, or caffeine even according to the CDC. It seems to me like if it is scheduled it can't be studied and that is a shame because it could potentially stem the opioid crisis. I feel that it was doing just fine the way it was as an unregulated substance, most brick and mortar shops that stocked it required an ID to even enter and I think placing an age restriction on kratom would be a perfectly reasonable response. This is not \"bath salts\" or \"spice\" it is a completely natural plant that many people have been using safely for many years and I think it would really be a shame to ban it out right and take from us a very positive plant with many potential benefits for the individual and possibly society as a whole. I truly hope you reconsider; banning this plant would not only be unfair, but silly and unecissary.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2337","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carl Schultz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Helps with my pain.

I am not trying to beat a heroine habit.  I'm a software engineer who suffers from chronic back pain.  I don't like to take acetaminophen because it's very bad for the liver, and I also hate to take ibuprofen because it gives me stomach aches.  A nurse friend of mine recommended that I try an herbal solution - kratom.  I rolled my eyes at the time because I assumed that a plant couldn't offer me any real pain relief.. otherwise I would have heard about it by now, right?  \n\nI take two caplets in the morning and two after lunch, and my back pain is gone.  Incidentally, I also found that it was a more effective stimulant than coffee, which offers much more severe side effects.  I have been living caffeine and pain free since I discovered this supplement and I am truly floored by the idea that we are even considering a ban.\n\nI had no idea that my government could reach into my cupboard and unceremoniously decide for me that I should have to live with liver damage, nausea, or back pain... because.. ?  I'm still not clear on the because part of all this.  Because it might act on the brain in similar ways to opiates?  Is this some horrific sin on its own, when it causes no demonstrable harm?  It was my understanding that the privilege of emergency scheduling was afforded to the DEA in order to combat the rapidly produced synthetic drugs that pose a clear and present danger to our public.  This is not happening right now... public opinion on kratom ranges from \"What's that?\" to \"That literally changed/saved my life.\"  The number of deaths that are 'linked' to kratom is laughable to anyone with a college-level statistics class.  \n\nI have done nothing wrong by availing myself of this natural form of pain relief.  You are not better than me because you use Advil instead... Or caffeine, for that matter.  The number of people killed by eating dishwasher detergent pods last year is much greater than the number (inconclusively) linked to kratom.  And hey ok.. folks are less likely to want to eat detergent pods so let's get away from the substance itself and talk about usage... You allow us to kill ourselves with alcohol and cigarettes, but you want to forbid us from the mild stimulant/pain reliever offered by kratom.  How in the world can you logically justify this ban?  \n\nI am not a criminal.

My late mother was an opiate addict for 20 years, and her mom as well, so it didn't take much for me to follow the footsteps. As an opiate addict, I often found myself wondering how in the world I could ever resume a healthy, sober lifestyle again. I have been using kratom for two years now, and have subsequently been able to rid my life of all opiates ever since. A friend of mine (another addict) told me he had heard about kratom, and was told that it could help kick addiction. Admittedly I was skeptical at first, but after a few days of using the plant I found myself no longer wanting opiates. This may not sound like much, but as someone who relied on opiates every single day for five years, this foreign feeling was both spectacular and comforting. Not only does kratom give me the energy I need to sustain a busy day, but it rids my mind of a persistent longing to get high. My emotions feel regulated, I am focused, and thoughts that used to dominate my wellbeing no longer loom over me.\n\nWhen I heard of the FDA's decision to schedule kratom as a Schedule I drug, I immediately was fearful. One fear of mine was that if kratom gets scheduled as Schedule I, than there is no way for me to use it-- period. And if I am unable to use kratom, I am afraid that I will return right back to the ruthless crutch of opiates. I am proud of my sobriety. I never want to go back to where I was-- waking up on the bathroom floor unaware of my surroundings, yet thankful to have not just died from an overdose. I want to stay sober going forward, and this plant truly helps me stay on track. Yet my biggest fear extends even beyond my own inability to consume kratom. My biggest fear is that there are thousands upon thousands of others who are in my exact same situation. I even feel like a lucky one; perhaps there go-to drug is heroin? The drug epidemic we have in this country--most specifically opiates and heroin--is incomprehensible, and this is true even with kratom (currently) being legal. According to Richard Taite, CEO of Cliffside Malibu, somebody dies in the United States from an accidental overdose every 19 minutes (Prescription Thugs). What happens to other addicts like me who can no longer responsibly utilize this plant? How many of us simply become another statistic, while the pharmaceutical companies continue to fill their pockets? \n\nI am hopeful that after reviewing a passionate response from kratom users across the country, that the FDA will backtrack on their initial plan to schedule this plant to make it illegal. This plant has quite literally been a lifesaver for me, and I am sure many others. A primary goal in this country must be to make strides to combat the opiate epidemic that is tearing this nation apart. The only possible outcome of a ban on kratom is a situation which, as unfathomable as it currently seems, will only get worse.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15634","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon Vineyard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI have been doing quite a bit of research on Kratom and subsequently I cannot find any negative or ill effects from using a moderate dose.

Instead, please leave it to individual State governments to determine how it should be regulated within their borders.\n\nI am a 41-year-old software engineer, a husband, and the father of two children. I also suffer from chronic pain in my neck and shoulder from a car accident in which I was rear-ended while stopped in stopped traffic at a red light. This pain has been constant ever since that accident, over a decade ago. Typically, physical therapy exercises and a rotational regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen can bring the pain down to a level where I am able to function within my day-to-day life. Often enough, though, the pain cannot be controlled this way, and this leads to the inability to sleep, work, or be present for my family. Prior to my discovery of kratom last April, my only choice during these times was to resort to prescription opioid pain relievers, typically Vicodin.\n\nThe problems with opioid pain relievers are manifold. Of most concern is that opioids depress respiration in even moderate doses, and larger and larger doses are necessary to obtain the same pain relieving effect over time. This is the most common way that people who use these pain relievers overdose and die. Second, opioids are universally addictive, and it's extremely difficult for those who depend upon them for pain relief to stop taking them. Finally, they are intoxicating. I have no desire to be intoxicated. I certainly have no desire to become addicted to any substance, nor to die from an overdose because of an ever increasingly large therapeutic dosage. I do not want to take opioid pain relievers.\n\nKratom, in addition to physical therapy and a strict acetaminophen and ibuprofen regimen, is every bit as good at relieving my pain as the opioid pain relievers I used previously in its place. Scientific literature shows that although kratom does interact with one class of opioid receptors in the brain, it does not interact with the receptors that cause depressed respiration, and therefore it is not possible to overdose or die directly from kratom consumption. I can also tell you from personal experience that kratom is not addictive: two weeks prior to the announced September 30th addition of kratom to the Schedule I list, I stopped using kratom altogether. The only difference was that my pain returned. I had no withdrawal effects whatsoever. Finally, for me personally, kratom has no unwanted intoxicating effects. Because of this, it is able to manage my pain to an acceptable level without interfering with my ability to do my job, live my life, and be the husband and father that I want to be.\n\nOnce again, I urge you to leave kratom (and its alkaloids, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine) off the Controlled Substances Schedules, and to let the States themselves determine how it should be regulated within their borders.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nSincerely,\nGene DeClark","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0617","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gene DeClark","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 48-year-old state-licensed property insurance agent and have been at my current profession for the past 10 years.

Though I am not a medical professional, it is my belief that at the very least, kratom should be studied as a natural alternative to synthetic and highly addictive medications which are currently prescribed. Though I suffer from the chronic pain of piriformis syndrome, and was prescribed morphine for a time, I strongly believe that kratom has helped me to avoid prescription opiates and maintain a more positive outlook about my life with pain than I had either without any medication at all or with physician-prescribed opiates and antidepressants.

Just like some of us choose to eat highly toxic foods that the US desires to keep legal like mcdonalds, beer, cigarettes, and gmo products. Many people in the US would rather self medicate with herbal remedies, as the bible intends us to, than to go to a doctor and be put on many medications to contradict eachothers negative side effects. Medical marijuana is one example, why is it so easy for doctors to prescribe adderall, oxycodone, and other heavy narcotics with extremely horrible side effects to a person, and even children, yet that same person could simply use a natural herb, as god meant it to be, without a single side effect? Well mitragyna is the same, it has many uses and many benefits to the human body yet the DEA wants to continue pushing nature away from us and force us into the pharmaceutical business. As I stated, whose body do our bodies belong to? Whose body is affected when ingesting and self medicating? If it is harm of ones body you are worried about, why is mcdonalds still running? Why are cigarettes and beer legal till this very day? We are citizens of the United States, yes, but our bodies will forever be ours. Thank you for your time.

My opposition is based on several points.  Firstly, regarding personal use, when I had made numerous personal health changes in 2012, including quitting drinking alcohol, I was trying various supplements, teas, herbs, etc.  Primarily I was looking to find alternatives to the ever-present caffeine (coffee), for stimulation, and alcohol, for relaxation.  In my research, I found kratom, which was noted to be safe, effective, and has been used for thousands of years.  Furthermore, kratom was purported to serve both purposes I was seeking; in lower doses it provides gentle stimulation, quite comparable to a cup of coffee and in larger doses, it provides relaxation, quite similar to chamomile tea.  As I incorporated kratom supplementation occasionally into my overall health and wellness diet and regiment, I found the supplement I was seeking.  As I stated, it provided the gentle stimulation, no greater than a cup of coffee, while not causing the jitteriness and anxiety that can often accompany caffeine.  Then, on some evenings or weekends, I found kratom to be a gentle relaxant, no greater than a cup of chamomile tea, without being intoxicating or causing impairment or any type of hangover.  I have now been using kratom occasionally since then, and I fully believe it has increased the quality of my life.  On days that I chose to use it, as there is no craving or urge to use it as with other addictive substances, I find myself productive, happy, and motivated and then able to relax, safely, without issues or harm in the evenings.\n\n \n\n  Secondly, my opposition to a ban on kratom, is rooted more in principle.  I fully believe, as an adult who is decisional and cognizant, a productive member of society, has the inalienable right to choose what I do and do not put into my body, especially if doing so, does no harm to anyone else or puts anyone else in any kind of risk of harm.  Furthermore, it does not harm to my body itself.  As such, I believe that I should be able to maintain this right, to utilize an all-natural, used for thousands of years, and without risks, supplement for my own benefit and betterment, without having to be afraid that I am breaking a law.    \n\n \n\n   Thank you for taking the time to consider my comments on kratom, and please count this as one vote for opposing the proposed ban.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16714","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"One last note:  With Kratom and a functional program with therarapy, I was able to put together 3.5 years of not drinking alcohol!

As noted by AHPA and others, there is no precedent for the DEA to use its emergency authority in this manner for a naturally occurring substance such as a plant.  As documented elsewhere (Yearsley, McGuffin and Young) the serious adverse health effects including deaths that have been in some cases potentially attributed to kratom are more likely due to adulteration and/or concomitant use of hazardous and toxic substances.\n\nSchedule I classification would also be highly counterproductive in terms of gaining additional scientific knowledge about kratom and its potential uses, as well any potential safety concerns, in that such a legal classification would overly restrict further scientific research into not only its safety but also its therapeutic value.\n\nI urge the DEA to permanently set aside the potential classification of kratom as a Schedule I drug as inappropriate, given all we know of its uses and safety based on both science and tradition.

My drug of choice was opiate medication. I was introduced to Kratom shortly after I became clean. If it wasn't for Kratom, I am not sure I would still be here today to make this comment. Although I do not use it daily, it helps with my pain and is MUCH less riskier to use than pain medication. Pain medication should not just be given freely by doctors, and there is currently an epidemic regarding the overuse and overprescribing of Opiates in this country. Whenever I get a craving, I just use Kratom and it completely subsides. I do not abuse Kratom, I do not use it in excess, but I will say that if it wasn't for Kratom, myself and many other previous users would more than likely be back out in our full addiction cycle, or worse, dead. Kratom helps me tremendously with not only pain, but anxiety, as well as giving me energy to tackle the day. I do not feel that it is dangerous, it does not cause any negative side effects, and it is not addictive by any means. To put it into perspective, there are 8 TOTAL known casualties due to the use of Kratom, yet Opiates are legal and easily attainable, and an average of 78 people die EVERY DAY from Opiate use. I say you need to focus more of your time and energy on ending this horrible epidemic, not only for myself but for our future children. I, along with many other people I know, have seen the benefits of Kratom use and have never even thought about going back to our old addict lives. Please consider these comments, as well as the bigger picture when it comes to the Opiate epidemic, and consider that Kratom could actually be a better form of substance to help heroin/opiate users come off of drugs, then the current drugs they try to push down your throat that are just as addictive (Methadone, Buprenorphine). This country has a huge drug epidemic and I'd say you would fare much better with the American people if you were to put your time and effort into tackling this problem, as opposed to finding ways to make harmless drugs a Schedule 1 drug\n\nThank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3614","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Catherine Cresser, I am a 65yr. recently retired RN. I worked in home care for almost 40 yrs. caring for the elderly, chronically ill and  the mentally ill. I strongly oppose the the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. In doing so it would prevent the much needed research on kratom to continue. I have seen the horror of prescribed medication addiction as well as addiction to  illegal drugs. I have seen deaths from heroin overdoses and the decline in people addicted to their prescribed pain meds. I started to use kratom 18 months ago when I was introduced to it by my then 22 year old son. My son has been under the care of a psychiatrist since he was a young child due to extreme anxiety and depression. He was prescribed many different medications and none complety helped to alleviate his symptoms. He complained of not feeling well most of the time. He started self medicating in his teens and had 3 hospitalizations for alcohol poisoning. In doing research to look for something to help him he found kratom. He has not had any alcohol in 18 months, he is not on any precription meds and is a productive member of society with a very successful ecommerce business. During that time I was on antidepressants, having age related issues, joint pain and fatigue. I was able to wean off my medicine with my doctors appoval, my knee pain is  managed and I now have energy to do the things I love to do. It would be devastating to my son and myself if we were not able to use kratom. He does not want to go back to his previosus lifestyle, he has come so far. I don't want to go back on antidepressants with all the side effects and I don't want to have to start taking pain medicine for my joint pain. Our lives have been transformed for the better and I have never advocated for something as much as I have for kratom. I appeal to the DEA to allow the continued research necessary and not make kratom a schedule 1 controlled substance. Thank you. \n\nSincerely,\nCatherine Cresser","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13430","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Catherine Cresser","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was addicted to opiates for years, kratom gave me the means to stop using opiates without the crippling side effects of withdrawls.

I have tried it at a local cafe that was serving it also and can't see why such a mild effect would warrant a ban when caffeine is completely legal. To me the effects were comparable except I didn't \"crash\" from the kratom. Just a mild stimulating, easier to focus effect really.

I really cannot understand the rational for putting 2 of the key alkaloids contained in the natural Kratom leaf on the Schedule 1 list.  This really makes no sense to me.  I have had the opportunity to use Kratom as of this year, and have not had any type of symptom that I would even imagine to be harmful in any way.  I have only experienced positive things and nothing that would warrant banning this plant to the public for fear of addiction or some deadly side effect.  I have been around a growing number of people who use Kratom and have seen no side effects that seem harmful in any way.  Actually, quite the opposite.  People who use Kratom, to me, have a sense of wanting to engage in life rather than retreat(which would be something i would expect of something on the Schedule 1 list).  I came to use Kratom in part due to a friend of mine trying it and liking it.  She is very positive about it and talked highly of it, so I tried it and liked it.  For me, it is like having a cup of coffee without having to drink coffee.  From what I have read, it is related to coffee plants anyway.  Hopefully you will not place either coffee or Kratom on the Schedule 1 list.  Both are good things that don't have negative effects, but rather, positive.  I believe there are plenty of things out there that may not be appropriate for the masses to consume, but that Kratom is not one of them.  I have felt that somewhere behind this move to put Kratom on the Schedule 1 list was a profit and greed motive somewhere.  It is so unfortunate that greed spoils things that are natural.  I don't know how we got here.  Anyway, here is a link to an article speaking about just this, thefreethoughtproject.com/pharma-kratom-dea-patent/\nI really hope you will consider not placing Kratom on the Schedule 1 list of Controlled Substances.\n\nSincerely,\nMarc Nordstrom","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18383","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marc Nordstrom","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In 2013 my daughter was pregnant and was using lortabs, a painkiller, for a previous situation.

I have always been one to avoid medication whenever possible because so many of the side effects are worse than what you are trying to treat but this time was different... My life was falling apart because I was in too much pain to do anything. I started pain management and at first it worked well. But as time went on and I built up a resistance to the medications  and we started the nasty cycle of having to take more or have stronger meds prescribed in order to manage my pain. They worked well at first but always eventually stopped working. Then again more or stronger meds were prescribed, they also worked well for a while but then they too stopped working, repeat cycle over and over... I went from being on a low dose of Tramadol and one muscle relaxer to high doses of Norco around the clock, strong muscle relaxers 3 times per day, anti-depressants to ease the pain, and a very strong NSAID all in a matter of about five years. Almost three years ago I tried Kratom. After that first dose of Kratom I was almost pain free for the first time in seven years and guess what? I never took another rx pain medication again! It has truly given me my life back. And the best part? My body never built up a tolerance to it so I actually take less Kratom now than I did when I first started. I am finally able to be the wife and mother I have always wanted to be, and guess what? I also work full time in the field that I love! Please do not take Kratom from us. So many families will be hurt as a result. I like many American's cannot afford health insurance because my husband and I both own businesses and have to buy independently so if Kratom is taken away from me I will be forced to stop working and will no longer be able to be a productive, tax paying citizen.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18534","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't take away the plant that allows my friend To walk, it also gives me the the ability to speak...I couldn't even complete a \"hello, how are you?\" Due to my anxiety...\n   I am not an eloquent writer.

Since this wreck I have been put on a countless number of pain medications that are scheduled. The result has never ended well as these medications only work for a short time then have to be increased. It has left a devastating affect on this country that is ridiculous when we have many herbal alternatives that are not addictive and have a much better success. I find it very odd that our government would want to make these medications impossible to use. I'm sick of having to take chemicals when Tylenol itself is basically a poison. Kratom saved my life. I can take it as needed. Have found no side effects from it and it has no addictive qualities. If you would like to help stop the abuse of it by people that use it with other medications then have those that go to pain clinics be tested for the use of this on top of their already deadly schedule 1 pain medications. I do not want something that is completely natural turned into a chemical advancement of its natural form. Allow us to have our natural remedies and stop taking them away from us the people for the benefit of the establishment. We did not create these addicts that abuse everything that they can. You the establishment did with the chemical alteration of opium for a profit. I'm pretty sure you make enough profit on everything else to leave one simple herb alone. It simply relieves my pain in a way that pain medication does not without all of the terrible implications that come from narcotics. We have this right.

I have several friends who have been deeply and profoundly helped by this agent (kratom).  In a time when the American people are facing enormous levels of drug addiction due to prescription opioids I consider it, well, nothing less than \"sinful\" for Federal regulators to interfere with the availability of such a plant.  DO YOU NOT FEAR GOD!  The FDA is to blame for the opioid epidemic, of course, not the DEA.  I hope you are not attempting to ban this plant in order for some drug company to make a billion dollars on an extract that is probably more dangerous and much, much more expensive.     \n\nI am a professional herbalist (google me) and I can give you one piece of testimony that perhaps you are not aware of.  This \"herb\" or plant did not come to attention through normal herbal commerce, herbalism as a movement, practicing herbalists, or herb books.  Rather, it came up from the \"people.\"  It seems to have been discovered by the people needing it and to have become popular without even being listed in ANY contemporary herbal that I am sure of.  What this means is that you are fighting a battle against, frankly, impossible odds.  The people want this substance and they will get it however they can.  I am informed that it is naturalized in Florida so it cannot be \"kept out of the country.\"  It will become an extremely widespread and heavily used \"drug\" and you will hurt people much more by throwing them in jail and making them pay more, or not be able to obtain it at all.  The hairs on your heads are numbered and everything you do is accounted by God; have you no shame or fear for your souls?   \n\nAll you are doing by making this plant illegal is fighting against the current, against the people, and against Nature.  \n\nI have heard that there are side-effected to large doses of kratom.  There are side-effects to all drugs and many plants and even a great number of foods--- peanuts, for example.  But I have also heard (not scientifically but anecdotally) that this plant is more effective in small doses.  I suggest that it simply be banned in large containers.

I'm thirty five years old and work as an electrical apprentice.   Last year my older brother Brian introduced me the kratom tea. A friend of his suggested kratom  to ease the depression  and anxiety he was feeling from quitting drinking.  He was impressed by the positive effects and thought I might benefit from trying this plant \"kratom\".  I tried some kratom tea, and to say the least I enjoyed the subtle mood lift.  This plant does not get someone \"high\" but offers a relaxing boost, like a cup of coffee minus coffees' negative physical effects ie. coffee jitters and caffeine headache.  I have since replaced my morning cup of coffee with kratom tea.  On a regular day I have a cup of kratom tea in the morning for the relaxed boost and in the evening for its calming affects and mild pain relief from aches and pains from physical work .  Coffee is much more stimulating but kratom provides that relaxing boost that I enjoy so I can drink it any time of day without any negative affects, kratoms affect is mild in the first place.  I believe any concern about this substance has been exaggerated by the media because it has been reported that it eases opiate withdrawal.  Whenever anything is associated with \"opiates\", it becomes vilified.  People make the association that junkies are using kratom as a legal fix. Its no more of a fix than an aspirin and a hot shower would be to relieve opiate withdrawal.   In any sense if it does help withdrawals then I suggest that as one more reason to allow this plant as a safe and natural remedy for many people struggling with addiction.  People drink coffee to wake up, take melatonin to sleep, chamomile tea to relax, aspirin for pain, so should kratom be used for its multiple benefits be used as well.  Hopefully some research will be done to show how this safe and natural plant can help people.  All said and done I think kratom should be available to the citizens of this great country and erase this unfounded stimga avbout it.   Kratom is a non issue, the DEA would be better off spending its resources on real problems, not a plant related to coffee.  \n           Thank you for your time, God Bless and Happy Holidays,  Eric Harder","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12866","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Harder","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom does not belong on the schedule 1 list.

I am on disability from a car accident. I have six ruptured discs, three in my neck and three in my back. Days before storms I can feel the barometric pressure. It is agony. I have tried all but surgery. Surgeons told me they didn't know where to start. I have been taken off of morphine due to the opium epidemic, my doctor is afraid that he will get his license taken. I really did need the morphine. After they took me off morphine I gained 20 pounds from non activity. My blood pressure went up and I had to go to the hospital , it was 185 over 110. I managed to get a hold of kratom, and can tell you that I lost 10 pounds, and my blood pressure is now lower. I use kratom to end the extremely painful spasms. Although my pain is not fully gone I have nothing but positive things to say about kratom. It doesn't make you overdose or breathe funny or explode. If too much is taken like anything else a human will expel it somehow. I find that dealers need to add a dosage level, try one to two teaspoons first. I find that Starbucks matcha tea is more potent than white vein. There are three strains as you know of kratom, and the main one for pain and better sleep is red vein. Also should be a label saying do not ingest until you know how you react, it can make a person a little sleepy. Valerian tea does the same thing. I would love to see kratom sites still be able to sell this. It is great, just like anything else though, you get idiots abusing this and all they will do is vomit. There are No known kratom ODs only when they combine it with an illegal substance they have no business possessing. I want kratom to stay legal please. Thank you for your time. And please also let me as a chronic pain patient have a better painkiller. I'm allergic to aspirin, the only drug I tolerated well was morphine. If this goes then I'm moving to Canada.

I was severely injured by taking prescribed antibiotics in the family known as Fluoroquinolones.  Luckily I discontinued the dosage about 1/3 of the prescribed cycle otherwise I may not be here today.  It left me with lasting nerve damage throughout my body, severe muscle cramps similar to Dystonia, joint problems, and overall poor health.  I was only 30 years old at the time.  I was a healthy man before this incident.  My doctors tried to prescribe my Lyrica, various pain medication, all of which gave me fairly severe side effects including one particular side effect that wouldn't be reversible if I would of taken a little while longer (per their own insert).  Pain medications would somewhat manage the pain, but the severe muscle cramps and nerve pain resided. I didn't want to rely on such medications that can prove to be habit forming, and I know how hard those drug combos (paired with acetaminophen) can be on internal organs. \n\nAfter doing some research I found Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) and decided to give it a try.  I saw instant relief and no side effects.  It gave me my life back.  Before Kratom, there were times where the pain was so unbearable I felt like giving up.  Kratom not only made my pain manageable but also significantly reduced the muscle cramps and tremors.  Most of the time, I feel like a normal person again and can once again do things that I didn't think were possible 4 years ago. It is an absolute miracle drug.  It doesn't feel like it has addictive properties either, I can take it daily for a few weeks and then not take it for another week without issue.  Taking this medicine away from people like me would be a travesty.  Eyes are now watching, more than just the users, and they will not tolerate improper scheduling.  I seriously question the legitimacy of some of these deaths attributed to Kratom.  They were obviously other drugs in those people's systems (according to the reports), so does it make any sense to push for an emergency ban without proper data.  More people die from energy drinks and acetaminophen on a yearly basis and those are not banned. People as well as the media are starting to speculate if the pharmaceutical companies are influencing this decision.  We're aware that Pharma companies are currently patenting the two major API's (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) in Kratom.  If the DEA was planning on making Kratom classified as a schedule 1 which basically says it has no medical usage, then why are companies planning to synthesize it?  Alcohol and prescription opiates are killing people at an alarming rate, yet no one does anything about it.  I ask you to do the right thing, the moral thing, and leave Kratom to the people that responsibly use it.  Thank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0471","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kramton has been such a blessing!

The swim, bike, run, and weight training required to complete these type events leads to various aches and pains, which is why I started taking Kratom.   \n\nI became aware of Kratom and started taking it about a year and half ago.  My usage pattern of taking Kratom is similar to that of how I used over the counter pain medication before finding Kratom.  I have never exceeded this amount of usage or have had any desire to exceed this amount of usage.  If I do not feel sore then I do not take Kratom.   I have never felt any adverse effects or withdraw symptoms associated with taking Kratom.  My experience with Kratom has been highly positive and has helped me pursue my passion of participating in triathlons.\n\nI am very conscious about what I consume, so I reviewed available information prior to taking Kratom.  What I could find at that time, when I conducted research as the possible dangers of taking Kratom were interactions with other drugs.  I do not use other drugs so I did not view Kratom as a risk.  After I became aware of the intent of the Drug Enforcement Agency to emergency schedule Kratom based on an immediate public health threat, I assumed a new study was done or there was some solid data supporting this action.  Based on this assumption, that there was some compelling evidence to justify an emergency action based on \"imminent harm\", I immediately stopped taking Kratom.  However, after reviewing the information supporting the DEAs intent to schedule and conducting additional research there does not appear to be anything new or substantive supporting this action so I continued taking Kratom based on my original conclusion.  \n\nI strongly disagree with the DEAs scheduling the herbal supplement Kratom under the controlled substances act.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1247","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Reading","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, \nThank you for taking the time to read this.

I find that I am more outgoing with kratom and willing to experience what life offers.

It seems as though every time they do so, a new chemical/plant becomes available and can cause worse effects than the original chemical/plant that was scheduled and banned by the DEA. Making these things illegal has not had the effect that was intended. Heroin, for example, has run rampant across our country and it's illegal. However there are legal forms that are prescribed and well controlled and regulated that people can take. This method seems to be at least a safer route. Regulating these products is much more productive as we've seen with alcohol and tobacco as well. Educating the public with facts about a chemical/plant/drug allows them/us to make an informed decision and helps to prevent accidental overdoses as well as give the public freedom to choose what they will put into their body. The educational campaigns that have been started to explain the risks of tobacco and alcohol have helped with the reduction in tobacco and alcohol related fatalities. Promoting help for those wishing to quit or control their use has proven to be more helpful than trying to arrest users and sellers of chemicals/plants/drugs that some do not agree with. We, as a people, need to realize a model that does not work and step away from the insanity of doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2615","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"RE: Docket No. DEA-442W - my comments\n\nHello,\n\nI am a 28 year old male in the food service and food manufacturing industry and I have used Kratom on and off for several years. It has been helpful for dealing with symptoms of chronic soreness and pain due to working physically demanding jobs most of my adult life. Kratom has had no adverse side-effects to me physically or psychologically and even provides me with an energy boost not unlike coffee (which it is related to). This plant does not intoxicate me in any form or fashion and is in no way a \"legal high\" like some people have claimed. I have never experienced an overdose with Kratom and even when I have taken larger amounts of it, the only relatively negative effect it had on me was some temporary nausea -which caused discomfort but never requiring medical attention. I see no reason why this plant should be banned and thus put responsible citizens in danger of be policed as if we are users of dangerous substances such as opiates, amphetamines, and other currently DEA scheduled drugs. I believe if the DEA were to ban Kratom (Mitragynine), then they would be wasting their resources and taxpayer dollars on a substance that does not meet the qualifications for a DEA Scheduled Drug. Simply put, Kratom is a plant that I use, when necessary, to help me maintain a productive, happy, and healthy lifestyle. Please do not include Kratom/Mitragynine on the DEA CSA Scheduling.\n\nThank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8937","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dee Berube, widow of Vietnam Vet. \nI want my voice heard \"I oppose the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.\"\n\nMy husband passed away in July and I was not coping well with his death.\nI was having panic attacks and nightmares. \nI had been on prescription anti depressants before and hated the \"medicine head\"\nI looked for an alternative and found kratom.\n\nI initially took 1 gram twice a day as a tea.

I am a 25 year-old male and I work as a Quality Control Inspector for the medical device manufacturing industry. For nearly four years I was an opiate addict and cigarette smoker, and struggled with the ability to discontinue my drug use and change my overall lifestyle. About two years ago I was introduced to kratom and had a wonderful experience in that it helped to distract my mind and pull me away from the three year addiction I was battling with. About a year after first being introduced to kratom, I began to seriously consider it as an alternative to opioids. It has now been just over a year since I last took an opioid, and nearly nine months since my last cigarette, and my life has improved exponentially. I am now a better person for myself, my professional career, and most importantly, my family. Although kratom can cause physical dependency with regular use, it's effects and withdrawals are on par with those of habitual caffeine use. Even nicotine can be worse after discontuing habitual use. Overall, I am incredibly thankful for kratom to have come into my life, and for all I know I would still be ruining my life had it not been for kratom. Thank you for taking the time to reach out to the public and postponing your intent to schedule kratom. Many lives have been saved or repaired because of kratom, and I hope you allow that to continue.

I was on pain medication (hydrocodone 7.5) for nearly 10 years through my doctor. Unfortunately, due to changes in scheduling, my doctor completely stopped treating pain patients at the end of 2015. I had surgery at the beginning of the year and afterwards, tried to find a new doctor. Unfortunately, every pain clinic I called seemed to be hesitant or unsure of how to treat chronic pain not related to the musculoskeletal system. I found one pain clinic that was willing to treat me, where the doctor pushed shingles medication on me. \n\n\nAt that point, I realized I was unfortunately left with only two choices for pain treatment: I'd either have to obtain my prescription illegally or find an alternative. Thankfully, I found kratom. \n\n\nWhile kratom is not a perfect substitute for prescription pain medicine, its the best solution Ive found since the rescheduling made it nearly impossible for me and thousands of others to find adequate treatment for chronic pain. \n\n\nWhen I switched to kratom, I didnt experience any withdrawal symptoms. None. This is a MIRACLE after being on that medication for 10 years. \n\n\nEvery time I hear about another death due to fentanyl-laced counterfeit drugs, I think that could be me. While Im sure there are plenty of kids out there buying pain medicine to abuse, there are also hundreds of thousands of people like me who feel they have no choice but to RISK THEIR LIVES buying their medication off of the street. \n\n\nThere are countless testimonials from people like me who have found kratom to be a good alternative to the pain prescriptions were no longer provided, as well as testimonials from hundreds (if not thousands) of people who have been able to stop abusing pain medicine and heroin through kratom. \n\n\nFentanyl-related deaths are already climbing thanks to the recent decision to move most pain medications to Schedule II. If you were to make kratom a Schedule I substance - even temporarily - I guarantee that youll be giving the Chinese fentanyl manufacturers and Mexican drug cartels plenty of business. And, as Im sure youre already aware, this will keep Americas hospitals and funeral homes *very* busy.  \n\n\nPlease, reconsider your stance on kratom. There are thousands of people whose lives are being saved by this plant. \n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3662","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"N/A","postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lisa C.","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a great alternative to medication.

Several years ago, I  began researching natural supplements promoting overall well-being and stumbled across Kratom.  After doing my due diligence, I decided to try it.  At the time, I was highly stressed, and had constant back pain.  The narcotics and antidepressants I had been prescribed turned me into someone I didn't recognize.  My children, husband, and myself deserved so much more.  Kratom was not a magic supplement that turned things around over night, but it did give me a useful tool to work with while I worked on myself.

Possibly because teens, with their emotional and developmental state, I have seen teens get hooked on huffing gas.  This herb is very effective for relieving pain, without the side effects and the physical dependence and for some people addiction with opiods.  The reality is, we have no effective opiods for chronic or short term pain.  Celebres, neurontin, Lyrica, etc.  Go through surgery and take one of those.  Until our medical community develops a non addictive (and note, there is a big difference between physical dependence and addiction) a harmless herb should not be outlawed.  Lets face it, all people agree the war on drugs has failed.  Do I support legalization of all opiods?  No.  But the reality is this herb has been used for thousands of years, with little or no problem.  If you otlaw it because of what teenagers do, well outlaw driving because teenagers cause the most accidents statistically.    \nAnoterh topic which I can only speak to anecdotally.

I'm adding my comment based specifically on my experience with Kratom, other experiences shared with me, and the facts I've learned from both. First of all, I'm an addict,  I've recovered from my addiction of opiates and benzodiazepines. As of as how I learned of Kratom was because my friend is a recovered heroin addict. Before he moved to another state, he referred me to the herbal leaf, and herbal store to try it. This referral came from me asking if he could help me illegally obtain pain killer, prescription, opiates (I was unaware of his recovery at the time.)  I was taking around 20-25, 10 mg prescription painkillers a day. When I couldn't find them, that day that asked my friend for them, I reluctantly went to the herbal store and bought Kratom on his advice. I figured if he recovered from heroin, why not try it with my addiction to the same opiate related situation. It worked for me, I didn't withdrawl, and after about 3-5 months I stopped using Kratom. It wasn't a smooth transition, but I eventually substituted pain killers with Kratom, then after a while I didn't need anything. This worked by dosing lower and lower as I felt I could avoid withdrawl symptoms from opiates.  I'm not medically trained, but I imagine that using Kratom helped me from withdrawl, physically and emotionally. \n\n   I wasn't taking Kratom again until I read about it being used to aid in the symptoms of depression and anxiety. I've had bad experiences on anti depressants as a teen. I had even more adverse experiences with the anti-anxiety medication, benzodiazepine, a few years after my recovery from opiate addiction. Taking benzodiazepines, I eventually tried to overdose on them with alcohol to end my life. That ended with me in the hospital. So, when that happened I eventually was able to realize the potential kratom has with my symptoms involving my depression and anxiety. With Kratom I feel in control of my mind and emotions within. On benzodiazepines it felt like I lost control and I'd be so careless, even unaware of my actions or emotions. I truly believe benzodiazepines are dangerous because of my experience. I've had friends get into serious trouble because of them aside myself trying to take my own life. I've never felt that lack of consciousness and awareness from using Kratom. My hard work with the help with Kratom saved me life. It gave me back my life without pills.. A life worth living.\n\n I'm sharing this because I know there are others out there addicted who might have a second chance with Kratom. People in pain could use it without losing control. I initially used opiates to aid my hyper extended knee and became addicted. Being addicted starts with something unintentional like an accident. My accident had given me an excuse to use opiates. Kratom stopped my excuses. \n\n Recently I was in a terrible accident with an ex-girlfriend. I suffered a concision and some cosmetic injuries. I was so scared of being given opiates, I begged the ambulance to not give me any opiates, even if I passed out and lost consciousness on the way to the hospital. By then I wasn't using Kratom. I just hope another person out there has the same chance I had to get clean using Kratom to help through it. \n\n Thanks for this opportunity to speak. Please listen to us all! My story is so small compared to the other stories I've read on regards to Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0745","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Diaz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The attached essay is written as a personal testimony to my experiences with Kratom, and I do not make any particular claim as to the effects or safety of Kratom outside of my own personal experience.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12079","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Morgan Joylighter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is not a harmful plant.

If I didn't have Kratom available at the time I would still be on opiates and honestly I was dieing. This plant is not a mind altering substance. I never felt a \"high\" or \"buzz\" from it when I took it. All it did was stop my withdrawal symptoms and if anything had the same sleepy effects as taking the natural supplement Melatonin, which  you can get at any vitamin/supplement store. \nWith this Ban threat from the DEA  I have read a lot of posts online from people saying they will probably end up killing themselves because they use the Kratom for debilitating chronic pain and will be bed ridden again.  I have also read people saying if the Ban goes into an effect they will go back to using illicit drugs. I was very disturbed reading these posts and felt a great sadness. I do believe if Kratom is banned, America is going to be in a lot worse predicament. Suicides will go up and  illicit drug use will increase. Our country can not afford this right now.  I don't think it is fair that the DEA/Government would even threaten to ban this plant when it is helping so many people. If your going to ban this you might as well ban other supplements and over the counter medications. Anything in excessive amounts can have unwanted side effects. Keep it legal and make it mandatory for vendors to put DEA warning labels on the Kratom packages just like how it is on herbal supplements that you buy from stores that say: \"These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease\". For the time being start doing studies and testing with it, I'm sure a lot of people would volunteer for clinical studies. Than after that make a market for it but please don't ruin people's lives.

I am not exaggerating or being dramatic. I was an opiate addict for several years. Heroin, dilaudid, roxys, the list goes on and on. I used them recreationaly as well as alcohol, cocaine, xanax, basically anything I could get my hands on. My drug use nearly destroyed my life forever. Overdoses, arrests, broken relationships, basically everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. I could write a novel about how drugs destroyed me and hurt the people around me. However, I am not that person anymore, and I do my best not to dwell on the past. I started using kratom over 3 years ago. It literally changed my life. I could use kratom at a moderate rate and not feel the need to use opiates and other drugs. I was able to slowly piece my life back together with the help of kratom and the community that came along with it. I regained the trust of my family and friends. I got 2 job offers in the last year, took both of them and have been successful in both. I am almost finished earning my first degree, and most importantly, have not used opiates in over 3 years. I have no desire to go back to the lifestyle I once would have never dreamt of leaving behind. The lifestyle that comes with addiction. I know that my family and loved ones are so happy to have the real Kelsey back in their lives. I am now someone who can treat others with respect, earn trust, earn money and contribute to society, and even follow my dreams. I honestly never thought I would make it this far. I would highly recommend kratom to anyone who is struggling to recover from addiction. If it were not for kratom, I know I would not be where I am today. Please, I am begging the DEA, do not take this opportunity away from the American people. The drug epidemic our country is facing can use all the help it can get. Kratom can literally save lives.

Kratom helps me with my anxiety, insomnia and pain. Although my life is still a struggle, I have many more days than I used to where I can actually get out of bed. I now have days where I can get some chores done although at a slow pace. But this is better than what it was before Kratom. I have had to have quite a few surgeries over the past couple of years and Kratom got me thru that as I was only able to be on pain meds 1 of the 4 times I was operated on.

I also suffer from intractable idiopathic seizure disorder. I was sick and tired of being used as a human guinea pig for all types of \"new\" and \"improved\" pharmaceuticals, all of which failed miserably to provide any sort of relief from any of these diagnoses, and all of which entailed their own new sets of side-effects and new health problems. A friend of mine suggested I give this wonderful plant a try.\n\nI was amazed that after years of immeasurable discomfort and suffering, within hours of using Kratom for the first time, the shooting pain in my back from a herniated L4/L5 was slowly dissipated. The strange mental fog and black clouds that followed me for so long started to lift. Over the course of a week or so, I was able to feel like a human being again. I was able to leave my house and go shopping and get a car wash, perform at work, find happiness in relationships again. The seizures slowed, and then stopped....Kratom has been the single best thing that has every happened to me.\n\nI used to be so sickened by myself and my habits...that I was so depressed and tired that I would let weeks of laundry stack up and become so overwhelmed that I would resort to wearing dirty clothes and go days without having any food in my house. You can't imagine what it's like to have your life given back to you after longing for it to return to normal for so long. It was joyous.\n\nIt would be a terrible travesty and a shame that other people might be deprived of the power of this plant. I understand the concerns of the public and the health officials, but we as adult humans should be given the dignity of our own experience. If something exists that allows for the life, liberty, and happiness that I have found, should we not all be able to make our own decisions about what is right for us and what is not?\n\nI'd like to conclude by saying, simply, that Kratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life, so I'm asking you to please refrain from scheduling this substance at all. If you have questions about kratom, please visit www.americankratom.org.

As I was young I always had pain issues in my knees, and as of the last 4 years my shoulder. I feel some of the issue was because of my age I was never taken seriously about these issues, doctors prescribed me tylenol and ibuprofen, without following with any time of physical therapy to actually resolve these issues. I felt the need to venture on my own, eventually self medicating with other prescriptions.  Although I used them, I didnt necessarily abuse them, until very much later. After years of complicated addiction issues, feeling lost and stuck between feeding an addiction and truly needing pain management help, I stumbled on kratom. To call kratom a dangerous drug is obsurd. In all reality, the intoxicating or euphoric effects are less significant than coffee. But the pain reduction is exactly what I've needed and been looking for. If the argument is addiction, I can promise you the \"withdrawal\" effects again compare to that of a consistent coffee drinker.\n   I truely can't afford for this to become illegal, and I can only see that as extremely devastating to my future. The only possible explanation of this banning of a tea, is that there is some ulterior motives and pressure, which I can only assume are being pushed by big pharmaceutical to take back the people kratom has saved from them. Please, and I beg you, for my life and the life of many others like me, do not give in to this.  I hope and pray the right decision is made.

I have been selling Kratom through my business for the past 2 years. I have been completely amazed how this miracle herb has helped so many people with practically any type of pains. We have many customers who had been addicted to Heroin and other opiates and Kratom has helped them stay away from those dangerous drugs. With news of the possible ban, we have customers who have gone to tears knowing that they made need to go back to prescription drugs and suffer from all the side effects. I also have been taking Kratom for 1 1/2 years. I not only suffer from Arthritis, I have a disease called Temporal Arteritis (TA). My body gets so inflamed that at times it is unbearable. Treatment for the disease is taking Prednisone for about 2 years. Prednisone alleviates the inflammation but the side effects have been devastating. Not only does it rob your body of calcium it has made me artificially diabetic and caused fluid to build up behind the lense of my eyes along with many other terrible side effects.. I have had episodes of Temporal Arteritis 3 different times. The recovery afterwards from taking Prednisone has been at least 1 year each time. That drug is almost worse than the disease itself but I've had no other choice than to take it because the inflammation of TA  can cause blindness.  TA has recently struck me again and I just can't go through taking Prednisone again. Much to my surprise, Kratom has been able to relieve my inflammation. If the ban takes place, my only option may be to take Prednisone again and lose another 2 or more years from my life. Prednisone is so terrible I made choose to let TA run it's course.

I am a 28 year old male who was addicted to all types of pharmaceuticals. I was prescribed Klonopin for Anxiety & Adderall for ADHD. I was becoming anti-social and only wanted to stay indoors, never seeing my friends anymore. I finally had enough of the way the drugs made me feel, and I searched for a natural alternative to prescription drugs, and that's when I discovered Kratom. For nearly 3 years, I've been using Kratom almost daily, with ZERO negative side effects! I get more of a headache if I miss my daily cup of coffee than I do if I skip a day of Kratom. I no longer have to take ANY medicines, aside from the life saving herb, Kratom. Without this plant, I would be losing friends, wasting my life away feeling depressed and like a drug addict. \n\nMy older sister passed away just over a year ago due to opiate overdose. I still regret not telling her about Kratom, it most likely would have saved her life. She tried for years, going to rehab after rehab, she was even in jail for 9 months for being pulled over with oxycontin and xanax. Doctors ruined her life, and since she was a teenager she was addicted to pain killers. Doctors handed them out like candy in the late 90s early 2000s in Florida, and the sister I loved and grew up with was fading away slowly. It tore my family apart, and finally last year, she spent her last day on Earth, due to respiratory depression, and never woke up. \n\nI don't want this to happen to anyone else! Instead of banning a LIFE SAVING HERB, we should be benefiting from it! Regulate it, inform the doctors and the public, even make a profit off of it if you have to... But to ban it altogether? Its going to cause death numbers to sore in the USA once the millions of Kratom users run out of their beloved plant, or cause people to divert back to worse things, like Heroin and Oxycontin, destroying their lives, and ultimately their loved ones too. We have a chance to make a change and fix this opiate epidemic. \n\nKratom is NOT dangerous! I've taken too much before and it just made me a bit nauseous until I laid down. \n\nWhen my sister took too many doctor prescribed drugs, she died. Ask yourself, which is worse? Do your homework before you ruin millions of lives, please. We the people beg of you.\n\nThank You,\nKyle Poffenbarger","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3589","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyle Poffenbarger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Pleasr keep kratom legal it's saved my life I'm completely off of opiods  because of this plant","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10090","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stevevery Hattoy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have chronic Lyme disease and several debilitation co-infections and other autoimmune conditions.

I was in a bad accident 15 years ago and broke my left ankle, right knee cap, femur, and hip. I have since recovered but I have been in various levels of pain ever since. I have come to accept that this will be the case for the rest of my life. Initially I was prescribed narcotics by my doctors and while it worked, after years of this I couldnt stand the ever-increasing dosages and hated being so dependent on a drug. My health started to suffer, as did my personal life and the focus on my business. Because of this, I managed to stop taking them for various lengths of time, but the pain I felt always brought me back. What people who have never experienced chronic pain dont understand is that taking nothing is not an option. No matter how good everything else is going in your life, there is always that cloud overhead darkening everything. The pain has to be treated otherwise you simply cannot go about your daily life.\n   In an effort to find an alternative, I went to a pain clinic and tried all sorts of non-narcotic medications and treatments, but nothing was a good enough substitute. Then a year ago while searching online for all natural alternatives, I discovered kratom. It is simply crushed up leaves from the plant that I mix with water and drink as a tea. I have a couple teaspoons as needed and it controls my pain almost as well as the narcotics. The greatest thing about it is that I am not dependent on it and I dont feel the urge to keep taking it. My mind is clear and I don't have to be scared of taking too much. The effects are extremely subtle, and at its strongest it feels like a relaxing coffee buzz. It even has a ceiling effect, where if you keep taking more it doesnt give you a greater effect. In the past year I have completely turned my life around and if it is banned I will be forced to make a decision to go back to my doctor and start taking narcotics again, or live in pain for the rest of my life. Either option terrifies me and I honestly dont know what I will do. Just when I thought all this was behind me and I was finally happy with my life, something out of my control like this happens. The very people who are supposed to protect me are threatening my right to live a normal, pain-free life. \n   Id like to point out that I am not some teenager trying to catch a quick, legal high. The DEA seems to think that this is what kratom is, but they couldnt be further from the truth. I am 34 years old, and a successful small business owner. I am a normal, tax-paying citizen with a great family. It is not my fault that I require pain management for the rest of my life, but I have the right to take a safer alternative to pharmaceuticals if I want to.\n   Kratom has the potential to improve millions of lives. Others use it to help with Lyme disease and Crohns disease, two diseases that are notoriously hard to treat with modern medicine. There are veterans who take kratom for PTSD. Some of them have to suffer for the rest of their lives because they were protecting this country. But now they are being told that they arent important enough to allow them to take something that makes them feel better? Every 65 minutes a veteran takes his/her life and if there is any possibility that kratom actually could help treat PTSD, shouldnt it be studied? Our country is in the grips of a fentanyl epidemic and banning kratom is going to leave thousands of people with no alternative to dangerous narcotics. How can the government say they are trying to combat this issue when they are trying to take away a safer alternative? Kratom has been used for thousands of years in Southeast Asia and there has not been one reported case of someone dying from it on its own. How is this an imminent danger to our country? There was a Whitehouse.gov petition with over 145,000 signatures. This is not what the public wants. \n   I am glad that the comment period was opened up, but now the DEA/FDA need to leave this up to science, not their opinion. I dont know why they are so biased against this plant, but if a proper study is done, the truth will be revealed. There are plenty of more dangerous substances out there that should be focused on. I have been through enough pain in my life and shouldnt have to worry about something like this in the United States of America. Kratom should be regulated like kava, perhaps with an age limit, but nothing more. And that should be the end of this.

Kratom only makes people feel motivated and happy, it does not cause any psychosis or aggression. Kratom is an innocent victim in the war against opiates, which kratom is not.

I work seasonally, operating heavy equipment at a landscape supply company, and in the off season I homeschool my kids (well, I've got 2 down, one to go!)... Basically, I am busy and I need to be alert and functional! :)\nI began having back pain in my mid 20's, I believe it was a result of carrying my disabled son constantly. I was started on hydrocodone 7.5 mg to combat the pain, but it didn't have much affect and made me sick and dizzy. Not good when you have to physically carry a growing child constantly. The pain worsened, more meds were prescribed, until I was on 10mg methadone and Soma muscle relaxers. I can say in all honesty that I was most certainly addicted physically and mentally. Eventually I was placed on Subutex. I took that for about 8 years. I eventually weaned myself down to .5 mg a day, from 16 mg. No-one tells you that the withdrawals from Subutex are awful, it was touted as a miracle drug. Finally tired of the monthly expense of going to a Dr just to get 8 2mg subutex, I was researching natural painkillers, and natural ways to combat withdrawals, and I came across Kratom. Now, I am a sceptical person, and didn't REALLY expect much from the 20 mg of powder that I ordered... But I was desperate. I took the last .5 mg dose of subutex, the day after Christmas 2014, and I've not touched any prescription medication since. I also had barely noticeable withdrawal from the Subutex. Lest you think it was just the miniscule dose, I had attempted quitting before while taking the .5 mg a day- it was bad.\nKratom WAS MY MIRACLE.\nI beg of you, please do not take this wonderful herb away from us... My pain is manageable... I also haven't had a migraine headache since beginning Kratom, and before I was getting migraines 2-3 times per year. Maybe I just aged out of them, but it's awfully coincidental! :)\nThat's all I wanted to say... Not really eloquent, not really anything you guys haven't read before, but I feel better for being able to add my voice to the many other voices here...

Looking at the facts, CDC Data shows that the tobacco plant, not Kratom plant, is a better candidate to be Schedule I. Some CDC statistics below:\n\nCDC reported deaths:\n         The CDC website documents that 480,000 deaths occur annually as a result of tobacco use. Not only are tobacco users at risk, but many deaths are from the innocent victims close to the tobacco user from second hand smoke. There is no known medicinal value for tobacco and tobacco users do not claim health benefit from its use. Cigarettes are known to be highly addictive.\n         The CDC website documents that in the year 2013, three years before our countrys current epidemic of opiate related deaths, there were 28,467 deaths from use of opioids. Prescription pharmaceuticals were responsible for 18, 893 deaths. Heroin was responsible for 10,574 deaths.\n         The CDC website report:  Notes from the Field: Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) Exposures Reported to Poison Centers  United States, 20102015, states One death was reported in a person who was exposed to the medications paroxetine (an antidepressant) and lamotrigine (an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer) in addition to kratom. In the available literature, there are no known deaths linked to Kratom use alone. In all cases, other medicines or substances were present in the individuals systems. Kratom users report numerous medicinal benefits such as control of pain without use of highly addictive and potentially lethal opioid medicine, and relief of opiate withdrawal symptoms as well as relief of post-acute opiate withdrawal symptoms. I reviewed a sample of the 7,275 public comments so far on the DEA Portal and they reveal an overwhelming number of individuals recieve much benefit from the use of the leaves of the Kratom tree without negative consequences.\n\nIf we really care about public safety, and look at the CDC statistics above, clearly the DEA is planning on scheduling the wrong plant. We have a Public Health Crisis of epidemic proportions related to opioid use and its resultant high risk for addiction and death. Lets keep Kratom off of Schedule I to allow researchers time to provide hard data into its opiate addiction treatment potential as well as other potential medicinal uses. If Kratom becomes Schedule I, then research stops dead in its tracks as researchers cannot obtain the plant to do research. We still allow adults in our country to choose to smoke a deadly cigarette if they like. There is no convincing reason why not to not allow adults to continue to have the choice of plant based herbal healing by using Kratom. \n\nRespectfully,\n\nDiana L.

I'm not a current Kraton user.  However, I object to the idea that a substance that does so much good can be placed on the schedule 1 list without additional study proving harmful side effects or addiction.  My understanding is that the proposed schedule 1 status is precautionary and based on conjecture and \"feelings\" without true evidence.  There are many, many thousands of people who use Kraton as a pain reliever, a mild stimulant, or a way to nullify opiate addiction.  I respectfully urge the DEA to listen to the American people and schedule Kratom based on science/evidence and not on incomplete/inconclusive studies.  If the studies bear out that the plant is addictive or harmful to the point that the DEA feels Kratom is a threat, then so be it.  This plant has been used for decades at various levels without the same concern or demonization as other drugs that have been moved to schedule 1.  My only request is that we study the plant before making it schedule 1.  If people aren't dying or being hurt in tangible ways, what's the harm in leaving this plant legal pending further study?\n\nOn a separate note, there is evidence that Kratom was sold as a commercial supplement in Florida before 1994 and is therefore exempt under the grandfathering via the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7773","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dave Messman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"So glad that we are all being heard.

I preserve my health and wellbeing through diet, exercise, and yoga - reinforced with study and diligent pursuit of the same; because, at the end of the day - I am solely responsible and accountable to my experience outside of direct interference or accident.\n\tTo this end I have, for the most part, eliminated alcohol, caffeine, and do not smoke tobacco - all of which are legal and can be highly addictive.  I have been fortunate enough to not have had any major trauma requiring an invasive surgery to repair injury.\n\tIn this light I am less tolerant of synthetics and processed foods, and indeed seem to experience a stronger response when I do indulge in what most consider a normal or average consumption of fast-food and processed foods - or perhaps I am just more sensitive to the same symptoms that others have and simply cannot accept them as chronic or incurable, as more and more people misunderstand and not recognize the ill effects of their own food allergies.\n\tIt is in the above framework, perhaps once a week or two, that I enjoy a couple grams of pulverized or powdered Kratom leaf in hot water with a bit of milk and honey. I have made this tea for others, as one would make a guest a cup of coffee - to no ill effects.\n       Comparatively, alcohol, according to the CDC kills 88,000 people a year compared to DEA's claims of Kratom causing at least 7.5 deaths per year, and not exclusively attributable to Kratom itself and of clearly dubious relevance. And yet alcohol is not schedule one. The same goes for cigarettes and pharmaceuticals.  They all have caused more harm than Kratom to society, and remain legal. Yet something that is reputed to help those who suffer from addiction to any of the above is now considered harmful, and with scant evidence; evidence which should already be in their possession considering the massive impounds and confiscations across the country - even before their own deadline. \n       Furthermore, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has just recently released his report Facing Addiction in America (on alcohol, drugs and health) because this has reached epidemic proportions in our country, and there is strong evidence, as with Alabama banning Kratom in May 2016, where Birmingham saw overdose deaths double in the following month, naturally none attributable to Kratom.  It should be clear where the problem really lies.\n      This is a clear abuse of authority when I can still legally drink and smoke myself to death upon my own recognizance.\nIf there is some evidence that independent and other researchers can show harmful effects from Kratom consumption, then we, as Citizens should hear that, and let consumers decide for themselves as with anything else within reasonable purview.\n       I have personally witnessed the analgesic and calming effects of Kratom on others through simple teas or chewing of the leaf, and, from what I have seen: there is no evidence to show cause for any emergency scheduling of Kratom's active components.\n      At this point we need open-market trade that protects the jungles where Kratom is being harvested - as my understanding is they will cut down a whole tree for its leaves. Open, safe legal trade will allow business to develop and sustainable harvesting and farming methods can be implemented, as I know some distributors are already working towards.  Let's have a humane even-handed approach to this.\n\nSteven Godo Kiss -  Oregon Nov. 2016\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20032","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steven Godo Kiss","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not believe this drug should be made a schedule 1 drug.

I watched through these years how the heroin epidemic was surging AND the chronic pain sufferers were being targeted for pain medications taken away.  I knew it was only a matter of time before they'd get to me and I also knew Id never again seek pain pills from the street because it was too dangerous, so my resolution would be to commit suicide.  \n\nBUT in early 2016, I found out about Kratom and the rest is history.....\nIt has been almost one year since using Kratom and my life has changed for the better.  \n\nI am appealing to the DEA to NOT ban this plant because it has helped thousands of people just like me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7649","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Terasa Harris","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Since october 2014 I survived two cancers (throat+thyroid) with the help of my outstanding doctors,my Family and determination, but there is a long road ahead before we can claim final victory.

I am a college educated professional who has never been in trouble with the law for any reason. I have taken Kratom on and off for over 4 years now. This is not the addictive plant that it has been labeled. I trust Kratom to rid my body of an occasional migraine, anxiety attack or sciatic pain more than I do those medicines prescribed to me or recommended OTC by a physician. A natural plant with little to no side effects should not be criminalized and given the same fate as Marijuana. People desire natural, herbalist remedies for their bodies, not something produced in a lab to synthesize the effect of a natural substance. I would hate to see innocent people, such as myself, arrested for something that has so much potential for good. More research needs to be done and making Kratom a Schedule 1 substance will make that impossible.

Kratom has changed my life for the better and I am opposed to the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.\n\nFor the most part, I consider myself just an average white collar office worker that leads a normal, typical life. I enjoy spending time with friends and family, and I have a few hobbies that enable me to have a good work/life balance. I've never been arrested, I pay my taxes on time, and I consider myself a good law abiding person. I don't do drugs and I drink maybe a couple times a month.\n\nI injured my back nearly twenty years ago and have been dealing with that ever since. Initially I was able to treat my injury by being aggressive with physical therapy and exercise. As I got older, and as my body started to break down, it started to give me more problems. Eventually it got to the point where I had surgery. The surgery remedied some of the issues but in some ways it made things worse.\n\nI still do my core exercises and have tried many different things to alleviate my chronic pain. I am prescribed by my doctor hydrocodone as well as muscle relaxers. I am very aware of the opiate epidemic our country is facing and when I first started taking these medicines, quite frankly I was worried.\n\nI take my medicine as prescribed and also every once in a while take a break in order to control my body's tolerance to the medication. I have no problems when I take those breaks and I feel very fortunate that I'm able to do so without any issues. I understand that many people addicted to opiates aren't able to control themselves like I am, and I'm very, very thankful for that. I don't know if it's genetic, mental, maybe both, but I guess I don't have that addictive personality. \n\nA couple years ago I discovered Kratom while searching the internet for natural supplements that could provide pain relief. After a lot of online research, I decided to try it and was very surprised to find how effective it was. I now take kratom a couple times of day and have cut back my intake of hydrocodone. \n\nWhile kratom is not as effective as the opiate based medicine, it has been a huge benefit on my life. The pain relieving effects last longer and doesn't make me drowsy like the opiate medicine. This has allowed me to be more active especially when it comes to outdoor activities like hiking, hunting, and fishing.\n\nI don't spend my time online visiting kratom sites or forums, and I was surprised to learn of the ban. Like many others, news of the ban was disheartening and troubling. If the ban goes through like thousands of other people I will be very disappointed and will have to revert back to taking my prescribed opiate medicine more often. I'm fortunate that I have a doctor that understands the issues with my injury and knows that I'm not taking the hydrocodone just for a good time.\n\nI can't speak for anyone else but kratom does not get me \"high\", nor does it mimic taking hydrocodone. For me it's like taking Advil that is strong enough to provide pain relief and drinking a large cup of coffee. \n\nThe kratom ban will negatively affect thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands people. If the purpose of the DEA ban is to protect people from the harmful effects of kratom I believe it will actually make things worse. I am hoping my voice is heard. I'm hoping the DEA will look at the facts and even further study kratom before making a decision to ban it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12916","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please reconsider your ban on kratom.

Of course it was not easy for her to stop taking all the prescription but she eventually did and now just takes Kratom. AND the best thing of all is she is back to being a MOM. She is cooking and playing with her grandkids now. She is going places and getting out of the house. She is so much happier. Her pain has not disappeared because of Kratom , she still has bad days. BUT, she has a lot more good days now that kratom is in her life. I never want to see my mom like that again , and if you could put yourself in my shoes, YOU would not want to see your mother drugged up and listless , lethargic, wasting away.

Let me tell you about how kratom has helped me to turn my life around and become a better, healthier, more productive person.\nFrom the time I started high school drinking has always been a big part of my life. I am a fairly young man but alcohol (and my addiction to it) have caused me more problems than anyone should ever have in a lifetime. During high school my drinking went from being a fun thing to do with friends behind our parents backs to a dangerous dependence. By the time I was 18 I was drinking to black out every single night. When I was 19 I crashed my car and was charged with driving under the influence. At 21 I was diagnosed with pancreatitis. When I tried to quit drinking cold turkey I had to be hospitalized due to extreme hallucinations and erratic behavior (delirium tremens). That experience was a nightmare. I managed to stay sober for about 6 months but then I found myself drinking just as much, if not more, than I had been before the hospitalization. This cycle repeated itself 3 more times. At 24 years old I managed to get clean for long enough to enlist in the US Army. I thought that putting myself into new surroundings with different people might help me get my life on track That went well for the first year but soon I found myself binge drinking every night and eventually I was discharged after I got caught drinking while I was enrolled in the Army's substance abuse program. Once I got home I felt ashamed that I had failed and continued to drink. This led to another hospitalization for pancreatitis. I was in the hospital for 9 days and it took me months to fully recover. My family recommended me to a therapist who suggested that I try using kratom. She said that it had helped many people withdraw and stay clean from various harmful substances. The first time I consumed kratom, I had a feeling that everything was going to be okay. It didn't make me feel intoxicated but it did give me a minor boost in energy and mood which helped me to turn my focus away from alcohol. It gave me a feeling of confidence, that I would be able to stay sober at least one more day. I began consuming kratom tea a few times a week. Whenever I felt like I wanted alcohol I would drink a little bit of kratom tea and it helped me to focus on positive things and productivity. It has now been three years since my last drink. While I cannot attribute all of my sobriety to kratom, it has definitely played a huge part in my success. Abstaining from a serious alcohol addiction takes a lot of hard work, determination and dedication but I know that I wouldn't be where I am today without the aid of this wonderful plant. I still consume kratom regularly and I fear that the repercussions of a federal ban would threaten my happiness, well-being and my sobriety. I have worked for and gained so much these past three years. Kratom has done nothing but good in my life and I know that I am not alone. I ask that the DEA please reconsider it's proposed plan of placing kratom on the list of other schedule 1 substances. This plant has so much to offer humanity. It has helped myself and so many others lead healthier, happier, more productive lives. This plant is truly a gift from God growing right out of the ground. Please do not throw it away because of a lack of understanding of it or because it may or may not financially benefit certain parties. I thank you for taking the time to read my story and I truly hope that you take it to heart. Please do not ban kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19287","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jacob Faust","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\nRJ Tabit \n24411 Newhall Ave #201\nNewhall, Ca 91321\n\n\nHello, and thank you for taking the time to read my story.

My father introduced me to Kratom, and it helped with my stomach problems, high blood pressure, headaches, sleep problems, anxiety, and without it I would not be the same, and there is no doctor on this earth who can help that (I've been to so many that did not help me), but this should not be mistaken for an addiction because my consumption is limited, and within reason - and I've never felt any addiction or \"need\" to take this plant. It alleviates my serious issues, and I cannot stress enough the importance of the fiber, the plant matter which assists me with my stomach issues and finally being able to go to the bathroom correctly on a regular basis! That's what this plant has done it's helped me so much! It is imperative that you understand the importance of this because doctors can't fix everything, they will just prescribe you pills or medicines that are harmful and expect you to be on your way, this is completely different and is not in the same category as the whack medicine that some people in our society subscribe to. This plant does not get you \"high\" and is nothing like marijuana or the drugs you have scheduled. I am not in the category of the people who smoke marijuana, because I don't. I don't drink alcohol - not a single drop. I am your professional executive worker who helps run the businesses in your country which keep it going daily. I have done amazing things with my life and I'm still young, and excited about the future.\nSure, I still go to the doctor and I'm as healthy as ever! As the years progressed I have received regular physicals and blood tests, which have proven to me without a doubt that the Kratom is good! It lowered my high blood pressure, my cholesterol, and gives me the regular energy to continue my exercises and health maintenance. It changed my life!\nI know that this is new to our world, and you should take that into consideration - as our society is constantly changing. In this sense, I have watched the plant become the center of controversy, when I know with absolute certainty that it is not harmful (you want harmful look at alcohol and the people it hurts, or cigarettes which kill thousands of people), I've watched the news go from \"against\" to \"for\", and almost a million people now consuming the plant. If there is one thing in this life that I truly would like is for your organization to take their actions very seriously when it comes to Kratom and the future of its usage. Kratom is not a drug, and it should not be scheduled and kept from the public, nor should it make criminals of us, normal law-abiding citizens! It is not harmful to the public, and it helps those who use it more than you can ever know. I can honestly say I've watched people change their lives with the plant. I've known at least 4 people who used the plant to completely turn their life around for the absolute best. Believe it or not, so many people in our country consume Kratom, and based on the statistics, the reader of this comment probably knows people who use it without being aware of it - and the only reason they wouldn't know is because of the fear you have instilled upon the country into believing they are doing something wrong, when they are not.\nUltimately, if you decide on any regulation, I would only say for those that are 18 and under should not have access. In all honesty, the \"idea\" of this plant has been misinterpreted by other humans and they should respect it in all seriousness, instead of putting it in flashy bags and selling it in head shops just to make money. In this sense, yes it needs regulation, but not major scheduling. There must be an alternative and I pray that you help find it with us.\n\nThank you for the chance to make a comment,\n\nJeff H., M.S.\n\nDocket No. DEA-442W\nFederal Register Number: 2016-24659\nID: DEA-2016-0015-0006\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10843","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeff H.","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir:\n\nI am a thirty-five year old lawyer in Boston, Massachusetts, and I write to you to request that you decline to schedule kratom as a controlled substance.  First, I would suggest that it is entirely inappropriate for the DEA to schedule kratom on an emergency basis, as there is no indication that it presents an imminent risk--or any risk at all-- to public health.  In its original notice of intent to schedule kratom on an emergency basis, the agency pointed to fifteen deaths that were anecdotally related to kratom.  Such anecdotal evidence does not, however, constitute evidence that kratom was in fact the cause of any of those deaths, or even contributed in any substantial way to them.  Moreover, such a small number of adverse reactions-- even if they could be definitively tied to kratom-- pale in comparison to the number of deaths caused each year by alcohol, tobacco, or prescription drugs.  Six people die EVERY DAY from alcohol poisoning in the United States.  Almost 500 per year die from taking too much Tylenol.  In contrast, the claim that kratom constitutes a public health crisis appears somewhat absurd.  \n\nFurthermore, if such a substantial risk were posed by kratom, one would assume that in the intervening months between the DEA's initial notice of intent to schedule kratom, the withdrawal of that notice, and the modified public comment period, that many additional deaths or adverse health consequences would have arisen.  I would ask you to consider that no such consequences have materialized in determining whether kratom truly presents any sort of risk to public health or safety.\n\nFinally, I would ask you to consider that many, many Americans have benefited enormously from the use of this supplement.  Many chronic pain patients, veterans with PTSD, and individuals with a wide array of other conditions have found that kratom helps them to manage their symptoms without resorting to dangerous prescription drugs.   I am one of those individuals. I have suffered from chronic back pain since sustaining an injury as a child, and have tried virtually every treatment available in order to alleviate it-- including physical therapy, yoga, acupuncture, and prescription drugs.  I have visited doctors and specialists and therapists in order to address my pain, with little success.  Until just a few years ago, I had resigned myself to working part time because it was so difficult for me just to get out of bed each day.  Then I discovered kratom, thanks to my husband, who had taken it upon himself to research alternative therapies to help me. A combination of kratom and regular yoga practice has helped me enormously, and I have been able to return to work full time.  It has truly changed my life.  Because I have access to this supplement, I have not had to resort to taking the dangerous opiates that so many pain patients are forced to take just to survive day-to-day, and have been able to live a full, happy, and healthy life.  I would ask you to consider that there are very few options available to those of us who do suffer terribly from chronic pain.  Please do not take this natural alternative away from us. There has simply been no showing whatsoever that there are any substantial risks posed by kratom, and to the contrary, it has improved many Americans' lives greatly, including my own.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22320","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a current kratom user.

I have been a drinker for most of my life, and had noticed recently that I more or less drink Alcohol every day. It never became a serious problem, but I started to realize my health was deteriorating because of this. I decided to stop, and immediately began having withdrawls. They were awful, and the first night I was so uncomfortable I returned to the bottle, if only to get to sleep. The second day, determined, I researched supplements and vitamin's that would ease the physical tension I felt, and ultimately returned home with a pharmacy bag of various over the counter medicines. These did very little, and so I delved deeper into the vast knowledge of others who had battled (and beaten!) the terrible feeling of withdrawl. I read many brilliant, shining, glowing success stories of people whos lives were literally saved by a well known plant called Mitryaga Speciosa, and immediately found and bought some under the name \"kratom\". I took the reccomended serving size that afternoon while in the middle of the first 48 hours of withdrawl, feeling so hopeless and depressed that I felt like crawling out of my own skin. Within 15 minutes my feeling of Alcohol withdrawal had almost COMPLETELY subsided. I immediately felt my body re-balance, and my mental outlook clarify. I slept that night, and in the morning I awoke refreshed, yet still in the thick of withdrawl. I repeated the dose once a day for four days, and after that I felt like I had my body back. I haven't had a drink in over 6 months, and I owe it completely to this wonderful supplement; A medicine that God provided us. PLEASE don't turn other people who are in a similar predicament into criminals for simply reaching for help from a natural medicine. A medicine that they can afford, take without side effects, and actually see results from! Please, I truly beg you to consider the benefits of giving Kratom a little more time to be studied, and I plead with you to consider the reprocussion's of alienating the already thousands of Americans that are responsibly using Kratom for medical purposes.

There can be no other reason for this push. The suggestion by the SEA that kratom is suddenly killing large numbers of people cannot be substantiated by proof as less than 15 people have died as a result of use of kratom in past 2 years. A person is more likely, 1,000 times more likely to die from Advil or Tylenol which are uncontrolled pain meds that from kratom. To suggest it is a growing epidemic in our country can also not be substantiated with any proof. I urge not only lawmakers and other officials, but the entire general public to take a few steps back and ask, \"What is the real reason kratom is being banned?\" Cause I assure you that it is in no way medically related. In order to continue with ban the burden of proof must lay upon those applying for said ban. Prove beyond any doubt this alarming number of fatalities from kratom, the sharp and continuing increase in addiction, crime, accidents, death, etc., all from kratom. Do not accept sponsored or purchased testimonials from any doctors or medical personnel who stand to benefit from the ban, as well as any lobbying entities who are being compensated astronomical amounts of money to sway public opinion. I urge every citizen whether you use kratom or not to stand up to any lawmaker of official who would decide to make anything unlawful for everyday use just so big pharma can turn right around and monopolize it for profits.

After being diagnosed with a degenerative bone disease that will cause me immense pain for the rest of my life, I was put on prescription narcotic pain relievers. I, like millions of people, became addicted by following my doctors orders. I was tired of the side effects and withdrawal from not even abusing my medicine, but by trying to have a normal life without them. I did research for months until I came across the miracle plant, kratom. Within one week, I was off my meds. I now have a pain management program that allows me to work, sleep without terrors and live a life not hazed out by narcotics. Had I not switched to kratom, I can only imagine what my life would be. \n\nBanning kratom would kill thousands of people with nowhere to turn but back to the poison their doctors give them. To say kratom has no medicinal purpose is uninformed and plainly incorrect. Kratom users are not teens and drug addicts looking for a cheap high. We are fathers, sons, CEOs, police officers and tax paying American citizens looking for a way out of the death grip that are pharmaceuticals. \n\nThere is no \"high\" that hard drug users would look for associated with kratom. It truly is a miracle and a chance at a normal life for millions of people living with chronic pain. We aren't in back alleys dying in droves, we aren't stealing from our family so we don't get sick. The deaths \"associated\" with kratom all had the presence of hard narcotics or pharmaceuticals involved. This plant is no more harmful then it's cousin coffee, which is probably being consumed by the person reading this message. I ask you, would you not fight if the government told you that coffee had no purpose and was dangerous to the public? Of course you would, because like kratom, coffee is a natural substance that has been used for betterment of man kind for thousands of years.\n\nI implore you with the utmost respect to reconsider this pending ban. Kratom can and does save lives. The pharmaceutical companies of course don't want anyone to know that you can manage pain and have a life not addicted to their products. They need us to be addicted to profit. So as an American citizen, I ask you, the people who make decisions on our behalf, to please retract this ban until long term research as the effective medicine kratom is, can be done. Nobody wants the research more then kratom users. We know the benefits, we live better, more productive lives because of it. Please, don't send thousands to a death sentence in the name of profits. I can honestly say, without kratom, I may not be alive to ask you to help save more lives.\n\nI thank you for reading and hope you will take the time to understand the plant and all its benefits before banning it and killing thousands of people who simply want to live normally without the pain and suffering caused by prescription drugs. I hope that through this process you have a chance to meet and understand those of us who use kratom, and realize our true intent. Please help save this plant, it does more to help people then you may ever realize.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7148","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Montesano","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was completely unaware of the importance of Kratom until I listened to Joe Rogan's podcast.

I am 24 years old, female, and I am a server at a family owned restraunt in Arvada, Colorado. I know my job does not show it, but I have actually come a long way from where I was  a year go. All my life I have struggled with anxiety and depression. Whether it was passed down to me through my father or I acquired it from years of peer bullying is unknown to me. I have seen many psychiatrists and counselors throughout my young life. I was put on many antidepressants,  all of which had horrible side effects and made me feel like a walking zombie. A couple years ago I decided that since these medications were not helping and the counseling proved uneffective, I was going to self medicate. I bet you can guess what I chose as my poison. Like many, I chose alcohol. It was convenient,  always available,  and even being under 21 at the time I could access it easily. My life spiraled out of control from the moment I picked up the bottle. Long story short, I lost my friends, my job, compromised the relationship between me and my family, I basically lost my young life. Not to mention my health declined   quickly and it showed through my pale and bloated alcoholic skin. \nI tried getting counseling, I tried the medications again, but nothing could keep me and my liquid lover apart. The anxiety and depression always came back and it was unbearable without alcohol. As I was reading an online blog about addicts and anxiety sufferers, I came across the mention of kratom. I read positive things about it and desperate to get relief from the agony of depression and the shame of alcoholism, I decided to give it a try. I do not abuse kratom like I abused alcohol, simply put, I can't. It would be impossible to abuse kratom in the way so many abuse illicit drugs simply for the reason that kratom is not well tolerated in high doses and you often just get a bad case of nausea if you go overboard. If you use it too regularly it has no effect at all which deters users from abusing it as well. Kratom has helped me in so many ways. It has releived my anxiety, helped with my energy levels from anemia caused by my drinking habits, and best of all it saved me from losing my life to alcohol. When I heard the DEA was planning on making it a schedule  1 drug I was stunned. This herb that barely alters one's state of mind is being deemed deadly and toxic yet alcohol and other prescription drugs are allowed to keep working their evil and wrecking the lives of those whose suffering probably is not well understood by the gentleman in his lab coat researching causes of addiction. I have always trusted the DEA and their decisions, but this movement to ban an herb that, by itself,  has shown may times to be quite harmless makes me doubt where the DEA's true interests really lie. With all do respect I do not mean to be accusatory but this ban has me scratching my head wondering what else that has been deemed \" bad \" is really actually quite harmless, and the opposite of that which is legal. Many citizens I speak to feel the same. Thank you for taking the opportunity to read and consider my thoughts on the subject. At least I can say I did my part.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12587","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Natalie Pickup","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The government shouldn't be banning this.

From personal experience and review of online sources of information, I believe it would be a mistake to place kratom into Schedule 1, even temporarily. Doing so would immediately move kratom sales into the black market, effectively putting more money into criminal hands, and vastly increasing the possibility of kratom being cut with other, more dangerous drugs, which would skew reports of kratom-related ER visits.\n\nUsers have reported medical benefits, so I believe the even if studies find it dangerous, in would be extremely inappropriate to put it in Schedule 1 since that would effectively shut down further research to validate or disprove its medical value.\n\nNo deaths have ever been associated with kratom, and as far as I could find in my research, no violent crimes. I believe leaving it as an uncontrolled substance makes it substantially easier to study, and that a body of peer-reviewed studies is definitely called for before classifying kratom into any Schedule as a controlled substance ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6085","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lev Koszegi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Let me introduce myself, I'm a wife and mother of 3 girls, ages 16, 12 and 6.

In fact, they have and my fear of them has often times forced me to stay home rather than go out and enjoy things with my family or even attempt to work. \nI also have been prescribed a few different anti-depressants over years, along with different benzodiazepines.

I found it about a year ago. Since supplementing with Kratom, I feel like I found my old self which was buried under my illness. I love that it is natural and that I have never felt addicted. One of the reasons I didn't like the benzodiazepines was the fact that they sometimes made me feel high. Getting high has never been something I wanted, I just wanted to feel normal to be able to attend events with my husband and kids.

One that could help so many people suffering as I have. Also, I read that it could be a very good aid in our current opiod epidemic.

I was in a car wreck a little over three years ago and I suffer from chronic back pain. I was on prescription drugs for about 3 months until I had a friend recommend Kratom. I knew after the first day that I did not want to take pain killers again and I could live a healthy life without the drug side affects. The states that have already made Kratom illegal have greatly impacted people's lives in a horrible way. Now we are faced with the possibility of it becoming illegal in our country. I am 28 years old, a wife and mother of two young boys, and I also work as Barber. This natural plant has provided a way to live and be closer to how I was before I got hurt. I do not have other options and I refuse to take prescription drugs and live with the horrible side affects, not to mention the possibility of addition from those drugs. I do not choose to use medical marijuana because it alters me and I do not desire that. I am a simple Christian mother who needs a plant to help me daily with pain that I did not ask for. But I am asking that you rethink the decision and to let me have the right to choose what natural plant or herb works best. I pray and hope that our government will listen to so many great citizens and allow us to keep our livelyhoods. Thank you.

I was prescribed klonopin and valium starting from age 24, but the daily use of these drugs has damaged my memory. 9 years ago I discovered kratom had the same basic affect on my anxiety as valium but without any side effects. I stopped taking valium and relied solely on kratom and have never felt better.\n\nIf the kratom ban goes into effect Ill be forced to go back to memory-destroying benzodiazepines. I may soon find myself unable to work as memory problems have a serious impact on my career as an engineer.\n\nOn the issue of kratom addiction, I would put forth that nearly all pharmaceutical substances are addictive in some way. It took me several weeks to taper my way off of valium and even longer for effexor in order to avoid serious withdrawal issues. Using kratom daily does create a small dependence, but it's easily mitigated by tapering over a period of a few days/weeks.\n\nI've been using 14g a day of kratom for nearly a decade. In 2013 I tested how hard stopping kratom would be and went off of it for a few months. The first day without felt like a bad cold, and the two weeks after that I had insomnia, but after that I was fine. Compared with effexor, a legal prescription SNRI, kratom was far easier to wean myself off of.

Remember that Dilaudid by the Dr's they just dropped me without tapering me off I was so sick! I had seizures and high heart rate & depressed breathing, etc. All of that nastiness that comes from drugs! Kratom does not do the same thing at all and it helps with pain! It does not taste good however but you get over it I gag on pills too and withdraw from them it's awful. I'm in my pain without Kratom but not withdraw.

In my case, I have recently celebrated over a year sober from alcohol after over 13 years of struggle and Kratom is one of the tools at my disposal that I find invaluable.  \n\nI find Kratom to be completely non-addictive physically and non-habit forming, being used only acutely for anxiety or times when I feel I am about to fall \"off the wagon\" and need something that will \"take the edge off\" without adverse side effects.  I have been prescribed several psycho-active medications over the years and I can personally attest that these legal pharmaceuticals have FAR worse side effects for me than Kratom ever has.  In case you are wondering what negative side effects I have experienced with Kratom, they are as follows: sleeplessness if taken too close to bedtime, temporary nausea IF too much is taken.  \n\nI understand that there is much misinformation about Kratom both in the media and in the for-profit \"recovery\" industry.  \"Schedule 1\" as I have been led to understand it though should be reserved for highly dangerous substances that have no medicinal uses.  I can say from personal experience that it DOES have great medicinal uses with few side effects.  I can also personally compare apples-to-apples between Kratom and the typical pharmaceutical medications that are prescribed to help with addiction and anxiety.  Unequivocally Kratom's self-regulating nature and lack of side effects makes it far superior that the pharmaceuticals that led me to near suicide 2 years ago.  \n\nResearch and regulation is certainly in order where Kratom is concerned, but NOT banning.  Please do not give in to panic and make a decision that will hurt millions by listing Kratom as a Schedule 1 substance.\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10358","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steven Floder","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My belief is that the proposed scheduling of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I is unwarranted. The plant that contains the aforementioned substances is known as Kratom. It is an effective, natural substance that mimics the effects of mild opiate drugs, while not an opiate in it's chemical structure. I became familiar with it's beneficial properties after I had been taking medically prescribed hydrocodone( for a chronic back-pain condition) for about three months. My doctor didn't want me to continue with the hydrocodone, and would not refill my prescription. \nWhen I lowered my dose, in anticipation of running out, not only did my pain increase, but the horrible withdrawal symptoms began to appear, and were incapacitating. While researching other options online, I came across Kratom, and it had a lot of positive user comments. \nDeciding to take a chance, I ordered some. In a few days, it arrived in my post office box. I mixed a teaspoon of it with some orange juice, drank it down, and waited...... about 15 minutes had passed when I began to feel the withdrawal symptoms subside. Within an hour, my chills, shaking, and nausea had disappeared, as well as this, the constant pain I felt in back began to diminish. \nWell, to summarize, I have taken this herb daily for the last four years, and have not noticed any deleterious effects. That said, I'm not a scientist, but I am an educated man. At sixty-two years of age, I've had a lot of experience with addictive drugs, including a seven year addiction to heroin. I've been clean now for twenty years. I can only believe that had I known about kratom back in the nineteen nineties, I could have avoided the devastating addiction that led me to becoming a homeless, hopeless wreck. I think that the DEA should welcome this \"drug\". It could help prevent people of all ages from becoming addicted to prescribed opiates, as well as heroin. \nIf the government is really interested in the health of the nation, and wants to quell the opiate \"epidemic\", it needs to investigate Kratom in an unbiased, methodical manner. It is my belief that the proposed Schedule I designation of Kratom is being driven by big pharma companies who don't want Americans to use anything other than their own products, regardless of the pervasive abuse of these drugs.

Kratom has also replaced the redbulls I use to drink. without the redbulls I'm avoiding those calories. Kratom gives me the same energy that redbull does. I know with kratom I wouldn't be where I am today. Drinking those coffees and redbulls put a lot of weight on me but now that I don't crave that stuff ibmve lost a few pounds.

Having suffered from arthritis, chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, and social phobia from a young age, I discovered kratom as many others have, namely, online while searching for natural remedies to supplement my current medications, which are effective, but only partially alleviate my often debilitating constellation of symptoms. The effects--and lack of side effects--have been remarkable, allowing me to socialize and exercise and generally live my life like a normal person, without the pain and fatigue that in the past have made simple daily activities difficult and even sometimes impossible. \n\nI know I am not alone in my experience. The kratom plant has been used safely for hundreds of years, and thousands of people around the world use it daily without any serious problems--and no deaths from overdose. Scientific research demonstrates a unique lack of respiratory depression when using kratom. It is no more habit-forming than coffee, and vastly safer and less deleterious to health than alcohol. There is simply no reason whatsoever to ban the use of such a benign herbal supplement.\n\nWe can see the failure of the prohibit and punish methods of the Drug War all around us. At a time when we as a nation should be seeking new and more effective methods of controlling substance abuse through regulation and treatment, banning more substances--particularly ones as beneficial and benign as kratom--is bad for all Americans. I urge you to reverse course on this issue and recognize the scientific consensus that kratom should remain legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18630","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Caleb Founds","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This plant helped save my life. I was a heroin addict for two years and had several failed attempts at getting clean. Even using Rx medication Suboxone. On my most recent attempt at getting clean, and after extensive research, I decided to try Kratom. It made withdrawal more than tolerable. It provided relief from the joint pain, anxiety, depression, and desire to isolate. I felt no \"high\" I just felt... Normal. Which was a great feeling after being a prisoner to heroin. I had no ill side effects. I used kratom for about one month then I pursued the vivatrol injection for long term addiction management. I do not see kratom as dangerous. And certainly no more addictive than caffeine. I am positive that if safe alternatives to opioids continue to be taken from the public this country will see an increase in opioid addiction. No one can argue that's the last thing this country can afford. Just look at the response to the threat of losing Kratom? Those people will still be in need of pain relief and will turn right back to opioids including Heroin. Which will probably be easier to get than Kratom if made a scheduled\"drug\". Don't be misled by companies who have something to financially gain from this action. Listen to the people who have nothing to gain but safe pain relief and an effective way to get off opioids.

This is especially important in my line of work because the safety of the public is involved.\n\nWhen I was in West Palm Beach I scheduled to meet with a licensed civil engineer who worked for the Florida Department of Transportation for networking purposes.

We drank this tea because we did not want to deal with the negative effects of alcohol. \n\nI personally did not find this substance, which is derived from a naturally occurring plant, to be dangerous at a reasonable dosage. The tea I drank had a local analgesic effect on my mouth, and also made me feel mildly relaxed. I did not perceive myself to have cognitive impairment other than mild relaxation. The tea seemed more like an herbal supplement than a traditional drug.\n\nI feel that the attempt to schedule this substance is an overreaction and misunderstanding due to fear. If the substance helps individuals with opiate addictions, I would encourage them to see if kratom could help. I would personally feel much more comfortable using kratom for pain or addiction than a prescription opiate painkiller. I would encourage the DEA to adopt a policy that allowed for research to be conducted on the substance.

I've been taking kratom once or twice a week for over a year know and have no desire or need to take anymore. Something I could never have done on Vicodin. The increase in calls to the poison control center is incredibly small compared to the increase in use of kratom and to the number of calls for prescription painkillers.

I've struggled with an autoimmune disorder for the last 20 years, during most of that time I've taken numerous drugs, more than I can remember or count, some pulled from the market, others with extremely harsh side effects and addictive.  For about 8-9 years of that time, I was on opioid pain medication, trying to maintain the pain and continue with my life.  Unfortunately, over time, the drugs and their side effects changed me and my personality.  I was lucky enough to recognize this and stop taking them about 3-1/2 years ago, but struggle on a daily basis with the pain, which affected my focus at work and prevented me from doing normal daily activities.  I took over the counter drugs all day, but always more than recommended, which is also extremely harmful.  About 1-1/2 years ago I learned about Kratom, a natural plant that grows in the wild, and it changed my life.  I was suddenly able to do normal activities and stay focused on projects, because I wasn't constantly distracted by the pain I normally feel!  It was amazing, I felt like a person again, that was until a few months ago with the threat of having this plant banned.  I do not understand the madness behind this?  You have pharmaceutical companies that are legal drug dealers, they are selling drugs that are extremely harmful, addictive and are literally killing people, yet you want to ban a plant that grows in the wild, on it's own not made in a lab?  How can you ban mother nature?  Why don't you ban half of the pharmaceuticals out there?  You have these large corporations that are bankrupting and killing people for profit, they even build in money for lawsuits when they price the drugs, and you consider that ok, but not a plant?  If you care at all about how this plant has helped people and changed their lives and helped them stop taking these harmful drugs, you will not ban Kratom.  This is not a drug, it's a plant.  I cannot, and many people cannot, go back to opioids, and banning Kratom will do that.  My only thought is this is being backed by the pharmaceutical companies, those whose profit is being affected by this plant.

Kratom has been an essential tool I have used over the past year to combat treatment-resistant PTSD and major depressive disorder. I fear that if kratom is no longer available to me, my recovery would be halted or, worse, I may slide back into the darkness that previously enveloped me. \nI have suffered from mental illness for most of my life. At a young age, I was diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I was able to control my symptoms with the help of an SSRI and talk therapy. But my mental illnesses spiraled out of control when my husband committed suicide with a shotgun in our home. \nMy life was shattered and, unsurprisingly, I developed PTSD. In the immediate aftermath, I stopped eating and sleeping. If I did sleep, I had graphic nightmares. I was unable to care for myself  my friends and family had to make sure that I was getting out of bed, eating, and bathing. Thankfully, I do not remember many details of the year following his death. My psyche spared me memories of the white-hot emotional pain I am sure I endured.\nI spent the next 3 years of my life in a benzodiazepine-induced haze. My breakfast consisted of a handful of prescription pills to address various symptoms of PTSD. I was unable to sleep without pills. Even with strong sedatives, it wasnt uncommon for me to stay awake for 24 hours at a time. When I closed my eyes, I was terrified of the images my mind would conjure if I submitted to sleep. The more exhausted I became, the more frequently I had flashbacks. As the frequency of my flashbacks increased, my ability to function decreased. It was a cycle from which I could not escape. \nWhen you suffer from PTSD, you are constantly on guard against an invisible and omnipresent enemy. Days are choreographed to sidestep any reminder of the incident that destroyed your life. I avoided situations and places that could provoke a flashback such as watching television, walking around town, going to work, visiting friends, grocery shopping, and many other things other people do without thinking twice. In the event that something did penetrate the fortress I created around myself, I would find myself writhing on the floor in emotional pain so deep that it bordered on physical. \nThis avoidance behavior became so severe that I was diagnosed with agoraphobia. I exhausted my FMLA entitlement at my job and resigned. My psychiatrist determined that I was disabled and encouraged me to apply for Social Security. At age 31, I was unemployed and receiving state assistance. Dejected and hopeless, I moved out of state to be close to family who could help take care of me.\nAfter I moved, I lost my health benefits and could no longer afford medications. I had to abruptly stop taking both Lexapro (an SSRI) and Ativan (a benzodiazepine). Withdrawing from benzos was one of the scariest things I have gone through. I literally thought I was going to die. Because I also stopped my SSRI, I was in psychological hell. \nIt was then that I learned about kratom. Since it was a supplement, I was able to buy it without having to pay for a $200 doctors visit. When I started drinking it in a smoothie, I noticed immediate benefits. It promoted the quality, restful sleep that had eluded me for three years.  Because I was able to sleep better, I became more clear-headed. It also helped quell the severe anxiety that plagued me after I stopped taking Lexapro and Ativan. Because my anxiety was under control, I was able to start taking care of myself and address the issues that were the root cause of my pain. I became reflective and developed coping mechanisms that helped me reduce the frequency and severity of my flashbacks. The cycle of sleeplessness, depression, and anxiety had been broken and, after a few months of using kratom, I no longer felt disabled.\nAs my mental health improved, I wanted to do something productive with my time so I got a simple data-entry job. Because I was earning money, I could afford to go to the doctor and resume taking my SSRI. At that point, I was able to pick up the pieces of my life and begin building the foundation for a bright future. I applied for a more technical position within my organization and received the promotion. A few months later, an even better job  actually, my dream job  was posted. I applied and also received that promotion. My coworkers, supervisors, and managers tell me that I am an asset to our team and to the agency as a whole. For the first time in years, I am stable, happy, and productive.\nIn combination with my SSRI and talk-therapy, kratom helps me manage the symptoms of my mental illness. The thought of being denied access to a substance which I know helps me is soul-crushing. As you make your final decision, please keep in mind that a ban on kratom will have a severe impact on my quality of life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8509","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"A Smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Megan DeVries and I'm a 26 year old speech-language pathologist.

I would also like the ability for it to be age restricted, tested and regulated so everyone can know that what we are getting does not contain any additional adulterants as is in fact quality kratom. A major point I want to touch on is the media and people who have never consumed kratom before saying things like it is \"like an opioid\" or \"it is an opioid\" \"like morphone\" and so on. KRATOM IS NOT AN OPIOID NOR DOES IT ACT LIKE ONE. I have chronic back and hip pain and was addicted to opioids for about 5 years and I have been free from opioids since 2011. Kratom is nothing like an opioid. Using kratom I have been able to almost completely ween myself off of suboxone. I consider it a much better, natural, and much safer alternative to suboxone. Kratom does react on one of the same receptors, but will absolutely not get the consumer high. One of the main differences between the opioids and kratom is that kratom does not repress the users breathing like opioids does whci is what causes the user to OD and die.  If someone is looking to get high from kratom they are going to be sorely disappointed. I am not sure why the DEA is relying on comments from big pharma, other people who have never consumed the plant or people who have a financial interest to see kratom banned.\n\nI have been able to ween myself almost completely off of suboxone with kratom. Kratom has helped me especially with my chronic pain and does not effect me terribly like the opioids did. I remain focused and energized. I have a quality of life. I have a great job. I have a beautiful girlfriend. I recently sold my business and will be starting another business focused around helping others in 2017. I have a great relationship with my friends and family. I am a contributing member of society. I am working on starting a family. Why would you want to make me and the hundreds of thousands of other peaceful people criminals? In Massachusetts we have a terrible opioid problem and I know that if kratom was more known we would see a decrease in opioid related deaths. Plants heal. Pills kill.  \n\nThere is no way that this mainly benign plant should be considered scheduled. If the basis for scheduling is potential for addiction and abuse then tobacco and alcohol would be scheduled. Drugfree.com reports that \"Almost six million people die from tobacco use and 2.5 million from harmful use of alcohol each year worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports.\" That is 8.5 MILLION PEOPLE THAT DIES EACH YEAR FROM TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL, yet we are not trying to ban alcohol and tobacco. The only figures I have heard of kratom being harmful is 14 related deaths, not 14 kratom overdoses or 14 deaths where kratom was the cause, but 14 deaths where kratom and other drugs or alcohol was present in the system. We are all supposed to be free beings able to make our own decisions. If we as free people want to reject the toxic pharmaceuticals in favor of a more natural lifestyle I know it is not the job of US governments job to say that we can not use natural alternatives. Especially a medicinal plant that has been around for thousands of years.  \n\nWe have already seen this huge mistake play out a few times in US history through alcohol prohibition and the current failed drug war, cannabis (aka marijuana) prohibition. The war on the citizens (drugs) has failed. Prohibition puts otherwise peaceful, law abiding citizens and law enforcement into harms way, potentially deadly situations, as well as creates a thriving criminal black market. We has been a failed system for too many years. It is a shame that this has come to this. Where a group of individual yield power over the plants and what private citizens do with their own bodies. The logic behind this is non-existent. Please side with the people and do not ban yet another plant that helps people.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.drugfree.org/news-service/who-report-smoking-and-drinking-cause-millions-of-deaths-worldwide/","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20314","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mike O","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern,\n\nMy name is Michael Rosenthal (age 34), and I am licensed US immigration attorney.  I have never used or even heard about Kratom until yesterday when I listened to a podcast (Joe Rogan / Chris Bell) and felt compelled to send this message.\n\nAfter performing a brief google search which supported what I heard on the Podcast, it seems clear to me that there are many people who greatly benefit (in a medical sense) from Kratom.  That is, it seems that Kratom truly allows people who live with chronic pain (among other issues) to experience less of it.  And while I realize there are claims of a handful of deaths caused by Kratom, I am not aware of any medical confirmation that Kratom indeed caused these deaths.  In fact, from the information I received regarding these particular deaths, it sounded like other factors were very likely at play.  It also seems like Kratom's side effects are quite mild compared to other opiates, which for some reason seem to be quite popular amongst Americans.  \n\nSo overall, as with all other policy decisions, it comes to weighing the pros and the cons.  On one hand, you have thousands of people who claim significant medical benefits from kratom, along with the millions of Americans who could be using Kratom instead of potent, devastating opiates to which they are undeniably addicted.  On the other hand, you have 15 deaths which raise concerns about the dangers of kratom but confirm nothing regarding the true effects of it.  I know there are other factors to consider, but just based on these alone it should be clear not to put this plant on the Substance 1 list.  Why take such an extreme move as to declare it as dangerous as heroine when there is no scientific evidence to support or confirm such a claim, especially when it appears to have incredible medical uses?  Everything I heard and read indicates that this is a mild substance that has way more benefits than detriments for Americans and humans around the world.  So why ban it?  Why not at the very least give it a few more years for proper research before stripping it from the hands of good people who may truly need it?  \n\nThis is the general policy we should take with all substances - weigh the pros and cons and do what is the best for the general public.  In the case of Kratom, that seems clear at the moment - it should be kept off the schedule 1 list.  \n\nThank you very much for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely, \n\nMichael Rosenthal","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14648","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Rosenthal","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"with an opiate epidemic sweeping the nation kratom needs to be studied more before banning it. it has helped many many people including myself overcome the shackles of taking buprenorphine everyday. it made detox bearable and doable. banning this stuff is not and step in the right direction if you want to help solve this opiate epidemic.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5831","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"james pellecchia","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me to take care of my family.

When a more natural option to anything presents itself, I tend to try it. I continued the use of kratom on a more frequent basis, after injuring my back at the end of 2014. I had an annular tear of my L5-S1 disc, a painful injury that left me unable to work for 6 months. I began treatment at a clinic where pain medication was provided and treatments given to deal with the pain of the injury, such as cortisine injections. Pain medication quickly became a problem, as I felt I could not function without it. I had unwanted side effects and my marriage was starting to suffer as a result. I had read about kratom as a means to assist people in coming off of pain meds, and that it aided with easing the withdrawal symptons that almost a year on oxycontin can cause. I had tried unsuccessfully to quit the pain medications twice before, experiencing the extreme discomfort of withdrawal. I was afraid. I slowly began to incorporate kratom into my mornings before coffee and in the evenings after dinner. I stopped taking the oxycontin and was relieved to find the withdrawal symptoms reduced to almost nothing. I have continued this since as an alternative to pain meds, just like one might replace antidepresaants with St John's Wort. My back pain level is generally tolerable and anxiety is low. The only side effect i have encountered with taking kratom is sometimes it can make me a bit nauseated if I overdo it, which helps thwart overuse. It does not interfere with my ability to function normally. To take that away would have a serious impact on my daily life. I also think of the opiod and heroin epidemic, and what a useful tool this could be to aid people in coming clean. More research is certainly warranted, to explore the full range of benefits this leaf can offer.

I used heroin for 10 years, been in detox 6 time in 3 states and always relapsed after being clean for a couple of months. I was able to use kratom safely to detox my self and have been clean ever since. Before kratom I moved from couch to couch bumming from friends and family unable to hold a job. Now I have a stable job and have lived in the same place for 5+ years. Unfortunately opiate addiction is a disease and most addicts in order to say clean need a constant stream of medicine such as Suboxone or Methadone. As you probably know both can be very expensive and cause bad side affects. Kratom on the other hand is 112.00 a kilo and from my experience has no side affects over than a slight headache if you take to much. Plus its natural and is provided by God.

One of the worst things that happened to me was I walked into a trailer with kids smoking weed.  One of them decides to throw a dart.  It stuck in my arm, stinging bad.  I was 10 or 11.  My dad was also an alcoholic.  So in school, when I would see a respected officer of law enforcement speak to the class about the dangers of drugs, he had my FULL ATTENTION.  It was true.  As I got older I watched my peers begin experimenting with drugs despite the warnings.  They were all trying to impress one another.  Not me.  I stayed drug free, completely.   100%.  I never wanted to live like the way I was raised, or become a follower like my peers.  I was a stronger person than that.  So when I first heard about kratom, I was skeptical.  But as a smart, rational, intelligent adult would do, I did my research on the product.  I discovered that it was a tea leave, related to the coffee family.  If kratom was going to help me fight my fatigue, and lack of focus, then I was going to give it a try.  I gave kratom a try 3 years ago, and suddenly when you try it, you realize what a wonderful product it is!  I was finally able to focus on my work, as fatigue was no longer an issue.  Also gone was my depression and anxiety.  It has changed my life. It gives me energy throughout the day, and I can happily focus on my work.  One of the main reasons I considered kratom was I never wanted to use drugs.  Thankfully I still remain drug free and don't have to rely on medicines or harmful substances.  Kratom is an all natural tea leaf that I recommend to everyone!  And it would be a shame for the DEA to make it illegal.  I'm 100% in support of keeping kratom legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16573","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Billy Alley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I must urge you to take a better look at this harmless plant.

But as the saying goes \" all good things must come to an end\" and for me that was very true.  No money.  Holding on to a job by the skin of my teeth.  Holding on to my relationship by a thread.  I knew iI had to change.  I won't lie there was hard work to be done giving up taking painkillers all day I knew I had to pay the piper but I researched online how ease the pain of getting off painkillers and the word \"Kratom\" was getting mentioned.  Let me tell you that I could get any drug I wanted to abuse with a phone call or two and I have tried anything that I have heard was good, but I have never heard of Kratom.  I was curious so I read and then I went out and paid way too much for way too little of way too weak kratom and when I took it I felt better, not high or stoned just felt better.  I won't lie there was something there but I did not know what to call it.  But days turned into weeks and months of not touching a opiod painkiller and life turned around for me.  I decided that when the recession hit and work was slow I said to myself that now is the time to go back and finish college, which I did.  I decided to start a new career.  I finally married the woman who saw me at my worst and now sees me at my best.  All since I stopped taking pills and started taking 3 spoonfuls of some foul tasting ground up leaves.  I haven't had any narcotics for around eight years now.  I improved my credit.  I have a job and career that I am told I am very good at.\nKratom is not a cure.  Kratom is not a drug. Kratom is a tool. Kratom is habitforming but I would not say addictive.  Since I started I have lost 3 very good friends to drugs I wish they knew that this might have worked for them.  there are people that I have told about this and it did not work for them.  I have one friend who was way more addicted to oxies than my self and looking at serious jail time and after around a year he was clean from that and also quit kratom without any problems.\n\nThere is no way that this should be outlawed now especially at this time when there is so much dope and pills being abused.  And that you can go online and order chinese fentanyl and have it sent to you.  This could save lives, it did for me and it did for one of my friends.  I think that there needs to be reconsideration for this ban on all levels and let people make a decision for them selves.\nThank You So Vey Much for Doing the Right Thing,\nSean O'Connell","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10063","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sean O'Connell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have ADD and general anxiety.

I am also a senior Officer Candidate in the Untied States Mairne Corps and will commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in July 2017.\nThroughout my time training for both the military and athletics I have sought out healthy supplements to help with  performance, stress, pain,and recovery.\nI have been taking Kratom for six months and feel compelled to share my positive experience and voice my opinion on this topic.\nWhile taking kratom I have seen tremendous health improvements including lowering stress, pain relief, higher focus, more energy, and greater sleep and recovery. I was blown away how effective and safe kratom really is. It has worked extremely well for someone like me who lives a very active, productive and semi stressful life. But I discovered after using kratom for several months that I was not alone in experiencing its benefits.\nMy involvement with the Marine Corps officer program has allowed me to make contact with several veterans from both the Marine Corps and other branches of the military. Not to my surprise several of these individuals have issues with anxiety, depression and chronic pain from injuries. What did surprise me was after bringing up kratom in conversation I learned that several of these prior servicemen and women were using kratom to alleviate pain, and anxiety. Many also expressed that they specifically sought out kratom to avoid taking opiates, and the many harmful consequences linked to frequent taking of pain killers.  \nHaving used kratom now and knowing what it has done for myself, friends, family and veterans around me I cannot possibly support the idea of kratom becoming a schedule 1 drug. This safe, effective supplement has so much to offer, and it would be a crime to take away the peoples' freedom to use it. \nI absolutely believe that kratom should be further researched, but this motivation for more research comes from the positive benefit and experiences I have had and seen with kratom, and it is this same positive benefit that calls me to oppose the ruling for kratom to be a banned schedual 1 drug.. \n\nThank you for allowing me to comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15928","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sam Bryant","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.

I use Kratom as a medicinal supplement to manage a bi-polar diagnosis coupled with acute complex post traumatic stress and I've found Kratom to not only be the most effective at helping me to manage the complexity of my diagnosis but also the safest. I have been prescribed many different pharmaceuticals for my diagnosis and they only served to further complicate the symptoms of my condition. Having a bi-polar diagnosis for me means difficulty balancing and tending to the most basic of self-care. Remembering to eat regular meals and being able to maintain regular sleeping patterns has been a lifelong struggle that has been made exponentially more difficult due to a serious trauma sustained in 2010.  Since that time, I have survived two manic psychotic episodes and am currently recovering from a major depressive episode that nearly took my life. I've found that Kratom, specifically the white and green strains, to be by far the most effective at helping me to balance my moods and my energy so that I can then maintain a healthier level of functioning and self-care so that I do not fall back into a depressive state nor spiral into a manic psychotic episode, which neither I can afford to traverse again. With Kratom, I do not experience any of the negative side effects that often come from western pharmaceuticals, I have never felt the need to increase the size or frequency of my dosage to receive the same level of effectiveness nor have I ever felt any kind of 'hook' that comes with so many other substances or 'drugs'. It is honestly quite frightening to me when I think of all the likely hazardous consequences that will almost certainly come if Kratom is no longer legally accessible, not just for myself in my own life, but for the many many other people who use Kratom to manage legitimate and serious medical conditions. I think it is already apparent that the DEA and the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT have done little to truly handle ANY of the drug crisis in America and it also seems glaringly apparent that many of the actions of the DEA and FEDERAL GOVERNMENT have only served to further complicate the seriousness of the drug epidemic in the US. It seems nothing short of insane to me that the DEA would attempt to control another natural substance using the same methods and practices that have already so clearly failed. Time, money and resources need to be directed towards the research and understanding of how Kratom and other natural substances can be used to help benefit the whole of humanity instead of this old and broken model that has clearly already failed. \n\nSincerely,\n\nErica R.

In my experience, kratom is harmless enough that it requires no regulation.\n \nKratom has been used safely for millennia to address pain and other maladies. It is far safer than its over-the-counter and prescription counterparts, bearing no risk of fatal overdose and no significant side effects or interactions. Scientific research has already determined that it possesses significant medicinal value. This relative of the coffee tree also boasts some of the same constituents that make other plants, such as tea, beneficial for one's health. Furthermore, it can be a substitution for people who use true opiates that can actually be damaging to themselves and society at large.\n \nWith Schedule 1 status, however, scientists would face significant barriers in studying kratom, and, more importantly, the millions of Americans who use it safely and responsibly will be left with far less salubrious substances to treat chronic pain and other issues. And those who choose to continue using it would become instant felons, in danger of being stripped of their freedom, their families, and their livelihoods. I cannot imagine how possession of a plant that presents no real harm would justify putting someone in prison, destroying not just their own life and future prospects but the economic stability and well-being of their children and spouse as well.\n \nKratom has provided me with immense relief from chronic back pain, due to disc herniation, leaving me better able to enjoy time with my family and focus on work, without making me dopey or craving more. I have been using kratom sporadically for about a year (no more than twice a week or so); in no way am I addicted to it - physically or psychologically - and I can take it or leave it. I believe it is the prudent, wise, and decent thing to do to continue allowing hardworking and law-abiding Americans such as myself access to this inexpensive and safe remedy.\n \nLet's not go down the rabbit hole of banning natural substances because we may not truly understand them. I believe we are at a point in our society where we have learned the folly of wanton prohibition.

My son William Miller uses this herbal remedy.  My son has been in and out of drug rehab centers for the last 7 years.  He has battled with adderall abuse and also benzos and opiates.  He has finally been able to keep his addiction at bay the last year.  This has been attributed to his use of Kratom.  As he described it to me, he said that the Kratom is the only thing that he has found that actually stops the addiction cravings in his brain.  I was more than sceptical at first with this as I had never heard of it.  Not until I have personally observed the positive outcome from this chosen therapy.  He no longer is on multiple pharmacueticals for his anxiety and depression.  He has been able to excel at his job and move forward in life away from what was imminent death from abuse.  This is not an exaggeration, he is six foot tall and weighed only 100 lbs before his last admission into the psychiatric unit because he was suicidal.  I fear that his inability to use Kratom legally could send him back into addiction and possibly death.  I implore you to reconsider this decision.

I'm going to give a personal background, as well as my reason for using kratom, medicinally, as I feel it is imperative to understanding the average kratom user.\n\nI come from a stereotypical suburban family. My father is a pharmacist, and my brother, six years elder, is an oncologist. Medicine is a part of my family background. My family grew up in a nice neighborhood, my brother and I were both top performing students, and I participated in a number of organizations, typically involving sports or music. By all generalizations and stereotypes, I was a \"good kid,\" and an unlikely candidate for being the poster boy of addiction. Unfortunately, that is just what I became. \n\nIt started long before I ever even knew what a drug was. My entire life, I have suffered from a chronic, debilitating stomach condition that has caused me to miss, on average, 30-50 days of school a year. Despite that, I continued to be a top performing student. Throughout high school, it got worse, and it wasn't uncommon for me to spend an entire day stuck to the bathroom floor in agonizing pain. My condition baffled doctors, and though scores of medicine, prescriptions, as well as alternative methods, were tried, nothing ever reduced my symptoms. \n\nThis was never enough to alter my academic performance through high school. I finished top 5% of my class at a top-ranking school, and accepted a full scholarship to the University of Rhode Island to pursue a degree in engineering, back in 2007. This is when everything went awry. \n\nCollege, obviously, required much more effort out of me, and missing 30-50 days a year was not conducive to high academic performance. I couldn't skate by anymore on above average intelligence. As I struggled to maintain during my freshman year, my parents began enlisting the help of every doctor we could find. Gastroenterologists determined my condition was, most likely, entirely stress related, and began referring me to psychologists and psychiatrists. Within the year, I had been placed on an SSRI, though I had never mentioned being depressed, and then, finally, Klonopin. This kicked off my issues. \n\nThrough a long string of events, similar to anything you'd hear from someone my age at any rehab, AA, or NA meeting, prescription klonopin gave way to prescription opiates. They worked so well at relieving my stomach pain, and helping me move on through the day, that I began self-medicating. It wasn't long before oxycontin had become too expensive and hard to find, and I had already gotten addicted and began experiencing withdrawals. Circumstances led me to heroin, and I began a 4 year battle with IV heroin use. I have overdosed a number of times, been pronounced dead twice before Narcan brought me back, and in general, ruined my life, as well as my family's. By now, I had dropped out of school, couldn't keep a job, was getting arrested consistently, and was upset that I hadn't died yet. I had no hope.\n\nSparing the full \"experience, strength and hope,\" story of recovery, I attended a rehab in 2013 where I spent 6 months. I was a model resident, and \"graduated,\" from this top program. I re-entered the real world, free from addiction, but realized I still had a debilitating condition to deal with. I started work full time, and began looking into going back to school. But I needed a solution for my stomach. Through much research, I found kratom. I was extremely reluctant to try it, given its supposed similarities to opiates, and the addiction problems I had just spent years dealing with. I eventually decided to try it, as I was still non-functioning. I was getting sick too often. \n\nAfter trying it, I was absolutely stunned. If I felt symptomatic, I could take a couple grams (not enough to have any altering effect on me) and my stomach pains would disappear. Working full-time, something I never thought I could do, became possible. Thank the lord I wouldn't have to be on disability my whole life! I became so high-functioning for the first time in my life, that I went back to school. I'm currently at UNH, completing my master's degree, while working full time. I'm a model citizen. I haven't touched opiates or any other drugs for that matter, for 4 years now. I pay taxes, and I don't break the law. Should Kratom become illegal, I have a few awful options:\n\n1. Become a user of illegal drugs again (probably will start with trying to find just kratom, as its safe, non-lethal, doesn't get me high, and treats my medical condition. However, given my experience, will most likely be much harder to get, and more expensive, than heroin or other street opiates. I'll probably end up resorting to it, in the name of relief from my disability).\n2. Become a full-blown addict again, and a non-functioning, non law-abiding, citizen. \n3. Be placed on disability where I'll remain for the rest of my life.\n\nPlease, reconsider rescheduling kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18582","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nicholas Sammartino","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Greetings,  Thank you for the opportunity to share my opinion and feelings with you regarding Kratom.  I am a 64 year old woman. I am a mother and a grandmother, sister and Aunt.  I have a very small family and we are all very close.  Blessed to have three sisters who I love to spend time with.  I had three surgeries on my back in years past.  This left me with considerable pain in lumbar and other regions.  I now have developed arthritis, and other types of painful issues.  Getting older is no picnic on the body sometimes, even though I feel quite young.  I had taken opiates of all kinds over the years, and became completely reliant on them.  I became addicted to them and developed all manner of problems as a result.   I was desperately seeking a different way to manage chronic pain because my life was just falling apart.  I felt so poorly healthwise I just wanted to quit.  Something had to change for me or else.    Someone told me about this herb they had found called Kratom, and that it helped to manage pain from injuries they had sustained.  I was very interested.  I started using Kratom about 2-1/2 years ago.  I could not believe that a herbal leaf, or tea could really be of much help.  First, it is not a drug, its a natural herbal substance.  You cannot get addicted to it.  plain and simple.  You can not overdose on this substance.  If you do take too much, your tummy will let you know.  That's  It.   It gives you a little lift just like drinking coffee does.  Along with that it also has an analgesic property.  It does not remove all pain, but it takes the edge off of it so that you are not  without some relief, keeping you from reaching for the more powerful opiates like you used to.  I have experienced no side effects or suffered any ill effects from taking Kratom.   This has helped me so much.  My life would not be worth living if this wonderful herb became illegal.  The thought that it even could be is preposterous to me.  Its a God Send.   Please, spend your time and assets trying to get Heroin out of the hands of folks, and other drugs like it.   Drug companies will still be able to create other things to be used in the treatment of addiction.  There will definitely be a market for that.  Please allow those who prefer to use natural substances to deal with addiction, or pain relief. or ptsd, or any other problems do so.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5766","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jane Depew","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am not a user of kratom, but after hearing about the journey of so many other people that claim it has helped them so much, I firmly believe that this stuff should not be made illegal. I have known several people that got hooked on prescription drugs (given under a doctor's order) that almost ruined their lives. My own grandmother, who has since passed away, became hooked on prescription drugs, and I watched it break her down and ruin her life. I would have loved to see her have an alternative to the drugs that were given to her. I would hope that if I ever need pain management, then I would be able to explore this plant as an option. I assume that one could probably take too much of this plant at one time, but I have not heard of anyone doing so. I have, however, seen people take too many pain pills and have to get their stomach pumped in the emergency room. I remember one case when I was a young kid working in the ER overnight and going to college during the day, a family came in with a young girl who had gotten ahold of a bottle of prescription pills and decided to take too many. She was lucky that her family found her and was able to get her help before it was too late. I could mention more cases of prescription pills, but you already know as well as I do how dangerous they are. I hope that enough people come out and voice their opinion on this and hopefully this plant is not made illegal, but instead researched more as an alternative to pain management.

I believe Kratom should stay legal.  I have seen first hand the tremendous benefits of a small amount of drinking kratom as a tea in alleviating depression and pain, for my wife who has had an enormous amount of struggle with major depression and chronic pain.  Since she began drinking kratom as a tea earlier this year, she was able to discontinue use of narcotic pain relievers, and her mood has improved immeasurably. Recently she has been able to go back to work and maintains a positive and motivated attitude.  She has \"recovered herself\" from a cycle of pain and depression, and I believe this is owed to the kratom tea she drinks several times a week.  She is the person I met when we first married before the depression and pain became out of control, despite her vigorous efforts with mental health care professionals, antidepressants, therapy and being an active advocate for her health.\nI have not seen any signs of dependency, addiction or abuse.  I was anxious about the use of painkillers which were all prescribed legitimately and conservatively over the past three years. Ultimately they became dangerous to her mental health, contributing to dysphoria and more serious depression.  Since she has started taking kratom tea, she is not reliant on narcotic medications on a daily basis, and they are now \"a tool\" for when the pain is unbearable and not relieved by anti-inflammatories, cold packs, heat or physical therapy.  She does not need nor does she drink this tea daily or more frequently, she is informed and responsible with the unfortunate issues of chronic pain and depression.  Please keep kratom legal for all the individuals who are seeking a healthy way to manage pain and depression and end the cycle of being dependent on narcotic medications.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21045","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Greetings:\n\nI hope this finds you well.  I am a 31 year old Medicinal Chemist and have spent my career thus far investigating new therapeutics for unmet medical needs, including kidney diseases and cancer.  This experience includes studying the both the positive and negative effects of test articles.  In my personal life, I also battle chronic knee pain from a wakeboarding accident but do not wish to have a surgery or be prescribed strong pain killers chronically.  I have been taking kratom to alleviate this pain for around 3 years and it has made a world of difference in my ability to achieve my daily goals without debilitating pain or any side effects whatsoever.  If kratom were to become listed as a Schedule 1 substance, I would be forced to seek prescription pain medicine and my quality of life will decrease significantly, therefore I STRONGLY URGE YOU NOT TO LIST KRATOM AS A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE.  As an added bonus, the reduction in my anxiety due to kratom has aided my professional development by allowing me to have more productive meetings with company executives and my peers.  In my time as a kratom user, I have not observed any clinical signs of adverse effects or toxicity that I typically observe in my professional studies.  Kratom seems to be self-regulating in that there is a maximum observed effect and simply consuming more kratom does not cause further effect, which means there is no risk of acute toxicity (i.e. overdose).  After over 3 years of consuming kratom daily, I have not observed any clinical signs of chronic toxicity or other problems (e.g. addiction) either.  Please consider my personal story and professional opinion as a Medicinal Chemist in your decision, and please do not list kratom as a Schedule 1 substance.  Kratom is not a \"drug\" taken to get \"high\", it is a safe, herbal remedy for pain and anxiety with no observable adverse effects.

If kratom is banned, I will be unable to remain in the united states because it would ruin my quality of life. But this goes far beyond me, for I am just one of many.  Kratom is not a dangerous drug, just compare the data in the DEA's notice of intent to that same data for NSAIDs or other over the counter drugs. Kratom has caused far fewer emergency room visits, and only a handful of deaths over the course of several years. Contrast this to tens of thousands for drugs that the DEA claims to consider safe over the counter. Every single one of the deaths that the DEA has used to demonize kratom, has been an instance of a drug user mixing kratom with other drugs such as already lethal doses of cocaine. Cocaine alone has a reputation of extreme lethality. Clearly the cocaine is a more likley candidate to contribute to the death than kratom, which many thousands of people use therapuetically on a daily basis. Furthermore, kratom is irrefutably useful as a therapy although it is not a prescription drug. If kratom is placed into schedule 1, it will be nigh impossible for research to occur on its therapeutic utility. This has already been established with marijuana. If any scientific progress and further humanitarian benefit is to occur with the substances in kratom, it must be accessible to researchers and a ban or scheduling of the plant will destroy any chance of this happening. \n\n\nFor the love of god, do not schedule kratom.

More research into Kratom and it's safety needs to be done before such a rash decision is made. My daughter has been using Kratom for pain relief for over two years with absolutely no side effects or problems. She was forced to search for a natural pain reliever because doctors, due to the DEA's existing rules regarding narcotic pain relievers, were not prescribing her pain medications and she could no longer tolerate the level of pain she was in on a daily 24/7 basis. My daughter has a very rare neurologic paraneoplastic autoimmune disease that is destroying her organs. She is totally disabled and housebound. She is diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, autonomic and sensory neuropathy, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, adrenal insufficiency, immune mediated encephalitis, and increased intercranial pressure, but the disease is far-more reaching. She is currently prescribed mestinon, prednisone, immuran, Adderall, levothyroxine, lansoprazole, folic acid, vitamin D, Ventolin inhaler, Flonase, and restasis. She also takes aspirin, ibuprophen, pepto bismal and famotidine over the counter, and supplements with niacin, DMAE, TMG, phosphodytl choline and carnitine. And with all of these in her system has no problem with and derives immense benefit from Kratom. If someone with such a complicated medical history can safely take Kratom, I believe that it is safe if used responsibly and urge the DEA to STOP their efforts to list it as a schedule 1 drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2734","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Betty Nierengarten","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have 2  professional co workers who have benefited from consuming Kratom.

I met my husband in 2013, only 3 months after he developed a nagging pain in his neck. He had been to his doctor and had an MRI done that showed \"bulging discs\" and nerve impingement. He had been taking Norco which really didn't help.  He was treated with epidural injections,  trigger point injections, nerve blocks, radio frequency ablation, and nothing worked. He eventually had his pain med dosage increased and was eventually given oxycodone. In October of 2013 since nothing was working he had a cervical fusion. Two months after surgery we were in a head on collision with a drunk driver. His pain was never controlled following surgery. He was prescribed lyrica, gabapentin, valium, oxycodone, morphine, norco, tramadol, and several other controlled medications (all at different times, of course) but NOTHING helped. He was unable to work because of debilitating pain and the use of narcotics  (he was a helicopter mechanic). I remember going to work so scared that I was going to come home and he would have overdosed. He was depressed because his quality of life was gone, but I was mainly concerned that he was going to take too many pills to try to get rid of his pain and accidentally overdose. In October of 2015 he had a neurostimulator implanted. While that helped the pain radiating into his arm, the neck pain was still uncontrolled. He has done physical therapy more times than I can count. I watched him all but give up on life. About 8 months ago he started reading about kratom. He decided to give it a try and within a few days I saw him transform from a beat down, depressed man to someone who was smiling again. He finally found something that no one and nothing else could do-control his pain and give him some quality of life. Not only that, but he went to his doctor and had blood work done a couple months ago and his liver enzymes were normal. They have been high since before I knew him due to the use of acetaminophen containing drugs but thanks to kratom he no longer needs them. I am a physician assistant and am happy that he found something safe and legal that actually helps. Kratom changed OUR lives and I am really hopeful that it will not be banned. He has tried everything, and nothing helped him. We are a working middle class family. My husband isn't a drug addict or a junkie. He's just a regular guy that wants to live a happy and as close to a normal life as possible.  Please reconsider the ban on kratom. So many lives depend on it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20956","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I listened to the the Joe Rogan Podcast with Chris Bell as the guest and they provided a lot of great information about the benefits of Kratom.

I do not regularly use it, but occasionally use it for significant pain which OTC pain killers won't touch.  I've always had a natural tolerance to opiate pain killers.  They do not provide pain relief for me at normal doses, and I have never tried them at high doses because they are dangerous, and also potentially addictive.  Kratom has provided me with a safe, highly effective, non-addictive alternative.  I no longer even fill doctor prescriptions for addictive opiates because I have a better, safer alternative. It is insane to me that the DEA wishes to effectively ban (even for medical study) a drug where by the DEA's own admission, they can find only 35 world wide cases of Kratom involved death.  Those cases are highly disputed by several toxicologists, especially since Kratom appears to be effective at treating opiate withdrawals which means that many of the cases involved other far more dangerous drugs that were far more likely to be the cause of death.  \n\nIn short, Kratom, even when misused for a \"high\" is incredibly mild, short lasting, non-addictive, and relatively safe, by the DEA's own evidence.  Multiple reputable research groups have found it to be a useful and safe pain reliever.  Regulating it, is asinine and serves no purpose other to force people to more dangerous and addictive drugs, and making felons out of otherwise law-abiding citizens.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0183","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shelby Spencer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"dear dea\nif signed a petition that you didnt sharpin up the kratom schedul and now i`ve recived a mail from leap that you will push this trough. so please stop this stupid war on drugs cause humanity will always take drugs not just only for hedonistik reason and for who should i stay sober. for those who are workaholics? this addiction thing is more complicater than just substances are bad.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22406","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jrg Hornemann","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I urge you NOT to ban kratom unless you have at least 3 years of solid research, done by impartial researchers, with statistically large enough populations, that shows negative effects strong enough that it would be totally compelling.

I had just lost 90 pounds, and was working out 6 times a week and planning on competing in fitness competitions. then, I got sick, very sick. (insert long story here) and after I slowly recovered. I was left with devestating health issues and with 4 babies and a husband to take care of, and no ability to do so. I have been diagnosed multiple times, with multiple doctors with, Fibromyalgia, OsteoArthritis, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, IBS, Anxiety, Depression, and other assorted health problems. I was offered and prescribed pain medication, pills for depression, and anxiety. After trying these for a few months, and feeling like a drugged up zombie, still dealing wth pain, I threw it all away and determined to try and deal with my health issues, on my own, with no pharmaceutical help. I hung tight for 4 years and tried to live as healthy a life as I could, as my health slowly deteriorated more and more. I turned to alcohol and drank way too much, trying to drown out the pain and guilt I was feeling. Guilt that I couldnt raise my kids the way I had planned. Couldnt run and play with them, couldnt cook dinner, couldnt even smile or read to them most of the time. Finally, at the point of suicide, I saw a doctor and asked what options I had. But I made it clear that i did not want any opiates. I was so scared of adding addiction, onto my list of problems. Addiction runs in my family. He suggested Cymbalta, and assured me that it was wasnt habit forming and they have had great success with treating pain and depression with it. I had to try something, so I took it. The first two weeks, I didnt sleep at all, and after that, besides some other terrible side effects, the pain started to become, less and less sharp and horrible. and felt like white noise instead. For the next year, I kept taking the prescribed drug and lost all emotion and all will to do anything and lost any feeling at all. While my pain was gone, I was a walking zombie. I didnt care about my kids, didnt care about my husband, didnt care about my values or morals and my life spiraled even lower. After a devastating family emergency, realizing that I couldnt even feel sad or cry or anything, I weaned myself off of that poison ( a horrible and prolonged process) and started looking for health and life again. My dear husband who stuck by me through all of this, and was always researching and looking for ways to help me, found Kratom! The first day that I tried it, I knew that my life was going to get better. And almost instantly, I was able to get off the couch and out of bed and out the door, and start to Live again! Krater has literally given my children back their mommy and my husband back his wife. I still have bad days of course, But with Kratom, I have more (or any) energy, I am able to talk to people, go to my kids games and swim meets. Participate in school activities. Go grocery shopping. Teach my kids how to drive. Take a shower. Take a walk. Go to church. Have coffee with friends. Go out to dinner with my husband. All these things that everyone takes for granted, are things that I could not do, before I found Kratom. Kratom brought light to my life that had been dark for so long. Kratom gave me hope. This ban would take that all away again.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16988","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Bang","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\n*    If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\n*    Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n*    Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.

First of all, I would like to say thank you for opening this public comment window.  It is nice to know that someone is listening up there in the government!  :)\n\nI would like to voice my opposition to the proposed ban on Mtragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, especially in their naturally occurring form, the Kratom plant.  I believe that there is little evidence to ban the substances and much evidence that they may be very useful medicinal supplements for a variety of ailments.  \n\nI believe that, instead of a ban, the DEA should make a recommendation that the plant should be researched for its medical use potential in pain relief or for alleviating withdrawal from Opiates.  It seems to have been used for these purposes, safely, for many many years.  \n\nAlso, sometimes, I would say that a plant-based tea can be the milder form of medicine.  Let's say that someone has chronic pain, we all know that a drug like oxycodone can be highly addictive.  What if the person in pain finds better relief from a simple tea from Kratom, one that doesn't cause the same withdrawal symptoms as oxycodone?  How, then, can we reasonably say that Kratom tea should be more highly restricted than oxycodone, which is known to be habit forming?\n\nMaybe Kratom should have some restriction, such as an 18+ only, or under 18 by a doctors recommendation.  However, placing it as Schedule 1 will effectively halt all inquiry into a useful medicine.  \n\nThanks again for your consideration in this matter.  :)\n\n ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0814","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Maitland Turner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear dea director,\n I'm writing in regards to your proposed Kratom ban and wanted to share my experiences with the plant.

I have peripheral neuropathy from a form of spinal cord damage called Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES), caused by a spine surgeon's incompetence. I have been suffering with this condition for over four years and have permanent nerve damage and constant nerve pain in my right leg. By the end of a day of teaching, It feels like someone is hammering on my foot. Sometimes I have to close my door during my prep period and cry for a while because the pain is so bad. I feel terrible pins and needles 24/7 all the way down the back of my entire leg. I've tried gabapentin and Lyrica as well as low dose opioids. No matter what I take, I have constant pain. Since it's been over three years since Dr. Hart's arrogant incompetence left me with CES, my condition is now permanent and will never improve. Because of the constant pain, I struggle with anger, depression, and anxiety. It is very difficult to somehow find the strength to keep going despite all the terrible symptoms of CES. \n\nI decided to try Kratom a few months ago since I've repeatedly read that it helps with neuropathy. I make a tea out of it, adding an herbal tea bag and filtering out the leaf powder to make it a bit more palatable. Even so, it is a horribly bitter tasting drink and it is exceedingly unpleasant drinking it.\n\nI find that Kratom tea helps suppress my neuropathy for several hours after I drink it and I am grateful that I have found another way to treat my constant pain. Kratom is also a mild sedative that helps me handle the stress and anxiety of my disability. I drink it 1-3 times a day however, I can skip drinking it whenever I like. I haven't experienced any physical habituation at all, unlike with the gabapentin that I also take that leaves me with terrible withdrawal symptoms if I skip a dose.\n \nThe overall psychotropic effect of Kratom is very mild, and provides about the same amount of sedation as perhaps half a glass of wine. Ingesting Kratom is disgusting, so I find the likelihood of someone wanting to abuse this substance highly unlikely when much more palatable inebriating alcoholic drinks are easily bought.\n\nQuite frankly, making kratom a schedule 1 drug is absolutely ridiculous. This decision is based on a handful of deaths over several years where kratom was present in a multidrug cocktail that caused these deaths. No one has died just from ingesting kratom, unlike the six people who die daily from alcohol poisoning. \n\nKratom helps countless numbers of people battling a wide range of maladies. Taking this away from us and making us felons simply for possessing a powdered leaf is draconian and patronizing. We are adults and should have the right to take whatever herbal supplement we wish. I purchase my kratom from a reputable online vendor and am certain that the product that I'm buying is of high quality. I should be able to continue to treat my chronic pain with kratom without government interference.

I never expected to be writing the DEA, but the people were given the opportunity and this is a potentially life changing issue for myself. When the Intent to Schedule was issued, I truly feared for my future for the first time since I became sober. Like many others, I gave Kratom a try during my darkest times. After exhausting research to find something to combat moderate pain that was also not a narcotic and harmful, I stumbled upon it. I was almost 3 years post prison release, but still shackled by Methadone and on my way back any day. My life was a constant cycle; inpatient rehabs, sobriety for a short period, jail, detox, rinse and repeat. I was merely existing. It all started from the interest in the good feeling my prescription Hydrocodone gave me at 13 years old. At 16, I was a full blown addict, stealing everything I could to support my addiction. I did despicable things and ruined every relationship I had with friends and family. I wanted to get clean, but I couldn't. I suffer from moderate pain due to sports related injuries, I wasn't going to do an Acetaminophen regiment because of the terrible health side effects and anytime I tried narcotics, I would be back to the cycle of abuse. When I found Kratom, it was a godsend. I felt the biggest weight off my shoulders, I felt relief. I found something that is a natural occurring tree, that despite it evading my knowledge for years, it had been used for thousands of years and is known to have medical benefits by other governments. I couldn't believe this botanical was not more widely known in America. I was so depressed and in such a critical time of my addiction. I was on a daily dose of 140mg at a local clinic, which seems to be on the lower side of the spectrum compared to many. I was a walking zombie everyday, in the handcuffs of methadone maintenance. But hey, it was doctor prescribed and recommended so it had to be alright. I worked 60 hours a week to be able to keep up with rent and pay my 15$ a day for that stupid methadone dose. The money I've spent on these pills would make anyone cringe, it's truly upsetting. I was so tired of the daily struggle, I knew with the pain relief and general sense of well being Kratom gave me, I could kick this habit. The physical withdrawal is unlike any pain and the acute withdrawals that last months, depression & self loathing that go with it are just as hard.  It was the toughest thing to date in my life, the withdrawals were still by no means a breeze, but Kratom made them manageable. Today, I'm almost 9 months sober from the pills, from any narcotic and all drugs. It would be asinine to place Kratom with Heroin, MDMA, Methaqualone and others, when COCAINE, OXYMORPHONE, Xanax and these other terrible, addicting pharmaceuticals are Schedule II-IV. What kind of sense does that make? The opiates the DEA and FDA approve are literally killing us. Kratom is a botanical supplement that could be regulated much like coffee or dietary supplements, requiring tests for consumer safety. It is ridiculous to jump to Schedule 1 when such little research by the DEA has been done. I hope the Agency will make an informed decision, with the best interest of the public in mind, please.

I am much more productive in my career. \n\nBefore I found Kratom, I was heavily addicted to the pain meds I was taking for 20 years. I still take some when my pain is flared, but I have been able to take so much less of it, which is all I want for my own body. If the ban on Kratom gets approved, it will be devastating to me, my husband and my young son - not to mention the thousands across this nation who are good, hardworking people trying to live a happy and healthy life. \n\nWe are good peaceful people.

I have suffered from High Functioning Autism, PTSD, Depression, Severe Anxiety, Fatigue and Kratom has helped me immensely. I've generally had bad luck with traditional pharmacuticals and It would be a detriment to my life if Kratom were a Schedule I Controlled substance. If Kratom and it's psychoactive alkaloids were subject to restriction, I hope the alkaloids would be lowered to a lesser schedule or have an enforced age limitation on purchasing. I believe Kratom can be regulated witout the extremely limited access that a Schedule I ruling would enforce and that a reasonable, well thought-out agreement could be reached between Kratom users, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. \n\nI hope that the Drug Enforcement Administration would consider the impact this ruling would have on the lives of millions if were completely illegal. I understand that Kratom isn't a typical drug of abuse, nor does it cause respiratory depression, even in high doses. Kratom has limited abuse potential as high doses of Kratom typically cause nausea, vomiting and malaise and does not cause euphoria similar to other strong opioids such as Heroin, Morphine, Fentanyl, Oxycodone, Hydrocodone and Tramadol. Nor does it cause powerful stimulation akin to Amphetamine type drugs or Cocaine. I find it to be more Caffeine like in nature. And while it may not work for everyone, it has worked for me and hundreds of thousands of Americans.

I walked around in chronic pain daily and could not do any of the activities to stay healthy. Now my pain is 80% gone. When I do my physical activity I take only 1/4 teaspoon and that small amount has allowed me to move through the pain in order to make progress at healing.

I have friends and I myself, have had this wonderful plant be a life saver for us.  I had knee surgery in 01' of which was haphazardly done. The results left me with spinal stenosis and hip pain. The knee pain was gone, the others simply krept up due to being wrongly aligned.  Of course, I was prescribed pain medication. It did nothing for me other than upset my stomach and give me 150+ ulcers. I couldn't get out and live a normal life. I'd read online of this plant that helps with all things pain, as well as many other ailments such as depression, anxiety, and the list goes on and on. After 6 months of research, I located a reputable place online and submitted an order for they type I thought would best suit my personal needs. I was amazed at how well it worked and still am. The differing varieties help all sorts of needs without effecting an individual negatively.  Banning this substance will destroy lives, it's that simple. There are many out there who don't have the means nor desire to use pharmaceutical medications that cause much more harm than Kratom does, which is none in my opinion. There are people who've gotten off of pain medications as well as harder drugs by using this and to ban this PLANT would be an attack on American Society. Please, do not do this as so many people like myself will not know what to do with our recurring daily pains. The quality of human life will downgrade incredibly.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5624","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Lowther","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine (Kratom) has made functional life with a severe anxiety disorder possible.

And - actually cause irreparable harm to the general public by further fueling the legal, and the illegal opiate industry by forcing individuals using Kratom as an aid to avoid taking harmful and addictive opiate based \"medications\".\nI'm a self employed (real estate) 59 year old male and have suffered from an indescribable, debilitating pain in the bottoms of my feet for about 5 years that no doctor could diagnose, let alone treat. The predominate diagnosis was that the pain was nerve related and emanated from a back injury I sustained about the time I started feeling the pain in my feet, leaving me incapable from performing most of the duties necessary in my business.\nAfter being prescribed just every pain reliever available by my doctors, none working and all addictive, I thought I was destined to live the rest of my life with the pain, or on one of the opiate based drugs that I would certainly become dependent upon, and threatening my life as we all have learned given the effect of opiates and the associative addiction rate in the United States. \nThen about a month ago, I find Kratom! A safe, natural ingredient with a decade long history of use in the U. S. so I thought what have I got to lose. I ordered a sample from a highly rated vendor and after one teaspoon, and after approximately 20 minutes, I could literally feel the pain leave the bottoms of my feet, first the left and then a couple of seconds later, the right. At first, I couldn't believe it but after an hour or so, still NO PAIN! I had my life back! \nFinally a natural product, although at that point I was so desperate I would have tried just about anything, regulated or not, that completely addressed the indescribable pain I was experiencing. Not only did it cure my pain issue, but another unexpected benefit was that it also allowed me to give up the antidepressant the doctors put my on just to get over the depression caused by the outlook of my painful future with no hope, let alone the opiates I was getting through \"channels\", as the Kratom, along with its pain relieving properties, also serves as a nootropic! \nThe vendor then informs me that our government through the DEA is again going to attempt to fix something that is not only not broken, but is an assistant in the war they themselves are waging against opiate abuse by threatening the availability of this life altering (life saving in my case) natural product through unnecessary regulation of sorts which we all know will only serve to push it underground. \nAfter doing significant research on Kratom, and using it for about a month, it is my opinion that it would be a considerable disservice to the Kratom users and vendors to restrict the availability of this product in any way. Not only is it not a threat to the general public, it's a very significant aid in getting addicts off of addictive, opiate based pills, many of whom will do anything to get out of severe pain, including turning to heroin when they can't get what they're currently addicted to and usually being prescribed by doctors, which we all know is a death sentence.\nI'm in hopes that the regulation efforts aren't a result of the drug industry lobbying our government because they aren't profiting from the sale of the product but then I see the DEA  make the very difficult but correct decision to reverse themselves and get public opinion prior to any enforcement actions. I was truly impressed by the reconsideration decision but am reserving judgment until the final dispensation of the matter. \nPlease show the taxpayers that we are not wasting our money by funding the DEA make the correct decision regarding this life giving, non-addictive leaf and treat the matter with the \"laissez faire\" approach it calls for.\nIn summary, it's been established that Kratom:\n1.\tHas an only positive effect on the public at large\n2.\t Is safe\n3.\tIs non-addictive \n4.\tHelps all who use it \n5.\tHas a myriad of benefits \n6.\tIs actually healthy when compared to opiates\n7.\tIs helping to fight the war on drug abuse.\n\nSeems like an easy decision to me and I hope also to those who control the implementation of this regulation as obvious as it is and leave it alone.\n\nThank you in advance,\nMauri Myers\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10863","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mauri Myers","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nPlease don't ban nature; it really is quite a beautiful thing. I don't know if you've ever tried Kratom but if you have I hope you have had only positive experiences with it. I, myself, have had many positive experiences with the plant and, in fact, have had some not so pleasant experiences. Mostly, I want to focus on the benefits of Kratom treatment but I do not want to undermine those concerns that there may be about this plant. I use the plant to treat my panic attacks and sometimes when work is just too crippling to do, Ill treat myself to a healthy dose (~7 grams or so) of some good ol fashion nature and cruise through the day. I know this may seem strange or scary to some people but it makes a lot of sense. As a plant in the coffee family, it contains its own psychoactive ingredients that can influence your heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure while also altering the mood. The difference under question is how and at what cost?\nPersonally, I have done a lot of research about the effects of Kratom and from what I can gather, virtually none of accompanying risks of conventional opiate use, or alcohol use, or benzodiazepine use are present with Kratom. The one (maybe) potentially concerning side effect is the fact that it is a blood thinner. Therefore, those with low blood pressure probably shouldnt be using this plant as they may faint. Besides that, there other minor concerns that also come with many different medications such as itching, upset stomach, drowsiness, but nothing life threatening that I have found. I have heard of the potential for addiction but I will address those concerns in the following paragraph because that needs special attention.\nThe way in which American society treats addiction is so terrible because we have demonized certain drug users and praised others. We dont view addictions to substances such as coffee, or even alcohol to some extent, because they are a normalized part of our culture. In this manner, it has become so commonplace to require a cup of Joe or to in order to survive the day and a couple drinks at night to relax and unwind from a hard day. Were we to see a marijuana user or Kratom user taking their substance throughout the day, the average person may think lesser of the user because these substances have not been normalized yet by our society. Having experienced and seen the experiences of those who have abruptly terminated coffee, marijuana, and kratom usage (not all at the same time, that would be unbearable), by far the worst effects were experienced from coffee withdrawal. Mind you, the psychological effects are quite similar and include the inability to focus, lethargy, irritability, depression, and many more. However, coffee withdrawal also comes with physical side effects such as headaches, muscle pain, nausea, and other flu-like symptoms.\nI for one do not care so much to think about the negative side effects, as these are typical of overuse of any substance. Instead, I choose to focus on the benefits and why some people may use a plant such as Kratom. Many people, including myself, like the idea of natural medicines because nature has fine-tuned the production of such wonderful compounds that can be used to treat various ailments. Kratom contains compounds that can be used to cure insomnia, depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, overactive appetite, relieve pain, improve the immune system, block withdrawal symptoms of addiction to opiates, as well as prevent diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. The schedule 1 classification of this plant would essentially discredit any of these properties and instead demonize the plant and its users. Furthermore, it will cause major issues associated with its distribution.\nRight now, farmers simply sell Kratom as their crop and vendors distribute it across the country and the world. Making this illegal would cause tension between buyers and distributers that could potentially become violent, as has happened with other illegal substances. I see no reason why this plant cannot be simply regulated in a manner that does not allow for this potential. Making it illegal is only going to cause an underground market, which is going to take many lives. Furthermore, this plant will probably also be laced with who knows what type of opiates, rather than being exactly what we want it to be, which is pure unadulterated Kratom. If you really do not see the potential destruction that will be associated with the Kratom ban, please take a second look at the history of prohibition, specifically marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. Since their prohibition, usage has risen significantly, as well as the risk potential due to the fact that they are unregulated. If you dont want to see the type of violence and destruction that you see from the drug trade associated with Kratom, please keep it legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12322","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Noah Alsamadisi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used this tree\"s leaves now and again for chronic pain since I no longer use prescribed opioids.

I have dealt with the pain and immobility of fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis for about 12 years. I was diagnosed fairly young and now at age 45, had it not been for natural alternatives such as Kratom, would be forced to live my life in the constant haze of pain medications. I am a citizen who feels that it is important to have the right to determine what is best for my personal healthcare needs and want to live with the absence of narcotics to the best of my ability. While I am not completely free of pain management, I feel that I have been allowed to greatly reduce my need for it by using Kratom for most of my relief. I do not get a \"high\" from Kratom. I actually cannot stand the feeling that my narcotic medication causes and will therefore, while prescribed to take it every 6 hours, only take it at bedtime. Were it not for Kratom, I would be forced to either take the pain medication during the day or deal with the pain without means of relief. I prefer to take the Kratom during the day due to the benefit I get without the high feeling that I do not like. I cannot tell you how many people I have met personally that Kratom has helped with either pain relief, depression or anxiety without the need for heavy pharmaceuticals. I also have met so many people that have turned their lives around from drug addiction, not from Methadone clinics, but with the safe and natural alternative Kratom. The big pharmaceutical companies make plenty of money selling the medications they create without having to eliminate a natural remedy that has been doing so much good, for so many people, for so very long. Thanks for taking the time to read my story and I hope you will see the benefit of this herbal remedy and help prevent this from being a lost hope for my wellbeing along with many, many other people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3688","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tina Long","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have lower back problems which I have had most of my adult life.

Many other friends of mine have noticed the same thing. I have a friend with chronic back pain from a surgery a year ago and the doctors gave him tramadol. He said it had never worked for him so I showed him Kratom. He now uses it when his back acts up and we work out together and you could never tell that his back was even operated on with the way he performs on it. It is not an herb that can really be used to get high like other opiods, and I know no one that has reported a high from it. Only a nice clean stimulation and pain relief. I, and many others, ask that we can continue to use this herb to get us through our days pain free, as it truly is the best OTC option for pain killing. The safety is also continuing to be well documented. I have personally never experienced any ill side effects, and actually had bloodwork showing that my levels were great.

I have been using Kratom for almost two years and there is no valid reason for scheduling it as a schedule one banned substance.  \n\nI started using it as alternative to opiate pain killers, which I had been on for almost 4 years.  In 2010 I was involved in a very serious car accident where a woman who was texting ran a stop sign and T-boned my vehicle.  I suffered several serious injuries including a traumatic brain injury and the severe impact permanently damaged my spine.  I have been recovering ever sense that day and I am lucky to be alive.  After several back surgeries and months of physical therapy I was on as many as 9 medications prescribed by my neurologist for the TBI and pain killers prescribed by my spine surgeon.  I wanted to get off them and started researching homeopathic alternatives and found Kratom.  I cannot overstate this, Kratom has changed my life immeasurably!  It has allowed me to come off the opiates and several of the neurological drugs as well.  In addition to Kratom I now only take 4 medications daily and I have been completly off opiates for over a year.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

I have suffered through out my life tremendously, to the I point of not wanting to live anymore, quality of life means a lot. I have tried  different narcotics per the doctor for pain but all had bad side effects and  serious drug addiction issues had I stayed on narcotics. I just came across Kratom literally a year  ago and I am still grateful and shocked I found something natural that actually helps with pain and does not make me feel high like the narcotics did. Kratom also has helped me with my depression and anxiety I have suffered with all my life due to a chemical imbalance. I used to take klonopin and two different antidepressants but since I found Kratom, I don't need any of that mess. It helps with all three issues and a bonus plan is energy I get  in taking this natural herb. I am very grateful to have found this wonder leaf. Please understand I am among thousands probably more that have similar stories but not just a story its a true story. If Kratom is made illegal, it will ruin possibly destroy many lives and the lives of their loved ones. Quality of life again stands firm. I can honestly say I do not get high off this herb, I heard someone say that was one of the reasons it was being banned, if someone is looking to get high off Kratom, they will be disappointed. I pray you never experience chronic pain or severe depression and anxiety , or maybe you suffer also, I do not know but I can promise you it is a huge mistake to ban Kratom.

For years I have suffered with chronic pain and chronic depression. it was rare for me that prescription medicine worked, and the ones that did cause side effects which pulled me off of them completely. Once I discovered kratom my life has turned around. And the vilification this is receiving is astounding to me. What this may share with other drugs does not EQUAL the other drug the DEA is worried about. Studies upon studies have proven this (and I meticulously research what I put in and on my body--it was difficult enough for me to take the prescriptions not knowing exactly what was in them). So, this is not the same as other opioids (if it were though, wouldn't this be a wonderful replacement for opioid addicts--which it has been used for, apparently, but if it had the same effect it would be more commonly used) and possibly even a replaceable for marijuana, which is used for similar reasons. However where it differs is that while those opioids and marijuana are often used recreationally, kratom generally is not. I've never gotten a buzz (perhaps because I take it for its intended use, as do the majority of people who take this. Keep in mind taking kratom is NOT a pleasurable experience. i could not imagine taking this foul tasting herb for fun). This is a necessity in my life. An expensive one, at that. Recreational drugs are cheap.  This is not a matter of recreational use. This is a matter of necessity.

Kratom is an essential component of my well-being and the well-being of many others.\n\nI used to be prescribed opioid painkillers for chronic back pain stemming from an injury I sustained in college, as well as anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication. The painkillers only partially remedied my pain and left me with a dull mind and a dependency, and the psychiatric meds provided short-lived relief from my symptoms before losing effectiveness and actually causing my symptoms to worsen. As a result, I was unable to finish college and scarcely able to work, and I soon entered a long period of terrible depression and unemployment. I tried out different medications to no avail, and my hopes grew dimmer and dimmer. Finally, I discovered kratom and it saved my life. I no longer needed any of the medications I had been prescribed--it controlled my pain without the brain fog or dependency caused by opioids, and controlled my depression and anxiety more effectively than any combination of drugs my doctor had me on. Within about a month I was able to get back on my feet and start working again. I have since been employed and been leading a happy life. I currently work loss prevention/security at a very busy retail store, which of course requires a high level of attentiveness, sharp critical-thinking skills, self-control, and an ability to maintain a professional demeanor at all times when interacting with the general public. I guarantee I would not be able to perform my job duties effectively and responsibly if kratom gave me any sort of a \"high.\" Kratom does not make me intoxicated in any way. It just helps me be productive, responsible, engaged in my profession, and optimistic about life in general.  \n\nPlease keep kratom legal and freely accessible to adults as an herbal supplement. It has the power to vastly improve the lives of millions who suffer from chronic pain, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and addiction. \n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18957","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephen Lindsay","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I would like to make a brief statement about the herb Kratom  and how it has helped me.  I am a 35-year-old husband and father, successful small business owner, premedical student, and youth outreach Pastor. I recently discovered this herb at the beginning of this year and it has helped me tremendously.  Are used to struggle with drug  and alcohol addiction in my later teens/early 20s, but have been sober for over 10 years now. Later I discovered that I have some underlying issues that caused me to abuse substances. I sought the help of traditional medicine, to no avail.  This left me frustrated and helpless. I still struggled with things like anxiety and depression, and modern medicine did not help me. I discovered Kratom earlier this year and it has done wonders for my depression and anxiety, not to mention it is natural and much more healthy on my body. As a premedical student,  I believe in medicine. I believe Kratom can be a wonderful benefit to the medical world. This ban of Kratom will only eliminate any chances this herb has to benefit so many people who were in my same predicament.  Please do not ban Kratom and allow the many scientists researching this herb to continue their work. So many people in our country are struggling with various forms of mental and physical illness and have found relief with Kratom. The benefits far outweigh the negatives. If you do continue with the ban, I would most certainly honor the law and discontinue use of this herb, but I believe this would be a grave mistake and harm many people far worse off than me.

Then about 2 years ago i discovered kratom, and suddenly my prayers were answered.  I had access to a safe, natural, and relatively cheap substance that helped me greatly with my ADD/ADHD.  Unfortunately kratom started to gain renown in the media and across america as an alternative to pharmaceuticals, and of course that caused their profit margins to drop.  Like clockwork the big pharma lobbyists and DEA sympathizers started their smear campaign against it just like they did with marijuana and so many other natural substances that they could not patent or control.  A quote by John Ehrlichman depicts very clearly how our government has and continues to view anything that impedes their revenue streams and systems of control \"We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both HEAVILY, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\".

My pain started with a herniated back injury about 10 years ago.  While the herniated disc is no longer an issue as shown by multiple MRIs, unfortunately the pain has become chronic over the years.  I have been treated by multiple doctors, specialists, spine surgeons, neurologists, chiropractors, acupuncturist, physical therapists and pain management doctors.  I have lost count of the prescription medicines which has included all class of drugs including opiates.  \n\nAfter almost 5 years of chronic pain and living with the horrible side-effects of opiates, my quality of life was almost zero.  I was in constant pain, afraid to get up, afraid to work, afraid to sleep.  I was in mid-40s, but felt like 70 years old.  I hardly interacted with my family and friends.  I tried everything but pain is a vicious cycle, when I was in pain, I ate all kind of junk in frustration.  Obviously, I was barely able to get through the day, hence I had no physical activity.  My overall health deteriorated dramatically.\n\nAs my pain management doctors kept increasing my dose of opiates, I became desperate. It was a matter of time before my life completely collapsed leading to loss of work and not able to support my family.  My family who were dependent on my salary and medical insurance were on the edge as they did not know what to do.\n\nI heard about the benefits of Kratom plant through a friend who had recovered from opiate dependence.  I had nothing to lose and started taking Kratom plant as powdered leaves as a tea.  There are no side effects.  Kratom helped me alleviate the symptoms of chronic pain and reduce the dosage of opiate drugs.  Gradually my quality of life improved and I felt more energetic and became a fully functional member of the society.  I have a successful career and not only able to live a fuller life with my family but also contribute much more the society.  As I got more pain relief and reduce the dosage of opiates, the horrible side effects reduced dramatically allowing me to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\nScheduling Kratom will have a devastating effect on the Kratom community (3M-5M Americans) and the kratom consumers will have no choice but to either resort to costly opiates with horrible side effects or look for other alternatives.  These consumers have a safe, natural choice of kratom plant, hence they should be given the opportunity to continue with a natural and a safe alternative.\nKratom does not replace a treatment or cure for multiple diseases states, however kratom does provide relief from the symptoms of the diseases states (like pain) and allows us to be fully functional members of society.  Lastly, I appreciate the opportunity to provide candid feedback on Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2419","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 53-year-old medical transcriptionist with lifelong history of clinical depression and anxiety.

I have been enjoying Kratom for about half a year and it has been a good supplement for me. I use Kratom to enhance my life. It provides me with peaceful energy, and helps me to get things done on our property here in Washington. I am active in many projects at all times and Kratom gives me a little boost that I need to get needful tasks completed. Conversely, it also helps me sleep at night. It is similar to coffee, except it doesn't produce jitters or an uncomfortable, uneasy feeling, like too much coffee can.\n\nMany years ago I injured my right hip joint and since then it has caused me significant pain. Kratom seems to alleviate the pain, which is a God send, since I stay very busy and am physically active. \n\nIn my use of Kratom, I have never experienced any undesirable side effects, outside of becoming nauseated when trying it early-on, due to an excessive dose. Since that time, I have found that Kratom is not a \"party drug\" or subject to abuse, since it's effects are subtle, and increasing dosages merely leads to nausea and nothing more serious. There is no high to be obtained from Kratom. If that were the case, responsible, hard working adults wouldn't be using it.\n\nIn closing, I would like to emphasize that restricting access to Kratom would be a mistake. It poses no health threat and is not a dangerous drug. Law enforcement has more important issues to address, and pursuing Kratom and its users would be a waste of resources, and time would be better spent pursuing drugs that kill, like heroin and prescription pain medications. Responsible adults understand the consequences of their actions and know that Kratom is not a substance that causes problems. It is a good supplement that needs to stay legal and readily available to adults.\n\nSincerely,\n\nB.

I will be 64 this coming January. I became addicted to opiates as a result of an injury on the job. I was addicted for 20 years. I failed many drug tests with the company I worked for, but because I never missed one day of work for being sick or was late to work, the company let me slide. I did take one or two days vacation a year, though there was a stretch of 11 years where I took no days off. I also never turned down overtime. But after my last test with the company, they told me I probably should be dead and insisted I get help. I reluctantly went to rehab, got on Suboxone. I'm glad I did. There were some unpleasant side effects, like lucid nightmares, sleep apnia, impotence, but after a few months those subsided somewhat.   I felt normal again with suboxone. So much so, that after a couple years I asked my rehab doctor locally and my rehab doctor when I worked out of town to help me get off suboxone. Both recommended that I don't do it. Both said my natural endorphins may never come back to normal. Still, I wanted to try. They were right. After being clean for almost 3 years, working in very unpleasant jobs 60 - 90 hours a week, hoping the physical exertion would bring back my endorphins, I couldn't take it anymore. The constant daily cravings, the dreaming about opiates 3 to 5 times a week, I gave in, got back on the opiates after I retired to take care of my disabled wife. I could not afford to get back on suboxone, which is very expensive. I could see I was destined to become severly addicted again if I didn't so something. I then heard about kratom, had nothing to lose, gave it a try. My cravings diminished, I had motivation to do things again.instead of the severe blahs I had whenever I was off opiates. I haven't tried opiates once since drinking kratom tea. In fact, I've cut back on the amount of kratom by 2/3.which doesn't happen with regular drugs. I expect to cut back to every other day, and hope to get down to once a week to control cravings like some people do. Please don't outlaw kratom! Maybe regulate its purity or production. But friends who now use kratom and I depend on it to stay off opiates. Please don't take that away. Thank you.

Kratom is a safe multiuse herbal remedy. Much like one would use tea, kratom could be used as a energy booster,  and also like tea, provides a sense of warmth, and well-being.  This sense of well-being could be used for people who suffer with anxiety, and depression. Kratom also provides a pain relieving effect,  and could be used in place of other over-the-counter pain reliever's such as Advil and Tylenol without the risk of overdose and bleeding.  One of Kratom greatest potentials is to end the dangers of life ending opiates. Kratom could be used as a first line for pain relief after surgery over opiates. Kratom is used to affectively reduce withdrawals and end addiction of opioids without the use of other dangerous drugs like Suboxone. Kratom has a ceiling effect and cannot be double dosed. Having the ability to double dose is the single most reason responsible for opiate abuse and addiction. I hope the DEA is educated on the mater, and realize how important Kratom is for the efforts against opioid abuse. The safety of Kratom is well known by studying the use by the indigenous people who have used this leaf for thousands of years. If banned, this leaf that can be used for pain, headache, anxiety, depression, insomnia, chemical dependency and fatigue will not be able to be studied for legitimacy, and people will go back to heroin, prescription opiates, and people will die.

Please, don't take a completely natural, effective substance and put it in the same category as meth, heroin, cocaine and other genuinely dangerous substances. Myself and many others have lost our faith in what the Drug Enforcement Administration is capable of, especially when considering how long they've demonized marijuana and it's compete lack of any positive medical uses, which should go without saying is absurd. Please, don't give yourself another black eye by criminalizing what truly is far less harmless than the alternative to managing my fianc's lifelong battle with RA.

I have been using Kratom for approximately 6 months to try to lower my usage of prescription Oxycodone.  It has been very effective, and drastically lowered my usage of the the prescription opiate.  Soon, I will be completely converted to taking Kratom only for pain management.  The Kratom plant helps manage pain better than any over the counter pain reliever I have ever tried, helps taper off of opiates, and is much easier to stop taking when no longer necessary.\n\nI had weight loss surgery, and since then taking the level of Ibuprofen needed to get any relief ends up with gastric bleeding, and major intestinal discomfort most of the time.  Since using Kratom this bleeding and discomfort has subsided, and it is a good clean method of pain reduction.\n\nI just seek to be off of opiates, but still get the pain relief I need.  Changing the status of this plant to schedule 1 would only nudge me in the direction of going back to prescription Oxycodone, which due to its highly addictive nature, would be taken whether I needed it or not.

For many, including myself, this herbal supplement has provided substantial benefit for an array of conditions many ordinary citizens suffer with on a daily basis. In my instance, cluster migraine headaches have at times been a debilitating condition that I have suffered with through the years. After exhausting an array of traditional, alternative and therapeutic methods, I received substantial relief through the use of Kratom. I understand the need to review and possibly regulate it as a supplement, but to outright ban the use and acquisition of this herb outright would cause much distress for many, including myself. \n\n   I would consider myself a typical middle class American with a college education in a professional career who uses this as a medicinal alternative to strong narcotic and steroid therapies with their less than desirable side effects. To remove this choice would be to condemn many responsible citizens to a life of pain, leaving the only option to be the use of  highly addictive medicines that will cause long term complications. Poison control and even government studies show that kratom use is FAR LESS destructive as a threat to the common public as compared to current opioid epidemic with which our country is faced. Many more lives have been lost or adversely affected by the use of prescription meds for pain than have been by the use of this herb. By all means, study and possibly consider it for FDA regulation, but do not outright ban it. \n\nMany will suffer as consequence. Please consider this before issuing any final or lasting ban.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22191","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Rozas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to say that I have Been struggling with opiate addiction from a pain medication  (OXYCONTIN) made by PURDUE PHARMA.

When it comes to Kratom, most mention it for assisting with pain or as a tool for reducing opiate dependence, whether prescribed or illegally obtained. Throughout the community, many talk about the other uses the plant has, yet I don't see it mentioned as much publicly: depression and anxiety management. The CDC cites in a study done from the 2009-2010 period that the number of ambulatory care visits with major depressive disorder as primary diagnosis: 8 million as a yearly average. The experience I would like to talk about with depression, anxiety, treatment and the discovery of Kratom is long and anecdotal, but with other public comments it should convey a statistical message about personal experience.\n\tTo give context for my comments, I will give some background information about myself and life experiences. I am a 31 year old college graduate who has suffered from major depressive disorder and anxiety since my teenage years. I tried to hide this information (and still do to some extent) from my family until I left home to go to college. It wasn't until I was 18 that I started undergoing therapy and was eventually diagnosed with both disorders. From the age 18 to age 26 (the year I discovered Kratom) I felt like a pharmaceutical guinea pig. I have tried every type of medication, from SSRI's, SNRI's, tricyclics, buspar, benzodiazapenes, and several other that are not as easily classified. I had varying levels of success with these products, but they all came at a great cost to me personally. SSRI's caused me to feel like a different person and at the end of the day did not take care of the depression. These products had awful withdrawal symptoms like brain \"zaps\" which kept me from work many times.\nKratom helped me significantly in managing the depression and anxiety. It's as helpful to me as it is to people experiencing chronic pain. I became gainfully employed with a large company in a management position. I am contributing to society now. I am able to pay my bills. I am able to leave the house without crippling depression.\nSince the emergency scheduling announcement I have stopped taking Kratom out of fear that I would eventually have to face this fate anyhow. The months since September have been difficult to manage. I feel like my life is losing all forward momentum that I had previously gained. My depression is coming back stronger despite taking Welbutrin and having my doctor increase dosage. I'm now worried about losing my job because all my previous symptoms are making it nearly impossible to function at my job where I have to manage and lead many people. My employers have noticed a change and are asking if I am alright. Previously while taking the supposedly dangerous Kratom, no one ever thought there was anything off about me. No one wondered if I was ok, because I was a productive, fully functioning member of society. \n\tMany people who take Kratom to help with pain are feeling hopeless and worried about the potential ban or scheduling. I am just as terrified, because I feel like it will have just as terrible of an affect on my life. I risk going back to the doctor and trying other pharmaceuticals to try to deal with my brain chemistry and am worried about being prescribed something dangerously addictive (more benzodiazepines or products like Effexor) or losing everything I have worked hard for. I am writing this to ask you to please not ban or restrict something that has such a positive effect on the lives of so many. All of the supposed dangers and harm of Kratom can be dispelled by looking at the actual toxicology reports from those that the media claimed have died from it. It is only anecdotal for me personally to say this plant is not dangerous. The statistics and facts however do not point toward any real threat being posed by it. Do not condemn the lives of so many by removing something so mild and harmless. What kind of message does that send when products like tobacco and alcohol are totally legal, despite all the provable, quantifiable deaths caused by each of them annually?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17825","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matt Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After surgery I became addicted to pain medication.

My life has almost nothing to do with Kratom, but I know that it's helping others with their opioid addictions. Kratom is seen to be a harmful drug but the evidence says otherwise. This is from a 2014 article in the journal \"Pharmacotherapy\" by clinical pharmacologist  Megan Rech and four of her colleagues at the Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Illinois, \"Serious toxicity is rare and usually involves relatively high doses (more than 15 g) or coingestants,\". That same article also says, \"Fatalities typically involve coingestants.... Withdrawal has been described as less intense but more protracted than with prescription opioids.\" The International Journal of Legal Medicine offers a similar assessment; \"Kratom is considered minimally toxic,\" writes Florida forensic scientist Marcus Warner and two co-authors, although they add that \"research evaluating its toxic effects on humans is limited, with the vast majority of studies involving animals.\" Warner et al. say \"withdrawal symptoms are generally nonexistent to mild, even for heavy users\" and note that two Florida counties \"have deemed kratom not ready for regulation due to the lack of information demonstrating the substance as being unsafe or hazardous.\" Most of the stigma that is carried around by Kratom is due to the low level of research into Kratom, but from the research that we have seen, Kratom doesn't show to be a harmful drug at all, and one with a very low addiction risk. I beleive that that their is no evidence to suggest that Kratom is harmful to the general public.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19874","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Imran Abawari","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't ban Kratom. It saved my marriage, my job, and perhaps my life as well. Here is my story:\n\nI'm a small business owner living in a suburb of Philadelphia. I have a wife and three children all under the age of 10, and my addiction to prescription painkillers almost took all of that away. \n\n15 years ago, I was seriously injured lifting a 100lb TV set, and was diagnosed with a herniated L4-L5 in my back. This led to extremely painful sciatica, and ultimately led me down a path where I became addicted to the prescription painkillers that were giving me relief (mostly Vicodin and occasionally Percocet).\n\nAfter about 2 years of steadily falling deeper into addiction, I had decided that I needed to find a way out. I attempted to stop using prescription painkillers many times, over many months, but I always fell back into abyss of addiction. The thought of turning to Suboxone or Methadone was terrifying. Since I had never used Heroin, it seemed to me that perhaps Suboxone was going to be elevating my addiction, rather than curbing it. I was in desperate need of an alternative pain medication that would not have the negative impacts on my work and personal life that I was experiencing with Prescription painkillers. \n\nI first discovered Kratom when looking for an organic alternative to Suboxone. Online Kratom reviews were overwhelmingly positive, so I decided to give it a go, as my addiction to Opioid Painkillers had begun to take over my life, and my addiction was negatively impacting my productivity at work. Well - the first dose made me sick to my stomach (and dizzy). I went online and read that this is often a reaction to the first dose. Since so many other people swore by Kratom, I decided to give it another go. And boy am I glad I did! I was able to use Kratom to completely ween myself off of Vicodin. It has now been three years since I have taken a prescription painkiller of any sort. I take a twice daily dose of powdered Kratom, and that is all that I need. I am not cloudy throughout the day. I'm alert, and very much able to think on my toes. My libido is fully intact, and amazingly my back pain is better now that it was even on the Vicodin. Kratom gave me my life back. Please don't force me to go back to prescription painkillers. I have been on both sides of the fence, and they aren't remotely comparable. Prescription painkillers destroy everything. Kratom has allowed me to live a full life with dignity.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1363","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris McWilliams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not make Kratom a schedule 1 Drug!

If banned I will just go on disability because I refuse to live on pills.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5948","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shane sorosiak","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Does prohibition still work in 2016?\nWhy is the DEA banning plants when states are legalizing cannabis?\nDoes prohibition of a substance create other more dangerous substances?\nThanks for your time. :)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9258","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Aaron Baxter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using kratom for TWELVE years and thus, consider myself quite an expert on the matter. I always bought online, from easily found reputable vendors. In the entire time, I never received a \"bad batch\". Previously in my life I was on the standard medical drugs for minor pain, depression and anxiety. I was an RN working ICU and I was stressed, sad, and overworked. Thanks to the standard MD prescribed medications I had TWO major car accidents and a host of other problems that came from being over-medicated by doctors. When I found kratom, I was able to get off ALL prescription drugs and improve my life DRASTICALLY. I have never had a car accident or other serious problem while using kratom. I have gone back to school for a STEM degree and I am a STRAIGHT A STUDENT. My life now is unrecognizable from the pathetic way I lived while under MD care. I have no anxiety, depression, or pain. I am a very productive member of society seeking to better the lives of everyone I can. I was able to free myself of opiod pain medication for twelve years now! If you take kratom away because 1 person died then let's be honest, you have to take away aspirin, Tylenol, etc. Heck, you probably have to take away cleaning supplies, as well. Dumb, crazy people can misuse ANYTHING!! Don't you want to ban cars because a few people have killed thrmselves with carbon monoxide in the garage? And most FDA approved drugs run the risk of death, as well. Ban all medication. See how ridiculous this is? A kratom ban will lead to a domino effect of pain and death for many people. Addicts will resume their old drugs, and may kill themselves or others.  People will seek alternative methods and find only more dangerous, less effective options. Not to mention how difficult you will make it for scientists to research kratom. Please, do the right thing. DO THE RIGHT THING. I am not in the class of a heroin user. Don't put me there. Regulating kratom would be a much better option then relegating it to the trash heap. How many people have to tell you it has a plethora of positive effects before you listen? Your job is to protect the public, NOT HARM US. Removing kratom would be devastating harmful at a time when opiod deaths are OUT OF CONTROL. Please put your energy on ACTUAL problems, not beneficial substances. Your getting your duties all mixed up over there.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1378","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Megan Meyers","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't believe that Kratom should be illegal.

I work out 5 days a week (light workouts and back stretches) and eat very well, I take care of my body and I use Kratom when my back pain is severe. \n\nI can easily stop taking Kratom with no noticeable affects but the fact is I don't want this tool to be taken from me because a small percentage of people had concerns with Kratom.

I DO NOT drink alcohol or use any drugs (like I said I need to feel in control) and Kratom has been a gift and I tear up thinking about this being treated like a drug. \n\nIn short please consider people like me when making your decision as making Kratom will not stop the people who are a problem but they will affect people like me, I am a family man with a wonderful wife (high school sweetheart), blessed with three kids and I have earned everything I have through hard work and integrity. \n\nThank you for your consideration, \n\nJakob Crowder","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20637","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jakob Crowder","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has the potential to help people with so many different things - replacing opiates, helping to combat insulin resistance, helping to ease depression and anxiety, pain relief, as a sleep aid, as a wakefulness aid, to ease symptoms of the common cold...

Even if cannabis and kratom have zero medicinal value, which is demonstrably wrong and in no way backed up by scientific data, there is no reliable data suggesting that these plants are harmful to human health or to society in general. The war on drugs has been an epic failure, unless the goal is profiteering and ruining the lives of many nonviolent \"offenders\" by locking them up and treating them like criminals. It's ironic to suggest that these non violent humans who choose to consume a plant are criminals, and then to punish them as such. That is the real crime. It's a crime against the individual(s), and against humanity as a whole. The benefit of kratom, especially in a society where prescription drug abuse has become a deadly epidemic, is giving these poor afflicted souls an option that will provide pain relief and other medicinal benefits, while not ruining their lives and ultimately leading to their demise. If the interest of the people and their mental and physical health was your priority, then you would be promoting this beautiful plant and it's incredible benefits, but that's clearly not who you represent. It seems to me that you represent the interests of big pharma, our predatory Healthcare system, and other big money interests, so most likely my words will fall on deaf ears.

Unfortunately due to being in my early 20's when it happened, it was tough to find doctors who were willing to treat my pain... it seemed as if I would just be riding out the clock until I was old enough where I wouldn't be considered a liability. The muscle relaxers I was prescribed weren't enough to help the pain to where I could be functional and alert; each day was a struggle. I ate so many over the counter pain relievers daily, the IB Profen ate a hole in my stomach- something I found out after a colonoscopy at the disturbingly young age of 31. The excessive amount of pain worsened my anxiety, making every day tasks difficult, and I became a borderline recluse. When I found kratom, I gained a new lease on life, hope for the future, & instead of dreading waking up consumed by the chronic pain & despondency. After a few months of usage, I was able to not only rejoin the work force & be present with my family, but I also managed to completely ween myself off of codeine, and experienced the unexpected side effect of less anxiety. That lessened anxiety resulted in me drinking less too. I accept that I won't be 100% pain free life due to my injury & the hardware put in my leg, but kratom has helped improve my quality of life in myriad ways. I even lost weight because I feel pain free enough to be more active & participate in yoga & other activities I had to cast aside when encompassed by pain. \nI understand the need for regulation, but to put it to schedule I without allowing the current medical studies to finish would be unnecessarily extreme. Everyone agrees the opiate epidemic is something to be concerned about, so a solution like kratom (a non-respiratory depressant that can't be overdosed on) would be foolish to discard without heavy consideration & like mentioned before, the studies to be completed. Many have wondered how many lives ruined by prescription or street opiates could've been prevented had kratom been an option. My only regret regarding kratom is that I did not find it sooner.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14515","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Mac","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am requesting that you not schedule this substance (or as I call it \"supplement\"). I have many chronic conditions that cause me to have to take pain medications on a daily basis, and because of this my quality of living has went down tremendously, so I did some investigating and discovered kratom, a coffee plant cousin used for thousands of years for pain that was all natural. It didn't have the nasty side effects that pain medications had, and it couldn't kill me either from taking too much, and doesnt' have a respatory depressant in it. I discovered that just by making a cup of tea with this supplement a day I was able to cut out all my pain medication all together, and was able to get in the floor again and play with my children. I am able to be a real mom again. Not a mom high on pain medication just to be able to function. After taking my kratom tea for a while longer I soon discovered that it also helped me with depression, anxiety, PTSD, blood pressure among many other things. And I was also able to control all those things and cut out all those rx medications. So I can see why the pharma companys don't want this around. They will loose money if everyone stops paying for their medications and throws them in the trash. But lets look at the big picture here..Wouldn't it just be great if the people who choose can choose to do this? Please leave that option up to us, the people. We are not talking about an opiate here, we are not talking about a synthetic, we are talking about an all natural plant that God put here for us and its wonderful benefits, so I am basically begging you, my kids are begging you, and my husband, mother and father are begging you to please let me keep living, and not just existing in a brain fog anylonger. Which was what prescription drugs were doing to me. It was taking away my quality of life from me. Let me make my own medical decisions for myself, and don't make a good mother, wife, and daughter, and member of society a felon. Save kratom, and you will be saving lives. You will be saving my life. For I see no future on pain medications again. With all respect, and hoping that the regulations department will make the right decision in this situation. Regulate things that need to be regulated, like the pharma industry, that have reported deaths every few seconds from the usage of their pills. Regulate lab created medications and synthetics that are killing our young people. Not completely natural plants that are stopping these deaths from these dangerous pills.. God Bless and I will pray that the Regulation Committee will make a decision that God would be proud of.

I take Kratom regularly to help me cope with chronic pain.  I write to request the DEA completely avoid scheduling Kratom because it poses no danger to the public.\n\nFirst, please allow me to introduce myself.  I am a 44-year-old father of 6 children, ages 2 through 12.  I have an Electrical Engineering degree and am close to completing a Master's degree.  I have been steadily employed for the last 21 years and have been a salaried employee of a Fortune 500 company for most of those years.  I also suffer from chronic pain in my neck and back from several past injuries.  My work is intellectually demanding but the constant pain is exhausting and demoralizing, often making it difficult to concentrate on my job or my duties before and after work as an active father in the lives of my children.  \n\nI refuse to take opiates for chronic pain; in my opinion opiates should only be for acute problems.  In addition, my job requires me to meet DOT guidelines for drug testing.  I have friends that are close to my age and they also have their share of chronic pain, and some of them have become addicted to opiates. I personally know two people in in my age group that have accidentally overdosed on opiates and died from respiratory arrest.  Their passings were absolutely devastating to their families.\n\nI first tried Kratom 10 years ago, and began taking it on occasion to help me cope with pain and sometimes to mitigate the headaches and exhaustion from bad colds or the the flu so that I could do simple things like prepare food for the children or take a shower.  On days where my chronic pain is so distracting that I can't think of anything else, Kratom helps me get past the pain and continue to be productive at my job and with my family.  I don't only take Kratom, I take it as an integral part of a pain management approach that includes other herbs such as ginger, turmeric, coffee and capsaicin, along with ibuprofen and aspirin. I don't take any of these every day and have not noticed any addiction or withdraw symptoms with Kratom for the periods I don't take it.  I never find Kratom to completely eliminate pain, but on days where the pain is debilitating, it helps me to function at a level where I can stay at work, be productive, and not shut out my children.   \n\nKratom is an effective but mild analgesic that is self-limiting and has no potential for abuse because it is only effective in low dosages.  Scheduling Kratom will create problems for many Americans who rely on it to help them cope with their maladies without harmful side affects.  I am certain that the scheduling of Kratom would either unjustifiably criminalize or force tens of thousands of chronic pain sufferers to turn to dangerous - yet legally prescribed - opiates.  There is absolutely no reason it should be scheduled in my opinion.\n\nThank you for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21091","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marlon Wood","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nOn the surface kratom appears to be a medicinally promising substance. Susan Ash of the American Kratom Association maintains that, in pure herbal form, when taken at moderate doses of less than 10 to 15 g, pure leaf kratom appears to be relatively benign in the vast majority of users. Many fear that with the scheduling of kratom they will lose their lives to the opiate addictions they sought to control, others will lose a mildly stimulating intoxicant that has a centuries-long history of use, but all of us would stand to lose the valuable knowledge contained within this plant.\n\nImpending the ban of kratom, the Journal of the American Osteopathic Associations Walter C. Prozialeck has published a report and concluded that, Based on all of the evidence, it is clear that kratom and its mitragynine constituents are not opioids and that they should not be classified as such. Researchers like Prozialeck believe the benefits of kratom far outweigh the risks, he says, Additional studies are needed to explore potential benefits of kratom. Also, work is needed to look at toxicity, though. How would kratom interact with prescription drugs or nutritional supplements that a person might be using? Others like Andrew Kruegel, a research scientist at Columbia University, hope the DEA will decide against a ban that would hinder studies exploring its medicinal value.\n\nKratom is seen by many users as a possible treatment for opiate withdrawal, and even as an alternative to painkillers. Its growing popularity  for recreational and medicinal uses  presents a growing threat to pharmaceutical giants who fear a decline in prescriptions, and subsequently profits. If through lobbying the industry can demonize kratom, it would stand to benefit from the resulting ban. A scenario like this would ensure patients continue to fill prescriptions, and companies (cartels) would avoid losing profits.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22502","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joe Moreno","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life.

For almost three years of my life, I suffered from constant 4-8mm kidney stones. During that time I found myself resorting to prescription medication to get through work and my daily life, for insurance reasons, the doctors told me it would be better for me to wait out the stones instead of getting surgery. Eventually, I began using medication illegally obtained to treat my pain and my growing addiction to painkillers. after I passed the last stone, I found myself still craving the use of pain medication; that's when I realized I had a problem. Thanks to my brother, I discovered Kratom, which helped me ease off painkillers fairly easily. because of Kratom, I didn't need to take off work or risk relapsing. After that, I used Kratom to replace my drinking and then used it to treat my mild depression and anxiety. Now I use Kratom only when I feel necessary, such as, when my depression or anxiety are acting up. Other than that I never take it, and I have had no problems with feeling like I NEED to take it or with the so-called \"Withdrawl\" symptoms from it. I fear that many people won't be as lucky as I was if the DEA were to ban Kratom, so many people will be without the help they could so easily obtain if this ban goes through. \nI firmly believe that banning Kratom will do nothing but harm to the thousands who need it, and the repercussions for keeping it legal would be about as detrimental as legalized coffee. \nPlease, for the wellbeing of thousands of American's like me, do not ban Kratom!

For those of us (me included) dealing with chronic pain, it is a beautifully simple supplement to the pain prescriptions, in that it assists in the control of pain and helps conserve on the amount of pills / medication prescribed by dr's without turning to illegal street drugs or having to going through withdrawals because for one reason or another you were forced to take some extra medication to be able to function and have a good quality of life for yourself and those around you. I don't want to speak for everyone, but when I run low or out of pain medications, I'm not a pleasant person to be around,  and that's saying it nicely..\n   Kratom tastes horrible and if you get the gelcaps it doesn't work as well , in my case at least, it doesn't give you any real type of intoxication, it just keeps me functioning so I can continue to life.\n   If it wasn't for Kratom, I would either have to break laws to be able to function like a normal version of me, or suffer through the \"four day flu\" after which I wouldn't be able to function due to the extreme pain that I have to take Hydrcodone 10/325 (the generic YELLOW pills. I'm aware they both have the same ingredients, but for some reason the non-yellow, white version of the medication does not work nearly as well as the yellow versions. Ask anyone who suffers from chronic pain for extended periods of time [like their whole lives], and anyone who has tried both white and yellow, they will agree hands down that the yellow version is the type you want to use for your pain) for. \n   I beg of you, please do not let yet another harmless substance fall under the DEA's control.

I also live in West Virginia which has been ravaged by opioid addiction, sales and trafficking. I have one friend in particular who is 100% disabled due to PTSD from the various tours he's done throughout his years of service. Kratom (along with other substances) shows promise in helping people - your fellow countrymen, brothers-in-arms and the folks in your very own neighborhood without the damning side-effects that have robbed people of a substantial and rewarding life. The VA, FDA and 'big pharma' in general look more to line their pockets and save face more than helping the people in their charge. \n\nWhile this Kratom has not been fully vetted (clinically), there is no legitimate reason to enact any type of prohibition against it. While not 'definitive' (if there is such a thing) the initial reports are that it is both safe and useful, and to my knowledge, there have been no issues that can not be attributed to other issues (or at most a combination of substances). More people have died from caffeine overdoses than from Kratom (are there ANY that have been documented?). \n\nMore people traffick in cigarettes and booze - both 'legal' substances - than ever before. This proves that a ban on Kratom would not make it go away. It will only drive it underground. The war on drugs, while profitable, only serves to destroy - not to build. \n\nProhibition in this country has repeatedly found itself on the wrong side of liberty, history AND the people (i.e. alcohol, marijuana, etc...). While the FDA is known to be in the pocket of 'big pharma' (see the revolving door), the DEA is not quite there (yet). Please do not continue on the path with unsubstantiated claims for a prohibition (a la marijuana et al). while regulation would be an option, calling it a \"schedule-X\" drug would be a misstatement and would only harm people, not help or \"protect\" people. \n\nSome years ago, the FDA came out against Cheerios, of all things, stating that if they really did lower cholesterol - as General Mills stated they did - then Cheerios would have to be regulated. CHEERIOS! While it would be wise to seek their direction on SOME items, the DEA is not without its own merit. At this point, there is no illicit trafficking, no Kratom-Cartels, etc... and you can make this choice on your own with just the information you have available to you - with or without the FDA.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10153","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Norman Scites II","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is obviously less toxic than most pharmaceuticals. let scientific study, not cuts to big pharma be the determining factor in scheduling.

I have earned a Bachelors degree in biology and a Masters degree in molecular biology and biochemistry.  I like my job a lot and I work very hard.  I also suffer from anxiety and frequent headaches which make living normally very difficult.  Due to prescription drugs that are typically used to treat these health issues being significantly more difficult to obtain from a Dr, I have been using Kratom to treat these health issues.  I have been taking Kratom for 4 years.  It relieves my symptoms and allows me to be able to work and interact with people somewhat normally.  I do not know what I would do without Kratom?\nI also know of several people who have used Kratom to get off prescription opiates and Heroin.  They have been successful thanks to kratom.  If Kratom is taken away from them I am afraid they will go right back to the opiates.  With opiates being such a problem right now, this is the worst possible time to make a mild, nonaddictive, healthy, alternative a schedule one substance!  Kratom is very safe and no where near as dangerous as the alternatives.  \n\nPlease show some empathy and do not put Kratom as Schedule 1.  Research needs to be done so that we can further understand what causes the benefits of Kratom and taking it away from people will do a lot of harm.

I am a 56 year old female with a bachelor degree in business who works as an application analyst. Please do not make kratom illegal or take it off the market for responsible adults. I suffer minor aches and pains from osteoarthritis and the effects of getting older. I have been taking NSAIDS daily since 2009, of which known long term effects include kidney, stomach, and heart damage; to address these aches until I tried kratom about a year ago. I found that Kratom tea relieves my pain so that I can be more active and sleep better. In addition, it helps me feel more motivated and in a better mood. I drink it a few times a week after I do yard work or exercise, for example.\nThere is ample experience sharing and information available on the Internet to set proper expectations for benefits and minor adverse effects if too much is consumed by accident. Consequently, I have never experienced a bad effect from it. According to reports, adverse effects are minor and resolve in a few hours. On a positive note, the minor side effects of over consumption serve the purpose of discouraging attempts to abuse it. I feel more confident that I am not damaging my heart and kidneys from using it, than I was when I took ibuprofen. Since I have been drinking kratom tea a few times a week, I have not had any colds or allergy flare-ups either. I see my doctor regularly, and my labs are consistently in the normal ranges.\nI encourage kratom to be studied in regards to its nutritional analysis, as I suspect it to be as beneficial as other green vegetables such as kale or spirulina. In addition to its nutritional benefits, it appears to have minor energizing and pain relieving effects similarly to coffee. A study to investigate its safe use would provide the scientific justification of what tens of thousands of users over hundreds of years already know. \nKratom has the potential to be a great benefit to society. It helps people avoid dangerous prescriptions and expensive doctor visits. This relieves pressure on the health care system and lowers insurance costs for all of us. Please do not take it off the market because of a few unscrupulous marketers and their outrageous claims of a legal high that alarm the authorities and encourage abuse by the ignorant.

I am 44 years old.  I am on disability ,but was a certified medical assistant for my profession. My Use Of kratom started about 2 years ago. It has changed my life. I was diagnosed with Reflex Sympathic Dystropy about 9 years ago although I suffered from it for years before I got a diagnosis. I was on so much opioid pain medication that I wasn't able to function. I was on 2oo mg of morphine a day as well as 60 mg of hydrocodone. It was debilitating.. I started looking for some kind of alternative . I did a lot of research and decided to try kratom.I weaned off the opoids. I was surprised at how well it helped me and I could function normally without feeling loopy.I felt normal again. My pain is tolerable most of the time for the first time in years. I had no side affects, unlike all that opioid medication. I was clear headed. I was able to be more active and involved again in my children's lives . I now have grandkids that I am able to enjoy. I have at this point spent half of my life fighting this disease. The sad thing about Chronic diseases is that one person may have the diagnosis but the whole family has the disease. It is not just me whose life has been changed for the better but my whole family. While I still have don't have the quality of life some people may have, with kratom I at least have some hope that the quality I do have, I can be clear minded enough to enjoy when it comes. To make this natural medication illegal , while the opioid epidemic is running rapid, makes no sense to me. For me, I feel it amount to a death sentence for what quality of life I do have. Please make your decision with the care, with knowledge, and with those in mind who will be effected by your decision. \nSincerely,\nAngela Koenig.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16720","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Angela Koenig","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 40-year-old college educated wife and grandmother who is also living with chronic pain. In 2003 I started on a long road of legally prescribed opiate pain medicine. I always trusted my doctor and did not ask many questions except \"can I stop taking this whenever I want?\" and was told \"yes, and there will be no issues\" They lied. Withdraw is a horrible demon that can truly scare you that you will never allow it to happen again. As much as I wanted off, opiate withdraw kept me going back to my doctors each month. I saw changes happening with mood, thought, and my body that I knew was coming from the continuous use of legally prescribe opiates but truly felt unsure on what to do. Even discussions with my doctor turned up the option of another drug that I would have to take that could help me break free BUT I would need that pill for the rest of my life. It was a long chain of pills and no true answers. I decided enough was enough. I started looking and found the answers with Kratom. The biggest plus for me was the fact it was from the same group as coffee. I added Kratom to my plan of getting off opiates along with therapy, exercise, healthy eating and support groups. I have never looked back. Once I had stuck to my two-week plan, I had no issues with dropping Kratom from my daily routine. Kratom didn't get me off opiates by itself, I did that, it was something that allowed things to go smoother and help me function. I was shocked and saddened to find out this was something they wanted to schedule and remove it from the people who need it. Kratom doesn't cause you to feel \"high\" like opiates do nor does it cause you to crave it. It is a wonderful tool that can be used to help someone with chronic pain and opiate withdraw. My biggest fear is one day someone, just like me, will be at a crossroad when it comes to opiates and not have a natural option to leave opiates behind. Since my journey with opiates I have learned to ask questions and right now I question \"why anyone would take this from us?\" I am using my voice and my personal experience to be the voice of all those that that may benefit from Kratom. I am appealing to you, not to make Kratom a schedule 1 or even schedule it at all. I can honestly say I am not sure where I would be if I hadn't used Kratom in my tools to end my dependency to opiate medicine and I don't ever want to think what could happen if it is not available for others who may need it. Thank You for taking the time to read my personal story on why I am a believer in Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6207","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please think about how many people this helps to live a non pharmicudical life It another alternative for people who want to go another route but still want to ease the pain .

With all do respect, this is why that's a bad idea. The addiction epidemic is rampant in this country. Some people became addicted by choice, others did not. Some simply took the medication their doctor prescribed for them and in a couple of months they were addicted. These people are law enforcement, veterans, teachers, etc, but all productive members of society. They come from all walks of life. Once a person has been taking opiates for a certain amount of time, it changes their brain chemistry so simply stopping is horrific and almost impossible. With Kratom one can wean themselves off of such substances safely without fear of getting addicted, unlike things such as Suboxone or Methadone. Kratom isn't harmful nor is it addictive. If you truly care about this nation and it's citizens please don't take away the only hope they have by scheduling Kratom. I never thought I'd be able to say I'm not addicted, I'm not on anything. I can say that now, I'm not addicted nor am I on anything! Kratom has given me my life back, my children their mother back and my husband his wife back. I became in this position because my doctor sent me to pain management for Crohns Disease. By simply trusting my physician I became an addict, I had never done drugs before in my life. Please help others like me to be able to say what I never thought I could, I'm not addicted anymore. This is in your hands, please make the right moral choice by keeping Kratom legal.

I also did not want to chance becoming dependent on chemicals.  I felt completely helpless and frightened by life itself, and even felt suicidal at times.  Once I adopted kratom into my routine, I suddenly had found a new lease on life that I had just about all but given up on.  It didn't make me feel high, it didn't impair my ability to do my job or functional normally, if anything it made me 100x more productive and motivated to get up and seize the day!  Once I found out about kratom's pain-relieving abilities, I gave some to my wife to try as well, because she has severe back and joint pain due to having a connective tissue disorder, and she too did not want to use dangerous and addictive pharmaceutical chemicals.  It worked wonders fore her and gave her a life to live again as well.

There's not a single negative thing we can say about it!  \n\nKratom saved both of our lives!  Now that the DEA is considering banning it, we both are extremely frightened and nervous about the future, and we feel like our government does not understand the plight that will result for people like us.  If we can no longer access kratom, my crippling anxiety and depression is sure to return, and her pain issues will prevent her from working and having a normal life.  Please, we encourage you to do the necessary research to learn about kratom's benign efficacy.  The fact that the DEA has repealed it's own decision to open the floor for public comment in response to the outcry of hundreds of thousands of people clearly shows the vast majority of Americans that are in the exact same boat as us and feel just as strongly.  PLEASE DON'T BAN KRATOM!!!!!  There are far, far, FAR worse readily available substances that are injuring and killing people every day, which remain completely legal and accessible.  Kratom does not even get a person HIGH, the effect is comparable to coffee with a side of pain/anxiety relief.  The key word is RELIEF.

I have tried it a few times a few years ago from a couple different sources and I found no intoxicating effects that necessitate making this a scheduled substance. This was done with moderate and high doses taken in several ways (made into a tea, mixed with applesauce, etc). I would compare this to maybe a calming herbal tea like chamomile or sleepy time tea. There are some very dangerous drugs out there including heroin, cocaine, crack, methamphetamine, and research chemicals for instance. Putting Kratom in the same category as these substances is a joke quite frankly. I'd highly recommend reconsidering this push to make kratom a schedule 1 drug. It's absurd to anyone that's ever taken it and undermines my confidence in the DEA. Opioids are an epidemic here in Massachusetts and this is what you're focusing your energy on?

She moved out of her home state to be near me while my husband was deployed, and had to come off the suboxone. Her withdrawals were nasty, but we discovered Kratom and it helped her withdrawal symptoms. She still uses Kratom to help with the pain she experiences from many chronic invisible diseases. If it hasn't been for Kratom, she wouldn't be sober a year later.\n\nLast month I was coming off Cymbalta cold turkey. My withdrawals were terrible! Brain zaps, nausea, dizziness, sweats/hot flashes, and so much more. My sister gave me some Kratom and told me it would really help.

It is true that there are truly dangerous substances out there, such as synthetic opioids, that some unscrupulous people are mixing with Kratom, but the Kratom leaf itself is completely safe.  You want to end the crisis of Opiate drugs. I am all for that. However kratom is not an opiate and needs to be separated from opiates and synthetic drugs.  Kratom has gotten an unfair reputation as a \"legal high\", but it is not a drug and does not produce any type of high. There is no recreational value to it. If kratom is made illegal, the opiate crisis we have in the U.S.A. will get worse, not better, because the safe alternative is being taken away, forcing people back to highly addictive prescription drugs.  After Alabama banned kratom in May 2016 without public comment, opiate overdoses have doubled.\n\nMelvin Patterson, a spokesman for the DEA, suggested in an interview that \"numerous deaths from Kratom\" actually meant 1 death from Kratom, their primary example being someone with cardiovascular problems, where the medical examiner stated it was \"indeterminate\" if Kratom was even present in his bloodstream.  The remaining 14 'Kratom-related deaths' involved other drugs or a preexisting medical condition.  Even if the 15 deaths were due to kratom, there are an estimated 3 million kratom users in the United States alone.  If kratom were truly dangerous, there would be tens of thousands of deaths.  15 deaths out of 3 million is a lower rate than alcohol, tobacco, drunk driving, prescription and over-the-counter drugs.  Every single year tobacco, alcohol, prescription drugs, aspirin, and even peanut allergies combined kill almost 600000, the number of deaths in the American Civil War.  Each day 78 people die of opiate overdoses (46 from prescription painkillers). \n\nI am a responsible 40-year old adult, using kratom for depression and anxiety.  I found Kratom about 5 years ago when I was going through a major anxiety that prescription drugs and therapy were not able to help.  As soon as I discovered Kratom I was able to improve my life, have more focus and energy, and conquer anxiety.  I've tried other herbals as well as prescription drugs, but Kratom has helped me more.  When I have stopped consuming kratom for short periods of time, the worst \"withdrawal\" I would get was no worse than skipping coffee for a day or two.  I would get a headache and minor cold-like symptoms for a day couple of days, then I'm fine. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5655","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 34 year old software developer who first learned about and started using kratom nearly one year ago.  I've found the substance to be a good coffee substitute, of which I've been a heavy consumer for the last decade.  I'm opposed to scheduling it, which I'll explain below.\n\nIt's similar to coffee in that it gives me a energy boost, though it's not as strong as the caffeine jitters can be and it has a more smooth curve then than the coffee rush-and-then-crash over several hours.  It also doesn't keep me up at night, so I can safely use it if I need more energy in the evening and still get to bed on time for work.\n\nI make a tea out from its powdered form, which I order online from reputable vendors.  I don't support the stores that are irresponsible in branding and package kratom as  a recreational substance, who are doing a disservice to the actual plant and most users.\n\nI'm opposed to scheduling kratom for several major reasons, described below:\n\n1.  The plant's recreational potential is low.  I've been a heavy drinker since college, and the effect of even 2 beers overpowers the mild impact of kratom.  Similar to coffee, it helps me get lively and I enjoy socializing more, but it's not an intoxicant.  From those I know who use other drugs they report that kratom has almost no relative effect.\n\nThat's why it's been available for years without the drug using party crowd getting into it:  it isn't \"fun\" like alcohol, marijuana, and other substances are.  If it were, we'd be seeing it at raves and college parties on a regular basis.\n\n2.  It should be researched properly.  We have hundreds of years of worldwide anecdotal knowledge combined with 20+ years in the United States, which gives us some understanding of it.  I'm all in favor of full clinical research so we can refine that anecdotal knowledge about its effects into hard science.\n\nWere it to be scheduled (especially as schedule 1), however, this research would become prohibitively hard and the plant will spend longer without a proper understanding.  We need more research on it, and that's best found keeping it unscheduled.  \n\nNow, should this research discover currently unknown dangers about the plant then its legal status can be re-examined.  While I don't expect that outcome, it'd be good due diligence to find out and I'm all in favor of doing so.\n\n3.  I'm opposed to furthering the War on Drugs.  The US has ran that experiment for over 40 years now with serious consequences, with many citizens imprisoned and unable to contribute to society.  Criminalizing kratom would expand that war into new territory where it isn't needed, while going against public opinion.\n\nI understand why the DEA uses its emergency scheduling powers on such substances as the recent bath salts and other designer drugs.  Kratom does not belong in that company, however, and I'm confident that with further research those facts will become clear.\n\nFinally, I am open to kratom being regulated as a supplement.  Having the same level of FDA oversight as the many supplements on the open market will stop those unscrupulous vendors who sell an adulterated product, as well as eliminating the misleading marketing that suggests it is some kind of recreational product.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15879","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alexander Athey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am commenting on the proposed scheduling of Kratom.

There is scant evidence that Kratom is addictive and I would encourage some of you over at the DEA to try it before (and if) it becomes illegal.  Once you have sampled it you will probably ask yourself what all the fuss was about.  It's like coffee meets a mild painkiller without constipation and potential for addiction. I've never been addicted to opiate types of drugs, but I understand Kratom is helpful to some who do have that problem. Thanks for taking time to read my comment, and I do thank the DEA for some of the really good things they do for the United States and keeping dangerous drugs away from people.  I just think you have it wrong on this one substance.

Genesis 1:29. I cannot believe that the citizens of this supposed free republic are having to fight for a right guaranteed to us by God and the U.S. Constitution/ Bill of Rights but if we do not stand for our rights they will be taken by those tyranical, corporate types who seek to enslave and quench the voice of Liberty. The American people are waking up and standing up for the freedom that has been slowly taken away, in the name of peace and safety, because it is profitable for big pharma and the out of control corrections system in our country. I have used Kratom for four years now and could not put into words the tremendous, life changing benefits that this herb has to offer. Unlike a pharmaceutical, kratom needs not be cooked up, chemically altered, smoked or injected to receive the benefits that the Almighty no doubt intended in that magnificent week of creation six thousand years ago. If you refuse to listen to and fear your employers (American Citizens), then fear God and let this herb remain available and unregulated. Our government has ignored the voice of its people for too long and we the people are no longer going to remain quite about our rights as American Citizens.

It did! I felt better and did not have the undesirable side-effects from the prescription drug.  For the first time in 20+ years, I was able to manage my anxiety and depression without medication.\n\nIve lost close to 50 excess pounds, because Im much more alert and active on kratom than I was on the Prozac. I used to come home and sleep for 15 hours a day. Now I sleep about 6 to 8 hours, like normal people do.  Not to get too personal, but the Prozac also had a negative effect on my sex drive that I don't experience with kratom. \n\nIve been taking kratom daily for over 4 years now.

I have seen my parents go through alcohol and tobacco withdrawal as well. Kratom's positives far out way the downsides not only in withdrawal but in side effects and toxicity. It is much safer and isn't like other opoids. It doesn't get stronger no matter how much you take. \n\nI depend on Kratom because I have no insurance, put myself in 3000$ worth of medical debt and couldn't function on 4 different pills and Kratom has freed me of that.

Professionally, my career has been mostly in substance abuse education and non-profit outreach regarding substance abuse issues. I worked for notMYkid under Paul Penzone who last week became sheriff of Maricopa county in the Phoenix metro area. I was the coordinator of student educational services and did public speaking, fundraising, media and wrote educational curriculum on substance abuse issues. More recently, I worked as a house manager for Step by Step transitional living and presently I own a botanical supplement company specializing in products that allow for a better quality of life with reduced danger of physical harm vs. the alternatives. However, in my line of work, it is very hard for us to tell someone the truth about our products. There is often little we can say and it limits our effectiveness as a positive force. \nI was born with aspergers and an inverted circadian rhythm resulting in clinical insomnia, depression, anxiety and fatigue during the day. When I was 7, roughly half my family was killed in a plane crash which began an accumulated PTSD that blossomed in 2006 when my fianc and best friend died. I was also born with a spinal deformity called Schuurman's disease. Though I eventually grew out of the Schuurmans, extraordinary hypertrophy occurred during my youth and by the time I was 20, I had arthritis. I also sustained an injury in 2010 which resulted in a slipped disk that then pushed against both sciatica. Later, likely as another ancillary consequence of Schuurmans, I developed pelvic obliquity, a problem where the base of my spine seats improperly to my pelves. I am in constant physical and psychological pain by default, I have been heavily medicated my entire life. However, I have never been managed well by medications, they have always been a contributing factor to my issues or helped only briefly before becoming a hindrance. This created a cyclical process where my pain pushed me back towards medications, i found temporary relief, then spiraled downwards progressively only to repeat this process. I had dedicated my life to helping addicts in recovery but found through my various physical and mental health ailments, entirely unable to live with or without the substances I knew of. I was a pillar of recovery while my own recovery unraveled at the seams. \nWhen my disk blew out, I was on a full scholarship to ASU for my non-profit contribution, working as the coordinator at notMYkid. I could not go back to narcotics but I was in too much pain to even sit at a desk. I needed pain management, even knowing it would likely become a serious problem again to do so, I had no other option and began a course of pain medications once again. I stayed strong for a time but things quickly spiraled out of control and I lost everything. I lost my dream job, I lost my scholarship, I lost every quantifiable aspect of my life with any meaning. The ensuing 2 years were bleak beyond description, the worst of my life. They were even more bleak than the events in the story I told as notMYkid's coordinator, of the years of ruin culminating in the deaths of my fianc, best friend and other friends. It was worse than that because this time, I had fallen from great heights. I had made for myself the perfect life and it laid in ruins. I didn't want to be on narcotics, I wanted to stay clean. But I couldn't stand the constant pain. Still, i regret beyond reckoning what happened and wish I knew then what I know now. \nMy process of on and off medications continued for another 2 years until in 2013 I resolved to live without narcotics no matter the pain. I began to look into all of my options. I tried every conceivable remedy and had little to show for it. One day I google searched the terms \"natural pain reliever\" and stumbled upon ana article describing kratom. It sounded too good to be true. But the day I tried kratom was like waking up after a very long time dreaming. Not only was my pain suddenly manageable, unexpectedly my psychological hurdles seemed less daunting. And yet, I got the distinct impression that I was not on a \"drug.\" Its difficult to explain but despite the enormous assistance kratom can grant, unlike narcotics, it does not feel like a drug. It is more for me, the alleviation of negative sensations than a euphoria. I could only distinguish it by saying it was not \"mind altering.\" On narcotics, you feel like a different person. With kratom, I merely feel more myself and those around me attest to the same. I don't know where I would be if it wasn't for kratom. You must understand I was a hopeless case and now, my beautiful family and beautiful life have actualized. Socially, we have failed for decades to make a positive impact regarding narcotics. Things are worse than ever and the ideas of the past will not begin working now, let kratom stay. There's little to lose and so much to gain, lets see where this goes.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11842","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon Bird","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it may concern-\n\nMy name is James and I am 30 years old and have taken kratom to help with anxiety for the past 4 years.

Kratom has been used for thousands of years and there isnt a single case that proves without a doubt that kratom was the sole reason somebody has died. If the DEA was actually for the people they would use alcohol and tobacco as a base line, is the substance in question worse for the human body than tobacco or alcohol? The clear answer in the case of Kratom, Cannabis, MDMA, Psilocybin mushroom, LSD, and even some Stimulants and opiates is that they are in no way shape or form worse for the human body than alcohol, tobacco, taco bell, mcdonalds, or burger king. The DEA is fighting a war that is impossible to win. If you want to make money then stop takeing huge pay offs from super PACS and wealthy alcohol and tobacco companys and private prisons. The people will use illicit substances no matter what the DEA says, except the gov will not be getting any money from it, the drug dealers and cartels will. Now it has already been prooven that the gov. is supplying a large majority of illegal drugs that are out on the street but how about this. DO YOUR JOB!

I have used Kratom to manage pain and anxiety for many years. I do not use this recreationally-- I use it medicinally. The appropriate thing to do in this situation would be to fund research and development on the plant while it is. Or a scheduled substance --  not ban it until that research has been completed. It has been used by many people for a long time for medicinal reasons and a sudden ban would be detrimental to those users (like myself). I prefer natural alternatives to pharmaceutical prescriptions. I would certainly deny any opiate painkillers if they were prescribed to me in favor of kratom for pain management. I have denied pharmaceutical anxiety medication in favor of kratom.  I have never had an issue abusing kratom and it is not a problem to use it for a period of time to manage symptoms and the stop using it once the symptoms are gone. If this plant is banned I will have lost faith in the DEA as the decision to ban kratom would be an obvious play into the hands of the pharmaceutical companies who continue to push very dangerous opiate medications.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22920","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Branden Cote","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am against the scheduling of this plant.

My position of employment is maintenance landfill/receiving station manager.\n\nI have served in the military and served about 5 years as a corrections officer and armed security officer in Texas law enforcement.  I am also an equipment operator, skilled construction worker, and property maintenance tech.  I also am s former physical fitness instructor previously certified through Cooper Institute.\n\nI discovered Kratom in 2012 when I made the decision to better my life getting off of legally doctor prescribed hydrocodone, ambien/zolpidem for over three years, and xanax.  Kratom greatly supplemented and helped me through the withdrawals of these drugs.  Often times the withdrawals caused seizures, stroke level high blood pressure, hallucinations, unexplainable anxiety, depression and other psychological phenomena.  The withdrawal lasted around 9 months total as it was protracted.  Again, Kratom not only helped the withdrawal, it sobered my outlook and helped me turn away from prolonged prescription use.  I feel Kratom played a dear role in saving my life, as the withdrawals were that severe.\n\nIn early 2015, i became severely ill and tested positive for multiple sclerosis through spinal fluid analasys. Kratom I feel does help the severe neurological symptoms I now live with.  It has reduced the severe pain, weakness, fatigue, cognitive and memory problems, anxiety, and other psychological symptoms related to my neurological condition.  It has also helped me to be able to work in high degrees of summer heat, often times a huge issue for people with such illnesses.\n\nI do not believe that Kratom should be classified, scheduled, or banned for any reason whatsoever.  I cannot say it has ever cured any of my illnesses, but it definitely had a positive impact on my health for many inflammatory conditions as I mentioned above and in my last letter as a supplement to maintain my overall health, and has helped keep me alive when I might not have survived.\n\nKratom as a health supplement has not acted as an elicit drug, in fact quite the opposite.  It has a very sobering effect to me.  It does however improve my mood and give me a positive outlook.  I do not believe these effects are elicit.  I have never felt addicted, now have I had cravings or withdrawal symptoms from Kratom either.  Every time I wanted to stop, I did with very little requires effort.\n\nI believe in the right to self improvement.  I believe in the right to self treat.  I also believe we the people should have the right to utilize whatever tools, vitamins and supplements we deem or see fit to self treat if we wish to do so.  I chose not to go to drug rehab due to its low success rate, cost, as well as society's unfair stigma about anything drug rehab or mental health related.  I chose to treat myself under my right to refuse medical treatment, because we have the right to alternative treatment....we have the right to effective alternative treatment, and again whatever tools, nutrients and supplements we see fit to do so.\n\nI strongly believe that if Kratom is banned, scheduled, or made a pharmaceutical, many people will suffer greatly due to the illegality, or due to the brute airstrip red tape of the medical community making it only accessible to people who have lots of money.  This will not help the situation.\n\nI do believe that we the people can play our part in the opioid epidemic by using Kratom as a supplement to help folks who want to change their lifestyle into something healthier, and more positive. It works for me and from what I have been researching, it has helped for tjousands of years and continues to do so today.  Not only has supplementing with Kratom help manage my pains and suffering, it has also helped me have a very positive energy and attitude when exercising and trying to reach new personal bests and lift maxes.  I feel that it is quite safer than many things that sales people try to pedal to the fitness community at GNC and Vitamin world.\n\nI am against drugs and I want no part in them.  However, Kratom, which in my experience is milder than 5 hour energy, and coffee, and Tylenol PM, and alcohol, and many other things that are perfectly legal, it is not a dangerous addictive drug in my heart and in my humble opinion.\n\nKratom has helped people all across the globe as an alternative, safe, natural herbal supplement.  It has helped bring peace to many and has had a very positive, sobering effect on my life too.\n\nI do believe in responsible Kratom use, proper, safe labeling and advertising, quality and purity control, no additives of other substances, and age regulating Kratom just like many other supplements are presently.  Responsibility and self control are important with everything in this world.\n\nThank you again.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3135","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dustin Batt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Prohibition of novel plants and their compounds for which the pharmacology is unknown is a detriment not only to the scientific community but to America as a whole.

Being so young I thought the doctors would know what was best for me. I was put on hydrocodone 7.5 mg 3 times daily and soma 350 mg twice daily I believe was the dosage. After about 6 months the pain killers stopped working so I went back to the doctor and was prescribed a higher dose 10 Mg. I didn't know it at the time but now my body was addicted to it so about 6 months later those stopped working and I tell the doctor again and he says there is nothing he can do but to go see a pain management doctor and all he did was give me cortisone injections in my back which only seemed to work for about a week. So I took it upon myself to up the dosage I figured an extra one every now and then when I was in severe pain wouldn't hurt I'd just cut back on the days I didn't need to take 3 anyways I battled this for about 3 more years then finally the doctor raised my dose to 6 times a day which was fine but I was already ready to stop having to take all the pills everyday. When I tried to stop my body just wanted more and more it made me sick for 3 days then I couldn't take it anymore so I started taking them again then I heard about kratom and it has completely changed my life. It got me off all of the prescription drugs I was taking and now I only have to take kratom when my back severely hurts.

I was 20 years old and had just cold turkey quit a heroin habit. I have used it off and on since then to deal with the enormous amounts of anxiety that come after a life without heroin. I used to be very ashamed of the fact that I needed Kratom,  I didn't want to need a crutch.  I refused to have any help when it came to getting clean besides my incredible support from my family. I probably should have not been so stubborn but my point is, it was out of severe desperation and being home bound from anxiety that I found Kratom. Now when I think back, Kratom was a really important part to the puzzle. I currently own a successful online business.  I love my job at a legal software company and am recently happily engaged to be married. I am proud of where I am today. Please don't make it even harder for people that are in the situation I was to turn their life around. Especially when there are things like suboxone and methadone that just add to the problem. Your brain needs to heal and you have to re learn everything after getting clean. Kratom allows you to do that unlike these other alternatives. I would not consider them alternatives, however. And lastly I just want to comment on my experience stopping Kratom after long use. It wasn't pleasant but I would compare  it to what it felt like when I stopped drinking coffee. Anyone who has been through opiate addiction or has seen a loved on go through it understands the magic and importance of Kratom. By making it illegal you will be a part of this awful history of an opiate epidemic in our country. Be the part in  history that helped turn this bull shit around. \n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18368","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a mom who has struggled with depression, anxiety, and unexplained fatigue intermittently since adolescence.

I've never had an issue with opiates or alcohol. Last year I was diagnosed with depression and I was wary of becoming another long term prescription medicine patient. Instead of opting for anti-depressants I decided to alter my lifestyle and diet. Along the way I overheard a podcast discussing the medicinal value of Kratom. I decided to do a little research and find out more. I was a little wary after discovering it had been a mainstay in treating opiate addiction. I wasn't sure how a plant alone could do this Since it was a herbal remedy I decided to give it a shot and see how my body would react. My first experience was such a relief. Id been worried it would be too strong for me or alter my consciousness like Vicodin had done after my wisdom teeth. But this plant only offered a light pleasant feeling. Similar to my first cup of coffee in the morning. However, it lasted several hours. This light pleasant feeling of wellness. After months of taking Kratom daily I feel its safe to say that my depression has been treated. My work life is great again. My family life is better than it has been in years! All from a cup of tea. How can this be a threat to the health of America?

Long story short, eventually I was diagnosed with degenerative disk disease, with serious issues in my cervical and lumbar spine.  Some were pinched nerve roots, while others were discs bulging into the central canal pinching the spinal cord.  After treating the pain with opiates for 12 years, I eventually was able to have various surgeries from a cervical fusion between C3-C6, a lumbar fusion at L5-S1, a bilateral cervical decompression at C7 and a bilateral lumbar decompression at L5-S1.  \n\nFor pain management, I was taking 3 Percocets a day, and experiencing life thru a constant opiate haze.  Fortunately, I was still able to hold down a job as an IT developer/manager despite this state of mind, but was concerned that my limited productivity from the opiate haze would end my career.  Two years ago, I discovered kratom.  I stopped taking opiates cold turkey without withdrawal symptoms by managing pain with Kratom.  I have been experiencing life with a clear head from that day forward.  This has saved my sanity, my career and my 24-year relationship with my wife.\n\nThe disinformation surrounding Kratom is dis-heartening, and banning the one tool that many people have found useful in their personal fight against the opiate epidemic based on dis-information is unbelievable.  Basing this decision on anything less than sound controlled scientific experiments would be harmful and deadly to those who have finally got their lives back due to kratom.  I honestly believe by banning kratom, you would be killing many of those you are trying to protect.

I wish I could speak without silence. However, I am an officer in the United States Military, likewise, a physician that holds a DEA license to prescribe schedule II and lower medication ,and this medication is guilty by association because it has been found in the past in the same places as spice.  I can tell you hold-heartedly that kratom is no different than your cup of coffee. In the past I have had behavior issues (ADHD) and anxiety.  As time has passed, the sitting and standing in contorted positions in the workplace has done a number on my back and knees. I am tired of poisoning my kidneys and liver with NSAIDS and tylenol to get through my day. I had no interest to become a slave to big pharma narcotics and wasn't allowed to join the cult of medical marijuana do to my job. Which never sat right with me anyway. What I have noticed with this substance is I no longer drink coffee, nor do I drink alcohol, and I do not think I have ever more \"even keel\" as I am now. It is safe, almost self-regulating. you consume too much you vommit and you don't feel like any for a few days. If you decide to mix with alcohol you will projectile vommit. when discontinuing after a long period of use. It's like quitting cofffee. You don't feel right, but you can still work without consequence.  Reaction times are not decreased, and if anything, you have greater focus. Pretty much, drinking coffee without being jittery, with the added benefit of equal analgesia of taking 800mg motrin and 500mg tylenol. Oh wait, thats right, it's related to the coffee plant. hmmm I don't see you trying to regulate bayer aspirin, JnJ,  or SBUX. So why why would you want to take something away that can help people live normal lives, gives them green anti-oxidants, and much less heptotoxic and nephrotoxic than your OTC's? Don't hate what you don't understand. Moreover, the science looks promising. and finally there will always be people that ruin a good thing. Everything is a drug/substance that can hurt you if taken in excess. This is includes oxygen, food vitamins and even water.

It has enabled me to entirely quit & STAY AWAY FROM harmful & expensive prescription drugs such as SSRI, anxiolytics, hypnotics, cigarettes & alcohol.\n\nI tried the doctor route more than once. I was prescribed anti-depressants, anxyolitics, hypnotics. They made me fat, apathetic and unproductive. Quitting them was distressful, with over a MONTH of withdrawal problems each time. I didn't feel normal again for an ENTIRE YEAR during my last try. As someone with real life experience..the withdrawal symptoms literally start 24 hours after your last dose with SSRI pills...1-2 days for any of the other psych drugs I've been prescribed. I was mentally useless for WEEKS. I could not continue in life in the state that these drugs put me in, or the state I was in after eliminating them. Once I was finally able to eliminate them..crushing depression set in again, likely exacerbated by the removal of these exact legally prescribed medications. As I no longer had access to a doctor at this stage, I was desperate for some kind of relief & tried Kratom. It gradually enabled me to cope with life again. Kratom is indeed helpful daily, but it is not ever a requirement for life. I can go without Kratom at any time, for several days, with only mild tiredness expected for about one day afterward..similar to when I quit regularly consuming coffee. The key point is that there are no \"brain shocks\", physical distress, mental distress, rebound depression, or desperation. Again it's truly no more affect on my function than a couple of lattes daily from starbucks, but it costs far less money & it's not 1,000 empty calories.\n\nIt is not alcohol, not marijuana, not addictive or dependence-causing antidepressant & antianxiety pills. It's not even coffee, it's not energy drinks. From a personal account, caffeine is more addictive & has greater adverse affects on me. Such as headaches, irritability, anxiety,& dental problems. This is real life experience, not conjecture. It's necessary to point out that there are no real case studies of anyone dying or being permanently harmed from Kratom use. There is a case of liver damage, from a man who consumed other substances concurrently & excessively: https://livertox.niddk.nih.gov/Home/ReferenceCases/kratom. Kava Kava was also consumed, which IS KNOWN to cause liver damage. It's a flawed & incomplete report that is certainly not enough evidence to ban any of the substances involved.\n\nKratom is a real, live, plant, that any human should be free to ingest or not ingest. It's almost laughable to an educated man that marijuana can be legally purchased, but Kratom is under consideration to be illegal. This is not an analogue to \"bath salts\", or \"fake marijuana\", or even in that category. These substances aren't even in the same universe as Kratom. If those that are uneducated about the plant & completely inexperienced in valid real-life use & positive effects slam the door shut on this option, myself & many others will be forced to seek out other, potentially illegal & addictive means to combat mental problems. I DON'T WANT SSRI PILLS. They only cause distress & despair for me, my family, my friends, and many others. Clearly, educated & experienced people don't always want pills. They want choice. Free choice. What this whole nation is supposed to be founded on. Kratom may not be 100% healthy. Nothing is! Energy drinks can shut down your liver: http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/11/04/energy-drinks-destroy-liver_n_12798568.html Should these also be illegal because one man lacked common sense? People will always find a way to abuse any substance that is beneficial as a whole.\n\nPills prescribed by a doctor--when the doctor is not aware of the long-term effects--with the individual's long-term well-being often not in mind--should not be blindly sanctified. Conversely a natural plant where the positive effects cast a large shadow on the negative should not be vilified for no quantifiable reason. It's about a choice. We need to maintain our freedom to make choices on how to best deal with our health problems as individuals.\n\nI sincerely like to believe that these comments are read, cataloged, & taken into real account. I dread the thought that they are collected merely as a procedural formality before many peoples lives are be made even more difficult.  A ban on this plant should not even be under consideration. Realize that there currently are no better or economical options for what Kratom can do to alleviate many mental problems. We that use it are doing just fine, thank you. Please, please do not actively work to make our lives harder?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4407","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Until you have HARD PROOF that Kratom is more dangerous than alcohol, you should leave it alone.

I am a 22 year old Psychology student at Kennesaw State University. I believe that there is little to no evidence that supports the DEA's banning of Kratom. \n\nI began using Kratom about 2 years ago and my life has been on an upward trend since then. I suffer from many emotional issues ranging from depression and anxiety to symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder. Overall however, I consider myself to be a very self-aware individual. I recognize that I have patterns and habits that can take-over my healthy functioning. I am lucky in that I have never turned to hard substances to cope with these feelings, however some are not quite as lucky as I. I have found Kratom to be one of the most helpful tools in my arsenal. When I feel myself becoming overwhelmed, kratom gives me the opportunity to relax and not break down into negative feedback cycles. Kratom is a tool to help those in pain both physically and emotionally. It allows those struggling with addiction to opioids to find a release without having to sacrifice their sobriety. \n\nKratom has helped me get my life back on track, I went from failing out of college twice to being a straight 'A' student. I regularly attend therapy and am able to actively push my life in a positive direction. Kratom is in no way worthy of a schedule 1 controlled substance label; it is simply a tea life that has been used for thousands of years to positively impact the community surrounding it.To take this substance away is to condemn a community of individuals to a much harder lives than is necessary.

I broke my foot six years ago which made it very hard on me to return to school and work. I went through physical therapy, pain management, many tests and nerve medications before having to stop due to finances. I just dealt with the pain but in the worst way possible. I quit school and work to stay at home and train in 3D modeling. I eventually had to pick up a server position and it was dreadful. Then I discovered kratom and it helped me get through my shifts. I no longer dread going to work or outside. I would have never been able to get my life back on track if kratom was not available over the counter. Kratom has and will stimulate the economy in the United States if kept legal by creating jobs . Mitragnia Speciosa has had positive impacts on hundreds of thousands American lives. Everyday, hard working people who seemed to have exhausted all other options when trying to find solutions and cures to their ailments look to kratom for relief. Ailments which, in some cases, where only made worse and added to their suffering when pharmaceutical drugs were prescribed. How can the DEA justify banning yet another medicinal plant before having ample research, tests and experiments done first? A plant which has been used for 1000's of years should be studied and used for the betterment of mankind, not tucked away to be forgotten while the current state of suffering from opiate addiction, anti-depressants, ADHD and many other disorders are only made worse with pharmaceutical medicines.  If anything should be illegal, it's alcohol, cigarettes, sugar, preservatives and fatty foods. All of these items cause death from either diseases and/or cancers,. The two leading causes of death in the United States are heart disease, and cancer with emphysema coming in third. Diabetes is number seven on the death list yet diabetes doesn't have to kill to destroy lives.\n Kratom has a natural failsafe that keeps people from overdosing by inducing vomiting or falling asleep after ingesting too much. Kratom is a safe plant that can be consumed directly from the ground without ever being processed or having chemicals added. \nPeople with addictive personalities are going to abuse substances whether kratom is or isn't illegal. Why ban a substance which helps stop drug abuse in the name of stopping drive abuse? Making kratom illegal will not keep people from buying and using it, but instead increase crime, arrests, and incarceration rates all the while tear families apart who can't afford to buy their way out. An increase in money from tickets and fees imposed on the people will go to the government. Instead of federally banning a helpful and medicinal plant in a misguided attempt to protect abusers who can't control themselves, a system of regulations can be implemented to purchase the stronger, more concentrated forms of kratom.  Regular powdered kratom should be available without a license, while stronger extracts should have certain safety restrictions and purchase limits. Vendors should have to obtain kratom dispensary licenses to ensure responsible dispersion practices. We even have working models with marijuana dispensaries proving the regulation success and the stimulation of economy.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20971","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bekah Terrell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I used to be addicted to methamphetamine, kratom helped me get past that.

After I made the decision to kick my addiction, I was left with the chronic pain and suffering that led me to the addiction in the first place. Then I found Kratom. While I am not a daily consumer, I know firsthand the hearing benefits this all natural plant can have. It stops my chronic pain in its tracks. It doesn't leave me foggy or sick, it doesn't leave my respiratory system in chaos. It calms. It helps. By scheduling this natural alternative therapy into a schedule I drug, you are taking away our rights to treat our physical ailments with alternative therapies. Kratom has been used worldwide for milenia as an adjunct therapy to help dozens and dozens of physical ailments. Unlike heroin or LSD, Kratom doesn't cause you to lose your house, your job, or your zest for life. Kratom simply is an acceptable alternative, natural therapy to assist a person to leading a full, healthy life. Kratom deserves to have the chance to be scientifically studied, and the people deserve to have access to all natural therapies while treating their physical conditions.  Please do not schedule Kratom into a schedule I; the ramifications of that action could be detrimental to a society plagued by opiate addiction. Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5731","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I want to ask the DEA not to ban kratom without doing more research.

This simply must not happen. This plant is not some illicit substance that gangs are fighting wars over (until you ban it and they add it to their drug trade). It is not a drug that people are abusing to any extent such as alchohol or prescription pain killers. Thousands upon thousands of American citizens use this herb for several purposes. Be it relief of pain, a stimulant to help them through the work day much like coffee (Kratom is in the same family as coffee) and even enhances mood allowing people that have a difficult time socializing with other people to do just that. You argue that this plant is a dangerous substance with no medicinal basis but if that were true you would not have had thousands of people argue against your claims, even going as far as contacting the white house for support against your ban. Alcohol in the form of beer and whiskey has no medicinal grounds and kills many American lives a year. Tobacco has no medicinal grounds and is another killer of many American lives every year. Yet we the people see no effort from the DEA to stop these poisons that have plagued our country for hundreds of years. You wage war on drugs and cannot even stop the trade of drugs you have been warring against for decades now, using hundreds of thousands of our tax dollars only to bring little to no results. You know you are failing in this and so you target users of substances that have little to no effect on the over all function of American society as a whole. You demonize these plants, and throw their users in prisons along side child molesters, rapists, murderers and terrorist. The American people are tired of watching you wage wars against what you consider to be drugs, only for you to allow big pharm to generate hundreds of new addicts per year to prescriptions. You stomp on Kratom as if it were destroying our nation but you and everyone else knows that is not true. Ask the people locked up for robbery if they were robbing their victims to buy Kratom. I can tell you now, having worked in a law enforcement capacity for years, that is never the case. Crack Cocaine, Meth, and several other hard drugs plague our communities and cost not only the lives of their users but the victims of the users as well. You have done little to aide us, the law abiding citizens, the law enforcement community, the public that pays our taxes to fund your department. Yet you want to schedule another harmless plant to your drug list just to take eyes off of your failures in fighting the drugs that are destroying our nation. \n\nYou have an opportunity here and now to back out of this foolish crusade against Kratom, that is no doubt instigated by big pharm because people are leaving their addictions to narcotics for a natural treatment with Kratom. Do not make fools of yourselves and put a target on hundreds of thousands of law abiding citizens that choose to treat themselves with Kratom over poison from the pharmacy. Just stand down, focus on the real problems that your agency needs to be focused on. Help law enforcement rid this country of the meth, of the cocaine, of the illegal pain pills. Let us, the citizens of the United States of America, choose to treat ourselves with Kratom over alcohol, over pain pills, over coffee. That is our right. We have the freedom of choice but when you do things like this you limit our choices to poison A or poison B. You are here to serve the people, not rule over us and dictate what we can and cannot do. Let each State decide if Kratom is right for it. Your agency is already experiencing the backlash on marijuana and kratom will be no different. You should be fighting the drug lords crippling our communities with heroin and other drugs that have been proven harmful - not waging war with innocent people that choose herbal medicine over pills and alcohol. Take the time to ask yourself \"how is this going to help the nation, who does this harm and most of all does this support or violate peoples rights under the constitution\" and if you give yourselves an honest answer I believe you will turn your focus from Kratom and help the people rather than dictate what they do.\n\nI know my message is only a small voice in the vast majority but if you listen to the message as a whole the words all sound the same. DO NOT BAN KRATOM!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6684","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Millergren","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a recovering drug addict and kratom may have very well saved my life.

Generalized anxiety and ADHD are just 2 of them.  The third and most debilitating was the skin picking (OCD like) disorder that I suffered through for 15-20 years of my life!\n   \n      For over 15 I had a SEVERE acne skin picking disorder from my teenage years through my mid 30s.  I was physically unable to leave my face alone.  And of course I tried many different treatments including 3 rounds of Acutane.  I would squeeze and pick at my acne until my face was permanently full of bloody, scabbed, and puss filled legions.   I attempted to cover it all up with makeup, which just made it that much worse (gross) and umm yeah, I'm a guy....   If you saw what I looked like or had any idea of how I suffered you would feel for me, you would cry.   It was atrocious.  I was a hermit  and was suicidal.   \n\n        In 2008 I spent a year in specialized intensive behavioral therapy,  (which cost 10 thousand dollars) and tried numerous different types of RX medications and drugs including Paxil, Prozac, Effexor, Xanax, Clonazepam, Valium, and Marijuana to attempt to rid me of this behavior; yet it was all in vain.  That was until I found Kratom.\n\n       Not only did my use of Kratom enable me to COMPLETELY STOP my skin picking disorder, it also rid me of the depression and anxiety that went along with it.  It was a blessing from G-d.  Kratom literally saved my life!  Both psychologically and physically.  It also came with almost zero side effects (diminished libido).   \n\n      I was able to stop using the Kratom over the course of 3 weeks with no withdrawal symptoms whatsoever.   \n\n      Currently I use Kratom on and off to combat my ADD.  It enables me to focus and concentrate on both menial and complex tasks.  I am astonished that drugs like Ritalin , and Adderall are even legal to prescribe when there is a natural alternative with no side effects.  \n\n     Thank you so much for listening.    \n\nSincerely,\nChad","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18969","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chad Lewis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is amazing","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10736","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thaddeus Zitsch","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have a friend that has been battling addiction to opioids and herion.

Literally no cravings, in fact on the rare occasion when they have had a drink - kratom seems to have changed the way it interacts with their body chemistry.  All I know is that their lives have improved because of kratom.  I've been using it for 3 years and have had ZERO ill-effects.  Absolutely no side effects that I've noticed.

There were days that I was stuck on the couch as the pain from moving was just too much. \nEven with opiate pain medications, this was my life. \nAfter 6 years of taking opiate pain medications to help me function, I started researching alternate methods of pain relief. Being a huge skeptic of holistic and alternate medications/treatments I was pretty skeptical when I stumbled upon a forum discussing Kratom. In addition to skepticism I was also, desperate. Desperate for relief, desperate to cut my dependency on narcotic pain pills. So in my desperation, I put aside my skepticism and started really researching Kratom. \nI studied the chemical make-up of Kratom, what it was, where it's native to, the statistics on health and safety, even watched dozens upon dozens of YouTube videos in which users would stream their experience while taking, immediately after, and while experiencing the effects of Kratom. Everything was positive. I thought it too good to be true, but thought I'd give it a try.\nImmediately  after my first dose, I experienced the effects I had been reading about for months. My pain was minimal, my mood was uplifted, I had energy (similar to what coffee does.)\nThe following day, I dosed again. My fiance and I ventured out to enjoy some outdoor activities, per our normal weekend. After about an hour, my fiance looks at me and says \"you haven't complained about your back all day\". All of a sudden it hit me, I WAS PAIN FREE! It not only minimized my pain, but it effectively got rid of it! My eyes instantly filled with tears of joy. I realized in that moment that my life was about to change. Not only was I pain free for the first time in years, but I felt none of the negative side-effects that accompany opiate medications. Opiate medications strongly impact your emotional state, making the user either angry/sad. Usually it's pretty extreme. I felt only contentment with Kratom.\nA year and a half later I continue to use Kratom as my ONLY source for pain relief. I was immediately able to stop taking the pain pills, which to be honest I had become 100% addicted to and dependent on. Day one of taking Kratom and I never had to take another one. \nMost importantly, my children's lives have improved immensely! They now have a fully functioning mom and a dad with much less stress (from having to do almost everything).\nI can't imagine my life without Kratom. Just the thought of having to return to pain pills is gut wrenching to me and my family.\nThis is only a tiny snap shot into what Kratom has done for me and my family and I'm confident that you will not take this life saving plant away from us. \nI'm a responsible adult and have a right to choose how to manage my own conditions. \nThank you for taking the time to read my testimony.\nSincerely, \nSara Hough","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4814","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sara Hough","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a daily Kratom user, I use it to help with arthritis, anxiety and restless legg at night,  I discovered Kratom while trying to kick pain pills, I got heavily addicted to pain pills to the point it almost bankrupted me, Kratom pretty much saved me, withdrawals from pain pills is like having the flu times 10, and believe me I didn't wake up one day and decide to become addicted to pain meds, so I started looking for a natural way to get off them, Kratom did the trick, and I discovered it helped with other health issues too, and the best part  of Kratom is there is NO buzz, I can take it throughout the day without any side effects, I have seen Kratom help so many people, I had a friend of mine trying to get off of suboxone and it helped her thru some nasty withdrawals, I am for keeping Kratom legal!! \n\nSincerely \nMonica Rhodus","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17026","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Monica Rhodus","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a nurse in the ICU and I have used Kratom regularly for almost three years now.

I started using kratom about 3 months ago after finding a package of it in my adult son's room (he has had multiple back surgeries and spinal fusion and is still in chronic sometimes debilitating pain) and being curious as to what it was and what it was used for I researched the literature on it and the fact that it was very low on the addictive and overdose potential scale.  I had been on Tramadol, Neurontin,  Tylenol and Motrin for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis pain and had still been waking up stiff and spent most of my day in chronic severe pain.  After I researched its risk vs benefit potential I asked my son if he thought it would help me and he said he thought it might and helped me figure out what vein I should be taking, how much, and when.  I am very afraid of the addiction potential of the Tramadol I had been taking and was anxious to avoid if at all possible.  Since starting the kratom I have had an improvement in my sleep because I don't wake up in pain from my joints, I have been able to quit the Tramadol completely, and I feel better during the day because of the lack of pain in my daily activities.  I think it should remain available as I believe it is not as addictive, dangerous, or expensive as the opiate and opioid alternatives for me personally.  \n\nMy alternative is to start using marijuana as it has just become legal for medical use in my state and with the red tape and expense of finding a doctor to prescribe it and then obtaining it I believe for me it is a much better alternative to the cannabis or opiate/opioid alternatives. \n\nwww.sagewisdom.org/kratomguide.html","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4877","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Suellen Jones","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nIn accordance with the American ethos, I do not believe any substance including Kratom should be banned without substantial scientific  evidence of harm.

Luckily, I usually don't get panic attacks more than 10 or so times a year. I also experience generalized anxiety throughout the year. Kratom is a cure for all of my symptoms with no withdrawal or negative side effects.\nIf I'm feeling a panic attack, I drink down 5 grams of a red strain kratom and within 5-15 minutes, it diminishes. With general anxiety, I take 2-3 grams and experience the same relief. I love how it's non addictive.  Sometimes I don't have anxiety at all for a couple months at a time, so there's no need to take it. But when the anxiety surfaces, it's there to save the day. \nI have been treated with Xanax prior to discovering kratom. It worked extremely well, but made me feel \"pill drunk\" and dopey. I would have issues with concentration while on it and it made me not want to take it unless I absolutely had to. I also feared addiction to it since it's well documented that all benzos are highly addictive. Since anxiety runs in my family, I know a few family members that have been heavily addicted to benzos and it is not pretty. \n\nMy brother got taken off klonopin after being prescribed to it for over a decade because he got addicted and was abusing it. He suffered immensely from anxiety and was on disability because of it. When he was taken off, it ruined him. He is now dead from an overdose of fentanyl that he used to self medicate. \nIn conclusion, I and a few others that I know that use kratom do so with great success. I don't know a single person who is addicted to it. I know people who use it as an anti anxiety, and others who take it in place of prescription pain killers. The last thing we should do is schedule this plant. It should be embraced and researched further! Kratom can without a doubt benefit human kind. With the amount of people out there who are suffering from mental illness, this can be a life saver for many. Please please PLEASE do not outlaw this substance. I assure you that with adequate research, you will find that it is not only completely safe, but a great and effective means to treat a multitude of medical symptoms.

I was looking for natural stress relief and this was something I stumbled upon. As someone with no experience using herbs or any substance with such a unique activity profile, kratom was quite foreign to me, yet fascinating at the same time. I chose to pass at the time, but continued to research. I carefully weighed the pros and cons for well over a year. Once I was able to filter through the media hype and marketing jargon, and determine that kratom was something I could experiment with safely, I took the plunge. \n\n7 years later, I use kratom along with other natural supplements as needed. It's amazing for stress relief, but also provides clean, gentle energy that comes in handy on those long grueling days when I need a kick in the rear end. I run two businesses and kratom helps me stay motivated and focused without the crash or nasty side effects so common of synthetic prescription drugs. Not only is kratom effective, it's safe, which is very important to me. Each year, the report from my annual physical comes back with a healthy heart, stable blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and \"rockstar blood pressure\", as my doctor likes to say. \n\nKratom has been an amazing supplement for me personally, but even more of a miracle for others. I've met quite a few people whose quality of life has changed for the better thanks to this herb. People suffering from chronic pain and other severe ailments that wouldn't be able to function without it. Kratom's medicinal value is crystal clear and it possibly has even greater potential yet to be explored. For these reasons I strongly urge the FDA, DEA, and anyone who has a say on this matter to not schedule or restrict kratom, but instead invest more time and resources in to discovering what more it has to offer. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3276","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Contel Bradford","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Over 100,000 Americans signed a petition (including myself) to halt the DEAs two-year ban on kratom.

It clearly helps at least 100,000 manage their pain in an era where taking any type of opioid is completely taboo. People with pain matter. Completely blocking access to kratom will have a direct impact on those who responsibly take pain medications to deal with a chronic medical issue.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the DEA to halt the ban until further studies can be performed. I believe that I represent the majority of patients with chronic pain who use opioids. We are responsible and educated. Yes, there is an opioid epidemic in this country. However, taking away a natural supplement that could replace an opioid as pain management doesnt make any sense.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20214","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathan Nagel","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Wes King.

I am 24 years old and currently employed and looking to go back to school to become a counselor. I first heard about kratom in May when visiting a friend in Kansas. He had some with him that he used for pain and he told me that he also heard it helped for anxiety as well. Since I was a sufferer of generalized anxiety disorder myself, I decided to give it a try. Not once, since that time, have I had a negative experience with kratom or anything that would make me consider stopping use of it. \n\nIt has helped me immensely with both anxiety, depression, back pain/headaches and adhd. My family has noticed big changes in my life. I have a much more positive outlook on a daily basis and worry about things much less than I used to - especially things outside of my control. This easing of my mental state allows me to focus on what is truly important such as my family, my friends, my work, and my hobbies. I play tennis and lift weights actively and kratom eases my pain enough to where I can do these activities a lot more than it used to.\n\nI do currently use kratom daily but I am quite responsible about it and have a rotation schedule of certain strains (all with a different mix of alkaloids) so that I do not develop a tolerance. Anyone who claims to have withdrawal symptoms from kratom has probably used it incredibly irresponsibly. And even if they do have withdrawals, its probably similar to coming off caffeine as kratom is a relative of the coffee plant. I've taken several week long breaks from kratom while on vacation and had no withdrawal symptoms or cravings whatsoever. It is therefore not something I need in my life, but something that helps my life greatly if I have it. \n\nI am absolutely one hundred and ten percent against the kratom and its alkaloid constituents becoming schedule 1 since it has improved my life and millions of other Americans lives across the country, particularly those suffering mental health issues, chronic pain issues, and our veterans. Kratom needs to stay legal since nobody has ever died from it that we know of (similar to pot) - the only cases being where someone took several other drugs at the same time, often many of these being much more dangerous than kratom - suboxone, etc. More research needs to be done on kratom in order to find out more of its benefits and protect us from the possible downsides of kratom use. If it is made schedule one, none of this will be possible. No research, no benefits. Our country is a mess right now and so many are suffering. To take away another natural plant that helps so many lead a healthier, more positive and balanced life is criminal. Please hear us out and keep this plant legal. I'm all for pharmaceutical companies making their own drugs from kratom's alkaloids - just don't make the plant itself illegal! Those who would rather take the plant alone should have that choice. It is one of our unalienable rights as a human being born on earth. \n\nIn conclusion, I am completely against kratom being made illegal. Kratom has changed my life for the better - allowing me to be more productive in my work and social life, and allowing me to feel more at peace with both myself and the world. Please give this god-given plant a chance and do the proper research before banning it. All people suffering greatly in this country will thank you kindly for it.\n\n I would link to research and other important articles but I'm sure everyone who has already commented has got that covered. Again, thanks for hearing me out. #KEEPKRATOMLEGAL #KRATOMSAVESLIVES #JUSTATEALEAF\n\nAll the best,\nMike\n\nP.S. I personally drink my kratom in tea form. I normally brew an energizing strain in the morning with some lemon and mango juice (as a replacement for a caffeine) and then a relaxing strain in the evening with some honey to ease anxiety and aide in sleep.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9782","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe the potential banning of Kratom would not serve anyone as there is not sufficient proof that it could be dangerous.

In fact I not only think it would be overzealous to put Kratom on Schedule 1, it would also be a disservice to the American people. We have the god given right to use and study a natural, un altered compound, plain and simple. The DEA should be familiar with the disastrous side effects of opiate addiction which shatters families, communities, and our spirit as a nation. We should be able to employ any and all safe and natural alternatives to opiates that are available to help ease this epidemic.

Furthermore, I have personally used Kratom to ease my own issues with anxiety and have found it to be of great relief when used properly. \n\nIn conclusion, I would urge the DEA to consider the voice of the people and the changing tide of opinion on a number of schedule 1 substances.

I have published several major reviews and commentaries on the topic.    In my publications I highlighted the medical potential of kratom and kratom-derived drugs, but I also noted the important questions regarding the safety and efficacy of kratom for the treatment of pain and opioid addiction.   From my analyses, I am firmly convinced that the medical potential is too great to ignore and that the safety risks may have been over-stated.  Recent studies from Asia have provided compelling evidence that, in its pure herbal for form, kratom may be a safe and effective option for treatment of pain and opioid addiction.   At there same time, the is increasing evidence that many of the reports of adverse resulting from \"kratom\" use in US have involved confounding factors, particular multiple drug use.   In addition, several recent studies suggest that many products being sold as \"kratom\" in the USA are actually adulterated with other drugs.   I am convinced that kratom itself is a relative safe and and shows considerable potential as an alternative to opioids for management of pain and addiction. However, well controlled clinical trials are needed to clarify these issues.  At the same time, there are valid concern about the safety and purity of products being sold under the name of kratom. The problem is that lack of regulation regarding the production, standardization and sale of kratom products.   Moving kratom Schedule 1 status will stifle important research.   It is my sincere hope, there must be some way to regulate production and quality of kratom without banning it.

It does help to take away pain and discomfort caused by pain, and I have met numerous people who have told me that they take kratom for back pain. Some of these same people were prescribed opiates by their doctor's for years, many of them were both physically and mentally addicted to these opiate drugs, and then, they found kratom. Not only did the Kratom allow them to not experience withdrawal from their prescribed opiate medication but also had the positive effect of taking away their pain and discomfort, but yet, did not give them the drowsy narcotic feeling that their medication did.It literally gave them their lives back. Many of these people have told me how astounded they were at how well the plant Kratom worked to take away their pain but did not leave them with any of the negative side effects that the prescribed opiates had given them, and even more astounded that they did not experience any kind of withdrawal from their medication and even furthermore that if they happened to miss a dose of their kratom, they did not experience any withdrawal symptoms, or at the very least, suffered from a runny nose and some sneezing. Which leads me to my next point. In a time like this, where we are experiencing one of the biggest opiate epidemic's that this nation has ever seen, why in the world would anybody want to take away one the safest and most effective tools in helping to fight this epidemic? Kratom is known for being able to relieve or completely take away withdrawal from opiate's and then once the user has fully converted to kratom use, after as little as 30 days, they can either go \"cold turkey\" or ween down pretty dramatically from their kratom dosage and be completely drug free. Kratom has for literally thousands of years, allowed opiate user's to come off of opiate use pretty easily, without withdrawal. There are drugs such as suboxone and methadone that are prescribed to opiate addicts that just end up making the addict addicted to that drug then, instead of the drug they were already using, and now they cannot come off of either their suboxone or methadone without withdrawaling notto mention the mental cravings that they will have for anywhere to 6 months to a year after ceasing use. But with Kratom they can literally be completely non-dependent with no withdrawal symptoms or cravings within 30 days. Kratom is safe...if you take too much, you vomit, you get a little dizzy, and that's it. Any of the reported \"deaths\" from kratom that have been published, there were also numerous other drugs found in the blood of the deceased. I've done the research, if you don't believe me, please look it up. Also, what I find crazy is that in comparison, acetaminophen accounts for the leading cause for Poison Control Center calls each year, estimated at about 100,000 a year, more than 56,000 E.R. visits, 2,600 hospitalization's and 458 deaths a year due to acute liver failure...but yet you can go and buy Tylenol and other acetaminophen products at almost any store in the United States, yet one of the reason's for the kratom scheduling was cited as 660 Poison Center calls over a 5 year period for \"kratom intoxication\", that being kratom overdose as previously mentioned causing nausea and dizziness....that equates to about 110 calls a year. It seems pretty easily assumed that kratom in comparison to acetaminophen is far less dangerous, and in my personal opinion, it is also works far more better at doing what it is supposed to, relieving pain. It almost seems like a \"no-brainer\" that Kratom should be kept off the Scheduled drug list and remain legal in the United States. Thank you for your time, and thank you for this opportunity for my comment. Please keep kratom legal.

It hurt to eat it hurts to walk any kind of movement made me in bad pain. Now when I get up in the morning, I take a spoonful of Kratom and within 15 minutes my pain is almost totally gone. Kratom has allowed me to once again become a productive member of society. I do not look forward to the day it becomes illegal. I have not found any medicine that works this good. So I asked the DEA ,\" Please drop the kratom ban.\" Kratom does not get me high, neither does it make me do things that I would not do otherwise. To say that Kratom has no medicinal value is a flat out lie. My sister suffers from fibromyalgia. One day I got her to try kratom, and it immediately relieved all of her symptoms. She only tried it two months ago. Now with the possibility of Kratom being banned, she won't buy any for fear that she will get in trouble.  this all natural herbal supplement helps people. As with any substance, it can be abused. You cannot overdose on kratom, because it will make you throw up the overdose amount of Kratom you have taken. If you take too much it will make you feel sick. The only reason why people have taken too much and feared that they overdosed,  is because the FDA will not allow Kratom vendors to tell you what dosage you should take. So the FDA is really responsible for people that have gotten sick from taking too much kratom. it's not Kratom fault, and it's not the vendors fault, it is the FDA and the laws fault.

I'm 35 years old. I'm a professional artist by trade and I live in sunny Florida. I suffer from chronic pain and depression, all my life. Last year it got so bad that just surviving took all the mental focus & energy I had day to day. I've tried a lot of natural remedies & vitamins, but nothing provided actual relief. I was starting to consider harming myself, ending it all. A friend recommended kratom tea and I knew the first time I tried it that there was something  special about it. It eased my back pain and my depression in a way that nothing else has. I bought a supply and I use a small amount every day to keep me pain free and in a good mood, able to face my work and social life. I recently started getting psychiatric treatment as well, but I still consume kratom almost every day after a year.  I have not developed a tolerance to it.  The same small amount is still just as helpful as the first time.  Nor have I developed a dependence of it.  I go for days sometimes without kratom if I don't  feel a need for it & don't notice any withdrawal symptoms at all.  Its effects are noticable, but not distracting, powerful but not overpowering.  I don't feel at all intoxicated when I take kratom, if anything I'm more alert & present in the world, more myself.  When I heard the news of the DEA wanting to ban kratom I was pretty upset and baffled.  It seems like, if the DEA really wanted to protect the public from harmful drugs, that they'd outlaw the opiates and addictive substances that kratom is such a safe alternative for.  How could anyone in a position of power live with themselves knowing they outlawed something that makes such a positive difference in people's health and happiness? \nPlease open your minds & hearts. Do the right thing.  Keep kratom legal and easy to access for all the people out there trying to make a difference in their lives without turning to expensive drugs that just hurt us in the long run.  The difference between kratom and such drugs is so obvious  that a DEA ban on kratom would only make it obvious that the DEA has some kind of conflict of interest and actually wants people to be hooked on disgusting pain pills.

Nearly 2 years ago a friend recommended that I try kratom to ease pain from degenerative arthritis.  I was initially wary but had almost immediate relief from the pain.  Kratom has been a miracle for me! I do not drink alcohol or use any type of recreational drugs.  Indeed I have tried to stay away from narcotic pain medications entirely.  In nearly 2 years I have had no negative side effects from kratom besides shaky hands on rare occasions.  I am able to care for my daughter and live a satisfying and enjoyable life free from chronic pain.  I have also been able to discontinue antidepressant medications.  I have never felt intoxicated or drugged from kratom.  It does not have that effect.  I find that alcohol, which is legal, has an infinitely greater potential for altering one's mental status.  Kratom has no more effect than drinking a double espresso, but has the benefit of pain relief.  If alcohol and coffee are legal, I can find no reason that kratom should not also be.  It is certainly much more beneficial to me.  \n\nSincerely,\nHeather M.

I find it somewhat relaxing like having a drink or two. I found it took the edge off of the pain but didn't completely suppress it. No constipation or any other bowel issues. It is a somewhat effective alternative to opiates and should not be banned or made illegal. Even in larger doses It is no where nearly as bad as opiates. Case studies should be conducted.

I want you to know that I appreciate the job that you do for our country and I can't even begin to understand the amount of work it takes to pursue the drug related threats to this country.  That being said, I am of the opinion that alkaloids from the M. speciosa plant should not be categorized as a public safety issue, threat, danger etc.\n\nI have been using kratom off and on for about two years now.  My usage fluctuates; sometimes I'll use it daily and sometimes I will go months without using the plant.  I first started using kratom as an alternative to prescription opiates.  I have an allergy to opiates and opioids, and by allergy, I mean that I have a very hard time being able to stop taking them once I start.  I am a recovering addict and my drug of choice is opiates, which I was first prescribed in my teens and to which I spent several years hopelessy addicted to.  After a couple of trips to rehab, lost jobs, significant amounts of money wasted, hopelessness, guilt, shame, frustration and many wrinkles added to the faces of friends of family, I finally realized I could not take a prescription opioid and hope to control  my usage.  Something in me changes when I take opiates, prescribed or not and I cease to be the person I want to be.  An immediate psychic change occurs in which my life, my hopes, dreams, goals, wants and the people that are important to me cease to exist. Eventually, sometimes quickly and sometimes more prolonged, i lose just about everything to the pursuit of finding and using opiates.\n\nI am in recovery and have gotten my life back.  I know that I can not take any type of opiate if I wish to continue living a meaningful life.   However, there are times when I need a pain medicine or sometimes when I want to relax at the end of the day or to cope with a stressful event in my life.  Used to be I would take a pill.  Now I take kratom and I believe it has saved me from going down the dark road to addiction and self destruction.  \n\nI believe that kratom has done many good things for many people as I am one of them.  Trying to place myself in your position, I would look at this plant and ask myself if it is effecting our society, as a whole, in a way that is deleterious or beneficial. Honestly looking at the facts, as removed from a potential bias as I can be, I believe the answer to this question is that the alkaloids from kratom tree help people more than harm them.\n\nI believe that kratom does pose a risk to certain types of people.  I, myself, am one of those people because I have the potential to become addicted to anything.  However, from my experience, it is very difficult to become addicted to this plant.  Yes tolerance develops but the phenomenon of craving is very mild to someone with the same proclivity to opiates as me and much lower to people that have not struggled with addiction.  It is also important to restrict the access of kratom to minors.  It should not be sold at gas stations or as extracts available as '5 hour energy' shots. Kratom needs to be legal but its sale to minors must be stopped.\n\n I think that with both sides of this kratom debate attempting to see the arguments of the opposing side, we can reach a decision that everyone can support.  If you continue to pursue to have this plant classified as a schedule I drug then you can expect recovering addicts like myself to die unnecessarily, millions of people who use this plant as an alternative to traditional pharmacology will be made into criminals and there will be untold millions of dollars wasted in our court systems and by our law enforcement agencies.  The only winners will be big pharma and for-profit prisons while the real danger to society,  the criminal enterprises that produce, traffic and sell actual harmful drugs will have more freedom to operate because the DEA will be wasting resources criminalizing the use of kratom.  I believe you know what the right decision is and and I hope, and want to believe, that you will have the courage make that decision.\n\nThank you for listening,\nMichael L\nBirmingham, AL","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21090","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael L","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello.

I was diagnosed with renal cell cancer in 2008, which may have been initially responsible for the chronic pain I'd developed, but the pain did not go away after the cancer and my kidney were removed in surgery. I became caught in the horrendous spider web of Purdue's Oxycontin and oxycodone medications. When I tried to reduce and eliminate these meds with the help of doctors, I became extremely ill, and lost so much weight & became so weak I could hardly climb the stairs. I learned about kratom online, and researched it quite a bit before trying it. It's a natural substance, so its effects are subtle, but it helped with the pain, the agonies of withdrawals, anxiety and panic disorders. When I heard it might be scheduled as if it's a harmful, addictive drug, I knew I had to speak up. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nI understand that where there is potentially money to be made, the drug companies will try to prohibit that substance, then reproduce it synthetically. What I think might've happened is that some crazy-acting adolescents took a bunch of nasty chemicals, bath salts or whatever, AND some kratom, then put a video on YouTube of themselves acting insane or even getting dangerously sick, and blaming it all on kratom.\n\nTo ban the use of this plant based on no more evidence than social media is an outrageous idea. Please don't do this. There must be somebody out there with power AND good common sense, with a bit of compassion and willingness to learn from fellow citizens who have actual experience with this substance. There should be time given, at least, to scientists to study and learn about the qualities of this plant; what it is, what it can and cannot do, is it dangerous or not. Shouldn't our public policies be informed by science and intelligent investigation?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11290","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There is no question that taking yet another natural alternative off the market will increase overdose deaths. With the state our country is currently in with the heroin epidemic, who on Earth in good conscience would propose what you are planning to do, and have the audacity to assume you are \"doing the right thing.\" You should be ashamed of yourselves for even considering it. Are you seriously devoting time to this when thousands and thousands of people in the country have overdosed on LEGAL medication approved by the FDA this year alone? (not that FDA approval means anything in real-life, or we wouldn't allow pharmaceutical companies to profit immensely from obviously unsafe drugs).\nIn case you are unaware, people are dying from prescription medication, cocaine, heroin and other already illegal opiates and benzodiazepines: https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates \nDoesn't it seem morally right to allow access to safe options, rather than taking them away before you even understand one iota of what you're trying to destroy? Let me put it this way, the only reason ANYONE is in support of this proposed ban is SOLELY because of one or more of the following:\n1. Profit:\nThink about pharmaceutical companies and what they would do if a safe alternative to their \"options\" were being used by so many people that their margins were affected. Just look at Suboxone, an FDA approved treatment for opiate/opioid addition that makes their manufacturers a BOATLOAD of money daily, and it's guaranteed to make the user addicted to it...because it is STILL an opioid. That's not a solution, it's a corporation's bottom-line.\n2. Misinformation/Ignorance:\nI don't mean ignorance as \"stupid\"; I mean that people are so uninformed or misinformed on what this is and what it does that most of the people in this category believe that Kratom is an opioid, which is undeniably FALSE. There are no opioids in Kratom. There are only the compounds the DEA wishes to ban, because they don't understand them. There is no place in our society today for allowing others to suffer because of someone else's ignorance. I know people are getting relief from Kratom, and they absolutely should have access to it. Do you know why people who advocate Kratom are never on the news as part of a terrible crime resulting, at least in part, from drug use? Because those people do not engage in that behavior. They are not junkies trying to get their next fix; they are functional, productive members of this society and the majority are over the age of 30. When's the last time you saw a Veteran that fought for our freedom being denied access to morphine when they needed it? Me either. But we seem to think it's OK to take their Kratom away....absolutely unacceptable.\n3. Their jobs are at risk if the American People are not constantly in a state of fear about the drug situation in this country. You know who you are\nLet's look at the facts:\n1. Nobody has ever died from consuming only Kratom. The original intent to schedule posted here in August 2016 blamed 16 deaths on Kratom. The toxicology reports indicate that all of them were taking multiple drugs, and with most of them being the kinds of drugs that have been known to kill people, it makes you wonder why the DEA would include that in the first place. Do you really think the American people are just stupid and won't do the research, or did you think you're smart enough to not get caught?\n2. Tylenol can destroy your liver, but that's still widely available. Drugs are approved every day in this country that can easily kill anyone who uses it. Is a treatment for Restless Leg Syndrome really worth going into convulsions or death? Apparently that's more acceptable a risk than allowing Kratom to do what it does and help so many people to live their lives the way they want, with no side-effects?\n3. There is a government established \"acceptable\" number of deaths every year from chlorine in tap water. So why do we still drink tap water? Because it is needed. Kratom is also needed by many people, and yet it hasn't killed a single person on it's own and we need to even spend time discussing banning it? Come on, really?\n4. People are getting relief from a wide array of difficulties and pain that they would otherwise have to suffer through. Being miserable isn't good for the individual or their community. So why aren't we simply discussing how to make this a regulated product that ensures the safety of anyone utilizing it so that people can still benefit? If it's legal, the existing market for this plant can be competition for other interested parties that want to make it their own personal cash crop. And by parties, I mean the types of corporations that already distribute and profit from the sale of dangerous drugs without conscience.\nIn my opinion, after doing all pertinent research, there is absolutely no reason to even consider a normal scheduling process for this plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20481","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dustin Hoffman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a citizen and registered voters in do not approve of any attempt to limit the sale or consumption of Kratos nor do I agree with classification labeling of Krayom.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it!

Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works... It uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies. http://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

With the only answers from the doctors being to take pain pills, I knew I was looking at not only a life of pain but also a life of addiction. I made friends with a 42 year old lady who had been on doctor prescribed pain pills since her 20s, and I saw what little quality of life she had. Not only from the daily pain she still suffered (even with high level of pain meds) she also suffered many side effects of the pain medications. I knew I didn't want to live that life. After long research on natural alternatives I discovered Kratom - a plant that has been used in its native area for hundreds of years, to help tribes with pain and stamina. I went out on a limb and ordered some online and tried it. Not only did it help ease my pain, it did so without the ill side effects and brain fog that the RX pills gave me. I slowly weened myself off the RX pain pills. While this may cut into the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies - It gave me some of my life back! I have now been using it for years and while I will never again feel the young age that my body actually is, I can get thru my days with less pain and more mental clarity and less depression. Living in pain day in and day out is maddening and I would never wish it on anyone. If the government takes away Kratom they will also be sentencing thousands of people to pain, depression and other issues. Most Kratom users have tried the way of the western doctor and have tried all the pharmaceuticals available to help them - But they have not worked. These people have found a plant that improves their lives. The only thing making this plant illegal will do is make criminals out of people who have no other option to lead a full life. Grandmothers, mothers, fathers, so many people struggling with daily pain, just trying to work enough to keep the roof over their families head and to be able to play with their children. These people are not getting high and they are not criminals. Making this plant illegal would be a huge step backwards for this country. Productivity would wane and suicides would increase.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13550","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern:\nFor almost 20 years, I have been consuming the leaf of the Kratom tree. in the beginning, it was hard to find the crushed leaves to make the bitter tea I drank. more recently, I have consumed the powder form as well. this Plant has saved me in so many ways.

Kratom helps alleviate my anxiety, as well as boost my mood, without any adverse side-effects or risk of dependency. Kratom is a natural, benign herb without any potential to harm users. The worst that can happen from consuming too much Kratom is nausea and vomiting. This is not the case with substances like tylenol, alcohol, or ibuprofen, all of which are readily available at any convenience store. In addition, on several occasions I've ceased Kratom consumption after many consecutive days of use, without any withdrawal symptoms. To eliminate a safe and natural alternative will force people to use synthetic pharmaceuticals that carry the risk of addiction and numerous side effects. On top of that, Kratom contains anti-oxidants that are good for ones immune system. Please do not ban Kratom. I believe it should be regulated like any dietary supplement. If it becomes scheduled, tens of thousands of law-abiding citizens who use Kratom to boost their health and livelihood will no longer have access to a safe botanical. I believe it is god-given right to use what nature provides, granted that it doesn't harm the user or others, and that is simply not the case with Kratom. Thank you for reading my comment and again, please KEEP Kratom legal and accessible to the public.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20816","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Samples","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 51 yrs old and have been using kratom for 3 yrs now, with no ill effects.

I was started on Percocet when the over the counter medicine just wasn't working. I became addicted to them in no time and when the prescription ran out I would buy them on street. Before the addiction I had put myself through school and had a job making 100,000 a year. I was a model citizen but once I took that pain medication my life was down hill from there. Finally I knew I couldn't live like this so I went to a treatment center to get help. I started taking suboxone and after being on it a few years I knew it was time to get clean once and for all but I still had the pain I treated in the first place. That's when I heard of kratom. I tried it and I can say it truly has helped me get off the suboxone and I'm able to go to work everyday with no brain fog and no pain.

I grew up a middle class kid with a great family. I played varsity basketball and was pretty much an average suburban american kid.  I oppose the DEA scheduling kratom as a schedule 1 narcotic.  I disagree with the your stance that Kratom is a Drug.  Kratom has saved my life.  I broke a bone in my back when I was 17 years old which resulted in chronic pain for my adult  life. Im also Bipolar. By the time I was 25 years old Doctors had put me on pain pills, specifically opiate painkillers like percocet and oxycontin.  The day I was introduced to painkillers my life became a struggle with addiction.  I spent nearly 15 years addicted to opiates.  When the painkillers became too expensive I switched to heroin.  I was so ashamed and wanted to quit but I couldn't quit.  I would rather be dead than not have opiates. The withdrawal flu like symptoms and the anxiety were the most horrible thing imaginable but I tried to quit several times anyway. Trying to quit wasn't enough and my wife left me because my addiction. I wanted to be high or I wanted to die. Somebody suggested Kratom to me.  I started taking kratom and have never looked back.  Kratom not only helps with my chronic pain it also gives me a feeling of well being and has helped with my depression.  Kratom does not get you high it is similar to coffee as it gives me energy and also that feeling of well being. I am now able to live a normal life and to function and be productive.  I am terrified of relapsing and kratom is the only thing saving me from that.  I have 3 friends who have died of  heroine overdoses and there will be many more if it kratom is scheduled. It has changed my life and several of my friends lives so that we can live without addiction. Thank you for giving the comment period ti listen to us.

I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult. I had not been a very productive youth, and had drank to much and never did well in school. I began taking Vyvanse for ADHD at 25 years of age. It is an amphetamine, used to stimulate my brain. I accomplished many things I had never imaged after I began to take it, and became successful, but the bad habits I picked up when I was young were exacerbated by such a strong medicine, and over the years I began drinking more and more to cope with coming off of this medicine. I barely ate, and never excercised. A friend introduced me to Kratom, which I take in incredibly small doses, like a cup of coffee a few times throughout the day. I have been doing this for going on a year, and my health and quality of life have improved dramatically. I am not suggesting it is a cure for anything, but simply saying it has provided me the best way to manage my life. I don't drink, smoke, and I was once a medical marijuana patient, but now do not touch the stuff. I don't take strong prescription medication anymore. Please do not take this away, because it really helps me by assuaging my ADHD WITHOUT causing a high or side effects. I can not say this about the medication I was prescribed which cost $300/month.

I used to do it heroin and pills when the boom hit around 2010. I quickly realized I needed to find help and quit before my life fell apart. I've tried suboxen to releave my withdrawals but it didn't sit with me well. I got nauseas and sick when trying to use suboxen to quit.  Then my friend who used to do heroin but quit, shared with me about kratom. I started to take it and with in a week I was of off heroin and pills.  I didn't have any withdrawals from kratom and am so greatful for this plant.

As far as physical and health benefits are concerned, I think the trials that have been conducted, mostly in other countries, speak for themselves. The plant and it's extract have been used for many years for its pain relieving aspect and also to curb the addiction to prescribed opiate addictions, which has truly become a catastrophic problem in the United States recently. This evidence alone, combined with the lack of negative consequences from ingesting the compound, should completely curb the idea of making this substance illegal, and should actually promote the research into capitalizing it as a product as a alternative to much more dangerous, readily prescribed 'medicines'.\n\nIf the only evidence that would cause a law to be formed making it illegal is its addictive qualities, then you must factor in that any enjoyable effects obtained from anything that is done has the possibility to become just as addictive. Sugar, television, videogames, even activities that cause any sort of adrenaline rush can be even more addictive.\n\nIf the reason that would cause it to be illegal would be a push from the pharmaceutical industry, then you need to step back and analyze the idea of a FREE economy, because the involvement of the government thus far has only impeded the growth of these industries where natural, much more effective options such as marijuana, MDMA, DMT, and many other compounds have shown to have such positive effects on people who are suffering, but can only get effective treatments by doing so in private or by traveling to other more liberal environments.\n\nPlease stop impeding on the evolution of healthier recreational and pharmaceutical  ventures by being manipulated and bullied by industries who have built their substantial wealth through dangerous, addictive, and archaic drugs and substances.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18974","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Trey Mock","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement\nkratom.

I want to thank you for giving the public a chance to comment on this useful herbal tree leaf.  I have been utilizing kratom as well as other herbs on and off since 2001. I have suffered back and shoulder pain all my life and have been prescribed some strong opiates.  The opiates really help but I have always used herbals in place of heavier drugs when I could in order to function and not be under the influence when I needed to be alert. My regimen for pain was using a mixture of skullcap, white willow bark, kratom and when I need to sleep I add in valerian root as well.  All of those herbs are very nice and mild alternatives to some heavy and dangerous drugs. It is nice to have an herbal garden every year as people growing their own can get the full effect of fresh herbals. Kratom can not be grown in the US so herbals like kratom and ginseng I usually use an herbal outlet.\n\nWhen I heard about the comment period and read some people were staying off heavier drugs and got their life in order I felt I had to comment too.  To the people that stopped using heavy drugs and use kratom I say God bless them. It can save a few lives. Unfortunately some do not find it strong enough and succumb to some of the real dangerous synthetic drugs flooding the US. It warms my heart that some people can find balance and get a footing with an herbal after reading about so many deaths from synthetic drugs. I worry about the children in and around my family. If any of them used kratom and other herbs and have their life together that really is a good positive thing.  I have never had a problem with kratom. Please consider it another herbal in the outlets that can help more than hinder. Let it be available to these kind folks.\n\nThanks again for the opportunity to comment.  It is appreciated.   In time I am sure Nature will provide many more ways to help people.  Every new discovery is precious.

It has helped me treat my PTSD and drug addiction.\n\nLike many transgender people, I have been subjected to frequent violence, including rape. I have a severe case of PTSD, with one of my symptoms being occasional suicidality. \n\nSuicidality is a difficult condition to treat, especially when it is prompted by extreme circumstances. Anti-depressants can be used to lessen depression, but they aren't great at dealing with extreme, occasional emotions.  And when a person is raped, not for the first time, emotions are quite extreme. Like 65% of transgender rape survivors, I have attempted suicide after being sexually assaulted. An additional problem is, because many of them have sedating effects anti-depressants can be used themselves to attempt suicide.\n\nMy solution to suicidality in extreme moments was opiates, including heroin. These of course, came with their own downsides. Heroin like anti-depressants can be used to attempt suicide. And as you are no doubt aware, opiates are extremely habit forming. But in the face of the extreme trauma I was dealing with, I needed something.\n\nWhen I found Kratom, it was the perfect solution. Kratom cannot easily be used to attempt suicide, high doses trigger nausea. Kratom is significantly less habit forming than opiates, I have never once suffered withdrawal symptoms. And unlike anti-depressants, the effects are quick. On days where I face severe violence and discrimination I can take a few to tide me over until I can make sense of things again. As an added bonus, it is effective at treating withdrawal symptoms of opiate addiction. I was able to quit heroin thanks to Kratom.\n\nAnd, additionally, because Kratom was legal, I was able to access it without using illegal channels, meaning I could acquire it safely without the temptation to relapse onto drugs I had used in the past.\n\nWhen I was addicted to opiates, I was sure I was going to die by the end of the year. Kratom, quite simply, saved my life.\n\nIt is by no means a complete solution. I have been in therapy with a trauma specialist for four years, and naturally that has been helpful as well. But at bottom, talking simply can't remove the pain of being raped. Nothing can, especially when for me, as a trans-woman, I know I am at a high risk of it happening again. In that moment, in the past when it has happened, the only thing that has prevented me from killing myself to make sure I would never be raped again has been Kratom.\n\nIt's not something I use every day by any means. Most days I don't touch it. But it is something to be there for extreme circumstances. And unfortunately, as a transgender woman, I have no way to ensure that I will not land in extreme circumstances again.\n\nI do not believe there is an evidence based reason to ban Kratom. The information the DEA is acting on is purely based upon poison control center calls, which are anecdotal. At most, the DEA estimates 15 deaths from Kratom since it started measuring. There are many more than 15 people who have had their lives saved by Kratom, including me. There are institutional biases that prevent these benefits from showing up in the scientific literature, including lack of funding for non-patentable drugs, and the relatively small and marginalized use base of Kratom. That doesn't mean it doesn't work, it just means it hasn't been tested as thoroughly as it could have been.\n\nWhile there are some limited dangers of addiction if it is abused, there are many over the counter substances that are more addictive and have worse side effects (alcohol, nicotine, DXM etc.) I fear this hasty action will kill more people than it will save, because if the DEA had done this years ago, I likely would not have survived myself. As is, it may set my recovery back significantly, since I have found no other medication as effective for treating my PTSD, and I have tried everything I could think of, including anti-depressants, anxiolytics, and anti-psychotics. Only Kratom worked the way I needed it to, enabling me not just able to survive, but able to volunteer and help other members of my community survive as well.\n\nAt the least, Kratom should not be schedule I. It has documented medical uses. It can treat depression, suicidality, anxiety, and opiate addiction. If there is concern about recreational use and abuse, make it only available via prescription. There are people, like me, who truly need it.\n\nI do not submit comments often, but on this issue I felt compelled to share my story. I would beg the DEA to carefully consider the needs of people who have had experiences like mine. \n\nI tried to submit this comment once, but it appears to have been lost. So I would also add, due to technical difficulties, the DEA should probably consider the number of testimonials submitted an under-representative sample of those actually submitted.

I have a rare, chronic autoimmune disease and kratom has helped me to control my symptoms better than any prescription pharmaceutical. Kratom is an effective analgesic, anxiolytic, antidepressant, and it has helped me more than any prescription or OTC drug. I regularly take breaks from kratom and, when I do, my mood and energy levels dip for a couple days then return to normal. There is no crippling withdrawal or severe respiratory depression, like prescription opioids. The effects of kratom are mild and provide a pleasant mood boost, on par with a strong cup of coffee. Speaking of the world's favorite drink, the kratom plant is in the same family of plants as the coffee bean. But, like anything, it's not all positive. There is one negative about using kratom - it tastes terrible. And, one time, I drank a little too much kratom and it made me feel nauseous for a few hours. That's another important difference between kratom and the powerful prescription opioids I've been prescribed: Too much kratom and you get a tummy ache. Too many opioids and you stop breathing. All things considered, kratom is a wonderfully safe plant with a number of medicinal uses. Banning it would be tragic for all the people, like myself, that have used to to improve the quality of their lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16100","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nFirst i just wanted to say that i'm very glad that we have an opportunity to leave comments, and voice our opinions on this subject of kratom.

Many patients are also discovering the value of kratom in decreasing or eliminating their dependence on prescription pain medications.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry has a vested interest in debunking methods of pain management which do not further its own agenda.

It merely suggests more people are discovering it's value and wishing to gain further information. \n\nThe DEA loses credibility when it fails to responsibly assess it's decisions in a manner consistent with good science. Evidence of harm from this plant is so vastly outweighed by innumerable reports of its efficacy. If for no other reason than reducing prescription drug abuse, the DEA might please consider leaving well enough alone! The use of plants to improve the human condition began thousands of years ago, and will continue. \n\nHas the DEA still not acknowledged the failure of the \"War on Drugs\"?

I was an abuser on pain killers due to a motorcycle accident I had back in 2001. The doctors prescribed me Oxycotton 40 mg for 2 months. After a few weeks I was addicted to them very fast. I went back to the doctor for a last refill and he said that I am abusing the drug when he was the bastard that prescribed the addictive drug to me. For 2 years I was buying any kind of pain killers that I could find for a dollar a mg which was making me spend thousands of dollars every month. \nI then decided to take myself to a rehab for rehabilitation for my life. While I was in rehab after the 2nd month I started buying pain killers again and realized that rehab is not working for me. I decided to look for a pain doctor that prescribed methadone but I found Suboxone instead and started my recovery with that highly addictive drug (suboxone). At the time I was so happy that I could find a drug for my addiction when in fact it was just a legal way of taking something highly addictive. I took Suboxone for 3 years and my doctor was busted for fraud while I was working in Afghanistan supporting the war fighters. The detox from Suboxone was one of the worst detox I have ever been through in my life. It literally took almost 3 months for my body to clean its self from that legal addictive drug. \nI was free of addictive drugs for 4 months but I was not happy at all and depressed shortly after. There were times I just wanted to kill myself, I had no interest of life what so ever. I was neglecting my son so much because I was so miserable. I did not have any energy or motivation to do anything. After cleaning my body from Suboxone I hated to be around other people and I really hated to socialize with others, I would walk the other way if I seen somebody I knew just to avoid a conversation with them.I had terrible anxiety and could not sleep for months. I was on the verge of losing my job because I did not have any interest in working anymore until I was told about Kratom. \nI had purchased my from strain of Kratom from www.authentickratom.com and I was even spectacle about buying something natural without all of the chemicals that pain killers had but I tried it out and my first day of taking Kratom I was the happiest person alive. I was socializing with all of my Coe workers and peers around me. That same day I was awake until 4 am because I called all of my family members just to say hello and how were things going. 2 out of 4 sisters were crying because I finally reached out to them and opened up, I then started to cry with them because of how much I needed them, but for so many years I was antisocial and did not want a relationship with anybody. Kratom has really saved my life for the better and to label Kratom as a class 1 drug would mean thousands of families going back to pain killers and illegal drugs. This would be the destruction of many people and go back to square one where they first started. \nKratom is a natural leaf just like marijuana and as we all know marijuana helps with allot of illnesses but America made it illegal which is a mistake. I have a fabulous relationship with my son and my 6 month old daughter because Kratom keeps me focused and motivated for life itself. Also since taking Kratom I understand and make sense of everything I do. My memory is also way way better since I started Kratom. Before I could not remember even a small task I would perform at work. Now I am on top of everything I say I will do. \nI truly believe deep down in my heart that if America makes a natural leaf illegal that has saved thousands of lives would mean an uproar and destruction of Kratom users lively hood and sanity. \nAlso their are thousands of Opioid abusers that have not found Kratom yet but I am certain if they were introduced to Kratom their lives would be saved as well.

I went to college for Horticulture. I've struggled with anxiety since I was a child. When I was about 14 years old, I began to self-medicate on opiates to try to get my anxiety under control, along with being prescribed xanax when I was 16.  This led to further addiction of heroine and morphine. \n\nA couple years ago, when I decided to get clean, I went to the methadone clinic and was prescribed suboxone. My experience with suboxone was a negative one; I was wanting to get clean and have a clear head again, but I still had similar effects that opiates gave me and my mind was still foggy. When I decided to quit taking suboxone, the withdrawals were even worse than before, so I started using methamphetamine to cover the withdrawal.  \n\nA year and a half ago, I discovered kratom, and thanks to this all-natural plant, I was able to get off all drugs, including nicotine. Once I was clean from opiates and methamphetamine, I decided to stop xanax too so I could be free from all the chemicals. \n\nI don't know if this would have been possible without kratom, I was able to get clean with no withdrawals, and it keeps my anxiety under control without feeling foggy or under the influence. Kratom has saved my life, and I'm so thankful to be out of that old lifestyle. Please don't take this plant away from me and everyone else it has saved.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19880","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has completely changed my life.

I have used kratom for anxiety, exercise, and immune support for 5 years. I suffer from PTSD from multiple events and have had issues with anxiety and relationships my entire life. I have been in therapy for 17 years. Kratom drastically changed my ability to feel normal being calm instead of needing to feel \"up\" or \"alert\". It gave me the ability to calm my thoughts and speak rationally during fights, handle everyday stresses, push myself in my career, and communicate effectively with my family.\n\nAfter a surgery as a teenager, I realized that the painkillers they prescribed me greatly reduced my anxiety and made me more functional. However, I was and am quite aware of the physical and psychological dangers of taking painkillers for anything except their prescribed usage. I had heard a rumor about an herb that does something similar, without the stoning, flattening effect of opiates. From there, I found reliable vendors online whose reviews and sources showed me I was getting nothing but wild, natural leaves. \n\nI have introduced friends to kratom and gradually increased the frequency of use over the years and now take kratom daily. My initial restriction with the herb was due to the fear that it was similar to opiates: I feared developing a tolerance and dependence, as well as physical and psychological harm. However, breaks from the herb have shown me that I have little to no issue when I don't take it. The anxiety I feel after multiple days without it could be my resting state or it could be mild withdrawal, I am unsure. I have had about 1 cold in the past 3 years since my daily usage and I know it is from both the immunostimulant properties and my own lower cortisol.\n\nFrom my own experiences and the experiences of friends and family, there have been NO negative physical, emotional, or social impacts from using kratom. We all take doses below 5g/day, most hovering around 2g/day. This herb has given me the ability to let go of the iron grip that PTSD panic causes, a grip that destroyed past relationships, made me feel alienated from family, and led to self-hatred from inaction and avoidance in my own life. Therapy and age have absolutely contributed, I do not give kratom full credit. However, I strongly believe that adults deserve to have tools to manage their lives. We deserve to be able to choose which plants to eat if nobody else is harmed. Please trust adults to make the right decisions for themselves. Trust us to pursue our own happiness, so long as it does not interfere with someone else's pursuit.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22439","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Samuel Goodkind","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"         Hello. I am a 29 year old female with a lifetime history of debilitating tension headaches and Fibromyalgia. Since I was a child I've been given every drug by doctors to find something that helps the pain. If I take nothing I will get headaches and pain throughout my body that leaves me immobile for days, up to a week, at a time. I have three children who depend on me to care for them on a daily basis. So taking strong painkillers, muscle relaxers, etc. is not a good option. I never wanted to be on hard prescription drugs as it impairs my ability to drive and care for my children. After doctors had tried everything from anti-depressants to anti-anxiety to every painkiller you can think of (most of which I am allergic to) and nothing worked I was left to be in constant pain. Pain that lasts all day every day. My pain and feeling of hopelessness at never being able to find relief was overwhelming me. My kids were miserable. So was my fiancee' and everyone else I knew. The pain had me taking it out on everyone because it was too much to handle. At my breaking point and on the verge of killing myself, I made one last attempt at researching anything that could potentially help. \n       That's when I came across Kratom. I read story after story of how it took the place of a lot of drugs in people that needed a different solution. It honestly seemed too good to be true. Then I ordered my first batch. I was very skeptical because I didn't believe something this good had been around forever and it was never even offered to me. Within 30 minutes of my first dose I was in less pain than I've been in for over 15 years. After taking Kratom for awhile it was like someone breathed life into me. This was I life I never knew could exist. My family and friends constantly comment on how I am like a different person now. I'm happy, fun, active, and don't have to worry about not playing with my kids because it may hurt too much. I am finally living life the way it was always meant to be lived.\n       Now, after only having this miracle in my life for a few months, they are talking about making it illegal. My family and I are completely heartbroken. If this rule goes into effect my pain comes back, and this beautiful life I am finally able to live will end. I do not understand why this ban is even happening. Kratom is a natural plant/tree that exists in nature. Millions of people use it that cannot, or do not want to be, on  heavy prescription medication. Is that why this is happening? Because the pharmaceutical companies aren't making any money off of it? I have been on Kratom for months and never once felt the need to take too much or gotten addicted to it. (Other than needing it to relieve my pain and anguish.)\n        Please do not do this. This decision could ruin millions of lives and for what? Kratom has ruined nobody's life, has caused no harm compared to the drugs people would be taking in place of this. Personally, I do not want to go back to feeling like dying is the only way out of this pain filled body and hell I live in without Kratom. Give real believers a chance to research it and prove there are nothing but good things coming from this plant. Anyone can get addicted to anything. That is no reason to ban a lifesaving drug. Especially when I can go to the store and overdose on alcohol, nicotine, and even aspirin, with much more severe consequences (even death) than Kratom will ever have. I beg you to do your research on this before jumping to false and misleading conclusions. Thank you for listening to my story and please take this important issue seriously and don't let the drug makers do this to America.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7469","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern:\n\nMy name is Chelsea. I am an accountant, a single mother, and I have suffered from general anxiety disorder and depression for as long as I can remember. I have tried lots of different anxiety and antidepressant medications and have been unable to find one that works for me. This struggle has seemed so endless. I've been unable to find happiness in all the things a normal person should. Going through the motions, but never really being a part of the world. Who would want to live an entire life this way? Not me. Not anymore.\n\nAt the end of my rope, I went out of my normal comfort zone and decided to give this herbal supplement, kratom, a shot. I had to do something. I hated growing up seeing my dad live life this way and I don't want that for my little girl. I am so thankful that I did. Somehow, this herb made a real difference in my life. It made me feel like I could be that better version of myself that I've always longed for.  After so many sleepless nights, thousands of tears, and countless prayers, I can't even explain how overjoyed I was to finally find some relief. It didn't make me feel numb, drugged or zombie-like as other alternative options did. For the first time in a really long time, I felt like I could finally compete with the darkness. I  still felt worried, sad, and overwhelmed at times, but now I could also feel hope, motivation, and happiness as well. Things I had thought I might never feel again.\n\nI don't know who is reading this, or if you've ever suffered from a paralyzing mental condition, but I beg of you to consider those who suffer from one on a daily basis.

The alkaloids named above are naturally occurring compounds found in the leaves of the kratom tree (genus Mitragyna), a plant I consume to help treat my multiple pain and connective tissue and musculoskeletal diseases, so I can continue to be a attentive parent to my 4 children.  \n\n      At the age of 28 I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.  Fibromyalgia affects the muscles and soft tissue and symptoms include chronic muscle pain, extreme fatigue, and tender trigger points just to name a few. I was in so much pain that I couldnt handle my toddler sitting on my lap, without being in excruciating pain. Thats a problem for anyone, but especially as a young stay-at-home mom.\n\n       At the age of 29 I was diagnosed with the connective tissue disorder Ehlors-Danos Syndyrome ( EDS ).   EDS is  characterized by joint hyper-mobility as the dominant clinical manifestation. Generalized joint hyper mobility that affects large (elbows, knees) and small (fingers, toes) joints is evident in the Hyper mobility Type. Recurring joint subluxations and dislocations are common occurrences. Certain joints, such as the shoulder, patella and temporomandibular joint dislocate frequently. The skin involvement (smooth velvety skin with or without hyperextensibility) as well as bruising tendencies in the Hypermobility Type are present but quite variable in severity.  Chronic pain is a well-established and cardinal manifestation of Hypermobility EDS and it is common for pain to be out of proportion to physical and radiological findings. The origin of the pain is not clearly understood, but some of the likely causes include muscle spasm (tender points are sometimes present) and degenerative arthritis; neuropathic pain is also common.  \n\n       My doctors prescribed the FDA standard Fibromyalgia treatment course, NSAIDs (Celebrex), that were to lessen my chronic pan. With NSAIDs comes a lengthy list of very serious side effects, like lifelong risk of internal bleeding which would make future recovery from dental work, childbirth, injury or surgery more painful and possible life threatening. While the risk of taking these prescription treatments may have been worth it if they workedthey didnt. The dangerous side effects and ineffectiveness of what my doctors were offering led me to search for alternative treatment options. In 2015, I found Mitragyna speciosa, or Kratom as its more commonly known, in chronic pain groups on Facebook and once I tried it I was amazed at how well my pain was controlled.  I am able to play with my children again.  Clean my home.  Go on vacations. Before I was bed bound.  I couldn't even let my children sit on my lap because of the pain.\n\n      Since 2014 when my pain began I have been on many medications and suffered from many side effects including the very serious gastrointestinal bleeding from Celebrex.  Since I I started using Kratom I've been able to stop using all anti-depressants, Celebrex, Gabapentin, Tramadol, and Hydrocodone.  \nI cant imagine going back to not being able to hug my kids when I put them to bed at night because even the slightest touch from the littlest of hands sends a surge of debilitating pain through my body.\nIt is my sincerest hope that our state regulators and legislators reverse course and repeal the effective ban on Kratom and do it soon. I dont want to have to make a choice between my home and managing my chronic pain.\n\n       If you have questions about Kratom, please visit www.americankratom.org.  Thank you for your time and service to the state.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8377","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sheena Roccia","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using kratom for two years now on a daily basis and I have found it to be an amazing supplement for productivity and mood with the added benefits of suppressed appetite in the early part of the day--it seems to wear off by evening and i have a great big dinner after snacking in little bites all day.

He is a father, husband and sole bread-winner of the family. This is in response to the DEA's intention to make Kratom a Schedule I substance. It includes a great amount of information on what Kratom is and the what will happen if the DEA goes through with the emergency scheduling.\n\nThanks,\nSandy\n\nDear DEA,\n \nPlease remove Mitragynine & 7-hydroxymitragynine which is in Kratom from becoming a Schedule I substance.\n \nI am 29 and suffer from a herniated disc, chronic neck pain, TMJ, arthritis in my neck. I support a family of four on a single income. I have been to many doctors with little success for treatment. I have found that Kratom greatly improves my quality of life and allows me to work. It isnt comparable to any drugs, marijuana, alcohol or other stimulants.  Kratom helps to improve my quality of life that I suffer with chronic pain. Please dont make this herb illegal. Cervical injections, botox injections, chiropractic care, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, yoga exercises have not helped with my pain.\n \nKratom is a well-known, well-researched herbal substance drawn from the leaves of trees within the coffee family. The number of cases of documented harm from kratom use is remarkably low, both as an absolute matter and when considered against the extensive history of use of kratom, both inside and outside the United States\n \nMitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are two of the primary alkaloids of this plant. These two compounds are not synthetic and should not be lumped together with  \"bath salts\" or \"spice\".\n \nKratom has been used as a medicine by many people for thousands of years. It is a potent remedy for physical pain, anxiety and depression, and could be used to aid with opiate withdrawal by those who would like to quit using illicit drugs such as heroin. Kratom is NOT a hallucinogen and should not be classified as such. Adding mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as a Schedule I substance is rash and unjustified prohibition, resulting in a foreseeable increase in street drug-related crime, as well as a punishment to those who are currently using it responsibly to treat various ailments.\n\nThe reason that there are no deaths solely attributed to Kratom is because Kratom does not affect your respiratory capacity. It does not slow down your central nervous system. It's potential to do harm is virtually impossible.\n\nKratom has very limited recreational capacity.  The White House petition has over 100,000 signatures for the \"Please do not make Kratom a Schedule I Substance.\" \n\nThe federal government has invested significant resources to develop alternative pain management strategies. This includes a study funded by the National Institutes of Health in partnership with the University of Massachusetts and the University of Mississippi to investigate the use of Kratom as a remedy for opioid withdrawal. This study led the researchers to apply for a patent identifying the Kratom extract, mitragyinine, as a useful treatment for other addictive drugs besides opiate derivatives. The DEAs decision to place Kratom as a Schedule I substance will put a halt on federally funded research and innovation surrounding the treatment of individuals suffering from opioid and other addictionsa significant public health threat. Remember the DDear Colleague Letters of Senator Hatch and Congressman Mark Pocan.\n \nWe hope you realize the threat this scheduling causes the people seeking legitimate use of this special plant to improve our quality of life.

As an OIF combat veteran struggling with PTSD and wanting to make changes in my life, I found Kratom incredibly helpful. I am very concerned about the void of scientific research around this plant regarding its use. As someone who used Kratom daily, and also struggled with substance abuse (from medication prescribed to me by the VA), I can tell you that this plant is not physically addictive; for me it was also not psychologically addictive as my use of other prescriptions were. This plant allowed me to come off of highly addictive psychotropic medications and my experience was 100% positive. I would describe the effects of Kratom to be calming while also providing mental stimulation similar to that of Coffee. The calming effects were similar, albeit very different, and to a lesser extent than that of a prescription pain killer. \n\nWith the current heroine epidemic, I believe that this plant has enormous potential to assist those struggling with opioid addiction. I also want to emphasize that I used this plant daily for 6 months, and stopped using it abruptly when I ran out--I never experienced any type of physical or psychological withdraw. As a mental health clinician, I ask that you consider whatever scientific research FDA provides in discerning any regulations. Clinical trials would be incredibly useful to reference and based on my own personal experience, I do not believe that extending the time period for a decision would pose a risk to public health.

It is one of the only things that allows me to live a whole and happy life.  Without it, I will be left with terrible, destructive pain management options.  I am so completely disheartened that the DEA is attacking this natural product.  Please read my story below and include my voice in this discussion.  I am willing to go anywhere and discuss my story with anyone who can help this cause.  Please advise me on further ways to be involved.  \n\nHere is my story:\n\nThe simple way to start my story is with the happy ending: Kratom has completely changed my life and I am so grateful to have been introduced to this product. I am 95% free of all prescription pain medications, my pain is finally managed well enough for me to be happy, and each day is getting better and better. The future is extremely bright again, and I cant wait to be a part of it!\n\nWhen I was fourteen I was told I had moderate scoliosis, at age twenty I was in a severe car accident caused by another driver, at age twenty-four I was in a taxi that was hit by a truck, and by age twenty-eight the pain from the combination of these events was so bad it became debilitating.\n\nThe accidents accelerated my scoliosis and caused some of my joints to become hyper mobile, allowing them to basically dislocate on a whim. I have six bulging discs, as well as arthritis and nerve damage down the entire length of my spine. Bad days were many: I couldnt walk well, get out of a chair, put on my shoes, or sleep. I shook all the time from the pain and nerve damage. Simple things like eating soup or putting on make-up were a struggle.\n\nI saw my career slipping away, my savings disappearing, and I become a bit of an insomniac. I was trying everything I could to find something to help the whole-body spasms, migraines, and nerve pain. To be honest, I cried every day from the sheer exhaustion of it and the anxiety of what my life would be like in the future as I age. I began to cancel social and work events and pull away from my friends. Every pill I tried had horrible side effects like foggy brain, upset stomach, sleeplessness, nerve travel and emotional changes. I have been in physical therapy for over a year and, while it has helped quite a bit, it still hasnt managed the daily pain. I have seen over a dozen doctors and each has tried to help, but the pain has persisted.\n\nOne day, a good friend told me about Kratom. The first time I tried it I couldnt believe it: my pain faded away, but I stayed clear, alert and focused. I didnt feel sick at all, I could not identify any side effects, and I started sleeping better. I only need a teaspoon to feel better for a full half-day. It also seemed to significantly help my mood and oddly calmed my pain while giving me energy.\n\nIt was so perfect that I was skeptical it could kill me, so I took it to my doctors who looked into it. To my shock, they gave me the thumbs up, and they said they preferred it to daily pharmaceuticals. I started to feel happier and calmer. One week went by without crying, then two, then three, and on and on.\n\nI now feel like I have my life back. I only use a teaspoon a day and have not had to increase my dose, in fact I decreased it when pain lowers.

This would equate kratom, a plant that helps millions of people, with damaging illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression, which is the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\nThough not a kratom user myself, I have friends and family who are, and I have worked in the industry for the past four years. In my work, I talk to people every single day who have rid themselves of crippling opiate addiction. They have found relief from chronic pain due to injury or diseases like fibromyalgia and lupus. They have overcome anxiety and depression to lead better, fuller lives. I cannot count the number of times I have been told \"Kratom saved my life.\"\n\nBy denying these Americans their hard-won health solution, a ban on kratom will cause relapses across the country as people, unable to obtain kratom, resort to the abuse of alcohol, prescription painkillers, and heroin.\n\nIn the middle of a nation-wide opiate epidemic, a plant like kratom should be further researched and not banned. To deny kratom's medicinal value and overlook thousands of years of traditional use in Southeast Asia is irresponsible when lives are in the balance. The DEA's letter of intent also misrepresents the findings of several studies on kratom, framing the plant as more harmful than the studies actually concluded and citing out-of-context statistics. \n\nLife is not easy, and addiction is a horrible disease.

I spent a week in the hospital with a hydromorphone IV for the first 5 days, and 15mg of oxycodone the remaining two. Once I was released I was given a script for oxycodone which I had filled promptly as I was in severe pain due to the nature of the surgeries performed on my arm. After the first script was up, I decided to order kratom instead of have another script filled. My uncle has been placed in intensive care twice due to withdrawal symptoms from oxycodone which was more than enough motivation to keep me from taking more oxycodone. To make the story short, I have been taking kratom daily for almost 2 years, and have not touched a single oxycodone since the end of my first script. Not only does it manage my pain which can be unbearable at times, but I have none of the withdrawal effects or constipation the opiates gave me. I have not had any noticeable health ailments (that I can tell) from the kratom either, and after two years I can safely say this is a better alternative to opiates than anything else out there. The DEA does not seem to understand that people aren't abusing kratom, but self administering medicine to deal with withdrawals or pain. If the right to treat my pain with this plant is taken away because the DEA believes it is more harmful than good, then clearly freedom no longer exists in this country.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8032","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyle Grover","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whomever it may concern,\n\nI am a 32 year old missionary and blogger who has safely used Kratom for over four years as a supplement/tea leaf.

There is no scientific basis for banning kratom, there have been no deaths directly attributed to kratom consumption without concomitant polydrug abuse. Research published in the Journal of Plant Studies (http://speciosa.org/acute-toxicity-study-of-standardized-mitragyna-speciosa-korth-aqueous-extract-in-sprague-dawley-rats/) has found nearly zero toxicity associated with consumption of an aqueous extract of kratom, and even hepatoprotective properties associated with low doses. The mortality rate was zero, indicating an extremely high L.D. 50 and therefore a large therapeutic window. Several case studies have found that kratom attenuates opiate withdrawal, while having minimal withdrawal symptoms of its own (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670991/). A recent publication by the American Chemical Society examining the active constituents of kratom along with several synthetic analogs has found that the active component, 7-Hydroxy Mitragynine, produced limited respiratory depression, the main cause of death due to opiate overdose, minimal physical dependence, and fewer side effects than standard opiate narcotics. (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b00748)\n\nIn light of such evidence contrary to the claim that kratom is dangerous, I am aghast that the DEA, a purportedly scientific agency, is willing to cast aside unbiased research in favor of adding another natural herb to the controlled substance list. The original notice of intent published by the DEA did not include any legitimate peer reviewed research and was heavily biased. Criminalization will hamper further research into this herb and prevent individuals suffering from chronic pain from access to safe and effective pain relief. Many will be forced back onto addictive opiate narcotics. Those seeking recreational use will simply switch to illicit and far more dangerous opiates. As mentioned by several commenters, thousands of abstinent ex-opiate addicts who have avoided relapse with occasional or maintenance doses of kratom will be at far greater risk for relapse if this herb is criminalized. Please consider regulation akin to that of alcohol or tobacco in place of full scale criminalization. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6920","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am nearly a 73-year-old Family Medicine physician and have been using kratom for the past 4-5 years for severe, chronic pain from osteoarthritis.  I've had a right knee and right hip replaced and soon will have the left knee replaced with titanium.  Kratom is the only reason I am able to continue working and be somewhat physically active.  Kratom does not give 100% pain relief but reduces the pain to where I can work without being distracted  by pain and can walk upright.\nBeing a practicing physician, I could not practice if on narcotic medication and, actually, would not take that \"poison\" anyway if I could.  Over the years I have seen firsthand how Lortab, Vicodin, Oxycontin, Percocet and other similar drugs can ruin lives.  Even if a patient takes that medication correctly and for a short time, the side effects can be difficult to deal with.  For instance, constipation is universally a big problem that requires the patient to have to take other meds to relieve that side effect.  Also, if a patient is to be on a narcotic pain reliever for an extended time, the effect is lessened and a higher dose is often needed to achieve the same amount of pain relief.  This can lead to dependence and, too often, can lead to addiction.\nPlease leave us who need kratom to be able to work and be physically active, however limited, alone.  There is nothing about kratom that is addictive and it does not give anyone a \"high\".  That's been proven over and over.\nMany of us have wondered if this attack on kratom is the result of \"Big Pharma's\" influence on the government.

First and foremost it is completely safe.

If you ingest too much for your system your body rejects it by vomiting, therefore nothing else harmful occurs to the person ingesting. All of the deaths that you (the DEA) claim to be caused by Mitragynine/Kratom were proven to have one or more other substances involved other than Mitragynine/Kratom. The challenge you would be addressing if you had bothered to look at the details in the studies of those deaths is:  Who is marketing products containing Kratom with false claims that it is Kratom alone and what else is in there, because that other stuff in there is killing people and you have yet to address the other stuff. Google it, if I can find the information, why can't you? an entire government agency. smh.\n\n2.  You claim there has been no medical study but there has been, plenty published studies in mainstream medical journals as well as various pain news networks.  Sensible dosing for support of various ailments is available in multiple places online.  LOOK IT UP.

Your claim that it's addictive, yet it helps addicts to come off of addicting drugs such as both prescription Opioids and Heroine.  So addicts use it to assist them and you call it addictive?  Sounds to me that your statements indicate potential corruption and payoffs. After all, addiction is big business in this country and I am ashamed as an American to see that the DEA supports corporate addiction.  After all, Smith Kline patented Kratom in 1964, now that it's popular in the US I would appreciate an audit of your financials to see if and how much they and other drug companies have paid you.  Here you will find the patent trail:  http://thedailyhaze.com/patent-kratom-alkaloids-government-lying/ As a consumer I can attest that Kratom is far less addictive than coffee.  I drink coffee daily and just can't get a jump start without it.  I don't drink Kratom daily, only when I want to.\n\n4.  Banning nature is sacrilegious and violates my rights as an American citizen.  For my entire life marajuana has been illegal, and I chose not to consume it because I don't like it for me, but it's a plant and made by GOD not by man.  The people have spoken and are taking the rights of the plant back.  In the days when you outlawed it you raised crime rates and put it into the hands of dangerous drug runners with far less of a paper trail than would be documentable today.  Today we will not stand for the outlawing of another plant quietly for the benefit of your corruption.  You have not banned many deadly poison plants that if ingested cause death such as Oleander or any of these:  http://homeguides.sfgate.com/poisonous-flowering-vines-38852.html and many more.

With Kratom I have been able to drastically reduce my intake of each of these pharmaceutical drugs, which all seemed to counteract each other and made me not feel like myself.  I have not experienced any adverse side effects with Kratom. \n\nKratom to me over the past 4 years that I have consumed it has greatly improved my quality of life and allowed me to be a better son, husband, father and friend. Please do not take away my right to use a natural substance that has helped me and so many others in many ways.  Thank you for reading my comments and God Bless America.\n\nThank you,\n\nDaniel\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19966","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel B","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17959","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Schultz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello.

As a chronic anxiety sufferer, I have looked for natural and legal ways to alleviate panic, overanxiousness, and insomnia. I tried the Bali strain of Kratom in a tea, as it is recommended for its relaxation properties, and found that it especially helps with my insomnia. As a side benefit, it really helps relieve occasional joint pain from overexercise. \n\nWhat is really surprising about the DEA's intent to schedule the herb is that in no way do I feel any kind of \"high\" from taking it. In addition, the tea tastes awful without some kind of way to cover up the flavor, so it's not \"fun\" to drink. So why on earth does it need to be a controlled substance? \n\nWith all of the horrors that go along with opiates and anti-anxiety drugs, I would think that Kratom should rather be promoted as a safer alternative to them. Kratom is also being researched for other health benefits. Please allow those who find that Kratom provides relief from crippling conditions to continue using it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5398","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Durham","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning this substance is going to cause more problems than it solves.

The only result of this was that I became addicted to the drug that was supposed to help me kick the first addiction. I finally became tired of that cycle, and after my addiction recovery doctor was killed in a hiking accident in 2014, I, along with all of his patients, were farmed-out to a local methadone clinic. I decided at that point that I'd had enough, so without any assistance at all, I knuckled down for a excruciating bout of withdrawal.\nA friend of mine had kicked opiates ( heroin) by using the plant Kratom. ( He's still clean 5 years later), and he suggested I try it; while I was dubious at first, I decided to. I was amazed by how effective Kratom was at keeping the withdrawal symptoms to a manageable level. I could work, I could function. I wasn't curled up in a ball somewhere with my body wracking from cramps and chills for weeks on end.\nI continued to use kratom because I found out that it was also very effective at treating my back pain which was what forced me onto prescription pain meds in the first place. With Kratom, I didn't need to take it everyday ( like I did opiates); I took it only when I was in pain and it was a very effective analgesic. I still take it occasionally, if I have a flare-up; and it helps me to live my life with a quality that opiate pain meds did not allow. If I happen to not have any Kratom, I don't go into withdrawal like I did with opiates and suboxone. It's not consuming my life the way that opiate pain meds did, where the only thing I cared about from the moment I woke up in the morning was watching the clock to see when I could take more pain pills.  This plant is a safe, gentle and natural 'wellness\" plant. I have been able to reduce my dose of Paxil ( an SSRI) by two-thirds. I no longer take any benzos ( ativan, xanax), drugs which I have been free from taking for over two years now. I don't suffer from depression anymore. I no longer fight anxiety attacks. This plant has saved my life, has allowed me to live with dignity; and given me a quality of life I would not otherwise have. I can work, play, sleep, function as normal. Please don't put this plant into the schedule 1, and please don't put it into the hands of Big Pharmacy, either. Thousands of people have been able to get their lives back because of Kratom. If people don't have it, they will immediately turn back to dangerous opiates in order to alleviate their pain. Please don't let that happen.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19000","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Donny Thompson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern,\n\nKratom is a miracle plant that deserves to not be classified as a schedule one narcotic.

I am a college graduate with a degree in criminal justice studies.  I work in the risk management/fraud recovery field full time, I am 30 years old.  I am very interested in using natural herbal supplements along with eating properly and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  I unfortunately suffer from insomnia, anxiety and depression.  Sleeping is hard for me.  Being a productive member of society takes a certain amount of sleep.  I became so desperate to find relief from the symptoms of anxiety and insomnia that I began self medicating with alcohol and sleeping pills.  Before I knew it, I was drinking almost every other day, if not every day, just to be able to sleep.  This is unfortunately not uncommon with people that suffer from these ailments.  I started trying natural supplements, such as melatonin, passion flower, and valerian root in order  to alleviate the symptoms.  I was introduced to kratom through a trusted family member.  I added it to my arsenal of supplements in hopes that I would see a difference.  That very same night, I was able to sleep.  I was able to focus at work and in social situations where normally I was not able to.  In no way am I saying that kratom was a cure-all, I am simply stating I found a regimine of natural supplements that have successfully relieved symptoms from my insomnia and anxiety.  I actually am a year sober now.  I like who I am now.  I have control back of my life now.  I am thankful I have found a natural supplement that alleviates my symptoms (along with my other supplements) that works for me.  Banning this supplement would take away the right we have as people to choose natural supplements over substances like alcohol and sleeping pills that are actually found to cause more damage than help.  Please consider the voice of the hundreds, if not thousands, of people that have found help in this supplement.  Do not take away our right to choose.

I have been using kratom for about seven months now and it has changed my life for the positive in many ways.   I am a manager at one of the busiest car washes in the country and kratom has helped me with my day to day struggles of inflammation in my joints.   I no longer need to take ibuprofen regularly,  which is very harmful to the stomach and cardiovascular system,  nor do I have to take my antidepressant Lexapro.  Before kratom,  when I was on lexapro,  I was 30 pounds heavier and had very high blood pressure.   I have now lost all of that weight and am healthy again.   I've never gotten \"high\"  from kratom nor have I experienced any bad side effects.   The only thing I have experienced is the joy of living again and being able to wake up without debilitating pain in my joints.   I also am no longer depressed and truly enjoy life again.   I can go days without kratom and experience no \"withdrawal symptoms\"  such as one would have with some prescription pain killers or muscle relaxers.  I also generally am very happy now and feel no need to take any prescription medication for depression.   Kratom has saved me from the endless cycle of taking prescription drug after prescription drug to cure ailments only to experience the side effects they cause.

Kratom makes it manageable without the side effects of prescription pills. It is not addicting and no chance of overdosing, only getting sick if you take too much. I cannot go pack to the opiates and other medications for the pain. Many people depend on Kratom to live a normal life. People depend on Kratom for opiate withdrawals. People use Kratom instead of cocaine, crack and many other non prescription drugs and prescription drugs. Please, I am begging you do not do this.

I was diagnosed with arthritis in knees and SI joint in my back. Other unexplained pain/inflammation in almost every joint in my body and chronic fatigue go undiagnosed. For 9 of the past 10 years I have progressively gotten worse. Dr's cannot figure out the cause and I basically gave up. My mobility was rapidly decreasing. I could no longer clean my own house due to the amount of pain and fatigue. I basically became a shut-In, not even wanting to participate in family or recreational events. I am a Mom, a Wife and I was the one who always hosted Thanksgiving and Christmas, decorating my entire house and putting on a gourmet spread. My family always looked forward to Holidays at our house and I could no longer even do that. I had gained 90 pounds and my marriage was suffering. I was a shell of my former active, life loving, social self. I had even felt like I no longer wanted to be here. Sleeping had become my only relief. I was about to begin the process to file for disability since even my sit at a desk, work from home job had become to hard to perform due to the fatigue. Eventually I had to have knee surgery and found relief with all my symptoms with the pain meds they prescribed after surgery. But I was only given 1 refill, then no more. Even though I told them it is helping me with all of my pain and fatigue. They are unwilling to prescribe pain meds. I started researching natural supplements that might help with pain or fatigue and about a year ago, I came across Kratom. I ordered some and the very 1st time I took it, I could not believe how much it helped with my pain. I tried different strains and each seemed to help with one or more of my symptoms. So I mix a comnbination of strains. With the help of Kratom, I notice my pain is about 80% gone. It has made living tolerable again. I have some energy again. I take it when the pain or fatigue gets unbearable. It does NOT make me feel high. Rather it takes away most of the pain and helps my symptoms to be tolerable and be able to do normal everyday things like cleaning house. I am more focused and productive at work now because I am not nodding off. I have never felt any bad side effects. I have never had hallucinations or anything of the sort. Kratom has made me once again a productive member of society. I have been able to feel like living and participating again. I have even lost 20 pounds because I am more active. I have never used any illegal drugs in my life and I feel if Kratom is made illegal, I will be forced back to the hell I was living before I found Kratom. Please research it fully and keep it legal. This is not a dangerous drug, but rather a natural supplement that has helped me tremendously where even Dr's could not.

I use it to help control my chronic pain. I have chronic back and leg pain due to an injury. I also have chronic pelvic pain due to a medical illness. The pelvic pain has left me in a state where I am unable to function without the use of pain medication. The name of my illness is Intersitial cystitis. In some people, myself included, the pain of this illness is comparable to renal failure and late stage bladder cancer. Essentially what I require is the pain relief of hospice care, but my illness is not life threatening. Before I discovered kratom, I would at times need to go to the emergency room to get an IV of dilaudid just to bring the pain down to a more tolerable level. Since kratom, I have avoided having to pay expensive hospital fees and have not taken up a bed, leaving room for other patients. Kratom controls my pain so that it rarely gets bad enough to require hospitalization. When it does get that bad, kratom is able to provide me with enough relief to get through the flair up without requiring hospitalization. None of the treatments for my condition, of which there are few, have been effective. I am allergic to the vast majority of prescription pain medication. Before kratom I would suffer horrible nausea and other side effects from the pain medications that I could take, because what pain medication I'm not allergic to, I have a sensitivity towards. I had to leave university due to my illness as well as quit my job. Once I started using kratom I was well enough to be able to work from home. I am still in severe pain every day. Kratom is not a miracle plant that gives me my life back. But it is a miracle in that it has been the only thing that has enabled me to work enough to help out with bills, clean and do some chores, and dress and feed myself. Without it, I am completely reliant upon others, unable to work, and a burden to my loved ones, though they do not like me saying it, it's the truth. Without kratom I am a burden and unable to contribute. With it, I can. I can be a better wife, daughter, aunt, sister, and friend with kratom. Without it, my quality of life is such that my existence revolves solely upon mentally fighting to get through each second of the day due to constant agonizing pain. Do not force me into complete helplessness. Do not take away my husband's wife from him. Do not take away the only thing that lets me enjoy life as much as I possibly can despite this agonizingly painful illness which has no known cause or cure. My pain is constant, it never goes away and it's been this way for a decade. I get no breaks from pain but with kratom, I experience some pain relief. Think about what it would mean for people like myself, who use kratom responsibly and depend upon it to be able to function in society before you ban such an incredibly useful plant. I urge you, do not force me into disability, into being a drain on society instead of a contributor. Do not take away my quality of life and the quality of life of millions of others who depend upon kratom. \nI thank you for reading my testimony and I hope you and your loved ones never develop an illness like I have. But god forbid, if they should, I sincerely hope they will have kratom as an option for some relief.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21582","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been shown in countless reports as a useful tool in recovery from various addictions (opiate primarily, and alcohol).

That is when I did research for pain management alternatives and found many personal stories of other people with similar problems that use Kratom for the same use as what I needed. If Kratom is made illegal you will be taking away an important pain management tool from countless people whose only alternative now will be addictive narcotics that kill people every day.

The Kratom is self limiting since it's only side affect is the slowing of the digestive tract and when taken in small doses, and adjusting my diet is manageable. The amount I use does not cause any elation or \"high\".

I've had 4 knee surgeries and I would always have problems by the middle of the day.  Im also big into weight lifting and it was hard working my lower body because of the pain in both my knees. I tried every over the counter pain medication you can think of with no luck so I turned to marijuana but absolutely hated the feeling of being high so therefore it was not helpful  to me in anyway. That's when I caved in and went to multiple doctors/therapist for all my problems but all they wanted to do was give me prescription after prescription. That's when I searched natural remedies for my depression/anxiety and that's when I came across Kratom but before I came to the conclusion that this plant could possibly help me, I did as much research as possible and I couldn't be more happier that I decided to try it. I have been using it for almost 8 years now, on and off. I make Kratom tea once in the morning and once at night. I have stopped multiple times with no side effects. This wonderful plant has helped me in so many ways. I can get a full nights sleep, waking up refreshed and energized. I can work a full day and then some without pain in my knees. By no means am I saying this is a cure for anything but my depression/anxiety has reduced significantly.

Pain pills almost ruined me I was staring at my shoe laces and drooling on myself. \nKratom = productive member of  Society \nPain Pills = zombie","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14424","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason Williams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My family will fall apart if Kratom is banned. My husband will lose his job if he has to return to opiates for his back. Doctors aren't prescribing opiates anymore so there's no way he would be able to work. We will have to sign up for welfare, food stamps, cash benefits or social security. My children will be devastated. Kratom gives us hope. It gives us happiness. Please reconsider banning this beautiful and harmless tree. It helps us to be productive members of society.

I knew I didn't want to be on pain pills all the time, yet nothing else seemed to help. Then I found out about kratom online, and my life was changed. I now use it daily to cope with my daily pain, which normally would make me miserable. This is not a drug, but a miracle plant. There is ZEROOOOO  reason this should be scheduled, AT ALL. \n\nDan Laughner\nErie,PA","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12666","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Laughner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 52 year old grandmother.  I have no criminal history, not even traffic tickets. I've never used illegal drugs, or even alcohol, in my lifetime. \n\nI have severe degenerative arthritis in my knees, spine, and hip. My pain was being managed with NSAID drugs until 10 months ago. At that time, I was diagnosed with Stage 4 kidney disease. \n\nBecause of my kidney disease, the only prescription pain medications I can take are OxyContin and Diluadid. All traditional arthritis medications are off limits to me. Not wanting to take narcotics, I searched for an alternative, natural method to help my pain, and found Kratom. \n\nIf Kratom becomes illegal, I will be forced to take dangerous narcotics for the rest of my life. Please don't put me in that position. \n\nSincerely, \n\nRoberta E.
