It has helped enormously with my generalized anxiety and depression and has helped me to avoid my previous attraction to more addictive, dangerous, and illegal substances. I use kratom as a dietary supplement alongside other more well known supplements such as chamomile, passion flower, and melatonin. By using kratom on conjunction with these other supplements I have found a more comfortable method to prevent my tattered home life from tearing me apart mentally without feeling dependent on any specific substance. I used to have to attend therapy once a week and was at one point dependent on benzodiazepines because of my generalized anxiety. After finding a therapist interested in treating the cause of my issues as opposed to treatment of the symptoms I was able to address my dependence on illegal or pharmaceutical substances and work out a harm reduction plan that would also help alleviate some of the symptoms while I work on the cause of the symptoms. Using this system I have successfully overcome issues that seemed otherwise impossible and have become comfortable enough to address my issues without constant therapy. I hope you can understand how kratom has helped me and I hope you don't intend to prevent it from helping others that could be in a much worse situation than myself.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5284","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jacob Hanzel","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My friend really needs this for her anxiety.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20321","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is an amazing natural product that I use to relieve my early onset of arthritis in my knee.

I have had 3 back surgeries. Gone through several years of pain management and the addictions that come with that course of action. Including the withdrawals when I decided to stop pain management. What changed was my wanting to feel the world while in it,but not hurt so miserably I longed for death. Kratom has offered me a simple way to manage my pain. If I take too much I get almost instantaneously sick,a big deterrent to avoiding that. I have little to no ill effects if I don't take it for several days. A BIG difference from the fentanyl patches I was on. (150 mcgh)  Simply put,I can't speak as to others' effects or experiences with kratom.

People who have suffered from pain, suffered from addiction , suffered from ptsd, suffered from other ailments ,have found their cure.  it seems as though kratom has been the safe answer to relieving symptoms and helping people get back on track to a happy and successful life. I'm not saying this plant should be out for everyone to grab, matter of fact I think there needs to be more research period , but to be considered a schedule 1 drug is absolutely ridiculous . I am not hippocrate , I have personally tried this substance now a handful of times , from personal experience smaller doses such as .3-.5 mg to .8 mg I have felt muscle soreness relief, headache relief, and uplift in mood. The only side effect I have noticed is nausea and vomiting due to lack of knowledge on dosage , it wasn't the end of the world and matter of fact once I threw up I was back to myself , unlike experience with alcohol that has left me hours or even days hungover . This plant may not be for me,  but knowing that it can save lives and prevent addicts from going down dark depressing paths is enough evidence for this drug to be investigated and utilized for its benefits . I understand that with new, hardly investigated substances , it's easy for one to label this as a drug and prevent people from getting their hands on it ,  and rightfully so if you are concerned about health and prevention of injury , but it is well known that this plant is not causing problems otherwise people wouldn't be on forums like this pleading to keep it legal. If anything, the long term effects are something unknown, and for that reason it is time for research to begin . I respect your time , and ask honestly to please reconsider this ban . I know it must be a tough position on your end , but please don't let greed override you , don't let money be a factor on you . Enough is enough, plants are not dangerous, it's people that are dangerous, anything and everything can be abused , it takes education and leading by example to help others around us . There are certainly drugs out there that deserve to be labeled as schedule 1, but there are plants / natural substances , amidst that list that are life changing , and beneficial To people , to us! Enough of the boundaries , one nation one love .

Myself, friends, and family have all received the benefits of Kratom.  From social anxiety, chronic pain, depression, pain relief, sleeping disorders, and many more Kratom  has not only helped my family and friends in these areas but has kept them off of extremely harmful medications and painkillers that not only destroy people's lives but are highly addictive and have a laundry list of side effects.  I have a corporate job, a wonderful family life, and have kicked multiple habits including alcohol and pain killers with the help of Kratom. It has giving me a second chance at being a successful and functioning part of society.  Those of us that choose to use Kratom are a community of driven and focused individuals and we chose herbal supplements over the already corrupt pharmaceutical companie's products. We have chosen to not ignore the harmful effects of pescription medications in ignorance, but turn to a solution that has been used for thousands of years with a wealth of knowledge and history to back it. We are the American people who make a difference in the lives of those around a us and we have found a safe, legal way to do that on our own. I ask the DEA to acknowledge its hasty decision and I urge the DEA to humble themselves enough to let this prosperous, strong, and functioning group of society continue on their journey and path utilizing an herb. Hear our voices and realize statistically speaking that Kratom is not a threat but a solution. Alcohol and prescription drugs have critical and fatal consequences on society yet both of those are considered perfectly normal methods to medicate.  We the people have spoken, we signed a petition and now you are hearing us individually as well as collectively. Please help us in restoring our faith in a branch of the federal government that has the power to take as well as give if it chooses too with this decision.

I believe rather than make these individuals criminals further research should be done on Kratom to test its medicinal properties as well as its potential to harm its users. I also believe that whether or not Kratom is a dangerous drug it should be regulated rather than outlawed, if Kratom is made illegal then its users are put at greater risk. Regulations ensures that people have access to safer drugs that are not mixed with other potentially more harmful drugs, such as with the heroin users getting bad batches which lead to fatal overdoses. In conclusion it is my belief that if the DEA truly wants to protect american citizens it would push for regulation of Kratom rather than criminalization. In order to ensure that users who will continue to use the drug dispute the DEA's ruling will be safe. In America we believe in freedom for everyone; as adults we should have freedom of consciousness and how we alter our consciousness.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12037","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jameen Blizzard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"hello, my name is Justin Gorris and I have used kratom to help with the pain from my fibromyalgia. when I was 19 I started having horrible nerve pain which led to doctors prescribing me cocktails of drugs including antidepressants and pain killers. It made me feel like a zombie. long story short it led me into a horrible heroin addiction which inevitably led to felony charges. I am currently serving a here year sentence to the halfway house in Colorado due to a false information to a pawn broker charge. I successfully completed a 90 day inpatient rehab program in the halfway house. after that, I started the residential program where I lived there but got to leave for work and be part of the community again. after 6 months I completed that part and tatted the non residential part of the program. I lived in a sober living house and worked full time. after seven months I was tested for kratom which I immediately told the director of the house I have been taking kratom for 9 months at that time to help with the nerve pain from my fibromyalgia. I was given the approval from the halfway house while I was still a resident and right after I completed the rehab portion that I could go back to a pain management doctor and be prescribed pain killers. I asked if I could take herbal substances instead and my case worker approved it. I decided that I did not want to be on pharmaceuticals any longer and wanted to try a more natural substance. after I had talked to the sober living director they understood and asked me what my nonresident case worker would say. I went to talk to her about the issue and was told she does not approve and was sanctioned and put back into the halfway house until I saw the review board. now termination and prison sentence were on the table. I have been law abiding, drug and alcohol free now for 19 months. I also work full time and have been promoted to substantial manager at the factory I work. after all of this I am now facing prison time because I chose to take a natural supplement with little risk of health issues or abuse. this is not right or sensible to be criminalizing this herb when it has saved my life from pain killers and heroin. prescribed or illegally obtained. please reconsider this ban. I do not deserve to go to prison and lose everything I've worked so hard for over the past two years to change my life because I chose a natural substance over doing what I have done before and be addicted to legally prescribed opiates which lead to nothing but disaster.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5017","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"justin gorris","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 59-year-old Medical Technologist working in a large multi-specialty lab and have used Kratom for pain associated with a severe spinal injury, both pre- and post-op. I felt highly compelled to find a safe, non-addictive alternative to the potent pain medications (Oxycontin and Fentanyl) that were being prescribed. After much research, I found a promising natural herb called Kratom. I was able to obtain it from a reputable vendor and found it to be highly effective at relieving my pain. While awaiting surgery and through the lengthy post-surgical recovery I was able to successfully manage my pain using Kratom, with none of the adverse reactions associated with opioid medications. It did not interfere with my ability to think clearly and I had no need to increase the dosage over time due to the tolerance or dependence that often develops with opioids. When I recovered and no longer needed pain management I was able to discontinue using the Kratom with no withdrawal symptoms and no lingering effects. \nI, along with many others, have found Kratom to be a safe, effective, non-addictive alternative for pain management with none of the unpleasant or dangerous side effects associated with opioid medications and no loss of mental clarity. Claims that Kratom has no meaningful medical benefits have been made without taking the time to analyze existing research, conduct further research or study anecdotal evidence of the positive effects Kratom has to offer. Given the current opioid crisis, it is worth doing the work to investigate the possible benefits Kratom has to offer, particularly as a safe alternative to these dangerous and highly addictive opiate medications. However, placing the active components of Kratom, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, into a Schedule I would effectively halt further scientific investigation due to the stringent federal licensing required and the inability to obtain enough Kratom to study once it is banned. Therefore, banning Kratom for having no accepted medical use makes it unlikely a medical use will be found due to the inability to research it further once the ban is in place. Please do not let this happen. Let my voice and the voice of many other Americans who have benefited from Kratom be heard.\n \nThank You for your time and consideration,\nKimberlee Bonnell\nNewberg, Oregon","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5880","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"KimberLee Bonnell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My brother who was a heavy user of opiates and almost lost his life numerous times after getting addicted after a regular injury from doctors who kept prescribing him opiate pills.

Kratom allows me to live a normal life without the worry of pain pill addiction or possible overdose.\n\nI do not believe that the DEA should place Kratom on the Schedule 1 list of controlled substances and thereby restricting the citizens of the US from being able to benefit from this amazing plant.  \n\nI have taken Kratom 4-6 times every day for the last 4+ years and have never felt sick or had any negative side effects.\n\nI also wanted to comment on Kratom and how it has helped me in my life.  I found out about Kratom by searching online for natural pain relievers.  I had racked up several thousands of dollars worth of debt at a Pain center, and a chiropractor, neither of which helped me much at all.  It was unsustainable for me to continue receiving treatment at those places when it wasn't really helping me.  I took Tramadol and Diclofenac for 3 years, up to 9 pills a day (6 tramadol and 3 diclofenac per day) to manage my pain.  I began to worry that I was damaging my body by taking so many prescription pills.  WIth long term use of Diclofenac, there are dramatic increases in fatal heart attacks. \n\nOnce I started taking Kratom, I slowly stopped taking the prescriptions.  They weren't helping me nearly as much as Kratom was and it was costing me too much money to continue getting pills.  After a year of taking Kratom, I was able to stop taking any pills at all!\n\nI have tried almost all of the available treatments that I could basically afford, from physical therapy to massage/chiropractics, even had a medical marijuana card for 2 years.  Marijuana didn't help nearly as much as Kratom so I didn't renew my card.  Nothing has helped my body like Kratom has.  \n\nThere are many people that I know in the same situation, who have had back surgeries or other chronic pain.  I introduced them to Kratom and they stopped all of the other remedies.  \n\nKratom really has improved my life dramatically.  My pain affects my ability to work, to be present with my family, and whether I can get out of bed or not.  Because of Kratom, I know that I can live a normal, productive life and serve our city and our church worry free and almost pain free.\n\nI urge you at the DEA to consider the negative implications of making this plant illegal.  PLEASE do not ban Kratom.  It helps too many people with little/no risk of hurting anyone.  I'm proof of that.\n\nThank you for your consideration,\nTimothy K.

I can take it for pain and still feel alert, functional, and able to have a productive day.  Compared to my experience with other preventative and acute medications prescribed by my neurologist, side effects are practically non-existent.

Unlike alcohol, I have found Kratom to be a 100% safe, non-harmful, non-sedating, light-stimulant herbal tea. I am a chronic sufferer of clinical depression, and similar to coffee, Kratom helps to keep me healthy, and in a positive state of mind, so I can continue to be a productive member of society. \nScheduling or banning such a mundane, and helpful plant, such as Kratom, would not only be a travisity of justice, I fear it would set an extreamly dangerous prescient for the future of our constutional rights as Americans, when there are so many other extreamly harmful, dangerous, and deadly substances that are 100% legal, such as... alcohol, cigarettes, energy-drinks, artificial sweeteners, processed sugar, food-preservatives, vitimens, etc.\n\nFor the record; I am responsible for the development of military simulation software, and electronic entertainment, which has helped the recruitment, and positive reinforcement, of US military personal, for well over two-decades. It was recently brought to my attention that many of these combat veterans, whom suffer from (post-combat) PTSD, Anxiety, Depression, Alcoholism, and Opioid Addiction, have been greatly helped by Kratom. Again, I was extreamly disapointed when I hear that the very government, in-which these great American have dedicatedly served, want to hurt these service members, by making them criminals, when all they want to do is maintain being honorable, productive, law abiding members of society (not unlike myself).\n\nI sincerely hope that the DEA and FDA can produce a logical, legal, unbiased, and rational clinical study of the plant known as Kratom, before moving to schedule and ban such a harmless and helpful plant from our great nation. \n\nSincerely,\n\nChris Borders\nUS Citizen, Humane Reporter, Casting Director, Interactive Developer, and CEO.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0483","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Borders","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Let's be real here for a minute. Kratom has benefited hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans and citizens across the world for decades. It is not synthetic. It is not a drug. It is a leaf from a tree, indigenous to Southeast Asia. It is known to aid in the relief of dozens of ailments from pain, anxiety and depression to digestive issues, PTSD, and withdrawals from opiates. Consumers range from the young,  to the middle aged, to the eldery. They are moms, dads, military veterans, teachers, law enforcement, doctors, lawyers, disabled, and those looking to rid their lives of dangerous narcotics. Prohibition doesn't work. The war on drugs was fought and lost. The vast majority of kratom consumers are responsible adults, capable of making educated decisions about what they do or don't put in their own body. You know the deaths you reported were not due to kratom alone. You know there are doctors, scientists, and researchers emploring you to reconsider your stance. You know this is not an imminent threat to the public. You know there are perfectly legal substances from Tylenol to laundry pods that have done more damage every year, than what you reported on Kratom in the last five years. If you want an age restriction, fine. If you want special wording on packaging and no brightly colored packaging, fine. If want vendors to be registered, fine. If you want quality control, fine. Do NOT take this away from the millions of people whose lives have changed for the better. Do NOT require a prescription. You CAN'T make it a prescription. You can try, but you will not succeed in recreating all of the benefits from a plant with more than 2 dozen alkaloids, but using only a few. Also, while reading through all of these comments, I surely hope you don't base your final decision on the language some of the average laymen may use. It is widely known, based on fights in other industries that you should not use medical claims or use words like treat or cure. Doctors should know this. Scientists should know this. Vendors should know this. Don't expect Jane and John Doe to know it. Obviously, Kratom doesn't cure anything and saying so is irresponsible. The word \"treat\" is debatable. People treat a bad mood to a night out with friends or a ride in a car with the radio blaring.  People treat anxiousness at the end of the day, to a cup of chamomile tea. So how about just listen to their story and how this plant benefits them instead. Please focus on real, serious issues like the current heroin epidemic and leave this safe,  natural herb and it's many consumers alone. We will fight you every step of the way, for as long as it takes until we are given our god given right to choose what is in our own best interests of our health and happiness.

This included being completely exhausted 24 hours a day, avoiding people, inability to keep a job or maintain friendships. This happened very suddenly for me. I had always had many friends, very outgoing, I actually very easily  made new friends everywhere I went. Then for no reason at all, everything became very difficult. Being happy became difficult. Over the next 7 years I would try several different antidepressants, ADHD medications, and anxiety medications. All of which failed to work, made me feel worse, or worked but then stopped working. These medications include Paxil, Prozac, Wellbutrin, buspar, pristiq, Zoloft, straterra, adderall, and klonopin. I had dropped out of school and was successfully going nowhere in life. One day a friend told me about something that he thought would help; Kratom. After first trying it, my fatigue lifted, my anxiety vanished, and I felt genuinely happy for the first time in years. This has led to daily use for the last 8 years. During this time I have earned 2 degrees and served as a graduate teaching assistant in my graduate program. I have also maintained an amazing relationship over the last 7 years. Kratom  is extremely safe. There is a limit as to how much one can take to receive benefits.  Too much will just make you nauseous and lazy. I have had one bad experience over the 8 years I have been taking Kratom, and it was because I bought from a new vendor that sent me something else other than Kratom just to make some money off of me. Like any medication, it can interact with other things and those interactions need to be studied and made public. Any serious health issues related to Kratom come from kids or irresponsible adults stuffing their bodies full of things they know nothing about. Before you make your decision please understand that if you take Kratom away,  you are dooming me to roll the dice on pharmaceuticals that have failed me too many times before. I don't have time to put my life on hold while I find something that works. Please make your decision based on evidence by the scientific community and by those of us that have used it responsibly to better ourselves and the lives of those around us.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20539","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeremy Megginson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used Kratom for the last few months after recently hearing about it.

I know it and whatever suit reading this knows it too. First with marijuana, and now with the medication I will refer to as kratom. \nI was in a horrible car accident that shattered my c7 vertebrae and fractured my c6 vertebrae. Needless to say, the 2 surgeries performed on my neck, and the metal cage that resides in there now, have given me a great deal of pain. I'm now a quadraplegic with limited hand function, and no feeling or movement from the chest down. Pushing a manual chair is my only option, which is fine with me, however, the shoulder pain isn't chronic, it's constant. In addition to this I have quite a deal of anxiety, ptsd, and depression. So here comes a powder that NO ONE has ever overdosed on. It helps my pain, both nerve and muscular. It also helps with my anxiety, insomnia,depression, appetite and a generally makes this horrible reality a bit more enjoyable. Well now it's illegal. As a result of this I take Zoloft, an ssri that makes me a zombie and has caused weight gain in a bad way. I'm taking OxyContin, which is chemically equivalent to heroin. I'm taking Valium and Ativan for my social anxiety, which are two of the most addictive drugs on the planet. Everyone knows this, nobody cares. I'm also taking lyrica for my nerve pain which makes me feel like laughing and crying at the same time, in a horrible way. In addition to this I'm taking soma, which another very addictive drug for muscle spasms. I would dare any of you to take this combination and tell me how you feel. I feel like a chemically induced zombie and Pfizer is thriving, the world turns, who cares. Alcohol is legal. Alcohol kills people. Tobacco is legal, it kills people.

It's a harmless plant that helps so many people and myself. There are  many other things that the DEA could be spending time on. This leaf has been used for 1000 years as a herbal remedy. By itself it's not hurting anyone. There are people out there that could get addicted to an aspirin because they have that kind of personality but that's not where 99% of us are at that enjoy sipping Kratom tea and benefit from this amazing herbal remedy.  \n\nKratom has a built in mechanism where if you ingest too much you get a belly ache, 99% of us don't take more than 2-3 grams a one or twice a day for some Herbal relief of many ailments and conditions without the side effects of the other drugs that are out there that really are hurting abusers and druggies. I hope that the DEA uses their time and resources for going after abusers and drug addicts that are killing themselves with Narcotics and other junk illegally and offering programs for those that have legally prescribed pain med problems. Kratom is not the enemy, it was just an easy target. \n\nUnfortunately some horrible people manufactured a drug called Kryptom Kratom. Kratom was spiked heavily with Tramidol, actually a very concentrated dose of Tramidol called O-desmethyltramado and this horribel Vendor used the Kratom name to sell his concoction to the masses. Kratom itself and by itself does not kill people. If this vendor used ST. Johns Wart instead of Kratom then the DEA would probably be trying to make St. Johns Wart a Schedule 1 drug, don't get confused here and take a perfectly safe herbal remedy away from hundreds of thousands of people. \n\nThere are more calls to the poison control center with people eating too much Fluoride toothpaste than there is with straight Kratom by itself. It's not Kratoms fault that drug abusers go out and take multiple illegal drugs and add a little Kratom to it and then, BAM you want to just blame the Kratom if the drug abuser gets sick or passes away from ALL of the illegal drugs in their system, it has never just been Kratom, ever. Kratom is a clean Herbal Supplement and I pray to God that you leave it alone. There are enough other things out there that you can take off the market.\n\nI take Kratom because it's safe, I don't feel like I've taken anything but I do notice a remarkable difference in my daily nerve, bone and tendon pain, not like when you take a narcotic and you might feel funny afterward, Kratom doesn't do that, you just notice that you didn't hurt as much today, you feel a sense of well being, you feel a little more normal and more hope for your day, that you'll have a better day, a more productive day. Anyone that doesn't live with chronic pain throughout your body or live with panic attacks from anxiety, (Kratom seems to help with this as well) will never understand what it's like that your own government may take away something that helps you manage your daily life. It hurts, it makes you mistrust your government.\n\nI think of all of the Narcotic Addicts out there that are clean and taking Kratom Tea to help them not go back to Heroin and other Narcotics, if you take away this currently legal supplement that has been proven safe when ingested by itself and the good it does by far outweighs any bad, well that seems like a heck of an overreach to most of us. Could the government be wanting to make some money off Kratom, take it away from all of us, just to figure it out, bottle it and profit from it in someway??? \n\nThe distrust that we now have with your agency is caused from you only giving 30 days notice to all of us that you were going to take Kratom away from all of us, a natural remedy that has been around for more than 1000 years. There is a lot of  distrust towards your agency now. What do you think those Heroin addicts will do when you take it away? They didn't like the prescription drugs that are supposed to help them with their addictions, the addiction to those drugs was almost as bad as the drug that they got addicted to in the first place. Not so with Kratom. If you take Kratom away from we the people, you will see hoards of Heroin Addicts going right back to Heroin, you will see retired soldiers and civilians both turning back to prescription drugs and if those aren't available you will see the illegal drug market soar, it will not be good and you will be to blame 100%.

The kratom has helped me live a normal life and be the best possible mother I can be. I have not experienced a  'high' from kratom or any negative side effects.

I have been using kratom for the last 3 years and it has allowed me to surrender my dependence on non-narcotic and narcotic anxiety medication which used to put me in a mental fog all the time and pretty much neutralized all of my emotions which I really didn't like. I feel Kratom effectively reduces my anxiety while not having any of the adverse side effects of prescription anxiolytics and tranquilizers including fatigue, lethargy & drowsiness which were the worst side effects of all. There is no physical withdrawal with Kratom if you discontinue use in comparison to the horrible physical symptoms you experience with narcotic prescription medication.  There have been publicized stories of people misusing Kratom which is why we are in the predicament we are currently up against with this ban. If you misuse any substance it could have negative consequences so lets not let a few bad apples and greedy drug companies take this incredible leaf illegal. I personally like to use Kratom therapeutically. I drink it in a hot tea form which I find is the most effective method of experiening the anxiety relieving properties of kratom. I would be devastated if i couldnt continue to use this product which has provided me with the best solution to a medical condition which I have suffered from my entire life.

I suffer from Fibromyalgia. \n\nMy story started in 2003 I was racing bicycles and had huge sponsors including a major energy drink manufacturer. I used to drink one a day and that was it. I was young, in shape and no health problems. \n\nThe energy drinks ended up eroding my stomach lining and I ended up getting a bloody ulcer that erupted and I lost 3 pints of blood. I blacked out and the last thing I remember is my mother tell me to hold on. \n\nFast forward six months. First symptoms started to appear. Pain that I cannot even explain, problem after problem, symptom after symptom. 25 emergency room visits, 57 doctor visits. Nobody could figure out what was wrong with me. 3 years I suffered with pain. It hurt me mentally, physically and emotionally. I suffered, my family suffered, my career suffered. \n\nFinally one doctors visit they decided to test me for something called fibromyalgia. It was positive. \n\nThe only FDA approved medication for Fibro was an anti-depressant (undoubtably that is the answer to everything). The one thing you DON'T do is put someone who is not depressed on an anti-depressant. \n\nI cannot even begin to explain what that medication did to me mentally. The pain went away but so did my sanity. I have never once in my life ever even thought about suicide. I did on that medication. \n\nLuckily by my side is an amazing woman! My wife is the glue that held this family together. She did so much research trying to help me. She found a fibromyalgia forum and one of the people on there told her about an all natural plant that was having very positive results. \n\nAfter doing some more research and hearing all the testimonies I decided I was going to quit the horrible medication and I was going to give this plant a try. \n\nThe first day of trying it, was the first day in a very long time I felt like my old self. NO pain, no hurting, no fog, nothing. I felt like me. Energized, happy and I did not feel high. I felt like me!!!!!\n\nThat was four years ago. My family and myself struggled for so long and to be normal has really changed our life. I now run a Fortune 500 company and my life couldn't be better. Best of all I haven't had a single pain or any other symptoms for four years!!! \n\nThis is all thanks to a natural plant called Kratom!!!! \n\nAll of this started because of something that is legal (energy drinks) but has been resolved by something you are trying to make not.\n\nI beg you, I plead to you! Do not ban this plant. I do not want my life to go back to the way it was. I do not want the pain or any other symptom to come back.....I love my life!!!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2904","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Aaron Horner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do more research before making Keaton a schedule 1 narcotic.

As such I've been prescribed codeine, tramadol, morphine and oxycodone and have been quite dependent on them while tolerance increased rapidly. I experienced side effects ranging from constipation to depression and spent most of my days in bed, unable to work. When I quit those I started using kratom. I found few side effects and that I was able to manage my pain better. In fact I felt motivated to exercise, swim, and do daily yoga, all of which help with my conditions and alleviate the depression and anxiety I struggle with. There are many common herbal remedies I have tried over the years. Kratom has been most beneficial, and has caused me fewer problems than things commonly available on the shelves of any drug store. Of course it's not without some small risks, but they are less than Tylenol. \nI will admit a vested interest. I eventually gained employment at the location I purchase my kratom. Daily I deal with happy, functional people who have their lives back after descending into addiction to opioids, alcohol and benzodiazepines. With the first of these, many had tried methadone or suboxone and relapsed or were unable to tolerate it. Their stories can be quite graphic and heart wrenching. I and they feel strongly that kratom was a valuable ally in emerging from those diminished states. I fervently hope they needn't descend back there should their herbal supplements be unavailable. \nBy all means, regulations that test for adulterants and truth in labeling are a benefit for all, but a complete ban will not serve the public interest or health and will exacerbate a crisis that has claimed and continues to claim far too many.

Main thing I want to say is, you do not get 'high' off it and you do not have cravings. I know what cravings are because I used to be addicted. And than I made the mistake of being prescribe suboxone and was worse than when I started off. Then I tried kratom to help me get of suboxone, and it worked. It instantly took away my withdrawals with the high and cravings of wanting me. Now I am able to take my meds without abusing them, because kratom helped me to not crave, just take what you need to get through day. I am a 35 year old full-time graphic artist and print shop manager at a newspaper, not some loser junkie. And I would be able to do kratom and function perfectly normal at work. Now I am very sorry some people have over dosed on this and died. But I am pretty sure those KIDS (not adults) had other things in there system that caused their death. I don't think anyone over 18 has died from Kratom. And people od on pills all the time, but the DEA doesn't take the option away from doctors being able to prescribe them. And weed is 100 x times more potent than kratom, and it is legal. I there scientific proof that a person with no other substances in the system can actually die from ingesting too much kratom. Don't forget if you ingest too much of it, you naturally vomit it up, saving you form potential overdoes. Now as for tinctures, maybe those should be in question, because you can ingest as much as you won't and not vomit, and I don't think that is good. I have not tried this, but I understand you can't smoke kratom either, because if doesn't work, so that is a positive thing as well. I am a Christian and I think this plant it helping people get out of a man made mess called addiction. I am sure suboxone and methadone clinics are against kratom, because they are losing money the most important thing to them. This medicine has helped me and is 100% better than other drug of addiction treatment because you don't get high and there is no cravings.  Thank you for reading my comment please make it to where people above 18 years of age can buy kratom powder (not tincture) to improve there quality of life. It is already too hard for pain patients to get pain pill and now they might not get kratom. It is only a matter of time before heroin use spikes, which it already has. And big Pharma will have there dream. 1000's of people needing methadone and suboxone.

Unless you know her well you might be surprised to find out she has a debilitating pain disorder. For 15 years she has suffered with Fibromyalgia which has no effective medical treatment, nothing available has worked. Doctors still don't even know what causes it. About four years ago my wife discovered a natural supplement Kratom that has been used by people safely for centuries. She did her own research, learned about people's experiences and eventually made the decision to try it. Adding it to her healthy lifestyle she was able to start living her life again, not perfect..just possible. It doesn't cure or treat her fibromyalgia, but has given her a new lease on life, and hope. I have never tried it. I did my own research and decided it's not for me. Living in a free society means taking responsibility for one's own choices. My wife has been responsibly and legally consuming Kratom for years and I can't argue with the results. There are no negative \"drug\" highs, she is not nodding off or staring into space. She is herself again, the woman I married.  The real issue is the negative consequences criminalizing a safe supplement will have on thousands of honest law abiding citizens. These are good people who are suffering and benefit from this natural plant.

I am the owner and operator of a small landscape maintenance business, and am building a beef cattle farm from raw land.  In October of 2001, I was diagnosed with Lyme disease which has profoundly impacted the course and quality of my life.  Despite years of intensive antibiotic therapy, I remain unable to rid myself of this disease. Of the myriad symptoms that I experience on a daily basis, severe joint pain and crushing fatigue are omnipresent.   Additionally, a lifetime of hard labor, and several traumatic accidents has left my back with significant chronic pain.  \nI have been taking prescribed opioid pain medication since 2002.  While these substances do provide some relief, I have found the quality of the pain management to be significantly lacking.  Now with all of the government interference in the healthcare industry, particularly with opioids, it has become a significant burden to obtain my prescribed medication. Due to new regulation, only one month supply is dispensed at a time, and an office visit must occur for refills.  The time demands and financial burden was significant. Indeed, these difficulties in providing for adequate pain management had brought me to the verge of having to give my physically active career and lifestyle. \nAbout one year ago I discovered the herb Kratom, and it has significantly changed my pain management protocol, and outlook.  Kratom useage has provided me with unrivaled reduction in my pain level, and has allowed me to dramatically reduce, and at times eliminate my use of the prescribed hydrocodone. After enduring 16 years of daily, severe pain, the periods of a near absence of pain provided by Kratom leaf is a gift that I had thought I would never again experience. This herb also provides a boost in energy and mood that is a welcome respite from the daily grind of Lyme disease.  The financial savings to my family from not needing to visit my doctor monthly have been significant.  Being able to order such an effective tool over the internet , and have it show up at my door is a godsend of convenience. \nIt would be my great preference that the government keep its hands out of my healthcare, and leave Kratom alone. I do however realize that government will never restrain itself, and that some form of regulation is forthcoming. I would urge that any regulatory actions be limited to quality assurances, and age restriction.  In case you have not noticed, the American people have just expressed, in a very significant way, their frustration with government.  This recent attempt at emergency scheduling of a LEAF is just another example of how far removed we are from a state of liberty, and why so many people are so frustrated with the federal government. Please respect the rights of the people to choose whatever botanical tools they may wish.  Any actions by you that preclude the ability to freely obtain this herb will result in a dramatic reduction in the quality of my, and many others lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8641","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bryce Hoyland","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is absolutely absurd, there is obviously a financial motivation behind the push for it to be scheduled.

You may hear people argue about the benefits, but the truth is it has helped millions with pain, depression, and addiction. I personally have seen that. I went from needing illicit drugs or heavy narcotics to being able to ease myself off and back to a regular life with Kratom. When seeing this ban pop up it makes me think of the war on cannabis. It makes me realize that my comments will be thrown away just because financial motivation is greater than scientific evidence or logic. We need to move forward as a nation, and I don't ever see that happening if we insist on burying our heads in the sand and ignoring reality. The reality is someone will always want to control the supply of something sought after, Big Pharma pushed for this ban after getting all the synthetics they wanted by studying it's actual benefits and chemicals. They pushed to make sure they won't have to compete to make money on it. It makes no sense that we keep putting drugs as schedule 1, as non-medicinal with high potential of abuse, while Big Pharma pumps them out by the tons daily and freely calls it schedule 2.

On April 21st 2014 I was on duty and gave chase to theft suspects. I jumped a six foot fence and landed on my right leg. When my right leg made contact with the ground I heard a loud snap and felt my knee give to the right. Naturally when loosing balance the human body attempts to regain balance so I replaced my foot on the ground and again my knee gave to the left which caused my left leg to loose footing causing me to fall on the ground. As I sat there waiting for the pain to come I pull out my firearm in case someone wanted to take advantage of my injury and attack me.\n\nAfter a few seconds I stand up and begin to walk \"baby steps\" to see how injured I was. During this time my knee snapped several times and I had to hop on one foot to the fence I jumped to hold myself up. I didn't want to call dispatch over the radio because quite frankly no matter how many people showed up I don't think they could get me across the fence. I look around and see a small four foot cattle fence. I hop to and roll my body over the cattle fence. I hop up someone's back yard and into the street. After an hour I get back to my patrol car and get transported to the hospital.\n\nI get an MRI later in the week and discover severe damage in the Meniscus and ACL was completely severed in my right knee. I had no choice but to have surgery. After surgery this is when the pain became unbearable. The hydrocodone I was prescribed was not working well enough and felt like needles in my right knee when I would move it. I took hydrocodone like M&Ms because it simply did not work for more than 3 hours. My tolerance to hydrocodone grew and to really manage the pain became even more of a challenge. Around this time I discovered Kratom and with nothing to lose tried it. I would take kratom before my physical therapy sessions and was able to move better and work harder than before. Unfortunately it didn't help me sleep at night but at least my knee wasn't on fire. \n\nToday I have full function in my right knee and I owe it to the effect kratom had while I was in physical therapy. But unfortunately for me the Meniscus in my right knee was so bad the only way to fix it was to have a knee replacement which I was too young for. Today I take Kratom two times a day once in the morning and once at night. Without it my knee becomes inflamed after a jog and to be honest I can't afford to be a limp duck when I place myself in a life threatening situation everyday. I can't afford to have severe knee pain when at any minute I may have to run after someone or God forbid a shooting. Kratom is not perfect. My knee is not perfect with kratom but it definitely becomes manageable. Sometimes my knee gets really tired but for the most part the kratom helps. I owe my safety and ability to this amazing herb. I've taken kratom ever since and my tolerance has no grown significantly. I don't know what I would do if kratom became scheduled. \n\n\nSincerely,\n\nBrooks Cash","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12524","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brooks Cash","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Eric Hutton, and I'm a 37 year old Doctor of Pharmacy working in a retail setting. Ever since graduating school and assuming a full-time position (an \"upright\" one, at that), I've dealt with a significant amount of back pain--significant not in its severity, but in its unrelenting presence--as well as the fatigue and stress that come with any job where your entire day is spent on your feet, often with the phone pressed between your shoulder and your ear. After several failed attempts to find something \"wrong\" with me (X-rays, MRI, ultrasound, etc.), I was starting to consider seeing a pain management specialist (and there are several in the vicinity of my work, so I was familiar with the types of treatment they offer). Still, I was hesitant, because without an official diagnosis, and an unwillingness to \"play up\" my pain level on command, I doubted they'd take me seriously. Plus, I got to see the cycle of dependency on a daily basis--patients who started out with a broken arm or some surgical procedure being prescribed short-term opioids, which gradually turns into long-term use, until they're referred to pain management where regular, around-the-clock opioids become a staple of the patient's regimen indefinitely (unless they're weaned off with an expensive prescription of suboxone, which often turns into an indefinite treatment itself). Luckily, it was right around this time that I discovered kratom. I was extremely skeptical that it would do anything, but within 30 minutes or so of consuming it for the first time, there was a mild but noticeable lift in my mood and energy, which then seemed to make the nagging pain more tolerable. After an initial period of finding the right level for me, I was able to take it at work, and get reliable relief that was just enough to enable me to smile and be engaged with our patients, even at the end of a 12 hour shift. The effects are about as noticeable as a strong cup of coffee (maybe two), but instead of being solely a nervous, jittery buzz, it provides a balanced sense of clarity and well-being. I've been taking kratom for nearly four years now, and have not had to escalate my usage to achieve the same effects. I've discussed it with my primary care physician, and he is thrilled that I've found something natural that alleviates my discomfort without putting me at the unnecessary risk associated with prescription pain killers. If a kratom ban were to go into effect, my quality of life would be significantly reduced without access to this safe, beneficial herb. Beyond that, I fear the quality of my care towards others would likewise be diminished--it's hard to be a truly good listener and problem-solver when all you can think about is how badly you want to sit down. With tobacco-related health care costs in the billions and ~480,000 deaths annually (CDC figures), I cannot understand why *this* harmless plant would be seen as posing an \"imminent threat\" to public safety. Additionally, considering the scope and severity of the current heroin/opioid epidemic, in my professional opinion it would be significantly *more* harmful to make a safe, natural alternative unavailable. I urge the decision-makers to look at the science, look at the data (not just in isolation, but as part of the bigger picture), and ask yourselves where the imminent threats to public safety TRULY lie.

Please keep it legal for all those who suffer without it and do NOT want pharmaceutical grade drugs entering their bodies unless absolutely necessary, which in the case of kratom, simply isn't.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8784","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tyler Hunziker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a professional woman in her fifties I have found Kratom to be beneficial in maintaining good health in numerous ways.

I'm a Florida resident just trying to make an honest living and live a peaceful life. I own a small pressure cleaning business while working for a wallpaper installation and painting company. The work I do I enjoy yet life has some major downs. Growing up has not been fun. As a child I had a Schizophrenic/Bipolar mother and an alcoholic/drug abusing father so my grandmother adopted me due to me being abused. In school I have been bullied a lot. Plus my uncle got the same condition as my mother and he lived with us on and off. Life was scary as you can tell. Because of that I was diagnosed with Depression and ADHD. While in college someone I was close to introduced me to Kratom. I looked into it yet I have't taken it till I had knee surgery. It was excellent for natural pain relief. The pain pills were habit forming so this kept me safe. Through out the years I have found this plant to ease my suicidal thoughts, reduce alcohol consumption, give inner solace, control my compulsive behavior, eases pain after a hard days work, get me away from pornography, etc. Since medical marijuana has been made legal here as well as many states it would be contradicting to say the least that Kratom gets banned while cannabis is legalized. Kratom has helped me obtain a functional life where if it were to be banned I'd have to suffer Depression while taking medication with harmful side effects. Please understand that many people are suffering and want to be happy and life in peace without getting their minds totally wrapped. That is the beauty of Kratom; it gives a euphoria while remaining sober! A truly beneficial supplement that should be sold in health food stores and local pharmacies  in the herbal section. If such a ban were to ensue then we could see a major rise in serious illicit drug abuse, not to mention the suicides from depression. Life in this world has become more challenging so something needs to be there for the people. The harm that the pharmaceuticals have done is why I avoid them. Another thing I wanted to mention is that when I introduced Kratom to my father he benefited from it for his arthritis as well as his pain pill abuse. Sadly this year though he passed away while the pain pills were ruining his life. I wished I introduced this to him earlier. I'm grateful that there is such a plant on this planet so why make my life more depressive? I just want to be at peace without having to take illegal drugs like heroin or cocaine and pharmaceutical  drugs like Haloperidol where there's tooth loss or Prozac where it can increase violent tendencies. If you truly care about the people such as I of this world , please consider my and everyone else' feelings on the matter.

Living in Texas I was In an accident and placed on hydrocodone for over 3 years, my doctor finally took me off of them but by then i was very much addicted to being pain free and the high they produced. The physical pain withdrawing off of 30mg of hydrocodone a day (that is 3,10 mg pills. not considered alot by addict standards) but thats how little of the drug it takes to be addicted to hydrocodone oxycodon etc.)so I went to a pill mill doctor to continue taking them to me it was so i could live life be an active mother for my kids the high was a side effect personally i didnt care for so per my request we lowered it to 1,10mg hydrocodone pill a day. Thats all I took for the next 3 years just enough to not feel the pain or detox, I was a housewife with 2 children I was not a danger to my kids i did the best i could to stay in control on just 1 a day. I just could not take the pain and sickness of quitting them completely. A doctor helped my pain from a serious accident prescribing them and unwittingly created a 6 year addiction. When I moved to Florida I was given 3 month supply. I lost my heakth insurance when i moved & continuing on hydrocodone was going to cost too much pain management is 200$ a visit plus your script cost, so I was going to attempt to quit again. The last time i tried to quit i was on 30mg a day and cold turkey day 3 I was still curled around my toilet vomitting, intense cramping , coupled with sweat and crying out for help then I went into a seizure my son called the ambulance, rushed to the hospital and while I was unconscious pumped me full of morphine, found nothing in my system but a little marijuana that had helped me through the first 2 days of withdraws a friend gave to me 3rd day I had no more and being illegal while hydrocodone is legal which is insane, I would never as a mother go looking for illegal drugs but I seriously considered it and understand why so many are addicted to heroine. ..when the hospital released me I was back on hydro and assumed that was how I would have to live the rest of my life imprisoned by 1 pill a day in fear they could be stolen or I lost them or anything happened to them i could seizure again.So there I am new to Florida no new doctor and running low and knowing what is goimg to happen when I run out but determined to kick them for good (btw I broke my back in that accident and the pain will always remain but I hoped to find a pain solution that was not dangerous to my health or held me captive) a friend of my dad's told him about kratom... I looked into it studied it researched everything about it realized it was a legal alternative from all the testimonials  and decided to try it. I ordered them and was scared to take them with the remaining hydros, so when I took my last hydrocodone I waited 24 hours before taking the Kratom to be safe the hydrocodone was out completely I began the shakes and direah pain everywhere in every joint and sweating and this is off of ONE 10MG HYDROCODONE A DAY THATS ALL I did not experience vomiting nor was the detox as intense as detoxing off of 30mg a day I can not even imagine the stories of people I know who withdrew off of 100mg a day habits and turned to cheap street drugs..on day 2 I woke up with a sweat imprint in my bed and immediately had to run to the bathroom then I got out the recommended amount of kratom capsules which was 3 for withdraws I took them and I felt relief from detox symptoms AND back pain within an hour I did not feel any fuzzy headed high I was clear headed! I cried woth joy and thanked god for his creation. They are not only safe but they saved my life from what is truly a seriously scary drug unless you are terminally ill.. if anything is being brought up to be made a law in this country it should be lawsuits against the pharmaceutical companies that stated \"hydrocodone is not addictive or dangerous \" how do you allow such an outright lie to be told to the public? There is an epidemic of addiction to heroine and prescription drugs in this country & kratom could greatly reduce that as alternative medicine for injuries that require pain management for long term but especially short term. I've been taking kratom for 3 years now sometimes I don't take them at all and take a few naproxen(aleve) there's no withdraw symptoms I am not a prisoner any longer the only thing I experience when I don't take them is back pain and that reminds me I'm alive ..when the pain becomes intense I take powdered kratom in a capsule and find relief for my intense pain only when needed  without any high or dependancy . Please dont take away the 1000s of people who have found the freedom of living productive drug free lives with a plant that is 100% safe as we are all living proof while others dont know an alternative exists to an addiction to pain pills & turn to a cheap alternative such as heroine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2638","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"None","postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"K.

Whether kratom needs to be regulated as an herbal supplement, a prescription medicine, or a recreational substance is yet to be determined.  Kratom does not pose an imminent risk to public safety, and it does appear to have significant medicinal value.  \n\nKratom has potential for abuse and dependence, more like caffeine than opioid medications, and between those two extremes, it appears to fall somewhere closer to caffeine on the spectrum of safety vs. risk.  Daily users of kratom will have some withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking it, as do coffee drinkers when they decide to go caffeine-free.  \n\nA small number of users develop dependence and will need help to stop taking kratom.  These risks are low compared to the known and potential medicinal benefits of this plant which has been used for thousands of years in SE Asia.  As others commenting have reported, kratom helps with pain control and opioid withdrawal.  More research is definitely called for rather than a total ban on the plant.  \n\nKratom is not a lethal substance- all the reports of deaths related to kratom have been due to toxicity of multiple substances, often a mixture of opioids and benzodiazepines (which can be deadly) and mitragynine was also present.  Placing this medicinal plant on Schedule 1 would do much more harm than good, and would divert our limited resources to prosecuting pain patients and safe recreational users.  It would negatively impact many communities across the US, pushing those in search of pain control to use more dangerous prescription and illegal opioids, leading to increased rates of incarceration and addiction to opiates like heroin, fentanyl, and oxycodone.\n\nKratom is NOT dangerous enough to require Schedule 1, but more research and regulations are needed to make it safely available to those who need/ want it.  Let's work together to determine how our communities can have safe access to this medicinal plant and how we can provide the public with the information needed to safely use kratom as they choose.  An outright ban is not the answer and would cause significant harm to a large number of people.  \n\nSome suggestions/ options other than Schedule 1:  \nPlace mitragynine as schedule III or IV and require physician prescription.  \nMake kratom available as over the counter restricted to 18+, or 21+\nLeave it to the FDA to regulate kratom as an herbal supplement available over the counter. \nAllow states to regulate it as they do cannabis, tobacco, and alcohol.\nRequire businesses that sell kratom to have a license/certificate to sell it and include harm reduction information to customers.\nDo nothing yet, and encourage researchers to learn more about kratom and mitragynine before any further action is taken regarding its legality.  \nRelease educational material to the public so we can make informed decisions about whether or not to use kratom.  \n\n Instead of banning a natural plant medicine that's been used by human beings for thousands of years, let's learn more about it through research and provide those who already use it with as much information as possible so they may continue to treat their symptoms as they choose, as safely as possible.  \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5726","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lesley Burke","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Taking kratom has helped me tremendously.\nI noticed my blood pressure had regulated better.

Taking away all the things they can be irresponsible with is treating them like children. That is not consistent with having a free society. I do understand that somethings are just to dangerous to allow people to even experiment with because they are so addictive or so dangerous that there can be no expectation of responsible use. I think that is the real question and I see Kratom as a substance that falls well into the area where responsible use can be the expectation for the general public. \n\nThe fiduciary responsibility of the FDA is also a point of concern. So the question regarding that is, Will allowing the use of Kratom, by the general public of adults, cost more then the tax revenue it produces? I see no evidence that that is the case but of course I have no access to records that could prove otherwise. Speaking exclusively from my experience I do not see how that could be the case. Should the costs of Kratom eclipse the tax revenue, like I expect tobacco, alcohol, opiate base meds., ect do, an appropriate tax to cover those cost would be in order as it is with said examples. The cost for court expenses to determine the legality of Kratom will likely cost the tax payer more then the effect legal Kratom will ever have on the tax payers when offset by the tax generated by the sale of Kratom. I would dare to say it would be much more likely to generate revenue then deplete it. This based on the revenue the legalization of marijuana has produced in every state that has legalized it. While marijuana use is much more widely spread the effects of marijuana are dramatically more profound causing an altered state that likely results in more of a burden on tax payer then Kratom ever will. I would argue that the addictive properties of marijuana eclipse that of Kratom as well. This is also would less encumber the total tax revenue. \n\nI would like to encourage a less costly resolution that could happen by finding ground both the DEA and Kratom users find responsible and prudent, out of court.\n\nI am writing to also comment about my experience with Kratom and to encourage it's continued legal use. I have used Kratom for about a year now for chronic pain. I have torn cartage in my hip that require surgery that I cannot afford. The costs are looking to be somewhere in the $20,000 area. With heath insurance coverage changing all the time and the government being an unreliable source for determining the future of insurance, it is an importance option that I have Kratom as a way to live life until a better solution arises for me. It is not something that gets me high by any means. I am not feeling altered or unsafe when I use Kratom. I do sometime feel a short lived feeling of uplift in mood. It is subtle most of the time and I rarely notice it if I am working.\n\n Kratom is on par with Caffeine in my assessment. The effects are profoundly less assaulting then alcohol, prescription medications like codeine, energy drinks(unless you have a tolerance for these drink. I shake. feel anxious and cannot sleep if I drink these type of drinks) or marijuana and even moderately less pronounced then antihistamines, sleep aids, and diet pills. Of course like any of these products, when using them for the first time the effects can be felt more aggressively and I believe that is true for Kratom as well. \n\nPersonally I believe Kratom should remain legal. Though I can see why it would be regulated for adults only. I believe energy drinks should be regulated for adults only even more so. I have never had any dangerous or harmful effects from the use of Kratom. In my experience if I use more I do not get more of an effect. It instead will make me sick to my stomach, which I am susceptible to feeling with many consumables. It is a much preferred solution then pain meds. for me. Pain meds. are addictive, much more dangerous, in fact people become addicted to and die from pain meds everyday. Kratom is a soft ,subtle, natural, solution I am comfortable with. \n\nKelly Combs","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21971","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kelly Combs","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"kratom is best medicine for middle aged people to relieve pains","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1526","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom.

My name is Charity Green I am a resident of Alabama currently, and I have been using Kratom for two years until it became illegal in my state. I was diagnosed with several auto immune disorders which caused me a great deal of physical pain along with several female issues. At the time of my diagnosis I was prescribed pain medications which made me have terrible side effects and I ended up going from being a working mom to hardly able to get up and fix meal for my family. I eventually lost my home, my car, and my family due to my pain. I wanted so badly to find a alternative to pain management that would relieve my pain without the awful sleepiness and sluggish feeling so I researched natural remedies. I soon came across Kratom and thought I would give it a try, at this point I had nothing to lose. I did not know this plant would change my life, for the first time in 8 years I was able to be a attentive mom again, I felt normal and without pain. Over time I was able to get two jobs and get custody of my kids back all because I was able to function. I have seen this plant change so many lives and taking it away would be detrimental to those of us that need pain relief. I have always bought kratom from reputable vendors recommended by the American Kratom Association,  I have never experienced any adverse effects or bad kratom. I think this country while in a opioid abuse epidemic needs this plant. People are dying daily of overdoses from prescription medications and heroine abuse. If the dea has a goal of stopping the epidemic then banning kratom would be the most ignorant move yet. There has not been a single overdose reported other than people who had several other medications in their system at the time of their death. It's time the DEA stop banning natural healthy solutions for those that want an alternative to big pharma.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6317","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Charity Green","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Stop the racist drug war that hurts American citizens.

First I want to state that I am a healthy 32 year old male with gainful employment, a long-term relationship with my soon to be fianc, and plenty of healthy relationships with family and friends.  I take Kratom often; I find it to be very useful for pain relief, mood elevation, and energy in a non-narcotic fashion.  I love Kratom personally and know that many people can benefit from its use.  It is a fantastic alternative to much harder pain relieving medicines that have MUCH higher risk for abuse, overdosing, and dependency, especially opiates.  It is pretty benign at worst and incredibly helpful with very low risk at best.  It is much less taxing on the body over other pharmaceuticals.  \n\nWith that being said I don't take any pharmaceuticals and essential my experience with Kratom would fall in the recreational side of things, even though I do receive some medical benefits as well (pain relief, anti-depressant).  I have encountered people who use it for serious medical purposes and have used it to overcome opiate addiction even when the doctors were still pushing meds on them.  Like I said before it is benign for recreational use, and has serious medical uses as well.  PLEASE LEAVE KRATOM UNSCHEDULED.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19306","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Si Fisher","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W\n\nKratom public use should be banned\n\nDr. Rene Perez - family physician\n\nKratom should be classified as schedule 1 due to :\n1) Abuse by opiate addicts to overcome withdrawal symptoms of abuse of opiates.

I work in a technical sales role at a software technology company. I would like to write a few words about the positive effects of Kratom.\n\nThroughout my life I have experienced mild anxiety and at times a lack of focus. I started taking Kratom on and off about 1.5 years ago to combat some of these negative cognitive effects I had been dealing with. Since starting to use Kratom I have garnered the focus to  accomplish following:\n\n-Learn full stack software development to the point where I have helped local businesses build systems and web tools needed. \n-Start public speaking and performing stand up comedy. Since I have let go of the taking of kratom and can get on stage without any use of it. However, it helped me get started.\n\nI can say with 100% confidence that I am not dependant on Kratom whatsoever. Just like I can stop drinking coffee or alcohol, I can stop taking Kratom no problem and my life would be okay. My take on Kratom is that sure, it can be considered a drug. But so can caffeine, nicotine and marijuana, which is increasingly becoming considered harmless and made legal in many states in the USA. \n\nJust like these the aforementioned substances, Kratom is not harmful. What are harmful are the drugs such as ritalin, vicodin, and other mind altering drugs that doctors prescribe day in and day out. My brother was prescribed ritalin growing up. I have no doubt that he didn't need it ,and could have used something much more mild such as Kratom with better health and cognitive benefits.\n\nWhat I can't understand is how the US government can have such an extreme reaction to a plant such as Kratom? I have taken it on and off for the last year and a half and at no point have I thought, \"Well, this should definitely be considered in a class of drugs with cocaine, heroin and methamphtamine.\" \n\nI kindly ask you to consider the regulation of Kratom just as you have with substances such as alcohol, nicotine, and how some states such as Colorodo have done with Marijuana. You will without a doubt save the lives and increase the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people without harming anyone.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nBest,\nMyles","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13682","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Myles Cooney","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nThank you for taking the time to hear the public's opinion on Kratom.

My entire life I've suffered from severe depression and generalized anxiety disorder, as well as gastroparesis and spondylolisthesis.   Since adolescence doctors have put me on a wide range of pharmaceutical cocktails, many of which cause more negative side effects than benefits and very few have helped the underlying problems.  SSRI antidepressants such as Lexapro and Zoloft, benzodiazepines like Xanax and Klonopin, antipsychotics Seroquel and Ability, NDRIs like Wellbutrin, SARIs such as Trazodone and an endless list of stomach medications (i.e.: Promethazine, Reglan, Megestrol, etc).  This is nowhere near the full list of prescription medications of which side effects I have suffered through in hope of relief from my psychological and physical pain.\n\nKratom is not a perfect \"drug\" (\"drug\" being a word that encompasses anything from morphine, marijuana and xanax all the way to tylenol coffee and tea).  There are side effects and it's not right for everyone.  But there is an enormous list of positive uses for it that the DEA turned a blind eye to and instead chose to focus on the negatives, even discounting a large base of scientific evidence and thousands of years of historical use in Asian countries.  \n\nDepression is a horribly debilitating condition: it drains motivation and creates an immense dissatisfaction with life.  At times, my depression has been so extreme that I was suicidal and hurt myself.  The medications prescribed cause me to live in a tired, mental fog and reduce my range of emotions.  Sure, I feel less sadness, but my levels of happiness are significantly lower, as if there's a ceiling preventing true joy.  \n\nAnxiety keeps me from achieving goals and experiencing social life.  It keeps me at home alone to avoid the painful feelings that come with anxiety.  For those who don't suffer from anxiety, it seems like a silly problem but I assure you it severely limits what I can do with my life.  \n\nFor me, kratom is easily the most beneficial substance I've ever found for my depression and anxiety.  It helps motivate me, gives me energy and allows me to feel more confident so I can achieve the goals I've put off for so long.  With kratom, I'm not dragged down by my feelings of sadness or fear of not fitting in.  I feel good about myself instead of feeling like an inadequate failure due to my past, things I wish I'd had the courage to do and unbalanced brain chemistry.  An added bonus is that it also helps with the pain I experience with gastroparesis and spondylolisthesis.  In the past I would take above average doses of Advil and Aleve many times daily.  Advil and Aleve put stress on your digestive system and so, while this helped with my back pain, it would cause even more discomfort in my stomach.  I've always been underweight and unable to get into the normal range.  After a year with kratom, I've gained 20 pounds and am now considered \"Normal\".  My doctor was amazed because I have never weighed over 135 lbs, and as a 5'10\" male approaching his 30s, this is an extreme achievement.  \n\nPlease do not make Kratom illegal.  Obviously, like any drug, regulation would be a good thing.  Too many \"headshops\" have sold kratom with adulterants which caused hospital visits and this is unacceptable.  But there are many reputable vendors online whom sell pure, high quality kratom and many customers benefit greatly from this plant.\n\nI beg you to reconsider the plan to make Kratom a Schedule I drug.  Doing so would take relief out of many peoples' lives and cause them to return to the unpromising pharmaceutical industry.  Hopefully, one day our pharmaceutical industry will reach a point where the negative side effects are reduced and medications treat conditions effectively.  But until then, many of us need kratom.  After years of searching for relief, I've finally found something that truly helps.  Please don't take that away.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22547","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Clay Crocker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I suffer from chronic pain and am hoping you will not schedule this medicine, as I am waiting to see what the FDA does before I try it for my pain.

My addiction came back to haunt me when I got injured in the Army in 2007 and  instead of taking illegal substances I turned to Kratom. I took Kratom  in the morning instead of a cup of coffee. It helped curb cravings, took away pain,  helped with anxiety and depression, gave me energy, and helped me perform at a higher level. My experience was that it was just as strong as caffeine but instead of a jittery caffeine feeling,  it gave more of an opiate feeling.  I stopped taking Kratom in 2013 by personal choice. It was not difficult to quit. After the army I became addicted to heroin. I used Kratom to get off of heroin. It was a tremendous help. I am no longer on Kratom  but I believe I should have the option To take it if I desire. I believe others should have the same option to pursue treatment on their own terms with Kratom  just like I did.

I have been a firefighter for over a decade.  I see first hand the devastation prescription opiates has caused in addicts, their families and communities.  Kratom is a safe and proven solution to getting addicts off of RX drugs. A ban on Kratom is dangerous and many former addicted of RX opiates will return to abusing opiates. Lives will be lost and overdoses will skyrocket as a result of a Kratom ban.\nI first came in contact with Kratom several years ago after an injury had me on RX opiates for 6 months.  I felt addicted to them. As soon as I stopped taking them, I would feel sick and not be able to get out of bed..  I tried Kratom and was able to successfully stop using the RX as well as using dipping tobacco. Kratom took care of the pain and lessened the withdrawal affects until I was off of them. It did not make me feel high, under the influence, or altered. It gave me a burst of energy similar to coffee and enhanced my mood.  I honestly believe Kratom probably saved my life as well as many others.

Since then there is no noticeable alteration of mental state. I have been taking slightly more than a teaspoon of powder each night and have no spasms. I finally get a good nights sleep each night. My doctor and I had tried every medication recommended for spasms and restless legs. Nothing worked except for the week I took Percocet for another issue. Needless to say, I was unwilling to take an addictive narcotic for a chronic issue. \n\nMy issue is not life threatening but no sleep and the pain of.

After receiving an honorable discharge from my branch of service, I set forth to utilize my GI Bill and receive an education. Finding my way back into the normal way of living as a civilian was and continues to remain challenging for me. Not only did I have strong anxiety when dealing with people, I had suffered injuries in service that required some form of pain medication to subside. When I went to the VA for treatment, they did not hesitate to prescribe me pain medication. However, as I have many colleagues and friends who have gone down this route before me, I decided that I did not want to become reliant on these medication as I have seen the unintended effects the pharmaceuticals can have. With that in mind I searched for natural remedies and stumbled upon the plant in question. I began using Kratom leaves once a day to ease my pain and cannot express how much it has helped me in my life. Not only do I have to live in constant physical pain, I no longer struggle with the anxiety I have had when being in groups of people, that before kept me distant and to avoid all social situations. I was worried about dosages and a potential addiction, but have found that in my 4 years of taking this plant once a day, I have never had to increase the dosage to produce the same effects, nor have I had any negative side effects or issues with removing this plant from my diet. I strongly disagree with the notion that this plant is dangerous to our society and its members and believe that it can only produce positive effects, in helping veterans like myself as well as other people who have severe anxiety and depression to feel normal again and return to their communities whole. I state my case solely for the raw plant form and not any synthetic creation nor extract. I have concern about individuals who produce synthetic forms of this chemical and extracts of the plant for these not only promote bad behavior but introduce issues, as all extracts can be dangerous depending on their potency. However, I would urge to keep the plant in its raw form available for the public as in its natural form, it cannot be hazardous to one's health. I have never felt that my government was truly harming my life until the news of the intent to ban this plant. Without it, I will have to live in pain, or give into pain medications with life threatening side effects, and live with crippling social anxiety that may force me to give into even more medication with seriously grave side effects. Having seen the alternatives, I believe the natural methods are the most safe and productive for our society. Thank you for considering my comments. I hope you keep all of our comments and lives in mind when considering to your decisions.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3280","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think this needs to be studied more.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9422","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Neil Smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I oppose the DEA making Kratom a Schedule I drug.

As a result, I have also had PTSD all of my life.  Two years ago I was desperately searching for something that would alleviate the over powering urge to consume alcohol.  After thorough research, I found many who had stated it helped with addiction.  I began using Kratom and I now have over 2 years of sobriety again.  In addition, it helped me with a number of other problems.  It eased the symptoms of PTSD, reduced my depression and anxiety, and eased the pain of arthritis.   The other wonderful thing is I suffered NO side effects!!  Other medications gave me horrible constipation and sleepless nights, however, Kratom did NOT give me constipation or sleepless nights.

I was not only suffering from a neurological disorder that caused immense discomfort and pain, insomnia, i was depressed, suicidal, anxious, I had suffered from PTSD, and much more. Ever since I took that first plant of kratom, it was like being a new person! Lets take a look at cigarettes and alcohol. Both are legal yet how many millions have died from those two drugs? I don't want to start a rant on the insanity of why we keep these drugs legal and not plants that GOD has given us (read the book of Genesis God told Adam and Eve to use all the plants and herbs on the Earth for our well being). Yes after kratom, I had an a revelation. That I COULD live a successful life (i'm studying to be an optometrist) with kratom as my medicine, It completely took away all depression, suicidal thoughts, my neurological disorder, anxiety, etc. It was a miracle beyond words. \n\nI do not drink. I do not smoke. I do not use nor have used drugs. I am just an everyday person. Now with kratom on my list of supplements (including a mix of really health conscious supplements (kratom users are not druggies and i NEVER took it to get \"high\" nor do i get high from it anyway I CANNOT tolerate nor stands these absolute idiots mostly teenagers who want to get high off this or that - almost everyone who uses kratom uses it for medicinal purposes....it HAS MEDICINAL VALUE TO IT DO NOT DOUBT IT). Also keep in mind, that we need to work with you to establish kratom with a regulatory body and a standard to #1 - make sure underage children have NO access to it #2 - the supply of kratom we get is pure and safe (i always had safe kratom) #3 - make kratom a true established supplement you could pick up at the health store #4 - TAX IT and MAKE TONS OF MONEY Make it Legit. Because people who do not understand kratom, tend to think of it like a drug which is not true. Let me entertain you. Check out the drugs at the pharmacy, addictive drugs that ruin lives doctors write them all the time. Those are given \"medical\" value even COCAINE which is cardiotoxic and can cause mycardial infarctions or heart attacks STILL IS UNDER C2 thus IT STILL has a medical valuie EVEN THOUGH IT KILLS WITHOUT MERCY!!! THIS IS INSANITY. YET YOU WANT KRATOM TO BE C1 BECAUSE IT IS WHAT? Kratom IS MEDICINALLY SOUND to THE EXTREME. Open your eyes, and your hearts and you will see the truth. \n\nWith this new lease on life I hope to become a productive member of society but if the DEA takes away kratom, then they will literally destroy countless lives including mine. I shall be relegated to absolute misery, despondency, hopelessness. And even worse. My story is no different really. All I can say it #1 - i have taken the same dose for 12 years, i am not \"addicted\" to it, it does not harm your body, there is spurious reports about OD's and deaths from it but we do not even have all the facts. I IMPLORE YOU THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY LET ME LIVE MY LIFE WITH SELF DETERMINATION AND THE RIGHT TO INGEST THIS MIRACLE HERB FOR ALL MY DAYS. GOD BLESS. Ryan C.

We saw many people die, circa 1990s re: opiates and here we are again suffering a nationwide heroin plague. It is morally disgusting in the face of our current national drug crisis to rule out this blessing of nature, kratom. It does not get one high, in the classic sense. It merely provides relief to the afflicted, be it opiate users trying to stop or grandma's bursitis. It seems that governments are not happy unless they are doing something, be it \"good\" or \"bad'. But look where it has landed us: In an internationally ridiculed drug war that preys on the weak and powerless, offers synthetic substitutes for drugs that are worse than the real thing in many quantifiable ways and lastly makes criminals out of our brothers and sisters.\n\n I understand that a kratom alkaloid was synthesized in the lab recently. That can be trademarked, the leaf cannot. You get where I am going with this. This Illegalization of kratom in light of this development seems like an incestuous coupling of  govt. and Pharma. Business as usual -which is sometimes for the good. I get it. However in this case, I respectfully urge the DEA to turn it's attention to issues that are more noble, and to the point. Maybe start with not letting assistants prescribe drugs. I recently read a gov. pdf that strongly suggests that physicians assistants are widely known to be  more liberal prescribing opiates. There are things we can do. Lets not follow Thailand's lead here re: banning kratom, a benign leaf in favor of the state approved heroin trade, or in our case the various addictive opoids and even more addictive synthetics from Big Pharma.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19440","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using Kratom as an alternative to pain medication and anti depressants for 10 years.

Instead concentrate on why we are sick, why we are addicted and keep these drugs away from us! this is a health crisis, and you cant win by taking away safe products that work! \nEven if Kratom wasnt a perfect solution it is sure better than FDA drugs approved to treat or cure illnesses and we find out too late it causes severe unreversable damage.

Kratom has been enormously helpful to me during my recovery from heroin and methamphetamine addiction.  Using Kratom has allowed me to deal proactively with my periods of craving and withdrawal from what are known to be dangerous drugs.  I've been sober for 21 months.  Before going to rehab, I was sober for maybe a handful of days during a span of about 18 years.  I had A LOT of adjustments to make in my thinking and how I related to the world.  Kratom has helped me feel 'normal' and has allowed me to meet the many challenges of newly found sobriety with strength and minimal emotional and physical discomfort.  I used Suboxone, under medical orders, during my initial phase of acute withdrawal; it helped enormously, but was not ideal for me for long term use.  Suboxone negatively affected my memory, sex-drive and emotional state.  Being on Suboxone for an extended length of time was nearly as troublesome as being back on heroin.  With Kratom, I experience NONE of the side-effects I had with Suboxone.  Kratom is nothing short of miraculous.  The only negative effects I've experienced from Kratom came from when I first began taking it, and being inexperienced, I took too much.  The result?  Nausea that lasted for a couple of hours, that's it.  Comparing the effects of Kratom to the effects of hard drugs is GROSSLY INACCURATE.  Hard drugs kill.  For that matter, caffeine kills, tobacco kills, alcohol kills- people even die from misusing sugar or water.  The dose makes the poison.\nScheduling Kratom will help no one.

I have been using kratom occasionally for the past three years. I use it mainly as an alternative to over the counter pain medications. I am concerned about acetominophen's effects on the liver, and I avoid taking NSAIDs because they have a tendency to severely upset my stomach. In my experience kratom is a superior alternative to these medications. Not only does it not have the side effects I have experienced with them, but it has been more effective at relieving my pain. \nAdditionally, I have intermittent episodes of irritable bowel syndrome which causes me to have uncontrollable nausea and diarrhea. I have found that when these symptoms start, kratom will alleviate them. Since I first started using kratom, I haven't had to miss school, work, or family events due to irritable bowel, which twice before had confined me to the bathroom for two weeks straight. \nI personally believe in the good that pharmaceuticals and western medicine can do, but I know several people who avoid such synthetic chemicals at all costs. Kratom gives such people a natural alternative and for me a more effective and tolerable one. I truly hope that the option of kratom isn't taken away from people, when I and so many others have found it to be such a help. Please reconsider its scheduling and the effects that would have on many people such as myself and on the possibility of new safer painkillers that might be patterned on its alkaloids.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4759","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carl Kolbo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"(NOTE: I am resubmitting this message with my full home address and contact information; please feel free to delete the duplicate: DEA-2016-0015-0006)\n\nDEA Staff:\n\nI have been using kratom to help me with symptoms ranging from pain to depression, and no other medication has helped me more consistently, and with no side effects, interactions, or other issues.  I estimate that I have taken over 100 doses in the small- to medium-range (and I have a log of every time I've using it, including date/time, strain, and amount).  I have never felt the need to take increase my dosage, nor have I felt any adverse effects of not taking kratom for days or weeks at a time.  Simply, it provides near-instant relief in safe way, and helps me concentrate, experience moderate relief from chronic pain, and to maintain a productive lifestyle.  If there is any issue, it's rare, and usually results in mild, short-lived nausea.  I cannot say that about many other drugs and medications that you consider legal.\n\nI was shocked to learn that the DEA single-handedly determined to put an \"emergency\" ban on kratom sale in the U.S.   The DEA has blocked perfectly safe herbal medications for decades, and even now, you have restated that marijuana - a drug for which there has never been any true risk, and where illegality was based on a century of race-inspired policy, misinformation, myths, and anecdotal fears.  You must realize that, where marijuana has been legalized, there have been no major problems, and a growing super-majority of the country supports its legalization.  Working against that causes a loss of credibility in your organization, your judgment, and your objectivity.  That will also increase a general mistrust in the objectivity and policies of the DEA, something that might lead to actual, real danger.\n\nNow, more than ever, I implore to take a science-based stand on medications.  You're not only potentially harming the American people and keeping them from risk, but the message you send to other countries in the world will cause them to create criminals out of people that are using a perfectly safe (and affordable) medication.  You will make it nearly impossible to research, benefitting only large drug companies, and doing a major disservice to the many of us that benefit tremendously from kratom.  Please reconsider your actions, based your policy on science, and do what is good and right for Americans and the entire world.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15982","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anil Desai","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Iid like to take the time to tell you my story and how I found Kratom a great help in my life.  When I was a teenager, I was jumped and brutally beat by 7 men with bats. From then on I have always been in pain in my neck and back. Doctors put me on just enough pain pills( opiates) to get me hooked and then no more. I turned to the streets for my painkillers because ibuprofen and Tylenol did not help. I got addicted and could not cope with my pain. I also could not keep taking pills, they destroyed my stomach. With no where to turn for help I quit pills cold turkey and suffered the withdrawals for 12 days. Nothing sucks worse. When I was weened I met up with a friend who said that they found a new legal painkiller called Kratom. I tried the recommended dose and in minutes I was pain free!!!  Ever since then I have used Kratom and I have not touched a pill since nor wanted to. I can work, I can play, I feel free and clean again. This is also what all my friends who suffer from pain and went through the same ordeal have turned to and it's like a miracle! PLEASE, please don't take my miracle away!! If I didn't have kratom I would be a pill junkie with no family or morals to live with. I think it's god sent!!!

I am taking the time to comment today because I feel strongly about the attempt to scheduling the leaf of the kratom plant, or more specifically the alkaloids mitragyne and 7-hydroxymitrragyne found in all natural kratom leaf. In no way do I believe kratom belongs on the same schedule as deadly drugs like heroin. Kratom has been consumed safely for countless years throughout the world. I have been using kratom for over 3 years, since learning about it from natural health forums. I suffer from herniated discs in my lower back which is exasperated by my physical line of work. Since taking it for my pain I have also noted that it helps immensely with my diagnosed depression. Kratom keeps me pain free, yet clear headed while at work. I liken the effects to a cup of coffee and some ibuprofen (which I have stopped taking for 3 years). I believe all natural kratom leaf (which is in the coffee family) belongs on shelves with other natural and herbal remedies, or at the most restricted to adults age 18 and over.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20169","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John OBrien","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a successful business owner who happens to have spondylolythesis and spondylolysis (movement in my back vertebra).

Before finding Kratom, I was a functioning alcoholic, drinking everyday no matter where I was. I would drink at work, in the car, at home, and anywhere else that I was. I have been using Kratom now for a year, and have been clean for the entire time. Once I used Kratom for the first time, I never took another drink. Another reason I use Kratom is for stress relief, and depression. Since I have started using Kratom, I have been making better life decisions. Kratom has saved my life and I know that it can save the lives of many others. It's primary use is for opiate addiction. It helps people from the burdens of heroin addiction and also for those like me, who suffer from alcoholism, and stress and depression. Please withdrawal the ban on Kratom so that I don't slip back into the same lifestyle I was in before. With alcohol so readily available, it is difficult not to think about stopping and getting a drink. With Kratom, the thought never crosses my mind. Thank you so much for giving us in the Kratom community a chance to speak up for ourselves, and I sincerely hope that the right decision is made regarding the legality of Kratom.

I've been taking kratom regularly for 9 years with absolutely no negative side effects. There are enumerable misconceptions about this supplement, and I urge you not to fall victim to the misinformation of the press and online forums. While taking kratom, I've held a 5 yr relationship, graduated with my BA and MA degrees, and happily work in the advertising industry in a major northeast city. I say this because the people you would be arresting for possession of this substance are not criminals, thieves, violent offenders, nor are we junkies itching for our next fix. On the contrary, we are some of the most significant contributors to society. We are people who hold power in our industries and if this law gets passed despite the people's opinion, I assure you we will oppose this action in any way we legally can. The DEA is over-stepping and is unaware of the damage this will cause to individuals and families. It was such a  fight simply to get a public comment period, costing thousands of dollars and protests just to practice our right to get our voice formally heard in an online text box.\n\nThough I strongly believe an increase in medical research on Kratom would be beneficial, it does not make logical sense to ban an herbal supplement simply because we don't know much about it. The 15 \"deaths\" behind kratom ALL involve an additional substance (heroin, cocaine, etc.). I implore you to present a single case of death caused SOLELY by kratom. In addition, the DEA sites about 600 calls to the CDC within a 5 year period relating to kratom, as if this were a high number. If anything, this is such a low number that it could actually be presented as evidence to keep kratom legal. Hundreds of thousands of calls are made to the CDC in a SINGLE year for Tylenol. This number of calls is not a solid argument. If anything, I urge the government to regulate this industry, calling for labeling standards so consumers know exactly what they are getting.\n\nPlacing this on Schedule 1 would be in line with making coffee Schedule 1 before we knew what it's effects were. Imagine if someone went to prison for life because they had a 16oz bag of coffee...; not to mention kratom is in the same plant family as coffee. This would be unjust and cause great outrage among kratom advocates.\n\nThanks you for taking the time to read my comments and for opening a comment period as is the people's right. I urge you to permanently withdraw your notice of intent, regulate the industry, continue medical research, and keep a close eye on this wonderful herb's effects on society. I have the utmost confidence that this plant is safe, that I urge you to try it to form your own opinion instead of getting your information from online reporters and random users on web forums.\n\nRegards.\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7392","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-27T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"A concerned citizen Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"See attached file(s)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20583","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W\n\nHello. Thank you for opening this issue up for public comment, and for your time and consideration. I am a 29-year-old female and I work as a Social Media Manager and Assistant for a local artist. I am writing to say that I oppose any ban or scheduling of Mitragyna Speciosa (Kratom) or any of its alkaloids.\n\nI have experienced varying degrees of back pain for as long as I can remember. Approximately three years ago, I was diagnosed with Degenerative Disc Disease and Scoliosis. I'm told that I am \"too young\" for this. Many of my pain management options seem rather scary and bleak. I have so far chosen to forego painful spinal injections, and after witnessing three different loved ones undergo failed spinal surgeries leaving them permanently disabled, I would like to avoid that avenue for as long as possible. Pain medications bring their own set of risks and seem to be out of the question because of my age. Over-the-counter medications sometimes help to an extent, but they are hard on my stomach and aren't meant for long-term use. Thankfully, I have found kratom tea to be a benign yet effective alternative to help manage my pain.\n\nI have participated in physical therapy. I practice yoga and stretching. I like to walk, ride my bicycle, and swim for exercise. I have a relatively healthy diet, I very rarely drink alcohol, caffeine, or soda, and I do not smoke. I am able to be this active with the help of kratom and I have returned to a healthier weight as a result (from 170lbs down to 140lbs). I use a heating pad, ice pack, back brace, and TENS unit (a therapeutic device that uses low-voltage electrical currents to stimulate nerves for pain relief) as needed. Kratom is one of many tools I have found to help ease some of my spinal pain. It is not a panacea and some days are still tough. I understand and accept the minimal risks as an informed adult and I believe I should be allowed to make that choice for myself. \n\nI fear the ways my life would change if kratom were no longer available to me. My daily pain would increase and my physical activity and productivity would suffer. Many days I would be unable to sit or even stand up straight. I would end up spending significantly more time in bed. Without kratom, I fear what limited options would be left available to me. Without kratom, I would be faced with choosing between the side effects of potentially harmful pain medications, painful invasive procedures that give only temporary relief, and surgeries where the risks outweigh the benefits. Kratom has proven to be a valuable, effective tool for me in managing my chronic pain and maintaining the quality of life that I want. Living in nearly constant daily pain is not the life I want for myself. I really am too young to live like that. I want to be able to stand up straight and move around. I want to be able to go outside and exercise and participate in life without requiring days of bed rest to recover. Health food stores carry a wide variety of herbal teas that people use to relax, sleep, or feel energized. Kratom tea helps me be an active, productive member of society. Please don't let it also make me a criminal. I urge you to not make kratom a scheduled substance.\n\nAgain, thank you for your time and for allowing this public comment period. Please consider all research and do not ban this plant. Thank you for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21837","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laraine S","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for your careful consideration of Kratom. As an emergency physician and medical toxicologist, my practice is finely tuned to the dangers of opioid addiction and overdose. Since 2006, my group has been following Kratom, reports of its use, assistance in managing addiction, and toxicity. Overall, this agent is a weak opioid that does have addictive potential. Yet, we rarely meet patients in the emergency department for complications of Kratom use, Kratom addiction, or evidence of Kratom toxicity. Severe adverse events (e.g., seizures) have been attributed to Kratom adulterants (substances added to the natural product). Recently we published a study on Kratom adulteration with a team at the University of Mississippi; we are concerned that Kratom manufacturers are \"boosting\" their natural products with chemical grade mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (the active alkaloids in Kratom). The addition of extra mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine increases the risk of addiction and adverse effects. Overall, I do not believe that Schedule I status for Kratom is warranted or of significant public health importance; however, I worry that the lack of regulation of Kratom contents makes users vulnerable to adverse effects. \n\nThank you,\nKavita Babu MD, FACEP, FACMT\nEmergency Medicine/ Medical Toxicology","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7266","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kavita Babu","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear deciding officials,\n\n     It is time for the Kratom Community to put all that we have into our fight for what we believe is discrimination against a natural plant that hasn't hurt people in a fraction of the way as others have.  \n\n     Kratom has helped my life for the better. I have had 2 spinal surgeries and was told by my pain management Dr that because of my back, I would have to be on pain medication indefinitely.  I have braces, tried other medications prescribed to help manage the pain such as gabapentin and Topamax.  I had recently told my Dr that I didn't want to be in a narcotic substance because it makes me feel loopy.  I have a business which loopiness can not be part of.\n\n     The effects that Kratom gives me are all the benefits of a painkiller without the side effects. I am clear headed, pain free, and do this in a legal manner.  If you would like to attack plants that, \"We just don't know much about,\" how about the millions of herbal supplements that are taken each and every day?  It seems hypocritical to go after a plant that has so many benefits without first explorng or doing studies on it first.\n\n     The DEA is getting way too much power than a sole entity should have.  They are going to start implementing that Dr.'s give a prior authorization for their patients to even have any controlled substance.  As this may help the people who abuse their medications, it is also going to harm the ones who legitimately need them.  \n\n     A huge problem with all of these labels that have been put on people who genuinely need these medications is outrageous.  My pain levels get so high, that if I over extend my body, I can't walk for 2 days.  I was afraid to tell my pain management Dr that because I didn't want to be seen as a drug seeker even though, I only get my controlled substances from the same facilities and never over lapping prescriptions.\n\n     Kratom has helped me naturally stay alert and keeping my pain down to a minimum.  Cigarettes kill more people every year than heroine and cocaine combined.  Alcohol is so accessible and how many people are killed from this every year?  Yet these are legal and not controlled even with the overwhelming evidence of how they effect people in the short long run.  \n\n     Kratom has a, \"good track record,\" if you want to compare apples to apples.  Or are you and the healthcare system afraid of losing millions of dollars by people taking back their own life rather than have an institution do it for them?  How many car wrecks have happened from Kratom?  How many car wrecks have happened from Alcohol?  How many overdoses have been related to Kratom, when used solely by itself?  How many deaths have been caused by alcohol and cigarettes?\n\n     It honestly seems as if we aren't being told the true reasons for illegal usage of Kratom.  Why?  Because you don't honestly have any.  The DEA needs to be reeled in and given less ability to ruin lives and more ability to save them.  Kratom doesn't need to be illegal. If anything, before making blind accusations and statements that make a person even question why quotes would be taken from an individual who says, \" We don't know enough about the plant,\"  is also questioning what government sector would make someone say something so ridiculous.  This logic that is archaic is just a disgrace to the DEA.\n\n     Don't be naive.  There are so many other substances that the DEA should be looking into rather than a natural plant who saves lives instead of killing them.  Put our tax dollars to use and find the drug lords who literally can't be that hard to find with technology.  Go stop the disbursement of  already illegal drugs that are out on the street.  You honestly can't do that which is your job, so why don't you focus on one thing at a time and fix what is already broken.\n\nSincerely, \n\nCatherine Ventura","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7998","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Catherine Ventura","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Danie Herrin, I am 29 years old, and I hold a degree in pharmaceutical sciences.

I have a brother who is a heroine addict, It started with Lortab, then percocett, then roxys and oxys, delaudid, anything he could take or snort or shoot up. I'm proud to say that this natural plant has given him the freedom from those drugs. Those are the nasty drugs that are killing our youth, those are the ones that are scheduled drugs for a reason, not Kratom. Kraton has helped me too. When it was allowed in my state I would take around 2.5 grams a day, just that small amount allowed me to ween myself off my Anxiety medicine, it also allowed me to cut back on Adderall. I felt alert, I didn't feel high, I could finally feel like I was getting off medicines that I didn't want to take long term. Now that it is considered illegal in my state I can not have it in my possession, nor can I buy it online and have it shipped to me. I can't risk getting in trouble. To me that is a slap in the face, I don't know of anyone who would argue the point of me trying to stop or lower my dosage of potentially harmful chemically derived drugs by replacing it with a ingestiable plant as being the wrong choice. I strongly encourage you to help our citizens seek alternative and natural treatment such as Kratom to help with people suffering from addiction, pain (both chronic and acute), anxiety, depression, add, the list goes on and on of people with different ailments, diseases, and disorders.

I originally discovered kratom as an alternative to opioid pain medication following a complex shoulder surgery. While trying to cope with post surgical complications, prescription pain medications were slowly taking over my day to day functioning in a very negative way. After researching kratom and its benefits, I decided to give it a try more than 4 years ago. The impact was immediate and I felt like I got my life back. Not only was I no longer inhibited by the negative physical and mental effects of precscription pain meds but I didn't experience hardly any of the pain and discomfort that I was left with from the surgery. I can't imagine going back to any semblance of that life style if kratom were to be banned. I'm a responsible law abiding member of society with a family and I need to be at my best everyday in order to the person I need to be for all those whom lives are impacted by my decisions. I feel that the DEA must not really understand the true value of this plant that has been so impactful to so many people. I've never had any negative side affects from using kratom. I don't drink, smoke or do drugs and I believe from my own years of experience that kratom is completely harmless and poses no hazard to its users. I truly hope the research and feedback from all the kratom users all over the world can do something to ensure that kratom is left alone and not scheduled as any type of drug. The very idea that this wonderful plant could be grouped with such deadly drugs as heroin and cocaine is a tragic mistake, in my opinion. I hope this input can be of some help. \nSincerely,\nDavid Hall","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8192","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Hall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 38 year old mental health professional, mother of three and contributing member of society.

I am a psychiatrist, and have patients who benefit greatly from Kratom; only rarely have I seen patients have difficulty with Kratom, and in those instances they were actively addicted to other substances.  I have seen no instances of overdose or serious side effects from Kratom, though I am aware that cases of overdose have been reported.  Patients who benefit from Kratom are of two types:  the first are recovering addicts, typically opiate addicts, for whom Kratom provides stabilization of their mood and cravings.  Dose escalation is unusual, because Kratom has a ceiling such that a person trying to get high on Kratom will be frustrated, disappointed, and nauseated.  They may feel sick from ingesting large amounts of an alkaloid plant, but they don't die as do persons taking high doses of pure mu-agonists.  The second group of patients has chronic pain (who may also be in recovery from an addiction).  These patients eschew opiates for fear of addiction and their deleterious effects on mood and functionality; they also find that opiates used long-term are ineffective for pain control (which they often seem to understand better than their physicians).  In addition, many of these chronic pain patients have ruined their stomachs after years of NSAID use, so are no longer able to avail themselves of this major category of analgesics.  What remains for them are the anti epileptics (gabapentin, pregabalin, et al.) and certain antidepressants (duloxetine, TCAs).  And, for some, Kratom.  \nThe pharmacology of Kratom is not well understood.  This is an argument for continued study, not a shutting down of investigation.  What is clear to me is that Kratom does not have the typical problems seen with regular opiates.  Just today, I met a patient who reported getting addicted to opiates following Vicodin use after having wisdom teeth removed.  I hear the \"wisdom teeth/Vicodin\" story a couple of times every month.  And yet I've not once heard of a patient taking Kratom and then progressing to heroin or prescription opioids.  \nMany of my medical colleagues reflexively oppose Kratom because they know little about it, and are quick to lump it in with the panoply of \"new\" Internet drugs.  This is a mistake, and I strongly encourage the DEA to take a step back.  Just because Kratom is new (at least in the US) does not make it equivalent to other new substances such as cathinones, designer hallucinogens, etc.   Let us not make the grave error of contempt prior to investigation.\nFinally, I have heard the argument that the ingredients/purity of Kratom cannot be assured; this is a reasonable concern, but it is not a unique concern.  I am sure you are aware that many substances used medicinally are not what they claim, and that even some of our prescription medications are also not what they claim:  the FDA has acknowledged their inability to ensure quality in the supply chain, especially from medications sourced abroad, with the great bulk of generic medications never undergoing a purity assay on a random basis.  \nI would much rather see the DEA devote its resources to better oversight of opiates and benzodiazepines, medications which destroy and end lives. I would prefer to see more attention paid to the galloping onslaught of cannabis legalization--we are only just seeing the first cases of a major flood of problems related to \"recreational\" cannabis use.  I would like to see better use of suboxone; how curious it is that suboxone prescribers are limited to the number of patients they may treat, but the prescribing of opiate medications is entirely unrestricted (shouldn't it be the reverse?)  Kratom is used benignly by large numbers of people and has potential in helping addicts to establish and maintain sobriety; I hope we can continue to use it.  \nThank you for considering my comments. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19700","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Meyers","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern-\n\nI'm writing to voice my concern about kratom being listed as a schedule one drug. As someone who is mixed-race Thai-American descent I am well aware of kratom's history in Southeast Asia. The plant was originally used in Thailand, Laos and Burma as a way to break local people's addiction to opium - which in the early part of the 20th century was an absolute epidemic.\nKratom worked so well that the opium cartels in Thailand pressured the government to outlaw the plant as it was hurting their profits (and curing millions of their addiction).\nAs someone who has watched his best friend nearly lose everything thanks to an Oxycotin addiction, I see very many similarities happening now in the US. The Sachler family (makers of Oxy) have just entered into the Forbes wealthies 15 families in America - meanwhile their drug has destroyed much of the middle of my country. \nPlease reconsider the ban of this plant.\n\nP.S. - I close relative is a former DEA agent.

I used to be a bad opiate abuser, for about 6 years. A junkie is how i felt. Thanks to Kratom I now live a normal life. I don't have opiate cravings. I don't get high on the stuff, it just lets me feel normal.\n\nThe only other option for addicts is suboxone or methadone, which is unavailable to anyone without insurance. Even then the treatments are ridiculously expensive and the drugs are much more harmful than Kratom itself.\n\nKratom is the only thing that I can afford. I live in a low income area in Missouri, where there is a lot of prescription abuse. How can it be that these pills can be pushed legally, but when someone wants to get off them, the same system that hooked people, won't help anyone without getting their thousands of dollars first. Don't know if you guys know, but suboxone is being sold as a street drug, so people are getting high on it.\n\nPlease don't ban Kratom, it's my only hope.\n\nI don't have health insurance. It's too costly for someone that makes minimum wage like myself. If you must do something regulate it like Tylenol, but even that will probably raise the price so much that it will become out reach for most of the poor addicts.\n\nBanning Kratom or making it harder to get or more costly will hurt a lot of people. They will go back to opiates. It's a disease brought on by the pharmaceutical companies, that this plant can cheaply and effectively help a lot of people like myself.\n\nSo in conclusion please help me stay a normal person, leave Kratom as a dietary supplement. I've never been happier or healthier than I am now. I no longer feel like a junkie.\n\nThanks for reading my story.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5409","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Keith Pahal","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Do not take away this alternative to prescription medications for varying ailments.

I realize the move to ban kratom was made from a place of concern, but I implore you to research this herb thoroughly before making this decision. This herd has been a part of my daily life for a decade. After being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and degenerative disk disease, my prognosis was bleak. I found myself under thirty years old and barely able to walk. My physician were kind and caring people, I have no doubt that they wanted me to recover some of my faculties; however, there is no cure for pain that comes with either of these diagnoses. Standard treatment for chronic pain leaves much to be desired. For a time I complied with my physician's orders, but found myself almost completely incapacitated. No longer could I responsibly raise my child since I spent most of the day asleep. My waking hours were like watching television in thick fog; it was no way to live for anyone. Then, completely by chance, I found an alternative that could possible give me a way out of my nightmarish dream life.\t\n I will not say kratom has cured me, there is no permanent solution for my ailments. Be that as it may, kratom has decreased my issues enough for me to power through and become a productive member of society once more. Once again I am able to work and contribute to my family. This semester I hit dean list for my program in school, and am thankful that Im stable enough to attempt finishing my education. Honestly, I would rather not imagine myself without kratom.

I am a 56 year old female with a bachelor degree in business who works as an application analyst. Please do not make kratom illegal or take it off the market for responsible adults. I suffer minor aches and pains from osteoarthritis and the effects of getting older. I have been taking NSAIDS daily since 2009, of which known long term effects include kidney, stomach, and heart damage; to address these aches until I tried kratom about a year ago. I found that Kratom tea relieves my pain so that I can be more active and sleep better. In addition, it helps me feel more motivated and in a better mood. I drink it a few times a week after I do yard work or exercise, for example.\nThere is ample experience sharing and information available on the Internet to set proper expectations for benefits and minor adverse effects if too much is consumed by accident. Consequently, I have never experienced a bad effect from it. According to reports, adverse effects are minor and resolve in a few hours. On a positive note, the minor side effects of over consumption serve the purpose of discouraging attempts to abuse it. I feel more confident that I am not damaging my heart and kidneys from using it, than I was when I took ibuprofen. Since I have been drinking kratom tea a few times a week, I have not had any colds or allergy flare-ups either. I see my doctor regularly, and my labs are consistently in the normal ranges.\nI encourage kratom to be studied in regards to its nutritional analysis, as I suspect it to be as beneficial as other green vegetables such as kale or spirulina. In addition to its nutritional benefits, it appears to have minor energizing and pain relieving effects similarly to coffee. A study to investigate its safe use would provide the scientific justification of what tens of thousands of users over hundreds of years already know. \nKratom has the potential to be a great benefit to society. It helps people avoid dangerous prescriptions and expensive doctor visits. This relieves pressure on the health care system and lowers insurance costs for all of us. Please do not take it off the market because of a few unscrupulous marketers and their outrageous claims of a legal high that alarm the authorities and encourage abuse by the ignorant. Please do not punish the large number of people who would benefit from this herb because of the misuse by a few.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3293","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Theresa Warren","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a professional historian and university professor.

Kratom has changed my life for only the better. I have suffered with CPTSD, scoliosis, PMDD/severe menstrual cramps, chronic migraines, and IBS for years. I really starting researching natural herbal remedies for pain and everything I was going though. Then I found Kratom, about 3 years ago, and  gave it a chance. I heard it had helped a lot of people especially the elderly in the area that I live in used it s lot. Since then it has made my life bearable. I was always in a state on anxiety and pain. It has helped me so much, without any noticeable side effects at all. I still have every disorder on that list but IT IS MANAGEABLE! It makes it so I can be a functioning member of society. If you take this away it would make it so I would not be functioning again and I would lose my job and home. Please do not schedule this safe alternative herb!! It has helped not only me but many other people including the elderly that cannot speak for themselves/ do not know how to use a computer.

Those medications and treatments along with my willingness to follow medical advice and do my part to mitigate my own circumstances make it possible to function and be as active as I can. When I moved to Idaho it took quite a while for my medical records to arrive from California and because of the stricter laws,, doctors would not prescribe my pain meds without seeing the MRI and other proof of my conditions. I was thrown into a painful withdrawal process and suffered through that and all of the pain that are part of my condition s. In desperation, i researched natural cures for pain and found out about kratom and met with a botanical supplier who recommended a specific type of kratom to alleviate my pain and my discomfort from sudden cessation of long-term opiate use. It was like a miracle within minutes of my first dose and I truly don't know how I'd have managed without it, as I am responsible for the care of my grandson who was two years old at the time. I now use kratom regularly instead of prescription meds and I can even go days without it when I am not in a flare or having intense pain. This is how I know there is no accompanying addiction with kratom. I could. Or do that with opiates, as your body develops physical dependence even when taken as prescribed. I feel it was because kratom was legal and available without having to see a doctor that my suffering ended and it would be a terrible mistake to regulate this natural remedy. Nature has provided an answer for when she betrays our bodies. Please keep kratom legal and available to all of us.

There was no disorientation, drowsiness or cognitive dysfunction.

I have suffered from chronic pain for over 20 years and im disabled. . I have undergone 3 spinal surgeries, plus many other treatments that did not help me.. i have also had major depression too.. I had been on opiate medication for over 16 years and was aware of the damage it was doing to my body.  In searching about healthier alternatives i ran across kratom. I researched it for 2 years before i tried it. I was able to switch to kratom and it was the best decision i ever made. No more nasty side effects and I've been able to discontinue 10 other rx drugs that dealt with the side effects of opiote medication. Since the crackdown on opiates. I had the same Dr for over 10 years who decided that due the Dea he chose to no longer prescribe opiates. I moved to a new state and was treated like i was a drug abuser at every visit. It took 4 months t find a dr that could treat me. The drug test and pill counts are so humiliating.  I now have a pain Dr that. I see.  And with kratom i have stopped almost all rx medicines. It has given me my life back. Kratom helps with the pain and depression. I have never gotten sick or had any negative side effects from kratom, in fact the opposite.  I have not heard of one person die solely from kratom. I know kratom was blamed for some that had other substances in their system as well. I know if kratom is made a schedule 1 it will force me to begin taking strong dangerous opiates again to be able to exist in my life. I say exist because that's all the rxs did for me. To where know I'm LIVING and can do things that I was never able to do before kratom.  I must also say that several times a month I skip 5 days of kratom and have no withdrawal like I did with the rx drugs I was given if I forgot a dose.  Please don't take my quality of life away by banning kratom.

Unlike many other psychoactive drugs with medical uses, namely cannabis, kratom does not produce a \"high.\" It is a medicinal plant from the coffee family with a wide spectrum of uses. I had used kratom to treat colds or exercise-induced muscle soreness previously, and it was extremely effective, but those are not enough of a reason for me to be writing this comment today. I am writing this comment because I was hit by a car while riding my bicycle one day, and I have had severe hip pain since. I have been prescribed a variety of painkillers since, and while they have been effective for pain they have caused brain fog, withdrawals and sedation. While withdrawals are a real thing with kratom, the severity of them is more likened to coffee/caffeine withdrawal than prescription opioids/heroin withdrawal. When I do not take kratom, I get mild cold-like symptoms with some added body aches. Nothing major or unbearable. Certainly not any more uncomfortable than the migraines I get without coffee. Not to mention that kratom clears my mind and gives me energy rather than sedating me.\n\nIf this is not enough of a reason, a coworker of mine kicked his heroin habit with kratom after my recommendation. Please do not ban kratom. It will only hurt the people and benefit those profiting from the sale of deadly prescription opioids.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6594","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Deon anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is an addendum (addition) to my first comment ID: DEA-2016-0015-4081. I am making this addition because it has only recently come to our attention that it seems the DEA is not being completely forthcoming when faced with a freedom of information request. Investigative reporter Anthony Roberts of MUCKROCK has requested all information on Kratom including any emails from FDA, DEA and pharma companies, and very specific sections of the intent to schedule, footnotes 17 and 18, 22. This information that the DEA is withholding is critical to the public mounting an offensive against such claims. It seems completely INAPPROPRIATE not to release all information, it's not like Kratom is a national security risk that warrants redacted documents or restrictions in releasing something?\n\nThese are his 2 most important articles, SO WHAT ARE YOU HIDING DEA?\n\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/search/?q=kratom\n\nhttps://medium.com/@anthonyroberts/dea-balks-at-latest-kratom-foia-refuses-to-provide-further-information-d725dc0ce170#.m4enfgn7k\n\nIt's in this 2nd one where the below excerpts are taken from. \n\n\"On August 30th, 2016, the DEA filed a notice of intent to temporarily designate Kratom (specifically its alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine) as a schedule 1 drug. That notice listed 33 footnotes/references, but the actual references themselves were not included in the document itself.\nLater that day, I filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for all of the data and documents referenced in the 33 footnotes. Specifically, this is what I asked for:\n\"I am seeking copies of all documents referenced in the 33 footnotes contained within the DEA's recently published notice of intent to temporarily place Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I...\nThis is a fairly straightforward request. The DEA wants to make this stuff illegal, and I want the public to have access to the same information as the DEA. Tens of thousands of people signed the petition to keep kratom legal (over 100k in the first week), and as a result, the DEA opened up a comment period for the public to respond. But in order to respond fully, we need to know what we are responding to. This means we need to see the information referenced in their footnotes, which is the evidence they're relying on to ban kratom.\nThe public has a right to see these documents.\nIn the case of some of the footnotes, I was asking for specific data they'd collected (from footnote (17 and 18, for example):\n\"...abuse of kratom/mitragynine[17] were analyzed by Federal, State, and local forensic laboratories.[18] According to data from the System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE) and STARLiMS (a web-based, commercial laboratory information management system), from January 2006 through March 2016, there were 293 records for kratom and/or mitragynine...\"\nIn other words, I was asking for the actual data references in footnotes 17 & 18, respectively, i.e. if there are 293 records on kratom abuse from January 2006 through March 2016, and those records were considered when the DEA attempted to schedule kratom, then the public should be able to inspect them.\nThis is the most basic logic: in order for the public to respond (and build a case against the ban), we must have access to the same data as the DEA. This is why, in court, the plaintiff (or prosecution) is required by law to provide the defense with all of the evidence they're using to make their case.\nBut the DEA has refused to provide us with their evidence. In fact, they provided absolutely none of the data they referenced. Instead, they provided documents that were already available (FDA press releases, copies of federal laws and regulations, etc...), none of which I didn't already have a copy of; none of the ones that provide evidence that supports the DEA's attempt to ban kratom.\"\n\nDid you hear that 2nd to last sentence THEY HAVE PROVIDED ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THE DATA THEY REFERENCED\n\nEmails between FDA,DEA,Pharma NEITHER CONFIRMED OR DENIED ANY EXIST?\n\nFootnote 22 emails between inter and intra agency memorandums which clearly exist NOPE NOT GETTING THEM?\n\nTHIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES. \n\nPROVIDE US WITH YOUR FOOTNOTES........PROVIDE US WITH YOUR DATA......what are we supposed to take your word for it.......UNACCEPTABLE. \n\n\nIt's because this substance is NOT AT ALL as dangerous as the FDA and DEA make it out to be. \nTHIS SUBSTANCE IS SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE AND IS USED TO MAKE PEOPLES LIVES BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nOver 7100 comments and 95-97% positive. The people and the science have spoken LEAVE IT ALONE AND REGULATE IT, TAX IT,.........ALL EVIDENCE POINTS TO THIS HAVING THE POTENTIAL TO BE MORE SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE THAN ANY OTHER CURRENTLY LEGAL SUBSTANCE OUT THERE...alcohol, nicotine, even caffeine AND not to mention prescription opioids, and many more,most of which are infinitely more dangerous than Kratom. \n\nHEAR OUR PLEA'S!!!\n\nSTOP THIS INSANE WAR ON DRUGS. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7142","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adam M","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please stop.

I appreciate your time and effort in reading the many responses from people like me who use Kratom regularly to help deal with the many health issues we face. \nI was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 2002. I have been on every medication used to treat the symptoms of fibro and many off label to try to get relief from this horrible neurological condition that affects the muscles, ligaments and every other part of my body. From Paxil to presently prescribed opiates, I've not found relief. They'll make me feel drowsy, but don't help with the pain and exhaustion that I go through everyday. You may have heard fibromyalgia is very hard to treat. \nAbout two years ago, I was on a Facebook group for fibromyalgia sufferers and someone mentioned Kratom. They said it was a plant from the coffee family and was not dangerous like opiates are. As you're well aware, opiate use and abuse is at an all time high across our great nation. Heroin and prescription pills are killing people everyday. I've personally lost two family members to opiate abuse. I did not want to become a statistic or memory to my daughter. \nI am one who has always been proactive in my healthcare. I researched Kratom for months before I finally found the American Kratom Association website. The group helped me find a Facebook group and there I found a vendor who has a safe and lab tested for safety product. My first time using Kratom still causes me to tear up. For the first time since I was a teenager, I felt like that strong man with his hands clawing into my upper back and shoulders had released me! There was no high, no woogly feeling, no spaciness; just a relaxation that came over my body. I cry everytime I think of it because I finally found something to help give me a break from the horrible pain I've felt most of my life! \nI learned about the different strains of Kratom, and found there was also one that helped people like me get energy. I tried it along with the strain for pain relief and I could clean my house! I could live!  All my daughter's life, I spent on the couch, curled up in pain. My pain costed her a childhood she could have had, had I known about kratom. As much as I tried to work 45+ hours a week, and be a good mother, I was just too exhausted to do much of anything else when I picked her up from daycare. \nKratom has given me life! Literally life! My now 24 year old daughter and I can go shopping, and spend the whole day! Yes. I am exhausted and achy the next few days, but at least I can do it! \nPlease take the comments of people who use this natural botanical in to consideration before you take it away. With the dangers we all face with opiates, this plant could be a saving grace for the millions dealing with pain and opiate abuse. \nThank you for your time. \n\nPeggy Hall \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7176","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Peg Hall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI have never signed any kind of petition or written to any government agency prior to today. But I feel the subject of keeping Kratom legal is extremely important.  I feel that the driving force behind the effort to classify Kratom as a Schedule I drug is misguided and ill informed. Kratom is not the dangerous street drug that some are trying to claim. In fact, it's just the opposite. It's the only legal alternative and in many cases, the only way out for many people who find themselves trapped in the grip of opiate addiction. I am. 43 year old man who found himself addicted to opiates after ten plus years of back problems and surgeries. For years, my doctors readily prescribed opiates to which I, like so many became addicted. When the rules were changed a few years back and the belt was tightened on prescriptions and doctors cut people off on their scripts, when drugs like Lortab were discontinued, the result was the creation of many heroin addicts and criminals.  People who could no longer get the medicines their doctors had pushed on them for years and were left high and dry. In desperation. Opiate withdrawal is a horrific and incapacitating process.  The natural reaction is to do anything necessary to stay well and not have to go through withdrawal.  Many turned to heroin or were forced to buy pills illegally. I was one of the latter. I had a good job and a family to support. I couldn't afford to go to rehab or lose my job because I was going through weeks of withdrawal.  Ultimately, I was arrested for possession of street pills. now with a criminal record haunting me, holding me back in life, I am determined to never be looked at as a criminal again because of what is actually a medical condition. Kratom has made it possible, alomg with counseling and NA meetings, has made that possible. Kratom is the only legal substance that anyone can obtain and use to ween themselves off of opiates. So many of us cannot afford to put life on hold and go to detox and rehab. Kratom makes it possible to work and be productive while healing from addiction. Kratom is a Godsend, not a danger. \nI still have back problems and severe pain intermittently. Kratom is the only natural, non threatening substance that I can use to treat that pain. Thousands of people use this plant safely and responsibly every day. It literally saves lives. Please don't take that lifeline away from those who cannot or choose not to use proven dangerous and addictive pharmaceuticals to treat their ailments. The pharmaceutical companies have enough victims as it is. Don't force us to be slaves to those companies and the addictions they create.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11744","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brad Pointer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To outlaw kratom, would be a sin, and a crime against humanity.\nI was addicted to over 500 mg of oxicodone & oxicontin for 2 years.\nI used Kratom to come off of the suboxone,  they told me would be an easy withdrawl.

So why ban a harmless plant that can assist in breaking these cycles of addiction?  My  belief is that pharmaceutical companies are making millions off the suffering of prescription opiate users (such drugs are prescribed with alarming frequency and little warning as to the dangers), and \"Big Pharma\" doesn't want anything interfering with that. \nI beg you to turn your attention to where the real dangers are and away from kratom.  \nThank you for listening. \nSIncerely,\nDena E.

I am an educated, relatively healthy, 61 year old woman living in New England. I first read of Kratom almost one year ago.  I was interested in it because of the claim that it relieved depression and arthritic pain, of which I have both. While I had no experience buying herbs, I had plenty of experience with prescription anti-depression drugs.  Through the many years of taking different anti-depressants, my mood and depression were not relieved in any long-term or satisfactory way.  This is what lead me to try Kratom.  \n\nAfter trying Kratom, I was surprised to find it had a mild, though distinctive effect, on my chronic depression, as well as an analgesic effect on my arthritis.  I was very pleased to experience this mild though effective herb! What is so terrific about Kratom is it's very gentleness. Does that make it ineffective? Absolutely not. It's effects are just enough to relieve depression and pain, but not enough to make you feel medicated, anxious, sedated, or to be used as a party drug. \n\nPlease keep Kratom LEGAL!!  Do not give in to the fear and paranoia that controls politics.

Doctors would throw more opiates at my pain, and as a result, I spent three years caught in a cycle of bed, to recliner, to bed,  a virtual zombie, absent from the life of my family. In 2009 I decided I'd had enough, and went to rehab to get off the opioids and find a better way to manage my pain that did not require me to surrender to somnolence. I was switched to Suboxone, which provided excellent pain relief (though it's usage as a pain control modality remains an off-label use to date, despite a proven track record in the rest of the world) without a clouded sensorium, but which was a tier 4 drug in my insurance plan, so it cost me $200 a month, which escalated to $300 a month in 2010, at which time my doctor switched me to generic Buprenorphine to save me some money, though it still cost me $120 a month. Still, it provided great pain relief, so I continued taking it until two months ago. Recent changes in Georgia law required me to move from seeing my doctor every 90 days, to seeing him every 30 days for buprenorphine, which added another $170 a month in office visit copays, along with urinalysis every other visit, though I have never used illegal or street drugs, and have never taken a prescribed medication in a manner inconsistent with my prescription. I decided to wean myself from buprenorphine. The thing nobody ever told me was how long the withdrawal period would be for buprenorphine as opposed to a traditional opiate withdrawal of a few days. Despite a very gradual taper, and ceasing taking buprenorphine only when my daily dose was down to .5 mg, the withdrawal was horrible. I ached everywhere, and I felt horrible. \n\nA friend recommended making a weak tea by boiling the dried, chopped leaves of the mitrogyna speciosa bush/plant. I obtained some leaves from a reputable vendor with a well-documented reputation for quality, and I made a decoction using approximately 4 ounces of dried Kratom boiled in a gallon of water for fifteen minutes. After the mixture cooled, I strained the leaves through a sieve and pressed the retained liquid through the sieve to extract all the liquid. I discarded the boiled leaves, sweetened the liquid with organic honey, and mixed it in a 50/50 ratio with regular iced tea. I started out with 4 ounces of liquid mixture, but had to gradually increase my quantity to 12 ounces before feeling any effect. When I did finally feel an effect, I did not experience any clouding of my sensorium, nor did I feel any increased alertness. I only experienced two effects from drinking my Kratom tea:  My withdrawal symptoms completely subsided, and my chronic pain was reduced to the same level I experienced when taking buprenorphine. There is no discernible \"high\", and no likability with Kratom tea. I drink my 12 ounces, and for eight to ten hours I am not only pain free, I am able to participate in life and raise my son without depending on pills, prescriptions, doctors or changing regulations. The real value of kratom is that it makes real relief available to the average citizen. As far as the risks associated with its use, I can find only seven anecdotal tales of reported harm to people using Kratom, and all of those were people using it for recreational purposes and taking it to excess. Even the National Institutes of Health's Liver Toxicity database contains only ONE documented case of liver damage attributable to recreational usage taken to excess. A similar search for acetaminophen returns over five-thousand cases of hepatotoxicity in a single year. Clearly a bottle of Tylenol is more dangerous to the average American than Kratom. \n\nI urge the DEA and the FDA to allow Kratom to continue to be sold, possessed and used in states where it has not already been declared illegal. A simple comparison of the risks versus the benefits would clearly show that a great many more people are helped rather than hurt by the effects of responsible Kratom use. In this regard, Kratom is no different than coffee, cigarettes or alcohol. I agree it should not be legal for minors to use, possess or purchase Kratom, because their lack of discretion might potentiate irresponsible use, even though Kratom is in one way a self-limiting drug, as excessive consumption simply makes the user vomit, removing the Kratom from their stomach and forestalling any serious adverse events. Please do not deny me and every responsible user of Kratom the freedom from pain and pharmaceuticals we currently enjoy through legal and responsible consumption of this overwhelmingly helpful plant, which is in reality a close cousin of coffee, which has been responsibly consumed and enjoyed for its effect for centuries, just as Kratom has throughout the world. \n\nThank you for reviewing my commentary.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0966","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 60-year-old self-employed longtime AIDS survivor who began taking kratom two and a half years ago. \nAlthough the AIDS medications I take have been effective in containing the growth of the HIV virus, I found that kratom gives me a mental focus that had been blurred somewhat as a side effect of the AIDS drugs.\nI am also concerned for the potential damage done to my kidneys from the AIDS medications, so I avoid any pain medication for my lower backaches.

I'm a thirty-one year old New Yorker and CNC programmer/machinist. I graduated in 2003 and went straight into the trade. Minus a brief layoff period I have been working for the same shop ever since. I would just like to say how kratom has changed my life and what it was like without it.\n\nI used to love my job when I first started machining. I had begun training back in high school in a vocational class. There is still a ton I can learn after thirteen years but after about ten it started to take a toll on me. The environment I work in is loud, repetitive, and tedious. I started out feeling down or grumpy depending on what day it was. Over time it got to the point that I was lashing out at coworkers.  A few years ago I had decided to seek professional help due to stress and anxiety. In early 2014 I decided to try anti-depressants and stuck with it for a couple months. I didn't like the way it made me feel at all or the side effects. The doctor recommended trying other drugs and groups of inhibitors so I did. I went through a number of different pills over the coarse of the next year or so. The way they changed me and the withdraw I had when I stopped taking them was frightening to me. After that I decided I might just be better off with a career change. It's hard to walk away from a well paying job when you worked your way up for over a decade. One of my life goals was to get my own place. I felt like such a pathetic person for wanting to give up on something that so many people around me would be proud to have. It also seemed ignorant considering I only have a high school education. It was around December 2014 when a friend recommended I try kratom. I was very reluctant at first and had a lot of questions. The worst part is most of the information you can find about it is by reading forums on the internet!!! Well I have always double, triple, and quadruple checked peoples opinions when it comes to sources like that. Even though my resolve was just about tapped out I wasn't about to resort to something I would regret. It turns out a large percentage of people who had taken it had only positive things to say so I tried two 750mg capsules. It made me feel like all my anxiety just vanished. The best way I can describe it is I felt like I was having a really good day. It was the exact thing I had been searching for the whole time. As time went on I continued to use it daily and also built up a tolerance fairly quick. Once I got to about six grams a day I started to get concerned. I realized there is no doctor telling what is okay and how much is too much. I knew from my reading that six grams is about average so I stayed right there for the time being. It was working so well for me I was putting in overtime at the shop and everyone around me got a little relief as well. In June of 2015 I finally bought my first house!! It's a beautiful little place on lake Ontario. I lived happily this way in my new home for months until me and my girlfriend started arguing about money. I slowly started increasing the amount I would take little by little until I realized if I bought more I couldn't pay my mortgage. This is the first time I had stopped taking kratom in more than six months. Over the coarse of the next week I felt sore, tired, and irritable. It wasn't so much I couldn't do my job though. After the first week I was back to normal and decided to give it a little time. Ever since then I have stuck with a routine to avoid budget problems and discomfort. I don't believe it's the kind of thing you can abuse too much because you build up a tolerance very fast. I'm also perfectly happy with my lower dosage. I noticed the higher it got the more ill effects came along with it. It was kind of like coffee in the way that if you drink too much you just get jittery and realize it's just not benefiting you anymore. \n\nThe only reason I am writing this today is because I feel that kratom can be more safe than any prescription pill. I learned on my own how it effects me but it doesn't have to be that way. It should be embraced not shunned. I understand the efforts of the people who have lost loved ones and want to find the cause. I think the evidence that it can be safe speaks for itself but also more evidence is obviously needed.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19906","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Sturm","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My sister-in-law treats her chronic migraines with Kratom. \n\nPlease use your influence to keep it a legal option in the United States.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAndrea R.

I have been an electrician for over 25 years. Eleven years ago I started having back and neck pain as well as leg and hand weakness. I went to a doctor and found out I was having severe nerve compression in my cervical and lumbar spinal cord areas.\nI was too busy trying to build a business and couldn't afford to take time off to heal from the surgeries and I was always taught you just have keep going and no whining, everyone has problems.\n\nBy 2012 my symptoms were so bad I couldn't go on like this anymore. I went back to the doctor and found out the problem had worsened to the point where I could die if I fell. I was having accidents from falling and my arms and legs were getting so weak that I could hardly make it through the day anymore without a lot of issues.\n\nI have had several spinal surgeries that have left me partially disabled as a result of severe and permanent spinal cord damage and in addition to six laminectomies, a cord tumor was excised as well.\n\nAfter surgeries I was left with even more severe back pain that makes it very difficult to walk. In addition I have been losing function in both hands making it impossible to use tools or do basic simple daily tasks we all take for granted.\n\nMy neurologist and neurosurgeon had been treating my symptoms with narcotic medications for years to help with the pain and spasticity. I was having to deal with awful side effects and in addition was developing symptoms of situational depression. I was not dealing well with what was happening to me. The drugs were making me sick and I was really having a difficult time with where my life was heading.\n\nA friend told me about a dietary supplement called kratom. This is a natural herbal tea like leaf that helps me live my life without having to rely on chemicals prescribed by a doctor. I have gone from using a handful of pills everyday to a minimal amount. My 30 day oxycodone prescription now lasts me more than ten weeks. I no longer take fentanyl, butrans, gabapentin,diazepam and antidepressants. I no longer have to take pills to help relieve the symptoms caused by the other pills.\n\nI have been taking kratom daily for the past three years and have been able to manage my pain, depression and anxiety symptoms without pills. There are no side effects, I am not addicted to it, I have zero withdrawal symptoms if I don't take it every day. I can function as a productive member of society without putting synthesized chemicals into my body.\n\nI am able to feel better without drugs and the horrible side effects they were causing me. If there was truly any kind of risk to my health or well being, believe me I would not be taking kratom. I do not use alcohol, tobacco or illegal drugs. I live a healthy lifestyle and pay close attention to my diet and I exercise every day.\n\nI should be able to feel better without the government telling me I have to use a pharmaceutical drug instead of a natural herbal supplement. I should have the right to make my own decisions as a citizen of the USA. This is a free country and I feel the FDA and DEA are not taking my freedoms into consideration. This ban is unconstitutional and an infringement of my rights. I feel like I have a right to be heard and I strongly oppose this ban. I sincerely appreciate you giving me this opportunity to express myself.\n\nThe government is supposed to work for me and not against me. This decision would adversely affect the lives of millions of people just like me. There is far more proof that suggests kratom is safe. I have done a lot of research over the past couple months regarding kratom and I see that the opponents of kratom have provided false and baseless comments that do not tell the truth. It is obvious there are people more concerned with money than health. This is absurd and an absolute abuse of power and should not be allowed to continue.\n\nPlease consider the results of a full and fair investigation from experts who will prove there is no imminent risk to responsible citizens and their health.\n\nThank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCory A.W.

Honestly, I wish I had discovered it years ago.

On a typical day I take 2.5 grams a dose and dose between 2-3 times a day, depending on activity or pain. This dosing level has been unchanged since I began using it. I have virtually no side effects (only occasional constipation which is managed by increasing fiber in my diet.) So while this is only my personal experience, it does lead me to conclude that this plant is not particularly addictive physically (I have gone without and while I'm grumpier because of the pain and have trouble walking, there are NO withdrawal symptoms like what I experienced from prescription opiates in the past) and kratom appears to have definite medicinal value which would be unable to be properly studied if such a scheduling were to occur.\n  While I oppose the scheduling of the active compounds in the kratom tree, I do believe that the industry could use regulation if only to ensure that products are unadulterated by pharmaceuticals.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10246","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bev Motard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used bith Kratom and Painkillers personally, and they feel similar when taken recreationally.

The name of a plant or strains may be used if it is the primary floral source. Kratom must be labeled with its common or usual name on the front of your package. (i.e. \"Kratom\" or \" Maeng Da Kratom\")\n\nNet Weight\nThe net weight of your product (excluding packaging), both in pounds/ounces and in metric weight (g) must be included in the lower third of your front label panel in easy-to-read type. (i.e. Net Wt. 16 oz. (454 g)) When determining net weight, use the government conversion factor of 1 ounce (oz) = 28.3495 grams or 1 pound (lb.) = 453.592 grams. Round after making the calculation - not before. Use no more than three digits after the decimal point on the package. One may round down the final weight to avoid overstating the contents. When rounding, use typical mathematical rounding rules.\n\nIngredients\nSingle ingredient products (such as Kratom) do not have to name that single ingredient when already used in the common or usual name on the front panel. However, if there are ingredients other than Kratom, you must list them in an ingredient statement. Some exceptions are spices, flavorings and incidental additives (additives which have no functional role and with minimal presence in the finished product) which have special rules.\n\nThe type size for ingredient listings must be no less than 1/16th inch as measured by the small letter \"o\" or by the large letter \"O\" if all caps are used in the declaration. There are exemptions that allow smaller type sizes for small packages.\n\n\n\nContact Information\nThe label must let consumers know who put the product on the market and how to contact that person. The name and the address of the manufacturer, packer or distributor of a packaged food product are required to appear on the label of the packaged food. This information, sometimes referred to as the \"signature line,\" must appear on the front label panel or the information panel. If space permits, include full address and telephone number. The information must be in a type size that is at least 1/16th inch tall.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0720","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thomas Larsen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 30 year old parent, employed full time with health insurance, and I own a home.

Did great on methadone,  got married,  bought a house , and had 2 children....a true \"Jones-esk\" life..except for having to go to a methadone clinic every week , waking up sick because my dose was way to high, and having to hide it from my extended family....sooooo....February 22 marked 15 YEAR at the clinic. Bone hurt, teeth have to be repaired constantly, and I wasn't allowed to take benzos. But not a problem I was sober ....RIGHT! .....Nope! So in Sept,  thanks to the DNA actually , a article popped up on my news feed about them trying to ban kratom.did some research, and bought a bag...after 3 weeks I was down from 100mg to 10mg. Now I'm completely off methadone!  And as my body is detoxing (which can last from 1-6 months, no joke withdrawls, too) my skin isn't crawling, I'm not craving candy (actually I'm eating better then ever), legs aren't restless, stomach is calm, head doesn't hurt, and I'm not in a \"withdrawl fog\". The 6 other times I've slowly tapered off methadone  (like they say to do ) sucked, can't sleep , eat , restless, and feeling like you have been hit by a semi (methadone replaces key vitamins and minerals in your bone , brain, and teeth) was so awful, plus I had all the Rx's to combat all the withdrawls, and the longer your on it the worst it is and 15 years is a terribly long time. But thanks to kratom I'm great! I'm detoxing by sitting on my porch with a glass of wine, made dinner for my whole family this afternoon, and read my 6 yr a book before bed....I can't put in to word the happiness I have for finding this. But I am no longer stuck in neutral and my husband isn't having to be a single parent while I try to get off a medication a doctor prescribed.  I also understand it was my choice to use drugs, but a choice I made as a kid shouldn't follow me when I did exactly what \" everyone\" said to do. And as crazy as it sounds when I was a junkie and got sick I actually went to my doctor, and took care of myself (I was lucky to have a great job) and that mention methadone. I did meetings, sponsors,  and therapy but I was still in terrible shape when I would finish. This is the best thing that could have happend to me and my family! Plus I have had major stomach problems since 3 months old , I've almost died 4 times from my stomach reveling food , yet some how I went from 116 lbs to 180lbs on methadone (sugar cravings) and now the weight is falling off. Another major issue I have is like most drug addicts I have a major anxiety problem. I was first put on Xanax a 8 years old ( only go through about 5-10 a year, to scared they won't work if I take them to often) and spent 6 years finding the right meds to treat it. And I had my doctor right a new script when I ordered kratom and decided to get off methadone. Haven't had to open once so far!  Needed Zofran once but pretty sure it was from my mums cooking and not withdrawls...just the fact that I was able to eat my mums cooking say so so so much about how well this stuff  works (hard to eatell normally let alone detoxing! Seriously, not kidding!). I can't believe out of all the help I've seemed to get clean, this was never mentioned. As far as cravings gof I'm way past even kinda thinking about wanting drugs , so I have no personal opinion on that, but my though I'd if your not feeling like crap you don't end to get \"well\" . So, this is my bumpy journey , there's way more , but if kratom has helped thus far I'm not to worried about going forward . For the first time in 15 years I'm planning my holidays around my family and not around clinic hours, and that is a glorious notion!

Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\n2.If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\n3.Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's.potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement\n4. Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n5. Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n6. Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nI strongly urge you not to ban kratom.\n\nThank you for considering my comments.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8989","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Brewer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please let freedom come back in style.

Being in a previous 5 year relatiinship with someone whom is addicted to opiate devried pain medication, mostly naros, has made me never want to touch pills. However, last year after being in a car accident my back is in unbearable pain every morning. My doctor suggested pills, and I refused for two reasons, I would never want to become addicted and secondly because I would have to pay for most of the presciption out of pocket and I couldn't afford it. I started looking for a way  to help and I found Kratom.  Kratom takes away my back pain almost completely, without ever having to touch a pill. I don't feel \"high\" from it, a bit more alert but that's it, certainly nothing more than drinking a cup of coffee.

The surgeries did not correct my problems and left me in severe chronic pain. For many periods up until 2015 I had no other option for pain management besides kratom. I was over joyed to find this mild, natural occurring herb that did so much for my chronic pain and associated depression. It really did save my life. Finally I was able to gain insurance and get into a pain management program. The opiates I take still carry nasty side effects that sometimes are hard to bear. It is nice to be able to take a day or two off from my opiates and substitute with kratom and not have to worry about suffering withdrawals. I fear if I ever could not afford pain management and kratom was not available I would seek stronger opiates on the black market. Kratom is a no brainer. It helps people manage pain without having to go to an addictive opiate. It also provides a way to get off of opiates for those looking to do so. I think banning kratom would cause a great spike in our countries opiate problem. Kratom is also dissociated with deadly overdoses, as a high dose causes extreme nausea and vomiting. This plant is related to coffee and chocolate. Banning this plant that so many people ingest to provide a daily good quality will have severe consequences and backlash resulting in higher opiate abuse which will come along with higher arrest and medical emergency rates that will strain our already precious police and emergency medical services. This plant is not more harmful or dangerous than supplements you can buy at your local GNC. Please do not schedule this drug, if anything regulate it like vitamins at your local pharmacy. Treat it like St. Johns Wort. We are making progress and steps forward with the legalization of medical marijuana across the country. Banning this herb is a step backwards in our country's progress and history of prohibition.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4124","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Seth Flake","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My sister suffers from fibromyalgia.

In fact, I could see pharmacists playing a major role in educating how to responsibly utilize Kratom. \n\nI practice in Missouri and there is an opioid epidemic in this state that is destroying lives. The scope of the problem is clearly larger than the state of Missouri but I can only speak to what I have seen. Prescription opiates and heroin have become interchangeable. If addicts can not obtain one, they obtain the other. It is a public health crisis. I know many people who have utilized kratom and it has changed their lives. \n\nStudies and anecdotal evidence indicate that yes, kratom has the potential to become habit forming but it does not compare to the destructive and addictive behavior of aforementioned prescription and heroin abuse. This does not mean it needs to become a schedule I narcotic. This line of thinking will get us nowhere in society. Alcohol and nicotine are extremely unhealthy when used in excess but because of the profit they generate and their long term use in our society we for the most part let them slide, even though they have enormous impacts on healthcare cost every year. Overheating and the obesity epidemic are very similar. As a healthcare professional it seems ridiculous to me to consider banning kratom. In that case alcohol, nicotine, and fast food should be banned as well.\n\nLastly, I suspect this \"ban\" was largely pushed/encouraged by pharmaceutical companies. It is hurting their profit margins. Also, rescheduling it as a schedule II and letting pharmaceutical companies reap the profits is a terrible idea. There are thousands of people in this country that benefit from kratom. Taking it away will cause many of them to revert back to more dangerous drugs and behavior. \n\nI took an oath when I became a pharmacist and it as is follows:\n\n\"I promise to devote myself to a lifetime of service to others through the profession of pharmacy. In fulfilling this vow:\n\nI will consider the welfare of humanity and relief of suffering my primary concerns.\nI will apply my knowledge, experience, and skills to the best of my ability to assure optimal outcomes for my patients.\nI will respect and protect all personal and health information entrusted to me.\nI will accept the lifelong obligation to improve my professional knowledge and competence.\nI will hold myself and my colleagues to the highest principles of our profession's moral, ethical and legal conduct.\nI will embrace and advocate changes that improve patient care.\nI will utilize my knowledge, skills, experiences, and values to prepare the next generation of pharmacists.\nI take these vows voluntarily with the full realization of the responsibility with which I am entrusted by the public.\"\n\nI strongly suggest taking some of those points into consideration when debating how to handle this issue. Let healthcare professionals work with the public and allow them to utilize this wonderful plant to do good. Don't make the same mistake that's been made time and time again. Thank you for reading.\n\n-Derek Barker, PharmD\n\n\n\n ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5233","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Derek Barker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Stephany Tamm I'm 37 year old mother of 2 children and I'm a self employed Housekeeper.

I have ingested it and felt it's pain relieving and calming powers.  I discovered Kratom because my fiance has chronic pain in his knee from an injury 20 years ago. Prior to us meeting, but after being many years addicted to his opiate pain pills, he ended up shooting heroin to afford his habit. It destroyed his life and his last marriage. It has now been three years he's been off opiates and Kratom has helped him stay clean. \nWhen we first started dating last year I noticed his drinking increased after working on his feet all day at a restaurant. He admitted he thought he was drinking more than he should, but he was doing it to stop the pain. We decided to try kratom because even though he beat his addiction previously and underwent therapy for the emotional pain he had been medicating, he was still in physical pain. \nNow, he takes kratom 3-4 times a day and says it works better on his knee pain than any opiate he's ever used.  He's no longer stressed out and is losing the extra weight he put on after kicking dope. \nPersonally I have had awesome success with using Kratom to relieve menstrual cramps. It also helps me sleep. I use it every day because I've found that it regulates and relaxes my Irritable Bowel. I've had IBS issues most of my life mostly controlled with diet and Ive never had a treatment that worked like Kratom. It treats my anxiety at the same time.

I did rather extreme sports right up until middle age and never got hurt. Then a gardening accident (standing up suddenly after weeding for hours) followed by an embarrassing yoga accident did me in. Go figure! I was in severe pain for well over a year as arthritis set in and all my dreams of an active retirement turned to dust along with my joints.\n\nThe one bright spot in this dismal scenario was my discovery of kratom, the most amazing herb on the planet for effective pain relief, lack of side effects, and safety. Now there are many varieties of kratom, so let me make it clear that my only experience is with red vein horned kratom and red vein Borneo which were recommended for pain relief.  I can't speak to the effects of other varieties.\n\nOnce you receive your packet, you will notice that it looks like tea, which, I guess, is what it is.  Unfortunately, it's pretty awful tasting tea, but I will share with you my method for getting it down painlessly.  But first, we need some ground rules to prevent overindulgence and unhappy effects.\n\nI just had two ground rules: \"You only take this stuff if you wake up in the night in pain and can't get back to sleep. Also, you are limited to one level teaspoon in your tea.\"  I'm not saying this form and amount of kratom will get you back to sleep but you won't care because you will be pain free and feel relaxed and rested up to four hours later.\n\nOkay, if these are your ground rules, you are going to need to be prepared since you will be groggy should you wake up in the night in pain.  Get a one cup jar with a lid and place one teaspoon of dry kratom tea \ninside.  Have a thermos or Contigo mug handy, full of the most delicious tea you can find.  Hibiscus mint tea sweetened with a little stevia works great.  Now, all you have to do is pour one quarter to one third cup of tea into the jar containing one teaspoon of red vein kratom, screw on the lid, and shake.  \n\nAlternate taking a swig of the kratom tea with taking a swig of the plain tea and, after  four or five gulps, you'll have it down with no problem.  Now lie down and relax.  This will take about fifteen minutes. After all, you haven't been injected or taken an IV; it has to get through your stomach.\n\nThe first thing you will notice is the absence of pain.  This is likely to amaze you, because you will not notice any other changes.  It's not like marijuana.  You won't feel stoned or in any way out of control. There's just no pain. \n\nThe second thing you will notice, after a few more minutes, is a feeling of being embraced in a state of utter peace.  Okay, that may sound a little like an opioid experience and, I admit, you will want it to last because there is no thought involved, just drifting in a universe where nothing seems to be wrong.  \n\nThe next stage is one of free association.  It's sort of like a waking dream, but you are totally in control if you want to be. It's nothing at all like hallucinating.  Rather, it's what you experience every night right before sleep, but in this case, it lasts much longer.\n\nThe only negative experience I have had the next morning is an occasional  slight headache which goes away as soon as I start moving about and have something to eat.  Then again, it may have just been seasonal allergies.  \n\nI have never gone beyond one teaspoon which has continued to do the trick, providing complete pain relief.  You may read about people doing three teaspoons, but you are much less likely to develop tolerance (need \nmore to get the same effect) if you stick to one teaspoon.  \n\nNow go sign any online petitions that are out there to keep kratom legal.  This is your safest bet for effective, safe, relief from pain if you stick to your wise ground rules.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6171","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Suzanne Carter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I absolutely am opposed to any scheduling of Kratom.

Cigarettes and Alcohol kills people daily yet they remain legal. It's a hypocritical policy that needs to go away. There have ZERO PROVEN deaths from Kratom. Each individual had other factors involved virtually all of which were on prescription pills. It's time we the people fight back against this horrific and failed war on drugs. Nothing has been achieved beyond making America have more people in prison than anywhere else. Methamphtamine is a schedule 2, but Kratom would be made a schedule 1?

Having used and explored several hundred different herbs, I can say with confidence and sincerity that Kratom is one of the safest herbs I have used with a wide range applications. \n\nWhile mostly used for safe and non-addictive pain management, it is also successful in treating depression and anxiety. After finding no success with pharmaceutical or natural  remedies for my depression and anxiety, I discovered Kratom which I have been using for the last 3 years.  It is not only effective, there are literally no side affects and I have not experienced any kind of tolerance. Therefore I have been using the same amount daily without the need to increase quantity for 3 years now.  I found it much more effective than St. Johns Wort - a well known and effective treatment for depression. I personally know of 3 other people who use it for the same purpose with equal success. \n\nIn addition to relieving anxiety and depression, it also reduces pain in my body -  I no longer need to take pain medication for a spine condition that I have had or over 15 years. Prior to discovering Kratom I was depressed and in pain all the time. Kratom has quite literally saved my life and given me a quality of life I could have never imagined prior. I personally know of 2 other people who regularly use Kratom for pain relief with great success and zero negative side effects. \n\nI beg you to consider all the benefits of this plant and the many, many people who have been helped and who share a similar story to my own.

Many patients are also discovering the value of kratom in decreasing or eliminating their dependence on prescription pain medications.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry has a vested interest in debunking methods of pain management which do not further its own agenda. I certainly hope the influence of corporate pharmaceutical lobbyists is not a factor in the DEA's decision making process. No doubt big pharma is chomping at the bit to make kratom \"their own\", furthering their already astronomical profits, at the expense of the health and wellbeing of the American people.\n\nThe fact that the number of poison center calls regarding kratom has rapidly increased in no way translates to a need to schedule this plant. It merely suggests more people are discovering it's value and wishing to gain further information. \n\nThe DEA loses credibility when it fails to responsibly assess it's decisions in a manner consistent with good science. Evidence of harm from this plant is so vastly outweighed by innumerable reports of its efficacy. If for no other reason than reducing prescription drug abuse, the DEA might please consider leaving well enough alone! The use of plants to improve the human condition began thousands of years ago, and will continue. \n\nHas the DEA still not acknowledged the failure of the \"War on Drugs\"? Kratom has not demonstrated sufficient harm in a significant number of people to warrant efforts to eradicate it's use. These efforts will result only in harm by denying legal access to many thousands of legitimate safe, responsible users who deserve the freedom to choose. \n\nAre there no potential risks to kratom remaining available without criminalization? Of course not! But until the unlikely day that it's use is shown to harm more people than it helps, it is unjustified and irresponsible to make it a controlled substance in an era when there are so many bigger fish to fry.\n\nAs a physician, a patient, and an American, I implore the DEA to more carefully evaluate the evidence (or lack thereof) and allow kratom to be used without criminalization.\n\nI sincerely appreciate the DEA's recent decision to allow discussion of this matter. \n\nWith Thanks and Respect,\n\nEly Zaslow MD","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10694","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ely Zaslow","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 51 year old retired fire captain / paramedic.

I have myelomalacia. \n   I was on OXY and Hydrocodone until 12 month's ago. An old friend told me about Kratom. I did my research. Since the day I started using kratom, I have not had to take any painkillers. I still have a bottle of hydrocodone from one year ago.\n   I have been mixing the crushed up leaf. I take 5 grams every four hours.\n   Kratom has given me back some normalcy. I have not experienced any side effects at all. With painkillers there were so many side effects. With kratom I don't experience the urge that painkillers have. I don't get high from it. The pain just disappears about 7 minutes after I drink my \"tea.\"  Also, it gives me a better attitude on having to deal with my situation. \n   Kratom is a miracle, all natural, organic herb. \n   The only gain to making this illegal, would be to help the drug companies keep their monopoly on their deadly prescriptions. I only have month's to live. Please don't make my last few month's Hell. \n     Kratom will make life for our military men and women, suffering from PTSD and pain livable. Kratom will be able to get people in rehabs off of opiods, without a physical withdrawal. \n    Contrary to erroneous reports, nobody has ever died from Kratom, ever.

My job requires me to be up pretty early in the morning, so shaking off the sleepy feeling can be tough. As I've never been a fan of coffee or tea I've always been on the lookout for something that could perk me up without resorting to energy drinks. Kratom has been perfect for me. It gives me just the right amount of an energy boost without feeling jittery or crashing like caffeine does. \n\nI don't use it daily, usually 2-4 times a week, and I've never suffered any sort of adverse effect. I've always been so amazed at how something that helps so much seems to have little in the way of side effects. I also find that with the energy boost I'm also more focused as well as cheerful. It also seems to make socializing easier. \n\nAll in all, I've had nothing but a positive experience with kratom and have recommended it to friends and family. When I heard the DEA was going to be scheduling it, I was shocked. I do hope that the DEA takes experiences like mine into consideration and decides against this measure.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2178","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Blair Krolak","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nMy name is Kristoffer Jones. I have used the plant mirtrygenine speciosa, also known as kratom, for approximately 4 years.  I am a 34 year old resident of Texas, and work in commercial pest control. I make $60k/yr currently, and have been one of the top ten employees for the Texas district of our company for 6 months running. I save a large portion of my paycheck each period, because my wife and I are saving for a house. In every way, my life has become better since I began using kratom.\n\nI had a troubled childhood, and was prescribed antidepressants from the age of ten on. That is normal for some reason nowadays, but at that time it was unheard of. I had terrible anxiety, anger, and a lack of self esteem and self control.  I got into drugs and eventually ended up with a drug possession charge at 18, for a joint found during a traffic stop.  I was a good kid, but a loser.\n\nThat followed me, and i had to work menial jobs and pay my way through community college on my own dime. Heading to work one day, pulling out of the driveway onto a highway,  my father and I were rearended by an SUV going 75mph.  We might have been going 5mph.  The vehicle rolled three times and the cab was crushed in. My father was wearing his seat belt,  and ended up with a brain injury. I wasn't , because I had a bad habit of buckling up as we started down the hill . I was thrown violently around in the vehicle but miraculously I wasnt thrown from the vehicle. My father was determined to be at fault because he was accelerating up to speed on the shoulder. Neither of us had insurance, so I opted to not be taken to the hospital with him. I knew i was in pain, but compared to my father i thought it was fine. I wasn't.  My back and shoulder have never been the same. \n\nI turned to opiates. It helped with the pain and also made me a happier person when I had my drugs. I wasted most of my twenties in this cycle of relapse, depression,  poverty.  I wanted out  \n\nI did exhaustive research. Methadone and suboxone are supposed to be the answer. They arent.  We used to LOOK for those on the street.  They make you a slobbering mess and if you didn't have them you went through worse detox than morphine.  It's longer and wrecks your mind. \nEventually I happened upon kratom on a detox forum.\n\nIt is a partial Mu opioid agonist.  Even if you  saturated all your receptors,  you wouldnt suffer from the respiratory depression that kills addicts. It doesnt get you very high, and taken to excess you just feel terrible and then throw up.  Its addictive, but not in any way like true opiates.  You feel tired and crave it, but I never felt the compulsion to do what i would to get a fix like true opiates. Ive gone weeks without it, waiting for my prefered source to become available.  I was fine in 3 days and never missed work.\n\n  Most importantly,  its legal and affordable.  I spend $50 a month, instead of a day. I can  moderate my use and be a productive citizen and a good husband. I don't put myself in danger to obtain it.  My mood has improved,  and I dont take antidepressants anymore.  Sometimes the back and shoulder pain acts up and i am forced to *gasp* take a Tylenol along with a dose of kratom to really put it down.  Knowing Im not a criminal is great peace of mind. It gives me the confidence to keep looking up. I want to start a company soon. If I can come up with a good idea I'll do it.\n\nHere are the facts: Kratom is a slightly addictive substance. It can be abused like alcohol. Some people will ruin their lives huffing Glade. The fact that its possible to have a problem with using Kratom doesnt make it inevitable.  Most people who use kratom use it for a medical reason, mental or physical.  It was used in Thailand for hundreds of years with no issue. The only reason it was made illegal was to make way for opium. Please don't make the same mistake the thai made. Please don't regulate it to allow pharmaceutical companies to dictate pricing and availability.  We pay taxes when we buy it and we buy it in a way that has integrity. My supplier tests each batch for potency and to make sure it doesn't contain pesticides or adulteration.\n\nIf you want to make it safe as possible,  keep it legal and require proof of age (21)  and batch analysis from the sellers. This will cover all bases. No one will do without and no one will get hurt.  The only instances of any harm were in poly drug deaths involving other CNS depressing substances. The chemicals in kratom may lead to better drugs for pain management.  Keeping it legal makes it easier for companies to study. \n\nThank you for reading this if you have taken the time.  I want to believe that you have our best interest in heart.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12370","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kristoffer Jones","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"please do not ban kratom.

Now I can't credit kratom alone with the fact that I am now a certified caregivery, a fully functioning member of society on the path of recovery with his own car, apartment, and future to look forward to, but it has definitively made a difference. I have an anxiety disorder that has kept me in a cycle of self medication my entire life. Kratom not only relieves this burden but also energizes me unlike the dangerous oft prescribed benzos Dr.'s love to give for anxiety these days. Kratom also helped me kick my opioid addiction by helping me \"stepdown\" off a gram a day heroin habit without any of the side effects of Methadone or even suboxone. With my current kratom dosage, 3 - 5 grams of leaf powder brewed in hot water, I don't even feel \"high\". Just a little energized and relaxed like chamomile and caffeine. To completely ban this incredible plant would be a great loss in the war on drug addiction and would bar any potential research regarding the medical potential of the active alkaloids in kratom. I heard a certain statistic cited  in favor of the ban which mentioned the increase in kratom related calls to poison control centers to over 600 in a five year period. This is amusing when compared with caffeine related poison control calls which numbered over 2000 in 2005 alone. Are we going to classify caffeine as a schedule I narcotic?

I've used Kratom for about a year an a half. I believe that it is not dangerous in any way. I first heard of Kratom through my Vape shop and have continued using kratom off and on since then. Before trying kratom, I did research online and deemed that it would be safe for me to try it. I feel that kratom has helped me with anxiety, stress, and focus. I am not a drug addict and never have been. In the time that I have used kratom I have never felt any withdraw symptoms at all. I work in the Mental Health field and feel that kratom could be beneficial in the future. It's not severe like opiates and other medications on the market now. I've seen more of my client's overdose and in some cases die from benzos or other drugs that are legal. I think kratom should remain legal because it is natural, it's been used in some parts of the world for millenia, and the documented \"deaths related to kratom\" are inaccurately reported. More people have died from heroin overdose, alcohol related incidents, and other prescription drugs than from kratom alone. I would love to see more research go into kratom, but scheduling it and banning it seems unnecessary and overkill. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for a while now. I was taking prescription medications to help with those symptoms, but I stopped after realizing it was causing weight gain, high blood pressure, and the pharmaceutical companies were making millions while I was still suffering from a mental illness. After I stopped taking my medication and started using kratom, I have never felt better. I am content with my life, I'm focused, and hard working. Part of how I achieved that has to do with kratom and the other half has to do with my support system. I don't believe the DEA should ban a plant that is natural on this earth and has continued to benefit people for many years.

I started using kratom about 2 years ago after contracting Lyme disease and developing chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia as a result. Prior to Lyme I was an active  and healthy; afterwards, not so much. In fact, I was barely able to get out of bed, let alone function normally.\n\nMy doctors and I tried everything--and initially I was hopeful: NSAIDS, anti-anxiety, anti-depression, over the counter vitamins and supplements, injections, creams and lotions, opiods, physical therapy, yoga--until it just felt like an endless, hopeless cycle. Finally, at one of the support groups I attended, someone mentioned a natural supplement: kratom. I did my research--of course I was skeptical, but willing to try it.\n\nSince then, I use 1-2 teaspoons/ day in juice in combination with my prescribed treatments and medications. I have been able to decrease my pain medications significantly, sometimes never needing them at all! My activity level has also improved, even though it is not near what it was prior to the Lyme. Is it possible that it was all a coincidence that I started feeling and doing better once I stated taking kratom? Yes. However, I find that unlikely.\n\nI think it would be a mistake and very detrimental to the thousands of responsible kratom users like me if you severely banned it. I certainly support more investigation and research into its use and benefits, but not a total ban that would cause many people like me to suffer needlessly.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMary Buchatsky","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18265","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mary Buchatsky","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to comment on the plant Kratom.

I would strongly urge that kratom be kept legal as a true natural substance that helps with so many issues that people today face.   thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11307","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Edward Houston","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do the research.

As both a researcher and a citizen, I implore you to permanently reconsider this stance for a number of reasons:\n\nFirst, to label kratom as an opiate is severely misrepresentative. While the plant does provide some euphoric effects, these are not the same type of effects found in other opiates. Kratom merely provide mood-enhancing effects, which are similar those produced by caffeine. Kratom users do not experience a \"high\" or any sort of cognitive or behavioral impairment while the compound is in the body. Kratom is more accurately an opoid, which is simply a \"compound that binds to one or more of the three opioid receptors of the body\" (much the same way over-the-counter pain reducers and anti-inflammatories are). Kratom has been used for centuries around the world as a natural pain-relieving alternative.\n\nSecond, there is no substantial and clinical evidence that kratom has any substance dependency side effects; that is, it has not been found to be addictive. In fact, kratom are often used to help those with drug addictions become non-dependent and return to happy and healthy lives. In fact, kratom are used in limited trials across the country in drug treatment centers and rehabilitation programs as a way for the body to more easily transition off of street drugs. Of the dozen or so reported cases in the US in which kratom was attributed to drug overdose and death, it should be noted that the vast majority of those individuals also had other illegal drugs or highly addictive prescription drugs in their systems at the same time. To associate their overdoses with kratom is presumptive and non-evidential. \n\nIn many cases, kratom also provide a safe alternative to millions of Americans who have long-term disability and require daily pain-relief management. Rather than turn to highly-addictive and over-priced pharmaceutical prescription pain medicine, millions of Americans rely on kratom as an alternative. In limited trials, kratom is being used to help treat veterans of our country with symptoms relating to PTSD. For individuals like veterans with prolonged physical and mental injuries that require life-long pain management, kratom provide a safe, effective, and affordable alternative. Kratom also provide individuals who cannot afford pharmaceutical medications an alternative - and one need not look too far to see evidence of the pharmaceutical industry's price-gouging techniques.\n\nThe DEA's original letter of intent also hinged on the presumption that kratom is currently unregulated. However, most kratom are sold through normal, honest American businesses run by honest and hard-working Americans. One's ability to purchase the product through retail and online distribution channels provides both economic benefit to American industry as well the ability for companies to continue to produce an honest product. Classifying kratom as a Schedule I drug would inevitably result in the type of behavior the DEA has said it is concerned with - namely that if kratom becomes illegal, it will certainly begin to be circulated through less transparent channels. The DEA, in effect, might create the very thing it was attempted to thwart if it chooses to classify kratom as a drug. The DEA and FDA often allow individuals to purchase unregulated health and nutrition products/supplements without pause.\n\nKratom is a natural, non-addictive, and effective alternative for millions of Americans who want the choice to manage their day-to-day pain. Kratom allows individuals an alternative to expensive  pharmaceutical drugs (both prescription and over-the-counter) - drugs that have also been found to create dependency, damage the body's liver and other vital organs, and leave people in a state of impairment while in the body. Kratom is not a drug, neither in the normative and non-normative sense. And to label it as such will have drastic negative and unnecessary implications for millions.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4608","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matt Donovan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be classed as  a schedule one  narcotic.

Because of the benefits of kratom I am now healthy, gainfully employed, and half a decade into sobriety.

Alcohol consumption saw an initial drop followed by a steady increase on track to exceed pre-prohibition rates when it was overturned. Drug use has steadily risen since the formation of the DEA and now drugs are cheaper and more widely available than ever before.

I work long hours, 6-7 days a week, often in ergonomically stressful positions, pulling weeds for hours or harvesting greens on my hands and knees. I have found kratom to be quite effective in boosting my stamina and flexibility, relaxing my muscles and allowing me to remain efficient and mentally positive while tackling mundane tasks. I have been farming for 6 years now and this past season has been my most productive, both in terms of my physical output and my outlook on the future of my career. \nThis past season was also my first season farming independently. My first 5 seasons were spent apprenticing under other growers, and this year was the first year of my own business. Starting a business can be stressful, especially contending with the uncertainties inherent in agriculture, and I have found kratom to also be effective at handling that stress and anxiety. Not in the sense that it allows me to ignore the stress or become numb to it. Rather, that it interrupts the physical symptoms of anxiety, the tightness in my chest, the butterflies in my stomach, and frees my mind to look objectively at the sources of that anxiety, allowing me to tackle the stress rationally and with a level head and relaxed body.  \nI oppose the scheduling of kratom and urge the DEA to reconsider. Much has been written about the potential of the plant to help those with opioid addiction. I have personally been affected by opioid addiction as both friends and family members have struggled with prescription pills. I don't have experience with using kratom in this capacity but it seems worth researching, especially considering the epidemic of addiction in our country. \nThis article -- https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kratom-drug-ban-may-cripple-promising-painkiller-research/ -- details the research already being conducted which suggests the medicinal potential of kratom. These studies directly contradict the qualification of 'no medical use' for schedule 1 drugs. \nFor these reasons and the profoundly positive impacts that kratom has had on my own life I urge the DEA to halt the ban on kratom. Regulate it, impose age restrictions on purchasing, require those selling the herb to undergo the regulations that other supplement companies are subject to, but do not make it schedule 1. There are too many responsible, productive members of society who benefit from this plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10799","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Mallon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am an ex heroin addict who used suboxone to get off of opiates and got off suboxone by using kratom and am a big proponent of the use of kratom to get off of opiates.

A few years ago, I began to suffer from sciatica due to herniated discs in my spine.  After three years of treatment, from acupuncture and massage to injections and prescription drugs, I became completely incapacitated. My neurosurgeon scheduled spine surgery. I've had two microdiscectomies. While those surgeries have helped me tremendously, I still suffer from pain every day of my life. Taking care of two children, one of which has a brain injury, and working a full time, fast-paced job in brokering, requires me to be in top-notch condition- physically and mentally. Kratom has allowed that. Sleeping is painful. Waking is painful. It's extremely difficult for me to use the restroom, shower, get dressed, drive, etc. Kratom has made these things tolerable. I discovered this amazing botanical, quite by accident, about a year ago. I thought I'd give it a try. ANYTHING would be better than narcotic prescriptions and their terrible side effects and gabapentin, which made me feel fairly stupid and forgetful. I began dosing Kratom daily. I couldn't believe my body's response! Kratom must be the most amazing plant God has provided for us! With Kratom, I have my life back. Simple tasks are doable, I'm more active, and have lowered my blood pressure. Please keep our plant legal. Without it, I will lose my life, again. Thanks to Kratom, I am living.

The supporters that are pushing to keep it legal typically fall into one of two categories, those profiting off the drug or the addicted users of the drug.  Kratom is marketed as a safe natural alternative to other medications as well as a health supplement but the truth is it is far from safe.  Deaths and injuries have been documented from the use of Kratom.  Kratom has no approved medical uses.  Many use it as an alternative to other illegal addictive drugs, but switching from one addictive dangerous drug to another is not a victory in the battle against addiction.  Crack addicts switching to heroin wouldn't be a reason to make heroin legal and so it is with Kratom as an alternative to pain medications.  Furthermore Kratom is accessible to young people not able to purchase alcohol.  They mix Kratom with cough syrup, sodas, and ice and use it for recreational use for a high. Furthermore bars serving Kratom allow the users of this drug to get on the road and endanger the rest of the population because there isn't the same stigma or public knowledge as there are with other drugs.  These businesses are profiting from addicts, people in pain, the depressed by falsely promising Kratom as being safe.  This dangerous drug is most similar to opium in its effects both on the individual and society.  Thailand and Malaysia have banned it and the USA should do the same in order to protect our youth and our general population despite the protests of profiteers and addicts.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0030","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I live in NJ, a state that has always been a very prevalent place for opiate use, particularly heroin. I have literally lost friends and family members to heroin and opioid addiction. These people that are gone from us forever went through the ringer trying to get clean: courts,rehabs, 12 step programs etc. and none of them worked. \n\nMany addicts in their quest for sobriety and a normal life chose to switch over to synthetic alternatives such as suboxone only to find even longer and more pronounced withdrawals. As it stands now, there is NO viable answer for opioid dependence by traditional medicine or the institution. The answers we get from them are either highly potent and addictive substitutes in methadone or suboxone, or more jail time. Neither of these is an effective answer for society.\n\nOn another hand, we have a natural,legal, and safer plant that grows naturally and has extremely diminished abuse potential when compared to opioids. That plant is kratom. For me personally, it entirely eliminated all cravings for opioids and withdrawal symptoms within minutes of ingestion. Not only that but it also lifted the depression that was hanging over me for months trying to quit opiates and suboxone. For overcoming opiate dependence kratom is a more effective treatment than any pharmaceutical that we have available. I literally have hope for the future and my life back, and kratom was the plant that enabled me to get to this point. This plant can do so much good for others, I don't doubt that if it was more widely used it could greatly reduce the suffering felt by addicts, families, and communities nationwide. \n\nThis plant should be the number one choice for those quitting opiates. It should be available to anyone in the public. I'm not exaggerating when I say it literally got me off of the streets in Paterson as an addict. It can help others too. With this plant we can help addicts get back to society and back to productivity. To ban this substance would be to enable millions to suffer and cause social harm through using heroin and other opioids. I would liken it to treason upon your own people. \n\nGetting rid of this plant will only enable more heroin users. Heroin is both the most dangerous and most addictive street drug. It's the most evil substance and the most difficult to stop using due to excruciating withdrawals. This plant kratom helped me gain my humanity back, and I want to help the fellow suffering addicts and families get the same help. There is another way that's herbal and inexpensive!

I have yet to come across strong evidence of negative side-effects or of it being habit forming.That is not to say that there are no draw backs, but rather that more research needs to be done in order to find out what they may be.\nFrom a medical perspective I avoid taking any drug, Whenever possible I would prefer to take natural drugs over lab made pharmaceuticals. I don't think lab made pharma doesn't have a place in modern medicine, but when there are options available with a lower risk of dependence or other side-effects, those should be the first option. Placing this on the schedule 1 drug list would reduce the options for the medical research that is needed.\nFrom a recreational perspective I am not an active user of anything, I don't even drink coffee on a consistent basis. But just because I don't enjoy taking them doesn't mean that others shouldn't be able to. \nAs a society we need to start learning from the mistakes we have made in the war on drugs. We need to start basing out collective actions on science and facts, not scare tactics and misinformation. Lets do the research and this plant  warrants it, then put it on the schedule 1 list, but not before. \nAlso, I have seen a lot of, what I'd consider, conspiracy theories about this being moved so quickly to schedule 1 because of pressure on the government from big pharma.

I'm 22, a full-time student at the University of Florida, and will be graduating December 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a Major in Business Management and a Minor in Classical Studies.\n\nKratom, as a dietary supplement, has helped me in a variety of ways.  Kratom eases the symptoms of my anxiety and helps me focus throughout the day.  After hearing about kratom and subsequently trying it, my quality of life has sky-rocketed.  Since supplementing my diet with kratom, I do not dread getting out of bed every morning.  It allows me to feel comfortable in situations that would otherwise make me anxious.  I can now hang out with friends, go to the grocery store without my hands shaking from nerves, and complete my homework and meet deadlines on time.\n\nKratom, I believe, has helped with my depressive episodes as well.  Before kratom, as a college student with already limited free time, I would spend my days off and weekends moping around, thinking about the assignments I should be working on and how I would never get them done - that I would fail if I even tried.  Once kratom entered my life, things started looking up.  I began to feel more motivated, not only towards my school work, but towards my personal life as well.  My previously abandoned hobbies interested me once more.  I can read, write short stories, draw, and even go to the dog park again with my pup.  All things that were excluded from me before taking kratom.\n\nMy life is not perfect, nor will it ever be, but kratom has alleviated multiple issues in my life.

I know of the nightmares associated with narcotic pain medication and will not use them. While I have witnessed pharmaceutical drugs and other illicit drugs devalue most people's lives I have only observed this herb helping people better their lives and allowing them to be productive members of society. I have heard the major reasons for classifying this plant. It appears to be portrayed as a scary dangerous plant. Cigarettes are a major killer. Alcohol is a major killer.

I was plagued by post acute withdrawal symptoms, could not muster the energy or drive to complete simple tasks.

I have never been arrested, I don't smoke, or do drugs, and I rarely use alcohol.  For many years now, I have suffered from severe migraines, and joint pain, and I have recently been diagnosed with adenomyosis, and large dermoid cysts on my ovaries. I have tried many prescription medications including Imitrex, and Tramadol, but I suffered severe side effects and none of them provided relief.  I have tried every over the counter migraine and pain relieving medication available over the last ten years, but have only achieved minimal relief. I have also looked into supplements and other vitamins to try and build up my body's natural defenses and they have helped, but not enough to reduce my dependence on ibuprofen and other pain relievers. As a result, I have suffered severe depression and anxiety in addition to my pain, and my quality of life was severely reduced to the point that it was affecting my work performance, home life, and limiting the interactions with my children and husband.\nMy husband discovered Kratom and used it to manage his severe spinal pain, depression and anxiety.  It enabled him to reduce his anti-depressant and anxiety medications, and begin functioning as a normal adult.  As a result of watching this change and commenting on his progress, he encouraged me to try it for my issues as they were steadily getting worse.  \nKratom was the only thing that enabled me to function.  It gave me more relief for my joint pain and body aches than anything I have ever tried, it controlled the pain associated with my migraines, adenomyosis, and cysts, and enabled me to manage my depression and anxiety without prescription medications.  Because of Kratom, I was able to be fully functional at work, I was able to concentrate with my students, and interact completely with my children and husband.  I was not addicted to it by any means and there were no adverse side effects, withdrawals, feelings of dependency, or extra pain like there were when I reduced my ibuprofen intake, or if I miss my morning coffee.\nI ask you to keep kratom off of the controlled substances list to provide opportunities for further testing and exploration of this amazing plant, and help the thousands of people like myself that depended on it for relief so that we can lead healthy productive lives, free from the side effects and dependency that are caused by most anxiety, anti-depressant, and prescription pain medications.  Please do not schedule kratom. Please keep it legal for adults as an accessible herbal remedy for the many conditions that are helped by this plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18063","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rachel Nedelcu","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my people of the DEA  I writing this to let you know I am disagreement with the new law of trying to make a kratom a harmless , yet actually beneficial plant illegal please before trying to make any plant not just kratom do your research this plant has only helped me and my love ones.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11330","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Froilan Pereira","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\nI am a recovering drug addict.

I could not afford my suboxone so I turned back to herion. I was out of control robbing and  stealing from friends and family.  My life became totally unmanageable.  I couldn't keep a job. I was an unproductive member of society.  A friend told me about Kratom. I purchased some on October 15,2016. And it has really saved my life. I have not used street drugs I am now currently employed.  I started a 12 step program and I actively attending meetings.  My life has turned around in 2 weeks. It is amazing.  How I can go to work every day.  And be a productive member of society again.  This is a miracle drug. It has taken me from living like a animal to becoming the woman I always new I could become.  Kratom Does not get you high. It allows me to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  As a drug addict and living deplorable in the past to living a great life. If I didn't find Kratom I would still be running the street. I don't know about others but I feel that I take Kratom responsibile. This has given me my life back. Please don't ban this drug. I was a Alcohlic too.  I have not drank alcohol either. I think alcohol should be banned. Alcohol has destroyed lives. I haven't heard Kratom destroying lives.

I am a registered nurse of 17 years with a bachelors degree, working on a master's. I am also a \"Kratom consumer\". Years ago I had a series of back injuries from lifting patients. This led to an autoimmune disorder called Ankylosing Spondylitis. A disorder that primarily attacks the spine. I have worked in various departments, from OB to ICU. Caring for thousands of patients over the years. I tried every therapy available, from pain medication and injections, to acupuncture and herbal remedies. Nothing helped. I found myself no longer able to do my job effectively. And have had to since take a \"desk job\" reviewing charts. I still suffered immensely despite the biologic therapy (Humira, Remicade, and now Cosentyx) and as of last year was seriously looking into disability. Which would make me no longer a continuing member of society, and a financial burden to taxpayers. But last year I was introduced to an herb called Kratom. \n      I researched the plant extensively before even attempting to try it. I am personally against any recreational use of any substance and to this day have never tried a single illegal drug, even when I was young. After my research, I tried it. I found not only did it help with my pain, but I could think clearer and function better than I had in years! The worst side effect was constipation. I was able to wean off of prescribed opiates, which did help with pain but made it impossible to do my job. And as a nurse, I can not have any mind altering substances in my system while caring for patients. Since Kratom doesn't cause the drowsiness or alter my thinking process like opiates, I am now able to work better than I ever did before. My fear is, that when this plant becomes illegal for US citizens, I will no longer be able to do my job effectively and will have to once again look into disability. So I personally have a lot to lose when the scheduling goes into effect. \n    I have several other agendas. The first being that I have family that depends on this herb to function. One with an autoimmune disorder similar to mine, and several others with back injuries as a result of construction jobs and motor vehicle accidents. All have said that they cannot function well without Kratom. Not because of a dependency, but because of pain. And these are hard working individuals that have tried every other means available, including surgery and various medications. The other agenda I have, is I lost my spouse to suicide when he could not get the pain relief that was so desperately needed. We have insurance and he literally spent years trying every treatment and medication available to no avail. He despised drug use and never took illegal drugs in his life, and rarely took prescription pain medication either. It is believed the drugs Gabapentin and Cymbalta contributed to his suicidal ideation. I often wonder if this herb could have saved his life. He was disabled for our entire 10 years of marriage and leaves behind a 9 year old daughter I now raise by myself. \n    I have personally seen many lives changed by this botanical for the better. I have also followed the heroine epidemic we now have, and notes the vast increase in use. Specifically in states where Kratom was made illegal. As a professional, I see Kratom as far less dangerous than marijuana and safer than any prescription medication we have available to treat pain, depression, and anxiety. I take several days where I do not consume any Kratom at all, to check my pain levels and prevent dependence. In 9 months of use I have not experienced any withdrawal symptoms, even though my dose is comparatively high. I did, however, have severe withdrawals from Tramadol, Oxycodone, and Methadone. All prescribed to me for pain. They all only worked for a short time, so my physician typically switched medications. And the surprising thing was, the tramadol was the worst withdrawal I had ever experienced. It took me 3 months to wean myself off of methadone. It took 6 months to wean off of tramadol. Yet physicians are prescribing this drug in large amounts because the abuse potential is supposedly lower. Many friends with the same disorder I have, have experienced being cut off of their pain meds abruptly with physician's citing the DEA. I am sorry to say many have turned to illegal substances. A few have found \"synthetic marijuana\" which is \"legal\", however watching their behavior while on the synthetic is extremely concerning to me as a professional. I have never seen this with those that consume Kratom. \n   I am writing with a plea, that you consider the thousands of lives at stake when the herb is made illegal to American consumers. I am very concerned for the amount of deaths that will be reported not only from heroine abuse, but to prescription opiates as well. Kratom does not decrease the respiratory drive like opiates. It saves lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18947","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Patricia Carsley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep this legal","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19661","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Charles Kaihewalu","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I oppose any law that prohibits responsible adults from being able to ?freely ?buy or take Kratom. \n\nI think Kratom should s?t?ay legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21996","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Johnathan Welbig","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly believe that the use of herbs instead of  pharmaceuticals needs to be researched heavily.

There doesn't seem to be any compelling reason for kratom to be schedule 1 and it's harmless enough that it probably shouldn't be scheduled at all. The proposed ban is a massive overreach of the DEA's authority and an insult to the concepts of freedom, liberty, self determination, and personal responsibility. There simply aren't any good reasons to ban kratom, it hasn't caused any deaths in and of itself and is significantly safer than many over the counter drugs. By all accounts, kratom seems to be a rather innocuous plant and the decision to use it or not should be left to individuals and not the government.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8506","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anon anon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We are experiencing an epidemic of opiate overdose deaths.

These substances can be safer and less expensive alternatives to the very costly maintenance drugs like suboxone and methadone.  Our healthcare is the most expensive in the world and we have one of the highest rates of addiction.  We should be doing everything we can to reduce both the cost and the incidence of addiction and placing Kratom on the schedule 1 list will only worsen both.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4584","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Hyde Park Acupuncture","postedDate":"2016-11-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carol Jackson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would hate to see another drug that has potential to help heal this nation banned.. if this truly is a free country then we should be free to heal ourselves without having to spend ridiculous amounts of money","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16660","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anthony marker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern:\n\nI am a 43 year old recovering drug addict with chronic pain and anxiety.  After a neck surgery in my twenties, I spent many years of my life addicted to opiate-based pain medications. After having thirteen years of recovery in a twelve step program, having had several major life crises, I was in need of a medication to help me deal with my crippling anxiety. I was prescribed Xanax. Having had thirteen solid years of recovery from opiate dependency, I did not anticipate that I would wind up in the same place I was years prior, but I was. I had to go a residential treatment program again to get off of the benzodiazepines. The issues that I had prior to my doctor prescribing the Xanax, were still unresolved and being in my active addiction had caused even more problems for me to overcome.  I have almost one year clean off of any benzos and any other controlled substances. \n\n I have been taking Kratom since June of this year for neck pain and anxiety. I have held down a full-time job working in a hospital emergency room with patients, do regular service work in the community, and contribute to my family.  My use of Kratom has never interfered with my life nor my ability to handle high stress situations. I was never able to do any of these while I was on any benzos or opiates.  \n\nWith opiate dependence and immortality rate at an alarmingly high rate, it does not make sense for the Federal Government to put Kratom on a list wherein people don't have access to it.  If the United States is TRULY a government for the People, they would look at the simple numbers that show Kratom in and of itself as not dangerous. In my experience, and, according to the numbers released by the Poison Control Center, prescription drugs are far more dangerous than Kratom. \n\nPlease do not ban Kratom use.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7001","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, \n   To whom it may concern I am here writing today to inform you that I believe kratom has a strong ability to posses medicinal benefits.

I wanted to share some of the benefits which Kratom has been for me.  I have ordered this product to help with addiction to Suboxone as well as anxiety...It has been a remarkable and safe replacement for me, and I don't feel the need to HAVE TO HAVE IT...It simply replaces some harsh previous prescriptions, which I do not want to take.. I was skeptical in taking this at first but I did an enormous amount of research and other people's reactions...It has been the safest thing I have ever found in my 54 years of existence... I am a female MERCHANT MARINER and I cannot take harsh prescriptions, and thanks to Kratom, I don,t have to..I hav3 been so tired of the yo-yo effect of pain pills years ago,,than Suboxone, which is addictive, and if Kratom is changed I will have to go back to pain meds, which I don't want to..I think so much clearer, my focus level is great, and I simply feel at ease.  I feel if the pharmaceutical companies make a prescription out of this, or this is changed to a schedule 1 drug, it will be out of greed, not out of concern for the average person.. We need your help in getting people off of hard pain meds and other types of anxiety meds...I have been taking this for months and I don,t need drugs in my life anymore..Now my husband is trying this to help with his diabetes...So far, it has helped him feel better and not so sluggish..I cannot confirm if he will take Kratom only, as he just started this, but he feels better than before...The DEA would do the world ALOT of good if people had a plant that can help with a variety of ailments, instead of pills every day.. I know I don't need to explain the epidemics of the pain pill world. I would hope that you would prioritize people's health before the greed of the pharmaceutical companies that just want to push pills. This is a very important issue.

I have, in the past, dealt with alcohol and drug abuse issues both personally and within my immediate family. I was able to get and stay clean off of opiates for years through rehabs and 12 step programs but I was always plagued by cravings and desires to drink, depression, and social anxiety in bars, clubs, and other social settings where consuming alcohol is a focus. I began using kratom over a year ago and for me it has essentially eliminated all of those hindrances with no notable negative effects. I consume it with or in place of coffee in the mornings for energy and a mood boost, I use it as a pre workout for added stamina in the gym, and I use it in the evenings or in the aforementioned social settings to help with relaxation and anxiety. I have never found it to have any negative side effects not has it ever made me feel the slightest bit impaired or intoxicated. I still consider myself to be clean with regard to drugs and alcohol and I am still involved in a 12 step program. I know numerous recovering addicts who have found that kratom plays a helpful and in some cases vital role in their sobriety. With numerous members of the scientific and medical community suggesting that this plant is not an opioid, not a dangerous or highly addictive substance, and something that offers great potential for aiding people in a number of ways, it seems like a huge mistake to make it a schedule I substance. The number of calls to poison control are insignificant when compared to many other legal substances that are marketed and sold for human consumption. All deaths being attributed to kratom for which information has been made available  are instances where the deceased was shown to have numerous substances in their system. If you use the logic that any substance in a persons body when they OD contributes to their death, then Vitamin C and other such common OTC vitamins and minerals could be tied to hundreds of deaths annually. OTC pain killers already are directly linked to hundreds of deaths annually. There really is no sound logic behind and no benefit to the scheduling of this plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18899","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Patrick Flom","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The use of kratom has saved my life i use to be on perscription pain killers for my pain and i got hooked on them for many years this medicine has helped me woh my pain and anxiety and made my quality of life better this medicine is non addictive and thats why i continue to take it","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9853","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alfred Cavagnaro","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using Kratom on a mostly daily basis for 4 years. One in the morning and once in the evening. If I could describe what Kratom has done for me in one sentence it would be this: Kratom allowed me to find the strength to build a real life for myself. I will elaborate now. I struggled for many years with an addiction to oxy contin, heroin and meth. I went to rehab multiple times, tried a slew of medications to treat depression and anxiety. When I was finally able to stop using 6 years ago I found myself extremely depressed, anxious, heavily medicated and above all else, miserable because I desperately wanted drugs. I stayed this way for two miserable years and finally relapsed. Then I heard of Kratom in an online addiction forum. That day my life changed irrevocably for the better. I only have 5000 characters so I'll cut to the chase. Today I have a great job, a wonderful marriage and we are expecting our first child. Not only have I stayed completely abstinent from all drugs, I have also never returned to the medication that turned me into a joyless zombie (not that I judge anyone who requires these types of medicines, they just aren't for me). I am sad to think of how my life could have turned out if it weren't for this herb, it truly helped me overcome something that I knew was going to take my life or, at the very least, keep me from ever having one.

As far as I know there have been no known deaths where Kratom ingestion was the only active substance involved, all of the known deaths have been cases where multiple drugs had been ingested.  Kratom has long a history of use in South Asia and so there should be anecdotal evidence of dangers of this plant, yet I have not found any evidence or anecdotes about Kratom deaths in South Asia.  Another reason to postpone a judgement on Kratom would be a lack of scientific research. One of the few studies on Kratom actually showed that it does not have respiratory effects, respiratory depression is generally the cause of death in opiate overdoses.  Making Kratom illegal, by scheduling the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine would stifle scientific research.  Finally the potential that Kratom, and its main active alkaloids, has on helping the many millions of people who either suffer from opiate addiction or the millions more people who suffer from chronic pain is so great that removing this product from the market is unethical.  \nSincerely, \n\nWilliam Legrain","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11479","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Legrain","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I started using Kratom when I injured my knee and feet running on a daily basis.

Kratom has helped me deal with numerous issues and has overall improved my quality of life. Thanks to kratom I was able to straighten my life out and now I make $150,000 a year. I was prescribed hydrocodone after surgery 10 years ago. I started liking the feeling of the pills and became extremely addicted. I moved on to percocet, then oxycodone, and finally Opana. I was spending all the money I had, over drafting my bank account, alienating my family, and becoming a monster. I was fully addicted and dependent on those pills to get by daily (and hourly). The sad thing is, I was a functioning addict. Only my fiancee truly knew what I was doing and she was starting to get sick of me being that way as well. I tried suboxone numerous times to get off opiates. Suboxone made me feel disassociated, ill, anxious, and nauseous. It was honestly worse for me than the opiates I felt. I would have to hide away in my bedroom for a days at a time because of how weird feeling and sick Suboxone made me. Eventually I had enough. I knew that I couldn't go on living this way, but dealing with the severe physical withdrawals was something I could not do while maintaining a full-time job. A friend suggested I try kratom to help alleviate some of the symptoms. It definitely helped me get by and take the first step on a long road to recovery. I have been clean for 4 years now, and I don't even get cravings anymore. Kratom saved my life. I never felt disgusting or sick or anxious. There wasn't even a \"high\" to it. It is not intoxicating at all. For me it is very similar to the happiness you feel from drinking a cup of coffee in the morning. Kratom should not be considered a \"controlled substance\" or made illegal. It is safe. As you can see in the other comments, kratom has not killed anyone directly by itself. It simply can't. People don't take this to get high. It's not some \"legal high\" you find at a headshop -- in my eyes it is a sin to sell it at a headshop next to dangerous things like \"salvia\". I also feel that it should be made illegal for headshops to sell kratom and have it only be sold online or at a storefront selling other herbs, teas, or coffee. Thank you for your time, and I hope you consider this information.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16740","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I urge you to not ban these substances.

This herb has helped myself and other folks sooo very much. \n I have used the Kratom herb for the terrible muscle pain that comes with Fibromyalgia. Doctors have had me on opiates, antidepressants, nerve medicines, and over the counter pain killers...all different combinations of all of these medications...for Fibromyalgia. I felt horribly sick, tired, and depressed from all of these chemical medications, and my life was miserable :( \n A little over a year ago I read about Kratom on the internet. So I went to another state and bought some capsules. I was so bad off that I had nothing to lose. Within a couple of weeks I was off of all prescribed chemical medications and only taking a few herbal Kratom capsules a day or drinking  a cup of herbal Kratom tea.  There are people who were worse off than me and it has changed their lives dramatically, just as it has mine.We are using Kratom just to function and have a normal life. I am again able to play outside and spend quality time with my Grandchildren! \n  Please, I am begging you to help on this issue, especially for all of us who do not want to be taking opiates. Opiates are killing people because they are so addictive. So many people will die if they are forced to go back to opiates. Kratom does not cause addiction. Alcohol is much stronger and more dangerous than Kratom and it is legal. Kratom alone has never killed anybody...some people may have had Kratom in their system along with other drugs that caused an overdose, but Kratom alone has never caused anybody to overdose and die.\n  I believe the DEA has jumped to ban this herb because of a few irresponsible choices made by a few people. The DEA really needs to take time and analyze research that shows evidence of Kratom's positive effects :) \n  There are thousands of us willing to attest that Kratom has improved our quality of life, some of us at a time when we are needed to raise our Grandchildren when the parents are unable to do so :(    Thank you so very much for listening to me.

My quality of life is terrible (who am I kidding there is no life), my only goal is to get to work and get back home to rest. I have since depleted all of my sick leave hours and the only thing I am given for pain is Tylenol.  Tylenol doesnt even touch this kind of pain that my Fibromyalgia causes and I cant even begin to attempt to explain it.  You cannot even concentrate with the chronic pain that I have on most days, not to mention the muscle spasms, migraine headaches daily and the list goes on.  I currently have an average of two decent feeling days a month and I use the term decent loosely. I have been petrified that I wont be able to continue working because most of my symptoms are similar to MS and extremely debilitating.\nAfter a conversation with a friend of mine regarding my diagnosis and my symptoms he mentioned a friend of his that has been in the same boat and was taking something that has been a pseudo miracle for her.  He made a call and told me Kratom.  Id never heard of Kratom prior to that day.  So, once again I started on my research quest to find out what this Kratom is and couldnt believe the information and testimonials I read and videos I had seen.  I was at such a desperate time in my illnesses that I wouldve given anything a try at that point.  I ordered Kratom tea with not a lot of hope it would help me but had to at to at least give it a try.  It was the best thing I couldve ever have done.  I am getting some of my life back!  My daily pain is tolerable; the Fibro Fog you experience from being in chronic pain has mostly subsided and fewer of my daily migraines.  I can actually make a dinner plan on occasion and get some of my household chores completed after work that I havent been able to do in a long time. Ive now been taking Kratom for about a month and overall I have to say its been a bit of a miracle for me. Now I am in fear of having this bit of quality of life taken from me because the DEA wants to reschedule Kratom.  I am begging of you to not allow this to happen. Fibromyalgia is not a fatal illness but the number one cause of death due to Fibromyalgia is suicide.  Most people cannot take being in pain all day, every day nor should they have to. If Kratom is rescheduled Im in fear of being a felon for taking a natural plant based herb (similar to the Turmeric capsules I take) because the DEA making a hasty decision.  I would love to tell people about my Kratom experience but because of the stigma right now around it, I wont. Please help us with chronic pain and hold off the DEA until the proper research can be done.  Ive only recently gotten my life back and would hate to be back in bed for the 10 hours I am home after work, possible lose my job that I love due to absences from the pain and being able to be a little social.  Ive been locked up in pain for too long and hope, no beg that you will reconsider.\nSincerely,\nGeorgia L.

I've lived in Naugatuck, CT for about three years now with my wife, Desiree. We love the town, its people and the way of life here. The reason I'm writing is to briefly touch on any potential Kratom ban that may take place.\n\nI have been a long time sufferer of depression and anxiety. As a result, I have incredible muscle aches, mostly in the leg area on a daily basis. It cripples my life for years. I've tried everything I can think of, but the only thing that has helped with both the depression and the muscle aches is that natural herb, Kratom. It has truly changed my life. It allows me to enjoy this town, the way of life that I mentioned earlier. It has given me my life back. The effects are mild yet soothing, but without any side effects that I have gotten from countless prescription medication.\n\nI should get to the point. This is just one story of over 130,000 people who signed a White House petition (in less than two weeks) a couple months back to cancel the scheduled Kratom ban and our public plea was heard as the ban was postponed. This is another plea to please keep it that way for the sake of our safety and well being.\n\nThere has been countless email traffic on this issue, so this is one of many, but I hope it sticks out. This message is a plea to help save my life in a way and thousands of others. A potential Kratom ban is a hasty, unnecessary, rash decision without taking into account the horrible ramifications.\n\nThank you so much for reading.\n\nI'd be more than happy to discuss further and can be contacted at both 203-257-1584 and sean.p.coyle25@gmail.com\n\nSincerely,\nSean Coyle","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6394","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sean Coyle","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA needs to revoke any action banning the sale , use and production of Kratom.

After my first child was born, I was diagnosed with sciatica and have since suffered pain from degenerative discs in my lower spine and nerve pain.  Nerve pain I found cannot be suppressed by any method or medication.  I suffered dull aches, sharp pains, and constant discomfort for years. My second child and a recent car accident aggregated my symptoms even further. Nothing seemed to work...not massage, not chiropractic care or over the counter pain medication.  I was introduced to Kratom by a friend who took the supplement and I figured it couldn't hurt to try a new method for pain relief.  Kratom was the first effective relief I found in a long time.  A little bit makes the discomfort and distracting sensations go away.  Kratom does not have negative side effects for me.  I am able to go on with my busy day free of pain and with more motivation than before.  It has allowed me to focus on other daily activities rather than on trying to relieve my discomfort.  I can also say that being pain free has helped me perform other therapies to progress my physical wellbeing and to strengthen and mobilize my body to achieve recovery from my injuries.  Kratom can be a mild stimulant and antidepressant as well.  I have struggled in the past with anxiety, as so many others have and Kratom lifts my mood.  That coupled with its pain relieving effects helps me have a better day.  It also keeps me away from some of the harmful side effects of other medications.  I am a believer in natural remedies and that the body should be free from man made synthetic substances.  I hope you will take the time to consider all of the stories and real people with problems behind our movement.

As I write this she is using a PICC line to deliver intravenous drugs directly to her heart, a process weve repeated several times a day for years. Treatment involves a range of medications designed to reduce pain and treat many chronic symptoms. These have a number of incredibly undesirable side effects and some are very addictive. Kratom has lessened her dependence on pain killers and provided relief in ways prescriptions cannot. Even after seeing dozens of doctors across a wide spectrum of specialties we have not found anything that manages so many of her symptoms as well as kratom. There arent even any bad side effects to boot! She is no longer bed ridden, her pain is well managed, and her spirits are higher than ever. She has even been able to start a successful business thanks in no small part to kratom.

I specifically reject criminalizing Kratom when the real problem is that highly addictive prescription opioids are enslaving patients to drug companies. Patients are forced to exchange their money and accept severe addiction problems in return for pain relief thus insuring profits for the legal drug pushers.  Isn't this the same pattern we see with virtually all pharmaceuticals?  Few of them cure anything, instead many of them are designed to suppress symptoms while producing side effects that must be treated with other pharmaceuticals which produce side effects... This isn't health care! \n\nPlease don't put Kratom on your ill-conceived Schedule I list.  Just because it is a safe natural product that provides relief to millions who reject dangerous, highly addictive prescription opioids is not sufficient reason to criminalize it.  \n\nCriminalization of drug use has indisputably led to huge profits for private prisons, drug lords and at least in the past the CIA; and has also led to the creation of huge, expensive bureaucracies like your own agency. As far as I can tell, the war on drugs has not protected children or helped people who need pain relief or assistance with their suffering whether it be from PTSD, or mental or physical disorders.  Instead your policies have torn families apart while enriching those who prey on suffering people. Worse, your policies have set back research on powerful healing substances like marijuana by decades, leaving cancer patients for example with no real healing options and at the mercy of carcinogenic chemo and radiation treatments. \n\nYour proposed rule on Kratom is yet one more example of your failed model.  Please become part of the positive change we need in this country:  Put the people first.  Abandon the discredited and failed war on drugs.  \"War is not the answer.\"  Start by withdrawing the proposed rule on Kratom.  Let people choose a safe, natural alternative to alleviate their suffering without risking jail time.  Don't insist the pharmaceutical industry modify Kratom so they can patent it and profit from it.  Just let the people use a natural, God-given pain reliever.\n\nPlease make a start toward helping solve the drug problem and our healthcare crisis by withdrawing the proposed listing of Kratom.\n\nThank you.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20086","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mary Hicklin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Leave it unscheduled","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8952","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It helps people. don't hurt people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16177","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"annon annon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi,\nMy name is Giovanni Troiano.

However there is so much more to this strong belief of mine.\n\nI found Kratom a year ago after a 3 knee surgeries in 3 years and the subsequent prescriptions to pain-killers. The Vicodin made me dizzy, nauseous and lazy.  I did a lot of internet searches along the lines of \"natural Vicodin alternative\", etc. Up came Kratom and the hundreds of amazing success stories. My curiosity was piqued and I ordered a sample.\n\nIn short, not only was I able to toss the prescriptions for my pain, but it has also allowed changed my life with regards to my life-long struggle with severe depression and anxiety. it has absolutely been a \"game-changer\" for me. I now use it daily and have been doing so for a little over a year. I never \"crave\" it or \"need\" it. It doesn't impair me in ANY way. \n\nWere this plant to become illegal, I would be devastated. My fiancee with severe Lupus has also been able to throw away her Vicodin prescription. We (all Americans) have finally found a natural, non-addictive alternative to pain medication; one of the biggest addiction problems in this country. As if you didn't know that fact. :) But the list of OTHER medical benefits is astounding. \n\nMy depression would resurface and it would lead me back to the fruitless search for more prescriptions that have never worked in 40 years. I feel so good about taking a harmless, non-toxic leaf... 100% natural. It has made me more effective at work, I have been more social, it allows me to actually look forward to the day. I am so grateful to have found Kratom. \n\nI ask that you read this very short summary of laboratory research on Kratom as an anti-depressant. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20869223\n\nIn conclusion, I urge (plead) you to consider my story amidst the hundreds of thousands you will see. There are people if far worse pain than me that have found freedom with Kratom. We are not a community of addicts. We are people that want to contribute more to society in a positive way. Please listen to us.\n\nI sincerely THANK YOU for this opportunity to be heard. It is greatly appreciated.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1586","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Turpen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"These are naturally occurring substances, which means they can't be patented.

I'm currently studying for a bachelor's degree in Entertainment and Media Studies at the University of Georgia.\n\nWhile I do not personally use Kratom, I believe that it has no place in being classified as a schedule 1 controlled substance.\n\nI am of course, in no position to make any sort of medical claims about this plant.

This would be impossible if Kratom was a schedule 1 drug.\n\nPerhaps this current Kratom situation can be compared to the one of Marijuana's. Marijuana was illegal in all of the U.S. for many decades, until further research was done about it. Today we see that there are more than a few U.S. states that have legalized recreational Marijuana, yet none of them have reports of people suffering from what was once called \"Reefer Madness.\" The cruelest part of this all is that there must have been people at some point in U.S. history that were suffering from daily seizures that could have otherwise found the help that they needed through Marijuana.\n\nThe real problem is that if Kratom is actually helping anybody at all, whether it is simply arthritic pain or a veteran with PTSD, then any premature decisions about it could be potentially depriving a U.S. citizen of a plant that is giving them the physical and mental relief that they need.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10087","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anderson Bui","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I suffer from deprstion and PTSD and kratom has helped me big time to live my life again.

My child and career and the two most important things in my life. \n\nI discovered kratom earlier this year. It has helped me in my life in so many positive ways. I use a small amount with my coffee in the morning and the effects reduce my anxiety, from which I have suffer from for many years, give me energy and positively enhance my mood. I haven't slept as well as I do now in years.   \n\nI used to drink alcohol fairly regular to help me relax or have fun, but I have no interest in that anymore. It's obvious to me now the stress alcohol put on my body and with kratom I was able to let that habit go.  \n\nI also periodically suffer from non-specific cystitis. There really is no reason or cure for this that doctors can offer other than habit or elimination diets. I started using kratom to help me with the pain when this happens. The relief I get from it is incredible.\n\nSometimes I do not drink kratom because of financial reasons or I just don't want it and I do not feel any side effects at all. I drink it when I want and when I don't that's ok too. This tea is not addictive and I've never experienced withdrawals.\n\nPlease, please do not take away something that has been such a positive thing in my life. Better moods, reduced pain, good night sleep, energy to exercise more are all very real side effects of kratom.  \n\nThank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20713","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI am writing out of concern over the proposed reclassification of kratom as a Schedule I controlled substance.\n\nSchedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\n\nThis is definition is simply NOT applicaple to kratom. It is not addictive or dangerous.

I must ask- do you WANT more Americans to die from opiate overdose?\n\nPlease do the right thing.

I was immediately given very strong medication to help with the pain. After several months i was able to ween myself off of the percocets. But the pain continued to persist. I no longer wanted to be pain free because i didnt like the feeling percocet or vicodin or any other pain medication was giving me. I could not focus at my job and even driving was dangerous at certain times. \nAt last, someone introduced me to Kratom! What a wonderful, all natural leaf. It has helped me considerably with the pain. Its not as good as percocet or vicodin, but it helps just enough to where i dont even think about my chronic leg pain. I am able to focus at work, drive normally and clear headed, and i am pain free! For the first time ever, i am where i want to be in my life all thanks to Kratom! \nI use it about 4-6 times a week, usually dose up in the morning then i am good the rest of the day. Sometimes i dont take it, just to make sure i am not dependent on it as i know i was with the percocets. That scares me, but i know with Kratom i am not dependent because i dont need to take it more than once a day, and i dont even take it daily. However, if i could not get it, i would defintely risk going back to other drugs and be very afraid of getting hooked again.

I've suffered from sciatica, fibro myalgia and other muscle spasms for 35 years.  I've had physical therapy, which is somewhat helpful,  but expensive and inconvenient; and I've been prescribed various drugs, which either did not help at all, or made me feel like a zombie while helping minimally.  Mostly, I just live with the pain.  I've had to miss out on many events with friends or family over the years, due to the difficulty of moving around, and how pain reduces sociability.   Having a job as a general manager of a small manufacturing facility for many years, the pain would have me limping through my days, and just collasping at night.  When I was pregnant with my first child, 12 years ago, the back pain was so intense I had to do something, but I did not want prescription opiods.  I did not know about kratom then, so I turned to marijuana.  It helped tremendously with the spasms, but I could smoke it only at night, right before bed, to avoid feeling \"high.\"  Now, I am pregnant again, and I know I have kratom to rely upon.  I will be having my liver enzymes checked periodically to make sure my system is managing with the extra load from the pregnancy.  I have not had liver issues with taking kratom so far, but I am a cautious person.  We are middle-class, responsible homeowners.  I am not a party-goer looking for euphoria.   Please, please allow kratom to remain legal so we can have this choice for pain relief.   A simple, safe, affordable, and effective choice.  Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15925","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my comment regarding the scheduling of the constituent substances contained within the kratom plant.\n\nI am a 29 year old male living in Louisiana and have been consuming kratom for around 2 years. I first began using kratom to alleviate intense social anxiety, but have found it helpful in regulating my mood and relieving the pain I suffer in the form of TMJ. In the two years I have been taking kratom, I have never increased my daily consumption of 2-3 grams (a teaspoon) and have found it to be extraordinarily tolerable and effective for me.\n\nKratom is able to relieve my anxiety and pain in ways that many dangerous pharmaceuticals, such as benzodiazepines, can not. I have gone weeks without kratom and have never faced the harsh withdrawal effects that even mild antidepressants and stronger benzodiazepines have given me - kratom has allowed me to live a stable and productive life as a musician and full time employee of a local audio engineering business. \n\nI have been employed full time since I graduated summa cum laude from our local university, LSU, in 2009. I'm a BSA Eagle Scout and published musician with a happy relationship and strong friendships. I do not bring these points up to laud myself, but demonstrate that kratom users are productive members of society; in fact I would state absolutely that if it were not for kratom, I may not be in the fortunate position that I am.\n\nI understand fully that kratom has risks, as does driving a car, taking cold medicine, eating red meat or raw sushi, drinking coffee, or any number of perfectly legal activities that can sometimes result in negative consequences. In all honestly, the worst I have experienced with kratom is a mild upset stomach and rare dizziness. However, I must admit that my experience is obviously not universal. However, as a kratom user and American citizen, I would like to see the below occur:\n\n1. Kratom should be regulated to ensure purity and the absence of extracts or additives.\n2. Kratom should be restricted to sale for anyone below the age of 21.\n3. Kratom should be allowed to be studied further by academics to assess its usage and damage potential, taking into account thousands of years of indigenous use in Thailand and Indonesia.\n4. Kratom should be treated similarly to other herbal remedies and supplements such as kava kava, St. John's Wort, ginseng, etc. \n5. The trade of kratom should be fair with nations that export.\n6. Kratom, if necessary, should be taxed appropriately and funds directed to the common good, such as education or improvement of public transportation.\n\nWhile it is obvious that there are grey areas when it comes to discussing how to classify kratom, it should be apparent based upon the existing evidence and public comments that:\n\n1. Kratom is not harmful when used alone and when normally dosed.\n2. Kratom does not form strong, life threatening physical addiction similar to synthetic opiates, opiods, benzodiazepines, etc. \n3. Kratom is not simply a \"drug of abuse\" but essential to the lives of many normal Americans suffering from pain, depression, and anxiety. Most kratom users are not chasing a high but simply attempting to alleviate pain. They come from all walks of life and all races, genders, professions, and ages. \n\nGiven the third factor, I find it most pressing that the majority use case scenario be investigated for kratom users. All other points aside, it would be improper to remove kratom abruptly from law abiding citizens who are doing nothing besides attempting to live better lives. Regulation, education, research, and reasonable restrictions on kratom access are all perfectly acceptable options, but I respectfully ask on behalf of kratom users everywhere that this plant be allowed to be studied further and not ripped unduly from those who rely on it.\n\nAbove everything I have written, I want to emphasize however that kratom is not a public health crisis. There are concerns, but they pale in comparison to the concerns we face versus heroin and prescription opiate abuse. While I am not and have never been a prescription opiate user, many kratom users formerly were and use kratom to help stay away from these dangerous drugs. Abruptly banning kratom would almost certainly result in deaths, as those who had been abstaining via kratom could very possibly pick their habit back up - and they would have no tolerance to it. This would result in an outbreak of overdoses and deaths - a true public health crisis.\n\nThank you again for taking the time to read my letter. \n\nBest regards,\nTravis Leeper\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3630","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Travis Leeper","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As someone who was basically disabled that the age of 39 and a chronic pain patient this is one of the few things that I can count on when I needed to give me the relief without resorting to narcotics or what some people may consider other illegal illicit substances.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17212","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Oonagh Morley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \nI am a 56 year old male waitor and window cleaner.

I researched Kratom and then purchased it. I felt it was necessary to try it myself before offering it to my mother as an alternative. I have tried it several times and find that it offers a pleasant and mild full body numbing effect and increases mental alertness at lower does (2-4.5 grams). At higher doses (6-9 grams) I find the the numbing sensation is more pervasive and profound, and some lethargy or sleepiness is present. Effects tend to start 30 minutes from ingestion and last approximately 2-4 hours. I have never had any adverse reactions and on the lower doses I experience no lack of mental clarity. Similar to coffee or strong tea, Kratom at lower doses contributes to a minor elevation in mood lasting for several hours. Having conducted these personal trials I intend to introduce my Mother to Kratom in the hopes that if her chronic pain issues become acute she is less tempted to turn to prescription drugs which always lead to increased and dysfunctional levels of use. I may also offer Kratom to my father in law for knee pain he experiences as a result of an old knee replacement surgery.\nThere are a number of peer reviewed publications of scientific investigations into the potential medical uses of Kratom. These studies indicate there is considerable need for further research into the promising alkaloids found in the Kratom plant leaves. Anecdotal evidence and anthropological evidence suggest Kratom has been used as a folk remedy for a variety of ailments without significant public health concern in Indonesia for hundreds of years or longer. I strongly urge the DEA not to schedule the active ingredients in Kratom in anyway that would inhibit scientific research into its potential (and anecdotally demonstrated) benefits to US Citizens. I also encourage the US government and the FDA to fund research on Kratom.

I suffer from chronic debilitating migraines,  female pelvic pain disorder, depression, PTSD  and anxiety. Before I wad introduced to kratom tea,  i was on a large amount of medications prescribed by my doctor.  A number of them I was taking because of the side effects from the other meds they had me on.  I was still in tremendous pain which affected my depression and anxiety and I got to the point where i had become dependent on them because i was prescribed such a high dose.  I was desperate to feel better,  to be the daughter,  mother and partner i wanted to be.  I was given the tea to try and i was amazed at how well it treated my ailments without the nasty side effects.  I felt like myself again,  never groggy or high,  but like a functioning member of society again. It's turned my life right around before my very eyes. I can now be the employee that my job and my patients need me to be, I'm not missing as much work as I used to because I can now deal with the pain in the more natural way.  It's a beautiful thing to me not to depend on so many medications but to be able to drink a cup of tea and feel the way I need to feel to be who I wanted to be all this time when I was on the medication. Without the pain I can no exercise again, I can run with my kids I can go out and about all day and not be cooped up because of the pain. It would be devastating to have this tea taken from me and force me to go in a direction I don't want to go in nor do I want to go back to the place I was before I found this tea. I urge you to look into this tea and research it to find out how much it is helping so many people and you'll see that the benefits are so worth it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8840","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe Kratom should not be banned.

I am a Social Worker and am specialized in addictions. I have heard from numerous clients of mine that kratom has enabled them to get their lives back. Reports include their being able to stop using heroin or even prescribed opiates. I see many clients who were initially prescribed an opiate pain medication and then became dependent. Some of them resorted to heroin to avoid withdrawal symptoms and ended up in my office as a result. When they began using kratom, they were able to stop using the narcotics and regain control of their lives and manage their pain. I think it would be a shame to ban this herb or assign a schedule to it when it helps so many people. There are always going to be people in our society who take things too far; shopping, eating, gambling...we can't (nor should we) make these things inaccessible or illegal.  Alcohol is legal, but I see people drinking themselves to death all the time. It doesn't mean EVERYONE who uses alcohol will. We saw how effective prohibition was and the war on drugs has failed miserably.

I'm writing this in order to express my concern that the DEA is considering outlawing yet another plant that has had a positive impact in the lives of many in order to supposedly protect an irresponsible few. My experience with Kratom has been nothing short of miraculous. I have a chronic hockey injury that required neck surgery in 2010. Unfortunately, the neck surgery did not have the pain relieving result I'd hoped for. Finding the opiate narcotics prescribed for my pain to be dangerous, rampant with side effects and overtly addictive, I stopped getting those prescriptions for fear of being permanently addicted. I find that a modest use of Kratom is more effective as far as its analgesic effects vs. side effects. Kratom has allowed me to be more effective in my career, as the prescribed opiates had a decidedly negative effect on my job performance.\n\nRegardless of my personal desire for a natural analgesic, there is a larger desire that I have... and that is to live in the land of the free. Please do not put Kratom on any schedule or make it in any way illegal. This plant is only a problem for a small subset of people... people who don't want a natural answer to opiate addiction. Let us live free. Don't force us to chose between pain relief and the law.

I have worked as a hairstylist in Nashville, Tn at the same salon since 2008. Over the past eight years i have worked with famous country singer songwriters, and up and coming Nashville artist. I am a responsible adult who works full time and a caregiver to my disabled mother. I take my profession and family responsibilities very seriously.\n\n   I am writing in concern of scheduling Kratom (mitragynine and 7 hydroxymitragynine) as a schedule 1 drug. I strongly disagree with this scheduling and think that doing so would  only cause harm. There are thousands of people that benefit from this amazing plant on a daily basis and it personally saved my life. I was addicted to prescription pain killers for approximately 11 years. I was going nowhere fast!\n\n   I was in desperate need of coming clean. I started researching natural ways to ween myself off of opiates and came across a Kratom forum. I was aware of suboxone and methadone but wanted to persue a more natural approach. After researching Kratom for about six months and discovering a close friend used it for chronic back pain i found a reputable vendor online and started my journey. At the end of 2011 i started to taper myself off of the painkillers and starting using Kratom in early 2012. After a few months on the Kratom i started to notice i didn't have the urge to take pills. I became very clear headed, happy, and focused more than i had in a decade. I took Kratom until February 2013 until i had no urge of taking the pills nor the Kratom. I lowered my Kratom dose daily until that February with no side effects.\n\n    Today I am clean and sober and don't think that would have been possible without the help that Kratom offered me during that time. I truly believe by scheduling this natural, beneficial, safe dietary supplement will only cause harm and even a larger opiate epidemic. Please reconsider this scheduling and ban.

Scehdule 1 drugs are drugs that have no health benefits and are highly addicting.  Neither of these is true for kratom as a whole leaf supplement.  If physical additction does happen through long term consistent use, it is mild and results in a day of flu symptoms when people come off it.  It is very hard to overdose on, almost to the level of cannabis.  In addition, kratom has many positive and well recorded health benefits.  It has been used for a very long time in its area of origin to treat pain, pain killer addictions, anxiety and depression.  It is helping many people recover from narcotic addiction and to stay off of highly addicting, side effect ridden, narcotic pain medications.\n\nI have a personal story to share about kratom.  I suffer from many pain causing physical ailments like carpal tunnel, tarsal tunnel, bursitis, and a hiatal hernia among other things.  I also have bipolar 2 and anxiety.  Over the counter pain medications do absolutely nothing for my pain.  Getting narcotic medications which do help is close to impossible, due to the crack down on them, and they have nasty side effects I prefer to avoid.  The medications available for anxiety have very bad side effects for me as well.  I live in California, so I do use cannabis for some of my symptoms, but the \"stoned\" effect makes dealing with my special needs children and just generally getting things done difficult.  \n\nI discovered kratom through an article I read online.  I then spent many hours researching it and reading articles written by people who use it.  I am very careful with my health.  I have no desire to take something that could make me worse and I tend to react in stange ways to medications.  I finally decided to try it, after discussing it with with a couple close friends and my husband and my mother-in-law (who both read the articles and are very careful about drugs).  \n\nKratom has very literally been a miracle for me.  I now have something I can take that will not only relieve my pain, but also helps with my anxiety and the depression side of my bipolar 2 without kicking me into hypomania and without leaving me \"stoned\" and with no energy.  I can focus and get things done without pain or negative thoughts.  The worst side effects I have personally gotten is a mild upset stomach and the jitters, but no worse than I get from too much strong coffee.  It has changed my life for the better in so many ways and, since there is a history of addiction my my family, it comforts me that it is highly unlikely I will become addicted.\n\nWhen I heard that the chemicals in kratom were going to be made, through an emergency declaration, into a Schedule 1 drug I was appalled!  I panicked because I might lose this herbal supplement that has solved so many problems for me and for no good reason. I quickly ordered a lot so that I would have some for awhile until I could find another alternative to constant pain or being \"stoned\" (I wasn't very hopeful).  I still can see no good reason for this to be even under discussion other than some company somewhere wanting to get it off the market to make their profits on side effect ridden pain killers go up. There are almost no negatives to kratom and so many positives.  From what I understand in the areas where it has been banned heroin use has gone up and I also heard that in its native area it was banned because it was cutting into illegal and legal drug sales.\n\nPlease do not make the massive mistake of classifying the chemicals in kratom as Schedule 1 drugs.  They are not even close to the definintion.  If you do this you will be stealing from people like me, who have so few options for reliable and safe pain relief, the one thing we have found that can actually help us.  You will be sentencing me to a life of pain again, like how I lived before I found kratom.  I never want to go back to that place.  Living with constant pain is an awful, draining, weakening thing.  It takes away from all aspects of life.  Please do not consciously choose to make all of us who depend on kratom for pain, anxiety and depression relief go back to struggling through each day.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nChristina Mulhall\n\nDocket No. DEA-442W","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3717","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cristina Mulhall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This comment is for the purpose of opposing the DEA's proposal to place the components found in kratom on schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act.  The kratom plant has apparently been beneficial to people throughout history, and is a naturally occurring plant.  The proposal to place this plant on schedule 1 seems like a blatant ploy to continue lining the pockets of pharmaceutical corporations, as they stand to profit greatly by kratom's criminality.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that people struggling with opioid dependency benefit greatly from this plant.  More research is certainly warranted, which is something not permissible once a substance is placed on schedule 1 of the CSA.  If appropriate medical studies determine this substance warrants no valid use, then the legislature should be the one to ban the substance, not the DEA.  The DEA should merely enforce the properly enacted legislation, not create new legislation, which is what this proposal would effectively accomplish.  I do not use this plant, nor do I profit from its continued use.  However, the citizenry of this country should retain the right to use a naturally occurring plant as they see fit, so long as no societal harm results.  Opiod abuse and deaths resulting therefrom are a scourge to this republic, and anything that can prevent further societal damage from this menace should be encouraged, not outlawed.

I have no withdrawals from not having the pain meds. Kratom is a safer alternative for me and many other users than the opiods for pain relief from my disease, also safer than Adderall that I take for energy as MS causes extreme fatigue. Both of those can cause kidney failure as well as other harmful deadly side effects as I am sure you all know. Living with a chronic disease that causes pain and fatigue can be very debilitating and we are dependent on these types of drugs but with Kratom it controls the pain and gives us the energy we need to live productive lives. It does not cause a high or alter our thinking. Also as a former clinic coordinator at a Pain management clinic I have seen people get addicted to pain meds in an innocent way, like an injury or a disease and are prescribed them and it escalates from there. I personally have seen about 10 addicts stop using drugs with the use of Kratom and now they live normal productive lives, have jobs, pay taxes, raise a family. Please I am begging you all not to schedule Kratom. Without it I and many others will have no choice but to remain on pain meds for the rest of our lives. People also now can afford Kratom for use  to stop taking opiods if you schedule it and big pharma decides to use it as a withdrawal med, who is actually going to be able to afford it? Much less seeing a Dr to prescribe it. I think it would be disastrous for people if it was scheduled.

I have long suffered chronic fatigue, body aches, joint pain, depression, and chronic daily headaches among a variety of other symptoms. I take a thyroid hormone replacement therapy,  and an antidepressant to manage my condition, but the fatigue and chronic daily headaches have become a severe struggle well into my adulthood.  I spent 5 years seeking treatment for the debilitating headaches, which included a wide variety of \"migraine medications\", pain block neck injections, and strong prescription pain killers. None of these things brought me any relief. The prescription pain medications worked at times, but they wore off quickly, and then led to even more severe rebound headaches,  which caught me up in a cycle of needing them more frequently and raising the strength of the dose to keep up with managing my pain just so I could work every day and take care of my family at home. I deeply feared addiction, and hated myself for resorting to this measure for finding a way to comfortably get through my day.  Then I discovered Kratom, when searching for a natural, safe way to manage my pain and symptoms of hypothyroidism.  Kratom changed my life. Kratom saved my life. Kratom relieves my headaches, combats my fatigue, soothes my depression, and I feel better knowing that I am taking a natural herbal remedy, so I do not fall into the spiral of dangerous and addictive prescription drugs.

My profession is IT networking. I appreciate the opportunity to comment like this. First, I respect the law. Period.  Now that being said, I do not agree with the DEA decision to make Mitragyna speciosa illegal. That would mean I and millions of others, can no longer control our pain the BEST AND SAFEST way possible. I find the DEA involvement quite invasive on the matter of making M. Speciosa illegal. Why on earth would someone deny the right to choose the relief that works the best for them?  Now, I am sure that because this topic has been blown out of proportion, the DEA is AWARE of some benefits from this miraculous plant. I hope they can see how it helps the lives of Americans. I really do.. The DEA has absolutely no clue how much pain I am in. Or how much pain my neighbor is in. OR how much pain THEIR neighbors are in. Yet, it is okay to make that choice for them? The DEA is basically telling \"us\", \"I deny you the option to have pain relief\". Oh, gee, thanks a lot. I find that behavior disgusting. Putting M. Speciosa in the same class as meth, crack, and cocaine, is insane. I have been taking M Speciosa for three years now. I take it every day. When I wake up, around lunch time, around dinner time and before I sleep. I have damage to L3-L4, as well as discs and sciatic nerve issues. I took Prescribed opiate pain killers for years and I HATED it. It provided little relief yet, I felt like I always has to take them. I was moody when I was running low, couldn't poop, I would nod off and had mood swings. My withdrawal symptoms were TERRIBLE. Cold sweats, couldn't sleep, restless legs. I do not get that way with M Speciosa. I read about it on a forum and decided to try it. Well, it changed my life for the better. I transitioned over with ZERO WITHDRAWAL symptoms. I felt alive again, slept better, my sex life improved with my wife, my job performance improved, no nodding off.  It is a miracle plant! I think it should remain available and out of the DEA control because I have finally found something that works well and doesn't make me feel guilty when I take it.\nIt is much like cannabis.

I am also an author and minister who goes into the local jails to help the incarcerated women change their lives for the better. I am also an administrative assistant to the president of the largest and most successful rehab in the world- Teen Challenge.\n\nI strongly oppose the banning of the Kratom plant and all its alkaloids. This will have devastating effects for people like me needing natural pain relief.\n\nI came to learn about Kratom when I was getting desperate for natural pain relief. The doctors gave me Tramadol for my severe sciatica nerve pain but it only made the pain worse. Then I learned of the dangerous side effects of it (seizures) and got scared and wanted to get off. I was also being prescribed Imitrex for my severe migraines that I've lived with since I was 10 years old. The Imitrex works great and almost immediately, however, one of the side effects for that is rebound migraines. Which means I often lived in a perpetual state of constant migraine. It was this desperation of living in constant, debilitating pain that forced me to seek God on the matter. I prayed and prayed for days for Him to show me something natural to help me. \n\nThen I was researching and came across the American Kratom Association webpage... I started reading the testimonials and became hopeful! I then found my way about how to order Kratom. This was about a year ago.\n\nKratom helps me with my chronic pain. It gives me a lighter mood and cheerfulness, much like coffee does (Kratom is in fact a relative to the coffee plant!).. It eases my symptoms and allows me to function without ANY negative side effects. There were two times I accidentally took too much and one of those times I threw up... so I have learned that this plant CANNOT be overdosed on. You cannot \"abuse\" this plant. How wise is God's creation...\n\nThank you for reading my comment and giving us a chance to express our concern regarding the proposed decision to ban Kratom. Please don't ban it. Please listen to us, hear us, we are real people just like you who are productive, responsible adults wanting to not live our lives in chronic pain. \n\nGod bless you and be with you as you make decisions that effect the entire country.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2766","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mariah Freeman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't make kratom illegal.

I tried it after hearing some testimonials about it on Internet radio, and then doing research on its benefits and drawbacks before ordering some. I was mainly seeking to temper the mood swings of anxiety and depression that I've had for my entire adult life and even earlier. Although I suffer from joint and muscle pain, due to age and continuing athletic participation, I didn't expect results in this area. (I'm in my mid-50s.). This is not severe enough for me to require a special treatment for it.\n\nKratom has been like a godsend. While using kratom my mood is always much better. It's not a \"high\" in the usual sense; it's more like a mild feeling of euphoria, increased energy, and a 'forgetting' of negative thoughts I may have been having.. In this sense it's like the combined positive effects of caffeine and alcohol but without the side effects of those substances. There is no mental/physical impairment, increased recklessness, and depressive effect as with alcohol, and there is no anxiousness, hyperactivity, or loss of appetite as with overuse of caffeine. (Some people may experience loss of appetite, but it actually increases mine.)\n\nKratom also reduced inflammation and thus joint or muscle pain, while I am under its effect. But the pain-relief effect only lasts as long as the kratom effect lasts, which is probably 3-8 hours, depending on dose. Amazingly, I have found kratom to be wonderful for reducing or eliminating the symptoms of colds or sinus infections. This was an unforeseen benefit that I only discovered by trying it. This is great because I do not use OTC cold medications, but I will treat sinus problems with kratom.\n\nFor me, there are two drawbacks, both of which can be managed. One is that kratom does tend to make you constipated. This can be managed through diet. The other is that it is habit-forming -- to about the same degree as caffeine is for many people. This one is harder to manage, because the effects are so positive, and there are no direct side effects from its use (other than the constipation). In other words, there are no \"hangovers\" or \"crashing\" from kratom use. I feel about the same in the morning whether I used kratom the night before, or not.\n\nI limit my use to 4 or 5 days a week, and never more than 3 days in a row.\n\nAnd like I said, there is no impairment. It has no effect on driving ability or other daily skills. (I would not try to operate heavy equipment or power tools while on kratom, but if I was highly experienced in those, I might feel differently.)\n\nIn my opinion, kratom is far less unhealthy than using alcohol or tobacco, far safer than alcohol in terms of the lack of impairment, and no more addictive, and with less side effects, than caffeine.

But if you had any morals, or dignity, or respect for the American public, you would base your assessment of the safety of kratom and other compounds on factual data and honest evaluation of the health effects related to consumption.  However, it is obvious that government corruption is common and widespread in the U.S. ( as we've already seen in the recent election), and now you're solidifying this perception with the ban of kratom.  But you know that you'll get away with this ridiculous ban with relatively little backlash, because so few people are aware of and educated about kratom, and also because Americans are ignorant and naive in general.  However, if you want people to respect you and your decisions, you must behave in a respectable manner and formulate sound and respectable regulation.  You are probably aware that drug prohibition has an overall negative impact on peoples' lives, but your job security depends on the restriction of these compounds, and you are probably also unrealistic idealists who are in denial about your role in the negative impact you have on peoples' lives through prohibition.  Once you make kratom a controlled substance and it becomes overly difficult for the average person to obtain, people will undoubtedly opt for far more dangerous, ( but easier to obtain ) substitutes, like suboxone and methadone, just as you are hoping for.  As for myself and like-minded people; however, we will choose heroin, and illegally obtained opioids and benzodiazepenes any day over prescribed opioids, because we refuse to play this ridiculous, unrespectable and childish game with you guys at the DEA and pharmaceutical industry.  Believe it or not, many of us illicit drug users are intelligent and discerning adults like you believe yourselves to be, and we are aware of the underlying diabolical, selfish and greedy reasons behind drug prohibition.  Furthermore, we know that we are far more knowledgeable about which compounds are safe for us to ingest than you guys are.  So congratulations; you've just made yet another another decision regarding prohibition that will cause people more harm than good, waste more tax dollars, and result in more disrespect by the American people for government agencies such as yourselves than before.  And all in the name of selfishness and greed!  Be careful; though, because as they say, \"karma's a bitch,\" and history has shown that taking more than you need has a tendency to bite you in the ass.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19385","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a retired 73 year old male and have injured my back at least two times in the past 40 years.

I am 26 and I have a genetic condition called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. This condition makes that all of the collagen produced by my body is defective. It's too stretchy, too soft. It does not hold my bones and joints in place like in a healthy person's body. I suffer from partial dislocations hundreds of times through the day. I have constant pain in all my joints, especially in my hands, ribs, neck, head, ankles, knees. My fingers hurt from typing or holding things and my doctors tell me I'm probably leaking cerebrospinal fluid because the sack that is supposed to hold it and your spine, called the \"dura\" is made of my faulty collagen and probably has holes. My whole life, I've been complaining of pain. Tylenol and advil are as effective for pain as m&ms. Stronger medications like vicodin somehow don't touch my pain, but give me new symtpoms like rotational vertigo and uncontrollable vomitting. Recently I've found out that people with Ehlers Danlos frequently don't process drugs properly, and this is why these drugs don't work for me. I've tried so many things to control my constant pain, but nothing seems to work at all. I'm always run down and tired from being in pain for so long. I'm grumpy because I'm just tired of pain. \n\nKratom is a weird thing. It's different than the opiate pills from the doctor. Kratom tea takes all of my pain and turns it down, like a volume knob. I know my body won't respond to anything that I take day after day. However, this plant has been able to rescue me from 9-10 pain level when nothing else can. Without this tool, my only option is to bear this level of pain for hours, until it subsides. This level of pain, unfortunately, will trigger more severe pain. Because my body compensates for loose joints by creating protective muscle spasms, my muscles all tend to be very tight. Traumatic episodes such as vomiting or pain increases these spasms and knots, and this holds dislocated bones in the wrong place for longer. All of this increases pain, so it's important for me to try to avoid episodes of severe pain. This is an amazing tool to have in my toolbox. For people with chronic daily pain, it is very important to have a toolbox. When doctors get angry at you for saying medications don't work, they don't continue helping you find solutions. It's too bad, because patients don't always need more dangerous drugs. \n\nI don't think this drug should be schedule 1. It is not more dangerous than other drugs we allow (alcohol, tobacco). And more importantly, it has a true medical use. If the DEA believes it needs doctors to monitor usage of this medicine, to make sure people aren't using ever-increasing amounts or to make sure people aren't using it daily, I understand. \n\nBut I think that removing this tool from the toolbox of chronically ill patients who cannot process regular opiate pills due to CYP2D6 abnormalities is truly cruel and a denial of medical services.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16541","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Moni Bhattacharya","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please thoroughly reconsider the idea of scheduling Kratom.

My lower spine is fused and I have surgical steal rods screwed to my spin. There is one disk that was not fused to increase flexibility in my movement. That disk has been ruptured, herniated and now is totally deteriorated. It is basically bone on nerves and I have inflammation problems constantly with my back which causes pain. My lower spine is also unstable. I have been advised that surgery should be a last resort due to high possibility of infection and that I am not able to have an M.R.I. and the C.A.T. Scans and x-rays are blurry. I have been prescribed and have taken opiate pain medication off and on for years. They helped to an extent with my pain but there were mental and physical side effects that I went through. One main physical side effect was that I became dependent for a time on them and being on 100mcg of fentanyl per hour patch it was very difficult to get off of. I also had mental effects that I felt from taking opiate pain medication which included depression and anxiety. My pain and mental symptoms were treated with an anti-depressant by a doctor as well. That made my mental symptoms worse and did not help with the pain. That antidepressant was the worse medication to get off of. I didn't want to live because how bad I felt. I couldn't stop shaking for a few days and didn't think I was going to survive. Because of the bad mental experience I had with opiates and other medications, I would only take more mild pain medications later and would have to get off them, live in pain and get back on them again so my tolerance to the medication would be lower. My quality of life was horrible. I learned about turmeric an ginger and mentioned it to someone that I was taking it for a while and it helped my pain some. That person told me about Kratom tea and it could help with pain as well. I did a lot of reading online and purchased some online. I have been taking it ever since for almost a year. It helps with the pain but doesn't take it all away. I don't have concentration issues that I had even with the non-narcotic pain medication I was prescribed. It almost makes me feel like I drank coffee but not jittery, just alert. I am able to do things longer with less pain. I also had bad experiences with anti inflammatory prescriptions too and that is why I take the turmeric and ginger as well. When I take the turmeric, ginger and Kratom tea, I have my life back and am able without mental side effects, to be productive and live my life. I just don't want Kratom tea banned or hard to get. I don't want to go back to that way of life again. In my experience, Kratom tea is much safer than the antidepressants, opiate, narcotic and non-narcotic medications and anti inflammatory medications due to the fact that all of the above had some bad effect to me mentally and physically which would impair my sight, make me dizzy some or light headed and hinder my concentration just to state a few.

I have a horrible condition where my neck and head are constantly in pretty severe pain. Because if my age and the fact that doctors really don't believe that you can be in constant pain without a specific test or MRI showing the pain. \n\nI've been to about 10 doctors just in the past year, trying to figure out why I've been in pain since I was 19. Not one of them take my pain seriously, they will not adequately treat it because they fear the government regulations. My pain is so bad that I can take 5 Tylenol and 4 ibuprofen and it doesn't even touch the pain. Why do I have to suffer my entire young adult life in terrible pain? It is because most doctors look at me like I'm drug addict who just wants a high. It is discrimination. \n\nI research a lot of different subjects online, medicine being my main subject. So about a year ago I was researching legal supplements that could treat my pain. I came across Kratom one day, I had never heard of it. I studied it thoroughly for several days, I found that it had strong effects on pain, it was legal and there were not an eighth of the side effects you see with prescription pain killers . I found so many forums where people gave their experiences on using this natural plant. To me, I am skeptical till I try it myself. So I bought some sample packs. \n\nI can't tell you how I felt after the first time using it (powder mixed with orange juice). First you have to understand the amount of pain I was in daily for 6-7 years. It's excruciating, I am not exaggerating. \nNow, I did not have high hopes for this, but I had to try it, just to see. \n\nAfter about fifteen minutes after drinking  the mixture, I was sitting on my couch watching a show I was really into. I started to feel the effects creeping in, I realized how comfortable I was for the first time in years.\n\n When the pain my neck started fading away, I cried. I had found a miracle for my pain, it was unbelievable that it helped more then all the anti depresssant meds, all the Lyrica (made me gain 30lbs in six months) I had been on for years. I have used it on my really painful days and it never fails to help me. It doesn't make me high, but it really helps my mood. I am happy when I'm on it because of the pain relief. I can do more now, with my husband and my little girls. \n\nI believe that it really is a godsend. I would be right back to the old me that couldn't do much of anything if this plant becomes illegal. I would be devasted because I would have nothing to help my pain. \n\nI'm urging the government to reconsider this ban. Kratom has been around for 2000 years. I'm sure if it was harmful you would hear a lot more complaints. If the 15 deaths is your reasoning(by the way everyone of those people were on other dangerous meds.), please consider that Tylenol Is more dangerous for you then this plant is. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23046","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"L.R.

I oppose the DEA putting Kratom on the list of Schedule 1 controlled substances.  I have never had the need to use Kratom, so can't personally speak to how or why it works.  I have a 24 year old son that uses Kratom.  Three plus years ago he had an accident playing college sports, and hurt his back, he was in pain, but continued to go to classes and play sports.  Then he broke his hand and had to have 2 surgeries to repair the bones.  The first surgery had to be re-done because the plate connecting the bones bent, and he was in great pain.  After the second surgery he went into a deep depression.  He had to take medical leave from his college, and was still in great pain from his hand and back injuries.  He visited many doctors and pain clinics.  I'm not sure what medications were prescribed, and what medications he would take.  He couldn't keep food down and spent many days not able to get out of bed, sleep or work.  Our family make numerous trips to the east coast, where he was living, to see if there was anything we could do to help.  We took him to doctors, hospitals, clinics and  therapists.  He was in pain and very angry that no one seemed to understand or help.  He stopped calling, texting, and cut off communication to friends and family.  After 6 months of not hearing from him, he called to say that he was taking classes at the local college and was hoping to get enough credits to get back in good standing at his college and graduate.  He is now a second semester senior, and will graduate in June of 2017.  He is calling, going to class, eating, and he seems to have his pain under control.  He is using \nKratom.  I'm not sure how or why Kratom is working for him, but I am so thankful that it is.  Please do not list Kratom as a Schedule 1 controlled substance; let Kratom remain available.

I deal with chronic pain due to a car accident. I have a weekly migraine that comes and goes but when it is hear it is horrendous. It is caused by how tight the muscles in my back and neck are sending pain all over my body. I work with a chiropractor, i have acupuncture done but i'm still left to deal with horrible chronic pain despite my best efforts to make my life more comfortable without a substance. I used drugs heavily when i was younger, i'm 27 now and clean for over two years. I still see a doctor and i do take Soma to help relax my muscles or flexiril  at times. But sometimes i need something stronger. I do not want to go to a pain clinic and have to take oxycodone every day. I have been there and done that. Having kratom as an option is a lifesaver sometimes. It is short acting and it works for pain. But it does not knock you out or disable you like Vicodin/Percocet or other opiates can. Plus it is easy to put down and not over use to use every day. There are so many things out there depending on the person people can get addicted to. That falls back on the person and there will and makeup. If they choose to abuse kratom just like anything else your body can get use to it and you can learn to depend on it. But those are not reason why it should be put on a list that includes drugs like LSD, Heroin, Crack or PCP. Taking this useful substance away from people is going to put people in a pinch to where buying heroin which is so prevalent everywhere these days or heavier pharmaceuticals because they could not get something as weak as kratom. I can only see worse happening in the world or illegal drug abuse if Kratom is made illegal. I hope that is not what you want for you fellow man.

Kratom is 100% natural and there are no harming effects. I would like to give a little bit of my background and how I discovered \"Kratom\". I've been in numerous car accidents and suffer with chronic pain. Since then, I've been prescribed harming chemicals to the body such as \"Acetaminophen\". I don't like it at all and I find that it does more harm to my body than good. I started looking for all natural medicines and was amazed after discovering there was this plant that had medicinal properties and had no toll on the body. In my opinion, this plant is a miracle and needs to be accessible to the public, not everyone likes putting chemicals in their body. I live a clean lifestyle and wish to keep it that way. I eat organic, exercise regularly and look for all natural remedies for all my needs. I don't understand why the DEA has any interest in banning this plant that does nothing but good. I use this plant for my chronic pain but there are many people that use it for other serious mental disorders such as depression, anxiety (which I suffer from as well), addiction and many more. I would like to reference a recent interview that President Barack Obama did with Bill Maher 11/16. In the interview, President Barack Obama said out his own mouth that one of our nations serious issues is Opiate addiction. Well, the solution to that problem is Kratom if really so. The DEA should be welcoming this miracle herb if their business really is keeping drugs off our streets, saving lives (protecting our American people) and stopping people from selling & abusing their prescription pills. I don't medicate with Marijuana because I find it to strong but look how far it has came in our society. The plant was banned but in states like where I live, California, its legal commercially. Why waste time and money and put Kratom in that class when Kratom is nothing like marijuana, not even close. As you all know by now, Kratom is a cousin plant to the coffee bean and has similar effects. We sell coffee on every corner in America, not to mention all the energy drinks we have on the market. Kratom doesn't make people hallucinate, it doesn't contribute to crime and it doesn't kill anybody. With all do respect, the Kratom community feels like we are being strong armed by the multi billion dollar pharmaceutical companies. Please, do not take this medicine away from us. Kratom has changed my life in many ways. I'm a better family man, patriot and all around American because of this plant. I would like to end this comment but I really hope my government does the right thing and works for the people. People will suffer if you take this plant away from us and I mean that. Thank you for your time and God bless America!

As someone who makes their living through physical work having a good method of pain relief that allows me to function normally at work is essential.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen are not potent enough to be thoroughly effective and opioid painkillers are more strongly analgesic but at the heavy cost of incapacitating me (can't drive, think clearly, stay motivated, etc.)\nKratom has been a perfect solution that clears the pain, improves my mood, and leaves me sharp and mentally alert. \nI am strongly opposed to the DEA's proposed scheduling of Kratom alkaloids as Schedule I substances.

I believe that we as a country should do more research into Kratom rather then banning it for multiple reasons. Not only the fact that it helps people with addiction but the fact that it completely stops the withdrawal aspect and helps people get back from that life of lawlessness and dependency. A natural plant that provides that relief is more then deserving of research and not being banned. It has no more serious effects then that of coffee, sodas, and aspirin all of which is completely legal.

Before I found Kratom I was self medicating with alcohol and it was not doing me any good. It was aspirating my mental illness and causing a lot more harm than it could ever do good. I found Kratom in a local cigarette store and decided to give it a try the shop owner let me know he knew very little about it but heard it was good for all sorts of things like pain, anxiety, restlessness even constant fatigue. So I tried it at first it just made me sleepy but that was just because I took a little too much after trail and error on myself I found a happy medium where I'm not sleepy at all and can actually have conversations with my fellow humans without feeling like I'm drowning.

I was drinking a lot of alcohol every day and it was killing me literally. Now I feel healthier than ever and I don't feel like I have to have a drink to be around people I don't HAVE to take Kratom either I don't feel like it has a hold on me but it helps me so much that I'd just be really sad if I couldn't take advantage of it anymore.\nThank you for reading this if anyone does I'm very sorry my grammar is garbage I hope it's not to hard of a read.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5204","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kelsee Kincer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"While I believe that the DEA's power to schedule dangerous drugs on an emergency basis is a good thing, I also believe that there must be a high level of proof met before that power can be exercised (even if only temporarily). I don't believe that the DEA has met this level of proof for the alkaloids in kratom. As far as \"no accepted medical use\" is concerned, medicines have been synthesized using these alkaloids, as seen in the following references: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18550129 and http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/348/3/383.full. As far as \"high potential for abuse\" is concerned, I don't believe that the DEA has provided evidence for this. A single death attributed solely to the use of kratom does not constitute an \"imminent hazard to the public safety\". By referring to these alkaloids as \"opioids\" in the original notice of intent reinforces my belief that the DEA prematurely intended to schedule without sufficient proof.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1047","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom. There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works... It uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies. http://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes... Thailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects. http://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

Here is a past criminal justice system's corruption example ending with the incarceration of an innocent individual, which will continue with the expansion of the war on drugs:\n\nWhen Rampart Police Department Officer Rafael Perez was arrested, it led to the biggest scandal in the history of the Los Angeles Police Department. Perez did what Rodney King couldn't do: bring the L.A. force under federal supervision.  Once a golden boy of the L.A.P.D., Rafael Perez has become a symbol of its decay. \n \nJavier Ovando was shot and framed by L.A.P.D. officers, then sentenced to 23 years in prison.  Tamar Toister, Ovando's public defender, asked judge Stephen Czuleger for a continuance to inspect the building. Judge Czuleger refused. When Toister tried to cross-examine the officers about discrepancies between their first report and their revised account, the prosecutor objected and judge Czuleger sustained his objections. Throughout the trial, Toister couldn't seem to catch a break. \"What happened was dirty,\" she said later, \"I did all I could but I wasn't allowed to put on a defense.\"\nOvando, stoic in his courtroom demeanor, was becoming increasingly desperate. To complicate things, Valenzuela (Ovando's girlfriend) had told him she was pregnant. \"I became very sad,\" Ovando said quietly. \"I cried. I admit I cried. What could I do?\" The trial lasted a week and ended on Feb. 20, 1997 with the jury finding Javier Ovando guilty of all charges. Judge Czuleger sentenced him to 23 years in prison, declining a request for leniency because, he said, Ovando had shown no remorse for his crimes.\n\nPerez's testimony was a series of lies, and the theory that Ovando was a gang assassin a total invention. When Toister learned of the frame-up, she said that she also felt like a victim. Judge Czuleger, who had prevented her cross-examination of Perez and Durden, apologized to the public defender. In an interview, Czuleger said that he was shocked by the injustice that had occurred in his court. \"It was,\" he said, \"the worst day of my judicial career.\" But it was worse for Ovando, who spent three years in prison and remains paralyzed. Judge Czuleger never apologized for destroying his life. \n\nPerez and Durden were polished, smooth liars. Nonetheless, it is appalling that despite having no prior convictions, Ovando was sentenced to the maximum by judge Czuleger because he \"showed no remorse.\" It was equally appalling that the sham of a trial withstood appellate review and the conviction was allowed to stand.\n\n(Excerpts from articles: \"Rampart Hasn't Changed How Criminal Courts Do Business,\" September 21, 2000, by TAMAR TOISTER, a Los Angeles County deputy public defender, and Truthinjustice.org, The New York Times Magazine \"One Bad Cop\" By LOU CANNON.)\n\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, the senseless criminalization of millions more innocent people will continue.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20560","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I want to  say that Kratom saved my son from an opiate addiction, he had neck surgery back in 2008, he was 28 years old and had his own bisiness, also took karate class'es and taught karate class, and also had a third Job bouncing at a panama city club. From this surgery he got so addicted to pain pills that he could not get off of them, he was having to do all kinds of shady deals to get what he needed, he confessed to me about his addiction and told me he had to stop doing what he was doing or he was gonna end up in jail, so he went to a methadone clinic. This clinic was not on his side, they are there to make money not help people get off drugs. This methadone started to wrek havoc on his body, made him weak, lost all his muscle tone, didn't have any energy, couldn't go to the bathroom, his stomach was bleeding, and it made him mean, and was thinking strange thoughts. I starting researching to do anything I could to get my son off of that methadone, and I ran accross Kratom, I bought a little and tried it on my pain and it worked fantastic, then I started to see blogs about how it could help people with herion addiction and opiates, well long story short, I bought it for my son and it did help him with withdrawals and to stay off, he had been clean for a year now, Kratom saved my sons life.

This would put Kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental & physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin.  It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown Kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\nI came across Kratom in 2010 as an all-natural, herbal option to the traditional pain medications currently running amok in our country.  I have been dealing with back pain for more than 15 years and have been prescribed everything in the physicians drug guide.  I battled and overcame an addiction to painkillers like hydrocodone and oxycodone.  At first, they seem like a miracle, but after prolonged use, I became fully aware of the dangers of these drugs.  Through physical therapy and a TENS unit, I was able to get my life back, but I was still having pain issues.\n\nA friend asked me if I had ever tried Kratom, I told her I hadnt.  After her recommendation, I began researching this wonderful and healthy alternative dietary supplement.  After reading scores of personal stories, research papers and articles, I decided to try it out.  Long story short, I have finally found a way to live a normal life, free from almost all of my constant, physical pain.\n\nI can take Kratom as needed, to help me through flare ups and then stop all together when I dont need it.  This is impossible with drugs being prescribed by doctors today.  Kratom has become an integral part of my life and to say I am distraught by this recent announcement from the DEA is putting it mildly.  PLEASE stop this from being banned for the millions who have regained control of their lives because of Kratom.\n\nSimply put, there is no evidence to support a ban.  Kratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and it has changed my life.  The Kratom community is all for making it a regulated dietary ingredient.  I fear a ban by the DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic.  I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without Kratom.  I will suffer and many will suffer far more.  You can stop this.\n\nIf you have questions about Kratom, please visit www.americankratom.org.

I had little success with methadone, their clinics are not typically a haven for sobriety. I've also been on suboxone for years and found it difficult to detox. I eventually had to go back to inpatient rehab to kick suboxone. It took years of work and professional help to get sober.  I have never taken Kratom but I've heard a few things about it.

I have a 21 year old daughter that has been ill with Lyme Disease for almost 5 years.  She has late stage Neuro Lyme which has  affected her brain, spinal fluid, circulatory system, nervous system, stomach, intestines, kidneys, gall bladder, pancreas, bladder, eyes, hearing, joints, and bones. \n\nThis disease is not just one disease but a combination of many diseases (viruses, bacteria, parasites). Any vector born insect such as a tick or mosquito bites an infected animal then injects those organisms into a human through a bite. A person can have Lyme with numerous co-infections all with their own set of symptoms sometimes overlapping. My daughter has had as many as three type written pages of symptoms ranging from severe unrelenting head pain (for 5 years), seizures, hallucinations, cysts formed in her sacral spine from 5 lumbar punctures due to high spinal fluid pressure, extreme light and sound sensitivity, unable to walk,  confined to a wheel chair and her bed for the last two years.\n\n  We have seen hundreds of doctors and have been told everything from \"she needs to go back to school\" to \"are you aware of munchausens\".  Most doctors think Lyme doesn't exist or it can be cured by 10 to 14 days of antibiotics.  Even  Doctors that are familiar with Lyme do not know what to do as it is so complicated.  Finally the small group of Lyme literate doctors are at odds with each other. Some feel IV antibiotic treatment is warranted, others still use multiple antibiotic rotation strategies , while others use more non-traditional methods employing a myriad of supplements, and \"out of the box strategies. \n\n The bottom line is this is not a simple or even highly recognized disease so the help you get from the medical community is slim to none. Which brings me to this:  THE PAIN is always there in varying degrees of intensity from a 6 or 7 to a 10 to 12.  Sometimes she curls up in a ball and cries for hours to make it stop.  As her mother I try my hardest to do that.  However, I have had to put her through withdrawal from sometimes well meaning pain medicine doctors.  They put her on oxycontin, oxycodone, dilaudid, morphine, etc. etc. etc. and then decide she has been on them too long and here we go again I have to put her through withdrawal and in the meantime THE PAIN is unrelenting.\n \nTwo years ago I was searching the web as I do nightly looking for something that would help her pain and I came across a blog discussing  Kratom.  I read the pros and cons and decided it was far less dangerous than the opiates she had been taking not to mention how hard the withdrawal process can be on the body.  So, I ordered some.  She took the pills. Had to take quite a few as her tolerance was fairly high.  We were amazed how much better she felt.  While it did not take away her head pain it did diminish her body aches and pains considerably. Within the last year we have switched to the tincture as it is more concentrated and seems to work faster.  I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't found Kratom.\nI know, we would have continued to go to the ER's and beg for help with the pain and be on an endless cycle of medicate-pain-withdrawal.\n\nMy daughter does not get a \"high\", she merely feels somewhat better and can get through a day without wishing she were dead.  Kratom is a plant and I believe God put plants here for a reason not synthetic drugs with 10 to 15 side effects. If I can give her a small amount of relief with little to no side effects, while we continue to get treatment for her condition it has been well worth it.\n\nI strongly urge you to reconsider your plans to make Kratom a Schedule 1 drug.  Its benefits, especially in  higher doses, can help reduce pain and make someone who is suffering more comfortable. The number one complaint of most patients to their doctors concerns pain.  There are thousands of people who cannot live normal lives because pain is a constant.  We need to begin to look at alternatives to fight these chronic conditions instead of opiates.  After all  the overwhelming increase of prescriptions drug abuse in this country starts with someone just trying to get relief from PAIN.\n\nThank you for reading my comments.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7534","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Janice Flores","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I Duane Hughes use Kratom daily for several back pain.

I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about 15 years ago. It causes widespread pain throughout my body. The pain I feel is similar to what a person feels when they have the flu or a fever. My body aches all over when I get a 'fibro flare'. I have also battled depression and anxiety and I get migraines often. I have been prescribed a lot of prescription medications over the years to help me. The drug Cymbalta was one of them, which is supposed to help with the fibromyalgia pain and depression. I have to admit it did help with the pain, but I felt like an unemotional zombie all the time. I really couldn't care less about anything while I was taking it. I also have chronic migraines. My health insurance company limits me to 9 migraine pills a month. That doesn't go very far as I get one practically every day. What am I supposed to do the other 21 days of the month?\n\nAfter much frustration and angst in dealing with doctors and prescription drugs, around seven years ago I discovered the herb kratom. Kratom is a plant that has been used in Southeast Asia for centuries by people to help them with not only pain, but to give them energy and an overall good feeling. It also helps with a myriad of other symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. I've joined groups of other users of kratom and have learned a lot about it over the years. I've met people who have successfully used kratom to help them get off opiates, including heroin, as well as anti-depressants. Many of these people deal with chronic pain, like I do and are fed up with all the hoops a person must jump through to get pain killers from doctors. My doctor also recently mentioned that he will no longer be able to prescribe pain killers to me after the first of the year. I must go to a pain specialistjust to get a prescription! I have rather high co-pays with my wonderful supposedly 'affordable' health insurance, so this will just cost me more money and my husband and I are both out of work right now.\n\nKratom does not get a person high, even though it works like an opiate. I wanted to get off the Cymbalta. I didn't like being a zombie. So I stopped taking it. Kratom gave me the ability to do it without going through a tough withdrawal. I was terrified to go off of it because I had heard horror stories from others about how hard that is to do. By supplementing with this plant, it wasn't hard at all. Kratom gives me the ability to get out of bed in the morning. I drink kratom tea every morning, much like people who drink coffee. It allows me to function. It helps decrease my pain. It helps me to become productive. It makes me feel better. And best of all, there are few side effects other than a bit of nausea if I take too much.\n\nObviously the drug war in this country is failing. I read more and more each day about people overdosing on opiates (mainly heroin and fentanyl) and how it has become an epidemic. The use of opiates has become out of control. Many people who turn to kratom will have nowhere else to turn if it is banned. Many who have used kratom successfully to get off opiates will probably either live with their pain (which for some is unbearable) or go back to prescription pain killers or worsethey'll turn to street drugs if kratom becomes a Schedule 1 drug. What alternatives do people have? Isn't torture illegal in this country? To me it seems that people who are in chronic pain in this country are treated like criminals. To me, that is torture. To be in pain all the time is no way to live. I truly believe that people will die if kratom is banned. No one has overdosed on kratom. No one has died due to kratom use alone.\n\nAs a person who lives daily chronic pain, I beg you not to ban kratom. I don't look forward to living the rest of my life in pain. Please reconsider banning this miraculous herb. \n\nSincerely,\n\nVicki A.

It is not a cure, but a very mild yet effective naturally occuring plant. It's relation to coffee can be compared to the extent of its addictive properties, so by definition, its not threatening at all. Mother Earth has given us many plants in order to help our bodies, a process that has developed for thousands of years. When we see that, we can truly get back to our health and vitality. There are many, including myself that can't tolerate anything synthetic and made in a lab, so what choices will we have to feel better when we are sick, if natural options are no longer a choice for the sovereign individual to make? I do not take Kratom anymore, but it helped me to get through many months of pain and fatigue due to Hashimoto's autoimmune symptoms after I gave birth, and I noticed my abilities to function as a new mother were greatly improved. I was very focused and present, and no longer distracted because of the discomfort I had been experiencing. When my symptoms improved, I simply stopped taking it.

After spending about a year going to the doctors, each of which told me the same thing which never helped, \" first we're going to have to send you to verbal counseling.\" well I talked and talked and got nowhere, until I found Kratom. The plant changed my life. I was able to sleep again, concentrate, I didn't always have that constant state of fight or flight, and morning sickness associated with nerves from not wanting to deal with the day disappeared. all from one cup of tea in the morning. Now that this temporary ban has been put on it and i can't get it i'm right back to square one. It's a terrifying concept to think that something so helpful is going to be taken away based on minimal evidence that it's even bad. When there's so many prescriptions drugs that i could get my hands on that are way more harmful and illegal. however banning Kratom has taken away a legal way for me to live an anxiety free life. I seriously hope that me and the thousands like me don't turn to illegal ways to obtain the same results, as a result of this what was legal substance being banned. All the people who took kratom for chronic pain and stress will now be forced to seek alternate avenues of help, some of which will be illegal and unhealthy.

I have a college degree and spent many years working in the legal field. Approximately 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with endometriosis, a chronic disease that causes severe pain. While some women with endometriosis suffer minimal or no pain, I suffer pain and emotional distress every day from this disease. Some of my symptoms include severe stomach and back pain, headaches, fatigue, mood swings, muscle soreness, heavy bleeding, and feelings of hopelessness. Many call endometriosis an invisible illness because it cannot usually be detected or diagnosed without surgery. This makes the disease very hard to diagnose, and some women, myself included, endure years of suffering before getting a diagnosis. Menstrual cramps are bad, awful even for some women. Endometriosis causes extreme pain for many sufferers every single day of the month. Many doctors dismiss this pain, because they cannot see it. Many doctors label you as a drug seeker when asking for help managing this pain, because menstrual cramps are normal, and every woman deals with them. Women with endometriosis do not suffer from \"normal\" cramps. This is a debilitating pain which interferes with work and daily life. To have a doctor tell you the pain does not exist because they cannot see it is devastating. 3 years ago I discovered kratom. Kratom helps with many symptoms of my endometriosis, lessening the severity of the cramps and lifting my mood. I drink a cup of tea in the morning and I can face my day and care for my young children without being chained to my bed in pain. Kratom greatly improves my quality of life, and the lives of many other people who have it much worse than I do. To remove a supplement that improves people's quality of life is, in my opinion inhumane. I would agree with some regulation to avoid the altering of this natural substance, or even to restrict the use of it by people under the age of 18. I am strongly against placing a plant on any schedule, be it 1 or 5. I am a law abiding adult. I do not use kratom to get high, and if kratom was a product which had any sort of amazing \"high\" it would be much more popular with teenagers and drug users. The people you would be hurting by taking away kratom are the veterans, the chronic pain sufferers, and the people like me. I am against the DEA scheduling kratom, and I believe it's a gross overreaction to a product that should be available for the responsible adults who gain help from it. It's a cup of tea, and it improves my daily life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4521","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do mot make kratom illegal.

It was the best decision I'd made for dealing with my pain. I put the powder in capsules. And I take 2-4 capsules twice daily. Which is a small dose, but it does relieve my pain. It isn't hard on my stomach like ibprophen or Tylenol. It doesn't make me feel high, I can finally live a better life managing my pain.

Not only due I have a steady stream of drug seekers coming into my office, but I have suffered indescribable pain watching my daughter go through her battle with opioid addiction.  Kratom is very popular in the recovering addiction community because it offers both anelgesic properties and anti-anxiety properties without causing relapse in the recovering addict.  My daughter uses it along with all the recovered addicts she knows.  I also use it because I choose not to use pharmaceutical opioids (which has caused this epidemic in the first place) and because I don't like to overdue the NSAIDS or acetaminaphine.  Kratom is very benefitial, very safe (anything can be over done so lets be realistic here), and doesn't cause addiction.  The alcohol and cigarettes that are legally sold through out the world is exponentially more destructive than Kratom could ever be and yet there they sit - on the store shelves. Please don't take one of the only tools the recovering community has to help stay sober.  You say you are here to help stop addiction; however, the over 2 million opioid addicts still need to overcome their addictions.  Please help them to do so by giving them Kratom as an alternative pain medication.\n\nThank you for your time with this matter.\nSincerely,\nNaida Singleton, DMD","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21575","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Naida Singleton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do more  research on Kratom.

It really helped me get out of a deep, dark depression. It is not extremely addictive, as I am weaning off of it without much difficulty, now taking it every other day instead of on a daily basis. I plan to continue to wean off of it because I want to be completely substance free (maybe one day without my prescribed Klonopin also. I should note that Kratom helped me lower my Klonopin dosage significantly to a level that I am more functional on and have less of a flat affect). \n\nMy feelings about Kratom are mixed, because there is not enough research on it and I want to know what I am ingesting. Still, I was near suicidal ideation on a daily basis before my friend recommended this to me. I am so blessed that it came and helped me get out of such a tough, dark spot. I will continue to wean, but hope to know that I have this as a possible choice if things get so bad in my head again.\n\nBecause of its borderline legality, I did hide this habit from my family but was using on an almost daily basis this summer. My brother wrote me the nicest birthday note ever, about how happy he was to see me happy and that he wanted me to continue to be happy. It meant so much to me, that I had come from the pits of despair to a joking, appreciative person others would want to be around. The inner-me, my sense of humor, my interest in ideas and others that used to be there which had faded during college and during depression had returned. And I was so happy that I was happy. There may have been other factors - I see a psychologist weekly and try to live a healthy lifestyle. I have lofty goals professionally and personally, some of which I am surely on my way to accomplishing.\n\nI would be in a worse place without Kratom. Today is one of my days that I will not take Kratom and I am doing just fine. The anti-depressant effects are longer lasting than when I am just affected by the substance. This helped get my life right on the right track, helped me appreciate what I have and know that things will work out for me. I have worried less and socialized more. This substance is mysterious and there must be more research done to see what capabilities and potential drawbacks this substance has. Anecdotally, it really helped me and I hope that it can continue to be a help to others with depression (and other conditions).\n\nThank you for reading my abridged story, and for considering the positive potential of this substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7481","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 52 year old man who raised 2 children by myself.

I have never experienced any negative reaction to kratom and have stopped taking it at times without any form of serious withdrawals.\n\nThis leaf should not be banned or made a scheduled drug.

I have seen what kratom does. I have two family members to use Kratom.  I know for a fact, the claims that kratom can cause hallucinations and is addictive is simply not true. I have watched my family members both suffer from chronic pain and they have both been prescribed very strong opiates. They both have suffered the side effects of those opiates as well. \nOne of those family members suffers with fibromyalgia, a known condition many pain doctors have stated is very hard to treat. For nearly 30 years she has been on every prescription available and off label to try and get relief. Nothing has worked well for her. She is one who researches everything she can about her condition, the prescriptions and any natural supplements she takes.  She found kratom a couple of years back and said she finally gets a break from the most of the miserable pain.   This woman is not one to take medications unless they are prescribed. She is not an addict and has never been. She is not an alcohol drinker either. She has energy to be with her daughter for a day long shopping trip. She can now clean her home, instead of being in the bed or on her couch balled up in so much pain she is crying. She can do things with her family she couldn't do until she got relief from this plant, kratom. It has given her energy, pain relief and the ability to live her life to the fullest. \nThe other family member was in a terrible motorcycle accident a few years back. Every nerve in her left arm was cut and she almost died from the injury. She has also been prescribed the strongest opiates on the market. She found kratom after  the first family member and has stated it helps with her nerve damage pain.  Not once while I've watched them take the supplement kratom, have either acted like she's not in control of herself and never has been unable to keep up with the conversations and be part of the family. Both  just feels like partaking in life now. \nPlease reconsider placing kratom on such a high level. With the opiate epidemic our country is facing and trying to get under control, from my research and watching these two members of the family, kratom could be a healthy, safe plant that  brings pain relief, is safe from any harmful  or deadly side effects,  I believe kratom possibly could be the answer to this nations opiate abuse problems.

I graduated from Princeton University in 2012 and currently own an ACT / SAT / PSAT tutoring business called Magnolia Prep.  We do tutoring in 6 cities: Shreveport, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Orlando, Phoenix, and Louisville.\n\nI tried kratom for the first time in Fall 2014, and started drinking kratom regularly in December 2015. I started drinking kratom with my friends Richie (Lyft driver) and Sam (medical doctor, internal medicine specialty) to put us in a good mood before we went to the bars in Phoenix on Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nI've used kratom for different things. First, it puts me in a good mood. Normally, if a certain day is \"fine\" (nothing terrible or great happening), kratom takes me from feeling sorta \"blah\" and puts me in a legit good mood. \n\nKratom also helps me see things in proper perspective, mood-wise. If something small in the grand scheme of things is ruining my day, kratom makes it seem like it's really not a big deal and that everything will work out fine eventually.\n\nSecond, it helps me with social anxiety. Especially high-pressure environments like going to parties / clubs / bars / meetings where I don't know anybody and I want to be upbeat, relaxed, and social. Basically, it makes me the same way in a high-pressure environment that I would be if I was just chilling with my best friends around the house.\n\nThird, it helps me get work done. It makes me content to just sit there and grind out work for 10-12 hours straight if I want to.

Kratom has helped reduce the negative effects of those conditions for nearly 6 years now. It's efficacy is somewhere along the lines of taking any other number of dietary herbal supplements, and absolutely nothing like the substances it would be placed next to on the schedule one list, like cocaine and heroin.\n\nJust because something has shown it can be effective for us does not mean it is dangerous and in need of regulation. As a taxpayer, there are better things for the DEA and law enforcement to spend their time on than battling against Kratom, like dealing with the prescription opiate epidemic.\n\nWhatever the effects of Kratom are, they are certainly not overpowering, or dangerously strong. There are many other herbs with similar potencies, such as Kava, Cats Claw, Blue Lotus, etc that are not illegal. \n\nOur friend to the North, Canada, also does not consider Kratom to be a schedule-worthy plant, and we have long held a tradition of siding with them on Drug policy.\n\nRather than making Kratom illegal, I would like to see some regulation as to the manner in which it is processed - i.e. ensuring clean manufacturing facilities, the same way we regulate the production of wheat flour or bottled water. \n\nIn summary, Kratom has helped me live a normal life, and be a functioning member of society. Less than half of all people with Autism find steady employment, and I have done not just that, but found it in a crucial and important field, with the help of Kratom, green tea extract, and my daily regimen of vitamins. Now, you want to take one of those away from me. Should this be the case, it is likely I would have no choice but to either suffer,  or move to Canada and renounce my citizenship. I have family here, and I love the USA! I don't want to do this, but I'm not sure what else I would do. What I do know is that Kratom is a dietary herbal supplement, has not been addictive in my experience over the past 6 years, and is absolutely not a drug. It has been very helpful for me and many others, and more importantly, has done no harm. Once again, it is an herbal supplement, not a drug. Please don't treat it like one.\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider what I've written here, and I do hope you decide to work for both the good of, and accurate representation of, we the people, and choose to keep Kratom legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17002","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathan Lamendola","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should remain legal!

At the age of 30 I developed an allergy to all NSAID medications. Ibuprofen, Asprin, Naproxin ETC. My throat swells shut if I take any. At the age of 34 I developed Chrons disease. This is an incredibly painful ailment. At the age of 36 I started dealing with gout in my knees and feet, also incredibly painful. Needless to say, with the exception of Tylenol and opiates there is not a lot the Dr's can do for me to treat pain. Kratom has been a God send for me. Kratom allows me to deal with the pain caused by these ailments without relying on highly addictive prescriptions that are also highly deadly. As a Kratom user for almost 3 years on and off again as needed I can say that it has helped in a way I never thought possible. I firmly believe the product should not be scheduled as any class of drug. The fact remains, its just not powerful enough. With the plant being from the same family as coffee any addictive properties are minimal at best. The plant simply is not something you can get high on. That is probably the reason drug companies are developing prescription painkillers based on the active ingredient in kratom and indicating they hold no addictive properties. I do find it odd that the emergency notice to ban Kratom came within hours of a drug company announcing said product was ready for FDA approval. This is highly suspect and immediately causes one to wonder if Kratom is being banned for monetary reasons.\n\nIs this something that just anyone should have access to? Of course not. Smart laws regarding its use should be considered. Age restrictions would be wise. Regulations in regards to the processing and packaging should also be seriously considered. I hope that you will take seriously how many people are helped by this naturally occurring plant that grows in the wild. Prescription opiates and illegal drugs like heroin kill thousands yearly as well as ruin lives. With the crisis we have in this country, having something that allows someone to get their life back should be considered a good thing.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19344","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Charles Lynch","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a Kratom user.

Aside from inducing more anxiety because I paid $21.99 or more for a product that did nothing to help alleviate my condition. I am not a drug user. I do not drink alcoholic beverages. I do however smoke cigarettes that I am currently trying to quit. I work with the public in a retail setting so my battle with anxiety is daily. Without this supplement, the task of going to work everyday would be quite difficult. My side affects from this supplement were mild constipation from time to time. I am in no way, shape or form the drug addict that some portray in their documents that have no realistic truth. Most are hardworking individuals who are trying to find an alternative to pharmaceutical drugs that do more harm than they alleviate. Not to mention the outrageous prices for such medication that the hardworking Americans can not afford with pay being so low and unemployment so high to even afford insurance. So I implore your agency to rethink your decision, which will only make an increasingly troubled economy and stressed out Americans even worse with a proposed ban.

I honestly cannot believe that I even have to write this letter. However, I feel my voice deserves to be heard as much as any voice. It is my only recourse to stand up to your potential actions against this plant, and to represent in the only way I can, the huge number of people who safely use this plant as a supplement on a regular basis, without any side effects or danger to their lives whatsoever. \n\nI am an older man, and my energy levels are not what they used to be. I work 64+ hours per week at my job, and have a multiple of projects that keep me busy at home. I work all the time. In fact all I do is work. I have been taking Kratom for over a year, and it helps me tremendously to stay focused and have an extra boost of energy, very similar to caffeine, except it helps me more to find motivation. There is no intoxicating effect whatsoever to this plant.\n\nTo say that this plant is an imminent threat to society is nothing short of a complete fallacy, and I can't help but wonder who's agenda these potential actions stand to serve, and who stands to benefit.\n\nAs for the potential for abuse; nobody could overdose on Kratom if they tried. If you ingest too much, your stomach will reject it and you will vomit. I will not elaborate further on that as I believe it has been fully covered in the information that has already been sent to you by the law offices of Hogan Lovells, which more than adequately refutes the claims you have made against this plant.\n\nThis plant is used by as many as 3-5 million people in the United States alone, who use it for a multitude of reasons. It is of great benefit to people suffering from depression, PTSD, fatigue, and those who use it for pain management, just to name a few. Nobody, to my knowledge, is out here advertising it as a cure all for all of life's ailments. However, it is a very important supplement that is used by many people, who use it safely every day, and who, right now, are quite simply terrified of you and your potential actions against it. \n\nI saw recently that alcohol kills 88,000 people per year, and tobacco kills 480,000 people per year. I don't see you trying to ban alcohol or tobacco. Yet you are calling Kratom a threat to society when it alone has never killed anyone?\n\nYou cannot turn on the television without being bombarded with non-stop advertisements for Pharmaceutical drugs with serious side effects that go on for half of the commercial. Yet here you are, targeting and threatening a natural plant in the same family of coffee, as if it is a threat to society. \n\nThere are countless people who are simply terrified right now of your potential actions against this plant and the repercussions it could have on their lives. Yet many are also terrified to even speak up against you for fear of consequences of even speaking out.\n\nIf you ban this plant, you will not be helping anyone. What you will actually be doing is severely hurting hundreds of thousands, if not literally millions, of innocent people right here in the United States, who are just simply trying to survive in this world and lead full and productive lives.\n\nI sincerely hope that this is not just an example of corruption run amuck and pandering to the pharmaceutical industry. I would like to think that we can have more faith in our Government than that, and that greed and control are not the driving force behind these potential measures.\n\nI have seen videos of soldiers, who have been literally brought to tears and are truly shaking, because of YOUR potential actions against this plant. These are people that struggle every day to survive with the horrendous memories of things they have seen and experienced in their lives, which no person should ever have to experience. They are people that struggle with the prospect of suicide, and yet this plant has helped them to find purpose, maintain their lives, and try to move forward.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, if you take this plant away from them, you will likely be directly responsible for causing the suicide of many American soldiers who will simply give up. For what? For who's benefit? Who gives you the right to take that away from them? What happened to a Government of the people, for the people, and by the people? When did it become a Government that rules the people? In case you have forgotten, this is a Constitutional Republic. It is not an Oligarchy. At least it is not supposed to be.\n\nAs for me personally, if you ban this plant, you will severely diminish my ability to maintain my active lifestyle, which I absolutely must maintain for the very sake of survival of my family. A ban on this plant would have devastating consequences on the lives of so many people in this country, and for what cause? For what reason? Who do you think you are? Who gave you the license to play dictator of all of the citizens?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21603","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been a life saver for my mom.

I suffer from debaliting pain everyday and it hinders my ability to do my everyday tasks. There is no long term cure that works for my condition at my age currently. There is no surgeons that is willing to operate on me due to my age, in addition, there is a two year waitlist for my first evaluation appointment, There are people who need care sooner than me.\n\nI am a productive member of society and plan to explore my love of chemistry. I work, go to school, and participate in community events as much as I can. My pcp of 2 years has decided a state funded narcotic that I don't pay a dime for from the pharmacy is best solution. My doctor is always impressesed by my positivity and my attempt to find better ways to manage my pain ( I have not given up yet). What do I do when I can longer work or function because of the heavy narcotic dosing?\n\nI believe in a mix of medication( all discussed my long lasting relationship with my pcp). I have taken X-rays, mri's and many courses of physical therapy all paid for by the state which I am so thankful for. I work with doctors at my job and they will all say that its not good practice to rely only on one medication for pain managemen because of tolerance - needing more of same drug for similar effects. My doctor and I have agreed that diversification of pain medication helps to reduce the risk of dependence on any one drug and therefore, allows me to function to now. \n\nThe problem with Kratom is inconsistency, different give different effects and so controls are not well established. And dosing is hard. I will admit that. It is actually very annoying with each, but if you are careful and titrate your dosing without combining other drugs til you understand the power of the substance you are putting in your body\n\nPeople lie, numbers don't. Let's look at statistics: \n\n1. Why do we consume 99% of the worlds production of hydrocodone? Those plants have to come from some where.\n\n2. a) our synthetic opiod epidemic : these number are from the cdc.gov. I think that's a reliable source. \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/opioid-prescribing/\n\nEach day, 46 people die from an overdose of prescription painkillers* in the US.\n\nHealth care providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for painkillers in 2012, enough for every American adult to have a bottle of pills.\n\n10 of highest prescribing states for painkillers are in the South.\n\n 3. Number of poison control calls over 5 years\n\nDuring the study period, U.S. poison centers received 660 calls about reported exposure to kratom. The number of calls increased tenfold from 26 in 2010 to 263 in 2015. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/866904\n\n4.\n\n100000 people x 40 hour x 20 years - 80,000,000 lost earnings\n\nAnd if they aren't making money then the state will pay \nBetween 1960 and 2014, the portion of U.S. healthcare expenses paid:\ndirectly by consumers decreased from 48% to 11%.\nby government increased from 24% to 49%.\nby private insurance increased from 21% to 33%.[14]Okay. \n\nI am thankful for the help to have the Medical care provided free of charge, but how long can this be sustained for our children?\n\nI agree 660 (is a lot by itself but let's look at reality which is 11 calls a month as an average. Data from http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/866904\n\nIn 2014, the 55 U.S. poison control centers provided telephone guidance for nearly 2.2 million human poison exposures. http://www.poison.org/poison-statistics-national\n\n\nDuring the temporary ban, the DEA would conduct studies on this natural supplement. To me, it makes more sense to conduct studies and then come to a conclusion on whether or not to ban kratom. \nIn conclusion, I urge the DEA to halt the ban until further studies can be performed do we can make America great again. I believe that I represent the majority of patients with chronic pain who use opioids. We are responsible and educated. Yes, there is an opioid epidemic in this country. Why not at least research it before the pharmaceutical version reaches the market as soon as patent goes through - as this less addictive, just as effective, and new pain med. We need to make the right choice instead of keeping stakeholders' interest a priority. Do the right thing and at least research the entire plant before making decision that affect a large group of people.\n\nIf you keep it legal then we can control it. every supplier has 2x/3x their price since this possibility of scarcity. \nSincerely,\n\nA concerned Citizen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23013","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sean Carter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please stop, do not Ban.

Briefly, I just wanted express my disdain for any type of ban or scheduling of the Indonesian leaf. Kratom, without a doubt, saved my life.\n\nAfter graduating from college and unsuccessfully finding a job that not only provided a living wage, but was not even in my field of study, the opportunity to relieve my later to be diagnosed depression led me down the dark road of heroin abuse. After years of usage, withdrawal, and two arrests, I made the decision to kick the addiction. Unable to afford the process and costs of doctor assisted tapering, I discovered kratom. \n\nFrom the moment I began to use the plant over two years ago, I have been free from using heroin. I have been free from the withdrawals, the potential felonies and ODs, and have become a father to a wonderful 5 yr old daughter. I no longer live in my parents basement. I am a productive citizen again, all because of this tree leaf. Even more so, easing off of heroin with kratom was far easier, less costly, and more pleasant than the experiences I witnessed friends friends have using Suboxone or methadone.\n\nThere is no \"high\" with kratom. There are no deadly repercussions with kratom overdoses. there is simply no need to schedule or ban a plant less harmful than alcohol or cigarettes. \n\nIn conclusion, I will disagree with and ask that no scheduling or banning of the substances found within the kratom leaf occur.\n\nThank you,\nTom Green","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14258","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Lindsey Damron I think Kratom should remain legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17488","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lindsey Damron","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep kratom legal it's a halted me a lot with my anxiety issues.\nI tried taking medications and I prefer kratom because it doesn't make me feel drowsy.\nIt just doesn't make sense to make this natural plant illegal. \nOur freedom is a stake if we make plants like kratom illegal. \nPlease think about this !\nThanks!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7056","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\nMy name is Kelli Audet.

After many failed attempts at sobriety, including years of doctor prescribed medications for opioid and alcohol abuse (suboxone and topamax), I found kratom in a Google search.

Unlike the many prescribed medications, I have never experienced any side effects or withdrawal symptoms from kratom.

In addition, I was in a horrible car accident in 2010 which both compounded my pain and caused additional injuries.  After several rounds of treatment, I was left with nothing left but to be prescribed painkillers from a pain management doctor.  Over the years, I have been increased from low doses of hydrocodone to Fentanyl all with an incredible list of side effects which have negatively impacted my life on top of the pain.  One of the reasons I chose to be a chiropractor was to help people who have suffered as I have.\n\nAt the time of the car accident, I was still married and my then husband also suffered injuries similiar to mine.  He was also put on the same path of opiate painkillers but he ended up suffered from a higher tolerance than I and looked for options outside of medical treatment for his pain and ended up taking heroin like so many others.  A normally healthy, positive, kind, responsible man became a shell of himself and was on the verge of death when he decided to go to rehab.\n\nWhen he got out of rehab, we both sought after something to assist with our pain that was not an opiate painkillers.  He could not take them anymore and I wanted to be done.  So, after much searching, we found out about kratom.  We bought some from a local herb store and it was actually very effective at managing our pain without side effects.  That was 4 years ago and we still both use kratom on a daily basis.  Kratom not only treats our pain at the effectiveness of most painkillers but also provides light stimulation, a mood boost, helps with anxiety, and concentration and does so without any kind of intoxication.\n\nAs a chiropractor, I see pain management patients several times a day and many of them are on opiate painkillers.  I hear their complaints about the side effects and how it loses its effectiveness overtime and their fears of addiction.  For all of these people, kratom provides them an option to treat their pain outside of this vicious circle our healthcare system as created.\n\nKratom has no risk of death, very little side effects, does not cause respiratory depression, and has not more intoxicating effect than a cup of coffee.  Scheduling kratom as a controlled substance is not only irresponsible but it goes against science which clearly shows that kratom does not pose the threat necessary to be added to that list.\n\nWithout kratom, my ex-husband and myself will be forced to return to opiate painkillers for relief.  When that happens, we will be on the road to tolerance and one or both of us will likely go to heroin to get the pain relief that we need.  When we do that, we risk our life every single time we use it.  What happens when our two daughters are left without parents because of a horrible decision by the government?  Who is going to explain why this happened to them?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12850","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ashley McDonald","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has got me off of alcohol and opioids and helps manage my back pain.

For a person who is struggling to stop using opiates and who has a desire to find a better way, I don't think there should be laws that restrict that person from tools like kratom that can assist in reclaiming one's life. Without legal kratom an opiate user would then be at the mercy of methadone clinics or other expensive and highly controlled pharmaceuticals often at the expense of the public health systems. We need to move towards individuals being responsible for themselves whenever possible and making kratom illegal is an unfair disadvantage for people who really need the help. I have seen addicts quit with only the desire to and the small help that kratom offers, just because jumping off cold turkey is scary as hell, and a thing like kratom is just as much a talisman for courage than it is some heavy drug that just replaces on addiction for another. Its addictive properties are very very minimal and ceasing kratom use is more on the order of obnoxious or frustrating, but nowhere near the nightmarish hellscape of opiate withdrawal.  It is mild, it is in the coffee bean family, and it does a vast public good when available. Ask us to be more responsible, and then do not take away the tools we need to be as such. Thank you.

The people who were supposedly killed by it all had other illicit substances in their system which is no doubt the actual culprit. Even if it had killed a thousand people, that is nothing in comparison to the deaths that opiates are responsible for each year.

I am a 26 year old man and I am chronic pain sufferer since the age of 15. For years I have gone to doctors for everything from pain killers to ptsd and everything in between. I've been on so many different kinds of pills from insomina, pain, anxiety, depression,  adhd, nerve damage, seizures, and ptsd, I'm surprised sometimes that I even make it through a day. What's my condition for all the visits and use of doctor prescribed pills? Child Abuse. Something I can't reverse. I have 3 bulging disks, pinched spinal nerve that causes phantom pains in my legs and feet and complete numbness of my lower half, hernia nerve damage that causes constant pain I'm my thighs and groin area, small fractures all throughout my spine, and I suffer anxiety, depression, and insomnia so horrendously that I'm agoraphobic. Psychiatrists, surgerons, doctors, and pain specialists have not bettered my life in anyway. What they have given me is more problems. Years and years of being prescribed hydrocodone and oxycodone I had developed an addiction that doctors kept calling a dependence. It wasn't going through withdrawal every month for 2weeks is not dependence its addiction. I overdosed a number of by accident, I've had so many reactions to certain pills, and I feel like a zombie all year long. It wasn't until one day through withdrawal and wanting to kick all my habits that I found Kratom. It was a prayer answered. Kratom took me out of withdrawal and into sobriety. It made me feel a happiness I hadn't known. The pain had finally become tolerable. And to my surprise it helped my depression, it lessened my anxiety, and it even helped with my insomnia. I get out of the house more. I can leave an our out of town. I can actually walk my dogs instead of being inside everyday. I feel like I can function where as prescibed pills nearly brought me to a path of illegal drugs, staying secluded, and near death. \n\nIf Kratom is taken from me, if I am forced back to that old life I was living for 11years, I will as so many others also will, I will helpless and hopeless. I will probably die from that life style again. A lifestyle of doctor visits every couple weeks, the looming fear of overdose, and relapsing into addiction. Keep Kratom Legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8677","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kratom Advocate","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As someone who has had a lifelong affliction with ADD and has used prescribed METHYLPHENIDATE (Ritalin) that resulted in experiencing discomforting adverse side effects from this drug while getting no relief, I affirm that KRATOM has been a godsend that brings relief for this terrible affliction.

The FDA and DEA should stand down and not interfere with one's personal choices on how they choose to self-medicate.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22928","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Weiss","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing the DEA in reference to Docket No. DEA-442W. I am a young man living in Pennsylvania. I have a history of\nhealth issues since birth and have had multiple abdominal surgeries. Recently, I have been hospitalized many times for small\nbowel obstructions and have been in the hospital at least a month and a half total in the last three years. Sometimes I experience\nsevere debilitating pain that prevents me from doing anything at all. In the past I have been prescribed pharmaceutical opiates\nlike Tramadol, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, etc. Because I have been hospitalized so much I have become tolerant of the low doses\nof these drugs. The only solution then for painkillers like these is to keep increasing the dose, but they are of course highly \naddictive, dangerous, and have powerful side effects. \n\nRecently, I discovered Kratom as I was searching for alternatives to pharmaceutical opioids to control my pain when I get it. To\nmy great joy Kratom has been wonderful in controlling my pain when I experience it. On top of that, I have noticed no side effects\nand have not noticed any addictive feelings. In my experience Kratom isn't dangerous at all. Its effects are mild at most. While I \nuse Kratom for pain control I know others use it for anxiety, depression, opiate withdrawal/getting off opiates, insomnia, PTSD, \netc. If Kratom is banned then I will have to go onto pharmaceutical opiates. That is the direct effect it will have on me. \n\nIf I had to guess I would say hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans use Kratom.

She told me to check out another friend and then we would chat. I looked at the other friend and she too was doing things unimaginable.

This in my opinion, a non-medical degreed one, is a serious mistake. I am sure there is pressure from pharma to stop people from medicating themselves for pain and depression or anxiety. What I have observed is that people are taking far more personal responsibility and learning more about there conditions than just taking whatever a doctor tells them and then complain about the side effects. \n\nI am seeing people across educational levels, across economic levels, across all age groups taking personal responsibility. The best thing about KRATOM, it is impossible to take too much, one just becomes physically ill. The anecdotal stories of deaths from this substance, are not JUST Kratom, but also combined with other meds, especially dextrometorophan. \n\nKratom needs to be left to the people, just like marijuana. Regulating Kratom will in the long run, end up the same way and you will have another long battle.

Humans have used its leaves as a mild analgesic and mild sedative for thousands of years in indigenous traditional cultures.  In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Americans have used Mitragyna speciosa either recreationally like coffee, or as an herbal remedy, similar to the herbs Piper methysticum (kava), Scutellaria baicalensis (skullcap), or Hypericum perforatum (St. Johns Wort).  Now, the DEA wants to include Mitragyna speciosa as a Schedule I Controlled Substance, which would transform hundreds of thousands of Americans into felons.  \n\nThe DEAs push to criminally prohibit Mitragyna speciosa will cost the agency legitimacy with the American public.  Hundreds of thousands of Americans have used Mitragyna speciosa and found it to be mild and harmless.  How will we react when the DEA declares Mitragyna speciosa to be in the same category as dangerous man-made compounds such as heroin?  The absurdity of the situation will lead us to determine that the DEA is operating without regard to basic facts, scientific evidence, common sense, or the interests of the American people. \n\nHospitalizations for Mitragyna speciosa pale in comparison to hospitalizations for coffee or energy drinks.  Clinical pharmacologist Megan Rech and four of her colleagues at the Loyola University Medical Center published a 2014 article in the journal Pharmacotherapy on Mitragyna speciose, finding: Serious toxicity is rare and usually involves relatively high doses (more than 15 g) or coingestants. Fatalities typically involve coingestants.\n\nA 2015 literature review in the International Journal of Legal Medicine offers a similar assessment. Kratom is considered minimally toxic, write Florida forensic scientist Marcus Warner and two co-authors, although they add that research evaluating its toxic effects on humans is limited, with the vast majority of studies involving animals. Warner et al. say withdrawal symptoms are generally nonexistent to mild, even for heavy users and note that two Florida counties have deemed kratom not ready for regulation due to the lack of information demonstrating the substance as being unsafe or hazardous.  Warner and his colleagues concur with Rech et al. that theres little evidence kratom is lethal by itself. Although death has been attributed to kratom use, they write, there is no solid evidence that kratom was the sole contributor to an individuals death. In most documented instances, mitragynine was detected in combination with other drugs.\n\nThe DEA should focus on man-made compounds that are actually killing people, particularly heroin and fentanyl.  Plants such as Mitragyna speciosa come from nature and have been used in traditional cultures for thousands of years.  Conflating plants with dangerous man-made opiates is disingenuous and is an abuse of the DEA's rule-making authority.  \n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22993","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adam Tomczik","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"                                 To whom it may concern,\n\n I have struggled with many things in my life.

It is my opinion that kratom can be used as a safer, plant-based alternative to many pharmaceuticals such as antidepressants and low-level painkillers. Also, I know several individuals who have used kratom to successfully end their dependence to prescription, or otherwise obtained, opioids and have experienced minimal withdrawals with no desire to return to the substance they were addicted to. Kratom can be a life-changing plant when  used medicinally. As someone who took prescription antidepressants for several years, I can confidently say that kratom is a safer alternative with less chance of abuse and/or addiction. Likewise, I strongly believe that kratom can be used to change the lives of those suffering from opioid addiction by helping them to get off of the drugs they are on. It is a safer alternative to many prescription drugs used to curb opiate withdrawals and desires in those suffering from addiction and trying to turn their lives around.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9256","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Grant Conner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern: \nI am a responsible adult & I take Kratom.

I am a father of two.  I work in logistics and nanocoating.  I don't believe placing  the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine into schedule 1 category is beneficial in any way at all. \n\nI was introduced to kratom through a work mate that recommended I try it instead of my prescription medicine.  It was terrible tasting and only helped slightly.  Of course,  I resumed my regular regimen.  Later I moved 1300 miles away and found myself out of medicine and no way to see a doctor, due to waiting on my records to get faxed over to my new doctor.  I tried EVERYTHING.  You name it,  I tried it.  Gabapentin, compounded back creams,  heat,  cold,  NSAIDS, etc. I didn't get a full nights sleep in three months,  until I found some kratom my friend had given me.  After finally being seen by a specialist,  I stopped my kratom usage with no side effects.  Almost a year ago,  the practice I was going to closed down suddenly.  My records are somewhere in a storage locker. I can't see another specialist without a doctor referral,  and I can't get a referral without my records.  I'm now stuck without proper treatment.  I have since only found partial relief from kratom.  It does not work as well as any medicine I've been prescribed, but still offers an inkling of relief.  I have stopped its use many times with no consequence,  aside from the pain returning full power.  I have not had any health concerns in my experience with kratom.  \n\nI think scheduling this dietary supplement in any way is more harmful to our community than beneficial.  If anything, an age restriction on purchase would be acceptable,   but not a law banning it. Please do not schedule the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20872","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sean Perry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI first learned about kratom less than 2 years ago, but when I did finally decide to try it, probably about 16 months ago, I was AMAZED at what it could do. For most of my adult life, I have had mild depression issues and general lack of energy and motivation, but for the last 3 or 4 years since I graduated college, it was much worse. I would say more than half of every week consisted of \"hard\" days, days that I had trouble getting up and wanting to do anything. This is especially a problem when being self employed as I am. Kratom, almost single handedly, fixed that problem and allowed me to get out of the rut I was in. \n\nI took kratom a few times when I first decided to try it, and was impressed with how well it relieved my depression and anxiety and gave me energy and focus. At the time, I compared it a little bit to coffee but way more effective and much better at relieving anxiety (coffee can do the opposite I find). About 7 months ago, I decided to start taking it on a more regular basis in order to get more stuff done. I would take about 3 grams everyday for 4 to 5 days in a row before I would take a small 2 days break in order to avoid building any tolerance to it. IT CHANGED EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE! I went from having a couple good days a week (days that I felt good and capable) to pretty much all good days with just a few exceptions some days. This not only allowed me to get way more work done from the increased energy and motivation, but it gave me a whole new perspective on everything and what I could achieve in my life. It made me feel incredibly powerful and motivated relative to how I had been living for the past few year. Honestly, I was a little upset that I hadn't discovered Kratom sooner, because I lost at least a couple years of my life to those \"bad\" days. \n\nIt has now been a couple months since I stopped taking Kratom regularly because I feel really great already without it. This is because Kratom allowed me to pull myself out of a hole I was in that just perpetuated itself. I COULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT MYSELF, believe me, I tried for nearly 3 years. I still take kratom on appropriate occasions, such as to relieve pain, which it is HIGHLY HIGHLY effective for, more so than anything else I've used, and when I have an espially long tedious task to do. I find it really great for manual labor and repetitive and tedious work. This is because it gives me a sense of well being no matter what I'm doing. \n\nA few more things I'd like to point out. I have NEVER taken kratom to \"get high.\" In fact, the small handful of times that I accidently took too much, I felt very tired and nauseous and was highly motivated to AVOID EVER DOING THAT AGAIN (taking too much). This has been the experience I've heard from EVERYBODY I know who uses kratom. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT to get \"high\" on kratom without feeling completely shitty. I think that's great built in defense against those who just want to abuse kratom. But you must also realize, those who want to abuse kratom are just people who will find something to abuse, or are already abusing opiates or something else. To those people, I would have to say that kratom is probably a much better alternative since they are going to use something anyway. There is no danger of overdosing on kratom because it does not cause respiratory depression and is not toxic at any reasonable dose. This may just be an opinion, but I feel 100% confident that none of the 15 deaths \"associated\" with kratom are actually a result of the kratom. Unless something is specially allergic to kratom, it alone cannot kill you.\n\nI'd also like to point out that I have never felt any sort of addiction towards kratom. I never felt dependent on it while I was using it regularly, and I had no problem at all when I stopped using it. I had no withdrawals or anything like that. But I also only used 3 grams a day, which is a pretty small amount, but not too small to have a amazing effect. \n\nThe last thing thing I would like to address is the insane opiate crisis we have right now in America. This is a statistic from the ASAM (American Sociaty of Addiction Medicine): \n\n\"Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the US, with 47,055 lethal drug overdoses in 2014. Opioid addiction is driving this epidemic, with 18,893 overdose deaths related to prescription pain relievers, and 10,574 overdose deaths related to heroin in 2014\" \n\nThat's almost 30,000 deaths in just one year from opiates, with nearly 19,000 from LEGAL PRESCRIPTION PAIN RELIEVERS! That's just ONE YEAR! And nobody has died from kratom alone in all of recorded history! There have only been 15 deaths that have some association with kratom, and in every one of these cases there was something else found in the person's system. You have to realize that if those people who died in 2014 would have known about kratom and would have taken that instead, they would all still be alive today.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18962","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Todd Holiday","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban kratom!

My name is Dale Profit, Im soon to be 50 years old and I currently reside in Caldwell, Idaho.  Yes, thats right the great state of Idaho.  Born and raised.  So I imagine you have the same image as most people.  Farms and ranches, mountains & streams, hunters and hikers.  Well, that pretty much sums up my life.  The rugged outdoors. I raised livestock, rode pens, buckarood and even tried my hand at saddle bronc riding in rodeos. Due to that up-bringing and lifestyle I have sustained numerous bone fractures & injuries.  So I guess I lived the simple life.  Only after numerous injures, some more severe than others.  Some requiring surgery, others casts, splints and such, but all of them required dealing with levels of pain on a daily basis.  \nSadly most every time I was prescribed pain medication.   I, like so many others, became addicted, it was quite frankly a double edged sword.  I needed the pills to function in my everyday life.  I was getting a prescription of a 120 Norcos a month, and to be honest, it was NOT enough.  I became addicted and sick.  I was sent to a pain management clinic, but was told its arthritis exercise and a life time of medication.  I developed high blood pressure, headaches, all requiring more medication.  If I didnt have the pain meds then Id have withdrawal symptoms.  A vicious cycle for sure.\nBut, three years ago, I discovered Kratom.  Finally a product that relieved my back pain to a tolerable level.  It wasnt mind altering and based on my own personal research, had little to no side effects.  Who would have thought after 30 years of pain?  I even talked to my physician about Kratom, who said he thought anything natural that would help, along with alleviate any long term side effects that the pain meds caused, he was all for it. \nChronic pain is tough enough, but addiction?  Its much worse.  When you take away the pain pills and leave me with withdrawals and then, still suffering from the chronic pain, how am I supposed to deal with that?  Thats why its so important that you understand how much Kratom has helped me.  Its not a quick fix its a daily regimen.  I would equate it to someone whos on a vitamin regimen.  My wife was diagnosed with a B-12 deficiency, so if she doesnt take her B-12 shes very ill.  Ive known people who have taken Saint Johns Warts for depression & anxiety, because pharmaceutical anti-depressants have far too many side effects. That is my plight with Kratom.  Without it, I am in constant and intolerable pain.  But with it, I am truly a functioning member of society, who has manageable pain levels without unnecessary side effects.\nPlease do not place Kratom as a Schedule 1 drug.  It saves far more lives than it is said to damage.  \n\nSincerely, \n\nDale E.

This is a decision that affects countless Americans, and should not be unilaterally made by the DEA. Their action would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions-- that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally--on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose. We cannot cut this research off at the knees.\n\nI discovered this incredible herb after  suffering a bad break in my knee in  2013. I was on prescription meds (Hydrocodone) for several months and I was looking for a safer, non-addictive alternative to ease the pain from the break (and accompanying osteoarthritis). Little did I know that it would have such an enormous benefit. You see, I also suffer from Crohns disease (since 1991). What I didnt expect from Kratom, on top of the moderate pain relief it offered me for my knee, was that my Crohns symptoms would almost disappear. This has changed my quality of life in an incredible way. I cant begin to describe how beneficial this has been for me over the last few years. I find that it is no more addicting than coffee (and is more gentle on my system). In addition, and through my experience with it, it is impossible to take too much (overdose).  At the most, it causes sleepiness and some nausea. It does not get you high. There is too much misinformation out there and this substance needs research and regulation, not banning.\n\nFor me, kratom is a much safer alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses. It has changed my life for the better. I fear making kratom a schedule 1 substance will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic (I believe this could lead some people back to illicit drug use). I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13688","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Susan Schreibe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 24 year old adult male currently living in the Pacific Northwest.

He then suddenly and wreckfully denied my refills and dismissed me from his practice. Leaving me to deal with the horrible withdrawals all on my own. No one would help. In fact I'm sure heroine addicts receive more and better help than I ever did. So I turned to kratom when I was at the end of my rope. I had done research on it prior to the withdrawals from my doctor prescribed opiates. As soon as it got here I ingested the amount suggested as to fight opiate withdrawals. It was incredible how well it worked! It helped me to stop taking opiates and to this day helps with my pain disorder when I need it. It would be a terrible idea to make this illegal. Especially in times where doctors are now abruptly stopping prescribing long term opiates to patients and not giving them anyway to deal with the terrible withdrawals. I'm not sure what would have happened to me had I not had kratom to ease me down from the nightmarish withdrawals.  Now I don't even need opiates because when my pain flares up I can simply have a drink of kratom and be fully functional again within an hour. It has given me my life back. It was the only thing that helped me in a time where no person would/could. Please think deeply about this issue before declaring it illegal. There will always be idiots out there that misuse anything they can get their hands on but you're not making pressurized spray cans illegal.

I am completely against the proposal to make Kratom a schedule 1 substance. I've been using Kratom since Fall of 2013 and have nothing but good things to say about it. \n\nWhen I was 16, I was involved in a boating accident which left me with a fractured vertebrae and a herniated disc (L5-S1). By the time I was 22, I had already endured countless treatments for my chronic pain including surgery (Lumbar Discectomy/Laminotomy). Though this fixed the mechanical problem in my back, I was left with considerable nerve pain. \n\nInitially, I relied on prescription pain medications to manage the pain, but eventually I was taken off them to prevent addiction. Without access to pain medication, I began self-medicating with alcohol. Over the course of about 5 years, I became an alcoholic. Alcohol was ruining my life in many ways. I was always either drunk or hungover, I gained approximately 60 lbs, and I was severely straining my marriage. \n\nIn the Fall of 2013, I was actually reading online trying to figure out a way to illegally buy narcotic pain medication when I stumbled upon Kratom. I read about people using it to treat pain, depression, anxiety, and even opiate withdrawal. I decided to try it. From the very first time I used Kratom, I was amazed at the effects. It reduced pain and inflammation better than any opiate pain medication I had ever used. Even more impressive was that I didn't feel like I was in a stupor like I did on pain medications. Over the last three years, I've never even had to increase my dosage to get the same effects and I've completely stopped drinking alcohol.\n\nNow here I am three years later facing the very real possibility that my miracle plant might be categorized in the same group as Heroin. This is insane. Kratom has made every aspect of my day-to-day life better. Everything from sitting at my desk at work to playing with my kids in the yard is more enjoyable as I'm less inhibited by my chronic pain.

A human will simply vomit if too much Kratom is ingested. Therefore, no human being has died from Kratom alone.     ALL reported instances of Kratom being detrimental to the human body are cases in which the human subject has other chemicals in the body. This fact cannot be disputed or used for bias or ignorant means. Moreover, this dietary suppliment aids thousands of Americans who need and rely on this supplement to function and carry out their duties as Americans including many veterans who have served bravely for our Glorious nation.

Scehdule 1 drugs are drugs that have no health benefits and are highly addicting.  Neither of these is true for kratom as a whole leaf supplement.  If physical additction does happen through long term consistent use, it is mild and results in a day of flu symptoms when people come off it.  It is very hard to overdose on, almost to the level of cannabis.  In addition, kratom has many positive and well recorded health benefits.  It has been used for a very long time in its area of origin to treat pain, pain killer addictions, anxiety and depression.  It is helping many people recover from narcotic addiction and to stay off of highly addicting, side effect ridden, narcotic pain medications.\n\nI have a personal story to share about kratom.  I suffer from many pain causing physical ailments like carpal tunnel, tarsal tunnel, bursitis, and a hiatal hernia among other things.  I also have bipolar 2 and anxiety.  Over the counter pain medications do absolutely nothing for my pain.  Getting narcotic medications which do help is close to impossible, due to the crack down on them, and they have nasty side effects I prefer to avoid. The medications available for anxiety have very bad side effects for me as well.  I live in California, so I do use cannabis for some of my symptoms, but the \"stoned\" effect makes dealing with my special needs children and just generally getting things done difficult.  \n\nI discovered kratom through an article I read online.  I then spent many hours researching it and reading articles written by people who use it.  I am very careful with my health.  I have no desire to take something that could make me worse and I tend to react in stange ways to medications.  I finally decided to try it, after discussing it with with a couple close friends and my husband and my mother-in-law (who both read the articles and are very careful about drugs).  \n\nKratom has very literally been a miracle for me.  I now have something I can take that will not only relieve my pain, but also helps with my anxiety and the depression side of my bipolar 2 without kicking me into hypomania and without leaving me \"stoned\" and with no energy.  I can focus and get things done without pain or negative thoughts.  The worst side effects I have personally gotten is a mild upset stomach and the jitters, but no worse than I get from too much strong coffee.  It has changed my life for the better in so many ways and, since there is a history of addiction my my family, it comforts me that it is highly unlikely I will become addicted.\n\nWhen I heard that the chemicals in kratom were going to be made, through an emergency declaration, into a Schedule 1 drug I was appalled!  I panicked because I might lose this herbal supplement that has solved so many problems for me and for no good reason. I quickly ordered a lot so that I would have some for awhile until I could find another alternative to constant pain or being \"stoned\" (I wasn't very hopeful).  I still can see no good reason for this to be even under discussion other than some company somewhere wanting to get it off the market to make their profits on side effect ridden pain killers go up. There are almost no negatives to kratom and so many positives.  From what I understand in the areas where it has been banned heroin use has gone up and I also heard that in its native area it was banned because it was cutting into illegal and legal drug sales.\n\nPlease do not make the massive mistake of classifying the chemicals in kratom as Schedule 1 drugs.  They are not even close to the definintion.  If you do this you will be stealing from people like me, who have so few options for reliable and safe pain relief, the one thing we have found that can actually help us.  You will be sentencing me to a life of pain again, like how I lived before I found kratom.  I never want to go back to that place.  Living with constant pain is an awful, draining, weakening thing.  It takes away from all aspects of life.  Please do not consciously choose to make all of us who depend on kratom for pain, anxiety and depression relief go back to struggling through each day.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nChristina Mulhall\n\nDocket No. DEA-442W","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3726","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christina Mulhall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"THIS IS NATURAL!

Kratom's multipurpose benefits work wonders for issues I have.  I cannot take opioids for my back pain, I get severe stomach problems.  Kratom completely alleviates my back irritation.  I also have clinically diagnosed anxiety.  The pharmaceuticals that were prescribed to me (I've tried Paxil, ability, Etc) also irritate my stomach and generally make me feel sick.  Kratom COMPLETELY alleviates my anxiety.  Thus kratom is essentially a wonder supplement for me, and thousands of other similar people. \nEconomically, it is much more affordable for me than even having to deal with expensive legal drugs that are more detrimental to one's health than kratom. \n\nI implore you to, instead of scheduling this amazing supplement the same as heroin, implement a 21 year old age restriction on it.  Allow adults to make responsible decisions for themselves.\n\nRead what professional botanists say about it.\n\nPlease help reconsider the scheduling of kratom.

I love this great nation. The military and VA have not always handled care properly and this plant Kratom is a way that thousands of veterans have been able to stop taking painkillers.\n\nMyself, I am on a drug called Suboxone and have been for almost 4 years now (so sad) I arrived  in Texas at a new duty station with no help, no doctors, no medication, with a severe opiate addiction from my prior duty station because the military handed out the painkillers like candy to keep us at work. I was directed to Suboxone and now have a pathway to be free from everything. many friends I know have gotten off of Suboxone with the help of Kratom. Many heroin users have done the same. \n\nTo ban this drug would be to shoot this great nation in the foot as you would have an epidemic on our hands like never seen before. Currently there is a death every 19 seconds due to drugs and overdoses with prescription painkillers and heroin. Banning or taking away Kratom will only push those people back into the dark. Banning this plant will put many people back on pills and medicines like Suboxone, which can do good as long as you arent being given it long-term.\n\nWe deserve better, \n\nAs a soldier who was Honorably Retired medically at 80% I deserve better.\n\nIts time we face this issue, the first step is looking into this more together without ripping it away from our hands.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMantford Sturgill","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12180","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mantford Sturgill","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I first tried kratom 4 months ago for the first time. Before that I never heard anything about it. I have been out of the military for 3 years and have been going to the VA for my daily medications. The medications i was receiving were for anti anxiety, pain, and muscle relaxers. These Drugs only took the edge off of my pain without providing complete relief. Unable to find relief from doctors and unwilling to be prescribed a higher dose, I came across a western Chinese medicine book. I started trying out herbs and reading up on how they all work with the body and best ways to help my personal problem out. After trying out plenty of anti inflammatory, pain killers herbs, and even went out of state to try cbd and thc, I was un able to find relief so i am able to work normally. Soon after a friend had me try kratom. My first experience I took 2 grams of powered kratom tree and found complete relief with added benefits of stimulation, and uplift in my overall attitude. After doing some research on readit, I found out it is apart of the coffee family and can help with depression and anxiety as well as chronic pain. Its been about 4 months now of continued use and only once did I over do it to the point were just my stomach was upset and i threw up, nothing more serious then that. Other then that 1 time I have successfully been self medicating myself responsibly only to achieve pain relief as well as anxiety relief. The added side effects of kratom are very plesent and only made my mood more productive and make me feel good throughout my work day. It has helped me and all the people around me that i have introduced to kratom. Most unable to be prescribed medication or even afford it, now able to self medicate at a very cheap and easy process.

I want to leave the subjective and anecdotal effects out of the equation. Some people find cigarettes euphoric, and others find them repulsive. The capacity of a compound to induce habituation is irrelevant to me from a legislative standpoint. You, the reader, may not be libertarian. You may feel it is your duty to legislate what the citizens of a government put in to their body. While I would disagree with you, there are factual reasons that kratom (m. speciosa) should not be prohibited. Its inability to consistently produce central nervous system depression makes the drug an anomaly for its mechanism of action. On top of this, the Thai FDA proposed to legalize the compound because if its recognition as a medicine, most notably a pain killer. It is important to consider the current opioid epidemic and the role kratom plays in it, especially for maintenance. I fear that there will be a surge in opioid use by people kratom for maintenance, and the people who can no longer access kratom could turn to deadly compounds and we may see a rise in deaths. This makes the DEAs attempt to ban kratom unethical at best, and deadly at worst. I spoke to Senator Joe Donnelly in regards to this, and will continue to reach out to representatives in all areas of government to just simply request that they make sane decisions and not criminalize a non-violent percentage of our population that are less likely to endanger themselves imminently than tired drivers,","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8798","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tyler Pittman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Charlotte Davidson I am going to be 73 in February.

I was desperately trying to stop taking prescription painkillers so I decided to try it. Kratom absolutely saved my life! It helps with the pain and, for me, 100% stoped withdrawal symptoms from prescription drugs. What it DOESN'T do is just as important, it doesn't make me \"high\" or \"out of it\". When I take Kratom it has the same effect as if I were to drink a cup of coffee. Because of Kratom, I've not taken a prescription painkiller in over a year. My injuries are getting better each day because with Kratom I have the energy to workout and take care of my physical health. PLEASE do not ban this plant or schedule it as a \"drug\". Kratom has been and still is one of the best supplements I've ever taken with zero bad side effects or negative health problems. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my short note.

I suffer from chronic pain partially from moderate to severe Kyphosis which causes spasm's in my thoracic region whenever I use my hands and arms for any amount of time. I also have a fusion in my lumbar between at my L5-S1 vertebrae from a car accident. Since the car accident in 2011 I had no choice but to take prescription painkillers. They cut the edge but always seemed to never be enough. As my tolerance seemed to grow at an exponential amount. \nBeing a father of 4 it was hard having such a life changing event take place. The opiates I would take would put me on a roller coaster effect giving me some days that I felt like Superman and would end up hurting myself trying to do more. The opiates also would do nothing for my spasms in my thoracic region, having to plug myself into a wall attached to an I.F. unit. The kratom kicks in faster and keeps my thoracic region from spasming. Which no amount of Norco or Percocet would touch. With kratom I am able to keep a stable therapeutic level, and not have to worry about poisoning myself if I need to take an extra dose. I have been taking it for 3 years, in the beginning I would take more when I weened myself off of Percocet.  Now I take about 4 grams 4-6 times a day. It also helped me to learn my physical capabilities, as I am able to make dinner for my family 6-7 days a week now. When on opiates alone I was only able to make dinner 2-3 times a week.  Another benefit is I am not having narcoleptic like attacks when I am driving or every time I sit down. I am here for my children now. Which is a serious blessing.  The kratom also has helped my rectal problems. Helping me to stay regular and helped me get off of heart burn medication/P.P.I.'s which had started to deplete my potassium and other mineral levels. My wife Thanks God every day that I have found a healthier alternative to the prescriptions I was taking that had some value but kept me unpredictable.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1183","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeremiah Hurja","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think that Kratom should be legal.

I searched for a natural alternative to perscription pain drugs, as I did not want the huge problems associated with pharmaceuticals. I was PLEASANTLY surprised to find Kratom (my miracle herb) and how well it consistantly worked.The only problem I found with Kratom was the irregularity of potency through vendors. It was hard to get old growth mature herb amid a quickly rising popularity. Kratom allows me to continue working hard, like I need to, as retirement might be an impossibility in my life. Needless to say, without the herb, or addicted to drugs would make my life extremely difficult to support my family. God bless the herb that has helped mankind for millennia. An interesting note to behold is the fact that Kratom has a built in overdose mechanism. Take a little too much, and you get a headache, dizziness, googly eyes and an awful sick feeling that would cause you to lay down and not move till it wears down!! Take the right amount and you can function and operate like a young healthy person. PLEASE !! DO NOT TAKE AWAY the only safe treatment for my aging predicament. prescription pain medication is being removed from our availability, which would leave me where in the work world? The pain is bad enough to feel hopeless with no relief. If there's an alternative to Kratom, you might outlaw it soon enough also.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20911","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Rodrigues","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have dealt with depression and anxiety since a child.

I've been on many pharmaceutical pain medication, even heavy duty narcotics to try and relieve my pain. At my wits end, I researched Kratom and decided to give it a try. Within the first two weeks of using Kratom, I noticed that my migraines were becoming less and less. If I did have a migraine during the day, Kratom would relive the pain and I wouldn't have to take my heavier meds. After 3 years now of taking Kratom, my headaches average about ONE per month! (If that!) I'm also happy to say that I no longer have to take narcotic pain medication just to help relieve my migraines. Not only does Kratom help with the pain, but it prevents my migraines and also lifts my spirits. People tell me that it's all in my head, but I know my body and the pattern of my migraines and Kratom really has been a lifesaver. Being only 37, I wasn't ready to live a life of pain and medication that made me feel awful. I would be distraught if I wasn't able to use the one thing that's helped me overcome my intense and horrific weekly migraines. Kratom is not dangerous or bad for a person.

I am against the proposed  DEA scheduling of kratom as a scheduled substance.  Let it be known I'm the type that hates even taking otc pain killer's let alone prescribed narcotics. My story behind kratom began with a family member with chronic back pain introducing, or better yet trying to.. introduce me to kratom as an alternative to the 6 plus Alive I was consuming daily to help with leg pain and fatigue I experienced at work. I was skeptical at first, being someone who hates the feeling of being \"drugged\" I even convinced myself the first few doses that I felt nothing until that one special day I finally got it right. I felt amazing, no pain, no anxiety, no drugged up feeling. It was like taking a Claritin for allergies, 100% clarity without the benadryl lethargic, tired feeling, but with an added and completely unexpected side effect. Just an over all feeling of motivation and non jittery energy, unlike energy drinks or other supplements just focus, no pain, and great energy. I never want to work another shift without it. Downside is I have been so reluctant in life to try anything new let alone seeing a doctor to be prescribed something I more than likely wouldn't take that I only tried and truly started to believe in kratom as late as September 2016.. Only a short time before the proposal to ban kratom came into affect. I didn't hop on a band wagon, I didn't buy into any hype.

Despite the limited amount of scientific research, I would like to point out the potential for relevance in medicine considering US Patent US3324111 A, held by SMITHKLINE BECKMAN CORPORATION, originally Smith Kline & French Laboratories.  The patent states Kratom's potential for medical use from \"a crystalline alkaloid produced from leaves of Mitragyrva speciosa, a plant of the Rubiaceae family. This alkaloid has useful pharmacodynamic activity, particularly analgetic and antitussive activity.\" The \"crystalline alkaloid of this invention is an orally effective analgetic and antitussive agent as shown by animal experimentation.\" The data here points to strong potential for medical use, which is in line with the thousands of firsthand accounts from users of kratom.  \n\nThe second condition to meet Schedule 1 states \"high potential for abuse,\" putting this in the same category as heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), to name a few.  These drugs have widely circulated as recreational drugs, proving them to warrant this classification, as well as undergone rigorous research to prove the lack of medical relevance.  It is not as though Kratom has been unavailable for a similar timeframe, in fact kratom has been available and used as far back as 1846.  Considering the long term availability, and how few accounts of abuse are documented for Kratom, it seems perhaps it is one of the least abused available products.  This suggests Kratom actually has a very low potential for abuse and is important as an herbal medication to users who choose it over other (and more harmful) medications such as Tylenol.  One study reported an average of 44,000 emergency room related overdoses from Acetaminophen each year1 and results in an average of 460 deaths annually, compared to a total of 660 emergency room visits from Kratom over a 5 year period, which averages to 132 per year and has resulted on ZERO related deaths.  With Acetamenophen being an over-the-counter, widely available medication, it seems a drastic move to place Kratom into the strictest scheduling.\n\nIn summary, not only does the preliminary research on kratom suggest significant medical benefit and a low potential for abuse, the body of research needed to prove any medical or abusive risk is lacking in this respect.  The strictest scheduling of this drug will cease all current research on the substance, halting any progress made in the understanding of its uses and risks.\n\n1.

I was more productive at work and a much more engaged with my family (not stealing from them and reminding them how much you love and appreciate them goes a long way). \n\nI recently lost my job in the construction industry do to work being slow. In the past this would have absolutely devastated me, completely destroying the small amount of self-confidence that I had. But thanks to kratom I was able to look at this as a challenge opposed to a life ruining circumstance. I hit the job lines and took interviews and am proud to say I started my new job last sunday. Without kratom to aid me I would have almost definitely gone back to sulking in my house and being a drain on my family, instead of the positive influence I am today.\n\nI was very distressed to hear about the possible scheduling of this amazing plant, it has been nothing but a positive in mine and my families life. I haven't taken a single terrible pain pill since I found this plant and I don't ever want to go back to them. I am gainfully employed and a loving family member I owe a lot of me turning my life around to kratom. Please read this and understand the harm this would cause me and everyone in my life, let alone all the other people who this plant has positively influence.\n\nWith love,\n\nEric Von Aesch","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11067","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Von Aesch","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 41 year old female. I work as a library clerical in elementary schools and am a full time graduate student of library science. I've been using Kratom for about 5 years. I found out about Kratom through a search online about natural anxiety and pain relief. I originally ordered Kratom online and found it very helpful so I started buying it from local retailers. In 5 years of use, I have never felt that I was addicted to Kratom. I would, however, be devasted by the DEA placing this on the schedule 1 list of drugs. Kratom is no more powerful than coffee but works in a different way. My life would be severely hindered by a ban on Kratom and how would my children be affected if their mother 1. cannot function due to pain or anxiety 2. if I was to have the substance on me go to jail and be classified in the same criminal matter as someone who is carrying cocaine. I have never been impaired from taking Kratom, in fact the substance would make me sick if I took to much. This ban could potentially affect my life everyday and anyone who has ever ingested this plant knows how completely ridiculous this is! Please please consider all the people who are benefiting each day from this plant. I live in a city where heroin and methamphetamines run rampit and I know that if Kratom is banned there are so many addicts who not only won't have the hope of recovery without this substance but will otherwise die from drug overdoses. We don't need more pharmaceuticals pushed in the market because they ruin lives and Kratom saves lives. It really saves lives everyday.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1171","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laura Quick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a sufferer of MS I have constant nerve pain and have been searching for an alternative to the addictive drugs prescribed for pain.

My friend recommended it to me and it quickly became my saving grace for a few other reasons. \n\nDuring this time I was a stay-at- home mom with my low-functioning autistic two year old daughter. Everyday when my husband left for work I would often feel stress and anxiety because of all the daunting work that desperately needed to be done with my daughter. The Kratom I noticed was providing me with a very natural and clean feeling, positive energy to move forward and work with my daughter on all the numerous therapies and skills that she was behind on. At the time she was completely non-verbal and did not acknowledge toys or dolls; literally all she wanted to do was scoop and pour dry beans. \n\nThe Kratom gave me the strength, energy and creativity to come up with different games, ideas, tasks, etc to work with her. It was a very lonely and difficult time but I truly feel like it was the Kratom that helped turn me into super mom. I could maintain a level of patience that is almost physically impossible. I could smile when I wanted to cry. I could pick her up when my wrist told me not to which I simply had to do sometimes. I could chase her when she would randomly run towards the street. I could go on but it seemed like every step of every day, it was helping me to keep it all together. \n\nNow I can proudly report that my daughter is communicating on a much higher level of functionality and enjoying school with the possibility of being in a mainstream classroom next year; a dream that almost felt impossible a few years ago. Though my daughter and I worked extremely hard, I truly believe it was that simple Asian plant, Kratom, that made all the difference because without it I would not have been able to work and push as hard as I did.

I understand that drugs can cause major problems and you people have devoted yout lives to cleaning up the mess. And In my opinion, the DEA is not my enemy. However, i must object to the scheduling of kratom. I am currently working on a degree that will place me in the law enforcement field, and as a future law enforcment official, i beg you to reconsider. Here is why:\n\nI will be honest with you: at one point in time i struggled with alcohol. I was quickly headed towards alcoholism and kept making increasingly poor choices, ultimately culminating in a DUI. It was one of the lowest points in my life. I drank to deal with my anxiety, which i have struggled with my whole life. I also drank to get to sleep at night because often times it was the only way to calm my racing mind. Fortunetaly, i made the choice to clean up my act, and on the road to recovery were many things: counsling, friends family, and kratom.\n\n I honestly do find that kratom is able to keep me away from liqour and has improved my quality of life significantly. In the past hear i have been using kratom, i have gotten a promotion at work, began feeling healthier, and most imlortantly gone back to school to complete my bachalors degree in a law enforcment field. I find that a small dose of kratom is able to calm me down when stress gets to be overwhelming and is able to help me sleep. That is it. I experience no high or euphoria from it. I do not get inebriated. It is simply a herb that helps me be a better person. The alprazolam that i was prescribed to fight anxiety only made me feel like i was walking through a fog after a six pack of beer. It didnt allow me to complete my homework or wake up for work on time. Kratom does not have any of these negative side effects but still contains all of the positive.\n\n\nI was very surprised to hear about this effort to illegalize kratom. I have never thought of myself as a criminal, and i hope and pray that the scheduling of kratom does not make me one.  As a future law enforcment official to another: i urge you to reconsider. Without kratom i am afraid i will be pushed back into drinking, and that is the last thing i want. I cant stress enough that i do have respect for what you guys do. You are not my enemy, and i shouldnt be yours.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17912","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Reed Peterson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My husband and I have been using Kratom instead of toxic addictive pharmaceuticals for at least 4 years.

Kratom is non-addictive (there are zero physical or mental cravings) and can be taken as needed to relieve any symptoms without any harmful side effects, unlike addictive pharmaceuticals.  Kratom is also a healthier option instead of using Advil or Tylenol, which is harmful over time when used to treat constant pain.

As adults we should be able to decide how we would like to treat our bodies without government interference.

I am a coal miner from Fayette The County, Pennsylvania. I became acquainted with Mitragyna speciosa - also known as Kratom- a leaf cultivated and indigenous to South East Asia when my cousin started drinking the tea form for symptoms of PTSD that had disabled her for over seven years. I am commenting here believing that my words will be read and considered. \n\nWhat I mean by my cousin's symptoms being disabling is that she had become unable to hold a job, cooperate in meaningful relationships and developed a quality of life that was detrimental to her health and distressing to both herself and the many people who loved her. She worked very hard to find relief with traditional methods, such as therapy and psychotropic medication, to no avail even though she was very proactive in trying to get better. About a year ago she discovered Kratom tea. Although we were all very skeptical it turned out to give her tremendous relief. She now works. She no longer receives disability benefits. She is once again an active and loving daughter, cousin, friend and citizen. She is also falling in love with who we all have reason to believe will be her husband - this is no small thing.  The positive effects of this tea has been an answer to prayer. \n\nIt is for these reasons, and the lack of a scientific basis for the allegation that Kratom is dangerous that I am against the scheduling of Kratom. The undiscovered possibilities for this plant are too important and should be studied scientifically. I live in a county that once was a hub of coal mining activity. Now that the coal mining industry has all but disappeared, the people of this area are turning more and more to drugs and it is a terrible thing. I believe if it wasn't for Kratom, my beautiful cousin would have either died or turned to street drugs in desperation. I am thankful to God that she found Kratom. Taking this harmless medicinal substance away from people who depend on it is sinister and cruel. I expect that the DEA will remember whose interests they serve and make  the right decision not to schedule  Mitragyna speciosa.

I am VERY THANKFUL to the DEA for withdrawing the notice of intent to temporarily place mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (kratom) into Schedule I. I believe the original basis for listing kratom was very flawed and am very thankful the DEA has reconsidered. For the reasons I mention below the DEA's withdrawal of the NOI has allowed me to avoid a horrific decision. I am not going to get into why I think the proposed basis for scheduling was flawed. Many articles and comments have been written and submitted explaining the reasons why the listing proposal was flawed. I am simply writing as a very concerned citizen whose life will be severely impacted if kratom were to be scheduled and to state that kratom has been of medical value to me with no ill effects. I am a 60 year old executive with annual earnings exceeding $250,000. I am not a user of any illegal drugs. I have done nothing but work hard my entire life and obeyed all laws. Five years ago I discovered kratom and it has greatly enhanced the quality of my life. I have used 50 grams of crushed kratom leaf from a very reputable online provider weekly ever since. I have never increased my dosage nor ever suffered any adverse effects. I ceased using Kratom as a precautionary measure as I did with all legal supplements I was taking based on the advice of my physician for two weeks prior to prostate cancer surgery with zero withdrawal symptoms. I have dealt with depression my entire life. I have been on antidepressants and am currently on an antidepressant but nothing brought significant relief. Kratom is a godsend in the way it lifts my mood and allows me to be a fully functional individual and maintain my job. Kratom is also miraculous for me in the way it helps me get through social anxiety situations. Kratom has changed my life for the better and I cannot imagine life without it. If the DEA were to schedule kratom I would be faced with a decision that is unimaginable to me. I would have to choose between becoming a criminal simply because I possess this plant or I will have to give up kratom which I simply cannot fathom because it will make my life much worse. Please do not put me in this situation. I know there are 10s or 100s of thousands of law abiding Americans that will also face this horrible decision if Kratom were to be scheduled.

If you examine the cases reported where people have been harmed you will see that there were other factors that were to blame and not the Kratom itself. \n \n I was a functional binge alcoholic for many years, beginning when I was 15 years old up until the time I was 30. I would drink just about every day after work and on Weekends. It cost me my relationships, my family and prevented me from ever moving up in any of my jobs.\n\nAbout 5 years ago a friend of mine introduced me to Kratom. He was a frequent drinking partner and it was beginning to cause problems for him as well.  While in Asia for work he had been introduced to Kratom as a natural drink for pain relief. It worked so well he did research on it and then he learned that people in Asia have been using it for over a 1000 years to treat different ailments including opiate withdrawal and alcoholism.\n\nI tried everything for 15 years to stop drinking and my other self destructive behaviors, counseling, rehab, interventions, prescription drugs, medical help, and nothing worked. I would always return to drinking . \n\nI take Kratom Twice a day. One teaspoon in the morning with my coffee @ 5am and one teaspoon in  the afternoon with lunch @ noon. I function perfectly and the effects are so subtle I cannot even feel them. All I know is that my mood is pleasant, I no longer get anxiety and I am now active in my 9 year old daughters life.\n\nMy cravings for alcohol are gone. I can go to bars and restaurants with friends and family and socialize with no issues and I am still able to socialize and interact normally. Without Kratom If I set foot in a place that served alcohol, especially in a social setting, drinks would most surely follow.  Kratom has allowed me to start a business, get my priorities straight fix my financial issues and I credit it 100% with my successes over the last few years.  My biggest regret in regards to Kratom is not finding it before my daughter and her mom left me because we would still be together. I have my daughter on the weekends and her mom often tells me that I am now the man she always wished I would become. (unfortunately while I was finding myself she re-married) \n\nThere is another benefit that deserves mentioning. In addition to ending cravings for alcohol my cravings for cigarettes are gone as well. I feel like there is one negative side effect that I should mention. I have gained about 20 pounds since I started taking Kratom which I cant seem to loose even though I live an otherwise active and healthy life. I went from 180 to ~200 pounds at 5 foot 10 inches. I am not sure if this is because I eat more now that I dont smoke or if this is a natural part of aging now that I have fallen into a routine and no longer run around all night. \n\nIn closing. Kratom is a wonderful herbal solution for people that actually works. For my sake and the countless others who have and will use Kratom to fight there addictions leave Kratom as it is. Let us have this remedy and continue to live productive lives for our families friends and communities.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1624","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Not only is this herbal medicine beneficial to many of our citizens.

I ruined family and friends relationships. My life was also in financial ruin. At the age of 26, I joined a 2-year rehab facility. Once completed, I immediately moved from Ocean Springs, MS to Columbus, OH. Here I had the heavy support of family. I also met my wife. As soon as I moved to Columbus, I started from at a community college and transferred directly to Franklin University where I will be graduating with a Business/Marketing BA in May of 2017. During my time in college, I picked up a part-time job at a local deli. After I met my wife, we needed more money to share expenses. So, I took over full-time management at the deli and was almost immediately given the title of General Manager and I helped to build a new deli location across town. Now I was in school full-time and also salaried 50 hours a week, all the while trying to plan a wedding. Needless to say, my stress in my personal life was too much and I started using opiates again. I only used opiates for a 1 month period, but the addiction had gained enough ground that I could not just simply stop without having to quit my job and drop out of school. I just happened to live near a methadone clinic. I joined the methadone clinic for over a year. I lowered my dose to a very small amount, then I moved to a suboxone doctor. This was supposed to be a low dose to help me finish the progress I had already made by tapering down from the methadone. Well, suboxone doctors are not geared that way. Whether they think they no better, or they simply just want more money, it was impossible for me to have a voice in my treatment. I quickly learned that suboxone was causing more harm than the methadone was. I completely lost my sex drive, my energy was depleted, depression set in, and it was far more expensive. Since the doctor would not respect my wishes, I began looking for alternatives. This is when I learned about Kratom from online forums. I searched my city and was disappointed that it was sold in local head shops. It gave me the impression that it must have been another one of those synthetic drugs that just had not become illegal yet. I still gave it a shot because I was desperate. I went home and tried it. It certainly was not comparable to any type of \"high\" or opiate that I had tried. But, I felt It helped to give me the confidence and the energy I needed to kick the doctor out of my life, which I did. Many people say that they use Kratom and they see no withdrawal symptoms. This was not true for me. But, like I said, It helped more than any other solution I have tried from the Pharma companies. I could have saved myself 2 years of grief if I had learned of this plant sooner. As far a regulation, I am aware personally of any negative effects. However, just to error on the side of caution, I do believe that individuals should be 21 years of age before purchasing this product. When I was in high school, it was much easier to buy Marijuana than Alcohol. That's true for many people I have spoken too. So, if you are worried about children, that's the best bet. One last note, I have been suboxone free for only 3 months now. My life is back on track and I owe it all to Kratom. Please, do not ban kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4349","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/other/kratom-leaves.html\n\nwww.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/10/19/is-kratom-the-plant-that-heals-or-kills/benefits-of-kratom-are-more-legitimate-than-the-fears\n\nhttps://redice.tv/news/kratom-the-miracle-healing-herb","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22495","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jay Crew","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nMy name is Alex Kogan.

I have two children and have managed a large animal practice for over 20 years. In my early twenties I was diagnosed with a form of genetic lupus. By my early thirties they thought I had Lyme's disease but it turned out the lupus was getting much worse. After going to doctor after doctor and trying everything under the sun for pain management including pain pills. I began to try and seek out a non-habit-forming natural way to try and help relieve my pain. This is when I stumbled across kratom. Since starting Kratom my life as instantly changed. The exhaustion joint stiffness and pain that is associated with autoimmune disorder has greatly been reduced by kratom. It has helped me with my ability to work and has also greatly help me with having energy for my children. I have been using Kratom for over 8 years and can say with 100% certainty that it is by no means a drug deserving to be banned or addictive. I hope that you will have the foresight to understand that making this unavailable to people will be a tremendous disservice. You will be sending many people back to square one who had found relief in kratom. People who are hardworking and have families and morals. I know my life will definitely change without it.

Back to the revolving door at the clinic, or to the black market where there's dirty,DEADLY,chemicals coming into the USA legally,which would be a better place to start better enforcement IMO,instead of going after safer natural supplements (I cannot comprehend that).\n\nMost importantly,my Father fought for my RIGHT to have the freedom to use these God given plants/herbs. To chose that over man made pills is my right,and that is what I'm fighting to protect now. I'm not saying it cures anything and it may not work for everyone,but my Dr. knows I supplement with kratom,she knows it helps me.She knows I'm not having to ask her for norco as much now tbat you,the DEA tell her not to give me any more because I don't have cancer. So then what are our choices if we can't have pain meds. OR natural supplements?? This is wrong. Please realize how banning kratom will hurt people that can't wait for a 2 year study. That WILL do more harm than good. Let's work together to keep kratom safe and available for all who chose it. As far as this nonsense about it being a high, I live in Washington state,if I wanted to get high I could get some legal marijuana right down the road. I want to function,kratom helps me do that WITHOUT all the side effects.\n\nThank you for hearing us, Please do the right thing for the people. We are already hurting and or sick,we want this stressful fight behind us so we can move forward with bettering our lives and our children's lives.\n\nSincerely,\nAngela Lawler","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8599","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Angela Lawler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"DEA is a CRIMINAL ENTITY created to steal taxes, steal freedom, imprison & guarantee PROFIT for criminals.\nThe \"war on drugs\" is a multi BILLION $$$ SCAM!\nDISBAND THE DEA. \nDECRIMINALIZE ALL DRUGS.\nSpend the money to treat & educate.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16466","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jayne Douglas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"When doctors could give no help for my chronic pain, other than high doses of prescription drugs that turned me into a non-functional zombie, I thought all hope for me having a life was gone.

But to take Kratom away from those of us informed adults who use it wisely and benefit greatly from it is beyond cruel and completely wrong! Alcohol and Cigarettes harm and kill millions of people every year and have absolutely no medical purpose, yet those are allowed in our nation. To ban Kratom would prove the DEA does not care about people at all, but only cares about the bank accounts of people who make and sell prescription drugs that have horrible side affects, and the makers of alcohol and cigarettes.

I am also a recovering alcoholic and someone who suffers with bouts of debilitating depression and anxiety. Since I discovered Kratom three years ago my quality of life and overall level of functioning has significantly improved. Believe me, I have tried the gamut of psychopharmacological options over the years with no relief. In fact, I found the side effects, withdrawal symptoms, and addiction potential to be much greater among benzodiazepines and antidepressants as compared to Kratom. Unlike sedating drugs like alcohol or Xanax, Kratom (even in large doses) has not caused me to have memory problems, respiratory depression, impaired motor skills, or impaired decision making. I can take it when I need it and stop when I don't. Stopping completely after prolonged use has resulted in minor withdrawl symptoms on par with quitting caffeine, while taking too much at once has resulted in only temporary stomach upset.\n\nKratom has helped to virtually eliminate my urges to drink alcohol. I am no longer crippled by social anxiety and I actually look forward to the day ahead of me when I wake up in the morning. All this is a result of my hard work in improving my lifestyle choices and the wonders of this herbal supplement. Contrary to many of the false claims made in the media, there is no intoxicating euphoria associated with Kratom; only a relatively mild lift in my mood and a boost in my overall sense of well-being. \n\nShould I chose to continue to consume Kratom following this hastily proposed ban, the police will be forced to convict me as they would a heroin addict. There are literally thousands of other hard working, contributing members of society like me out there that stand to potentially lose everything by being branded as illicit, drug-abusing, criminals. A ban on Kratom would surely result in a sad continuation of a long list of failed drug policies in the US, much like we have seen with marijuana prohibition and the over-prescription of opiates within the medical community. I urge you to look deep into your conscience, withdraw this proposed ban, and allow this plant to be utilized as the miraculous herbal supplement that it is. Take a step back and truly appreciate the magnitude and impact this decision will have on the lives of people like myself. Don't allow them to turn me into a criminal overnight.

I am 36 years old, a college graduate (Biology), and I recently suffered a traumatic injury that rendered me disabled. Before the injury, I had always been a productive member of society. I always maintained full-time employment, donated my free time to many volunteer organizations, and remained active in my civic duties. \n\nI am vehemently opposed to the DEA and FDA seeking to list Kratom and it's active alkaloids as  Schedule 1 substances! This natural plant has been used safely for thousands of years by the people of South East Asia,  and more recently, by millions of people around the world. The DEA, recklessly and without forethought, tried to place Kratom under an \"emergency Schedule 1 listing\" back in September, claiming that it was \"an imminent threat\" to the people of the US. The people of this country (myself included) rallied in the thousands to make absolutely sure they did not get away with this. The DEA has done absolutely no research or studies to back up their claims. All of their data was incredibly false and seemed to be collected by searching for \"Kratom\" on Google. I hate to think about the same type of people, who would make such unfounded claims, as being in charge of positions in our government that are supposed to be looking out for our best interests. The claims of deaths attributed to Kratom usage were erroneous and always described people using Kratom w/ other deadly drugs in their systems. No deaths, ZERO, have been reported/attributed to Kratom alone in the thousands of years it has been used by humans. The supposed jump in Kratom related calls to poison control centers are completely insignificant when compared to the number of calls received daily from things like Tylenol, alcohol, and especially prescription opiates. All of these substances are legal, yet cause hundreds or thousands of deaths each year! It makes me suspect that there must be some other agendas behind the push to ban the safe and effective use of Kratom.\n\nI have used Kratom here and there for nearly two decades. I recently began to use it on a  regular basis after my accident in March 2016. Since my accident, I have suffered from  constant, severe, and debilitating pain in my right arm, hand, leg, and foot. Doctors have tried to prescribe me all sorts of synthetic drugs to try and quell the pain, but none of them have helped and have left me with severe side effects. I choose not to take any prescription opiate medications because of the severe risk of addiction and the first-hand knowledge of the horrible consequences it can cause to the people who are prescribed them. If you are looking for an \"imminent threat\", go after the doctors and pharmaceutical companies which are legally pushing these deadly substances on the American people! Kratom has naturally helped relieve my pain, with absolutely no side effects what so ever. It has allowed me to focus on my physical/occupational therapies. And I have been able to make significant progress in my rehabilitation! My doctors have been amazed by the speed of my recovery, and I have told them about my use of Kratom. They are behind me 100% in my usage of this safe alternative to pharmaceutical pain medications, and have begun to research the benefits themselves. I have been able to use Kratom daily without the build-up in tolerance that is commonly attributed to opiates. And I am also able to stop taking Kratom at any time, without going through any sort of withdrawal effects besides the return of my pain. Kratom does not cause any respiratory depression, which is the leading cause of overdose deaths from pharmaceutical opiates. \n\nI think our government would be making an incredibly huge mistake by making Kratom illegal! Doing so would cause so many users to fall into the use of legal and illegal substances, which cause so much harm to people already, in a search to relieve the pain, anxiety, and addictions that plague them. I suspect a rapid increase in crime and overdoses from other deadly substances if our government decides to go through with the ban of Kratom.  I am worried about the prospect of losing the ONE thing that has helped me relieve the pain from my injuries! I I sincerely hope that the DEA and FDA do some actual research into this plant and come to the same conclusion as the millions of Kratom users around the world. There are so many greater threats to our society that need the attention of our government. Do not take away the right for people to safely use Kratom!\n\nThank you for listening to the public outcry over an emergency ban of Kratom, and allowing this comment period! I hope the DEA and FDA do what is right, and continue to allow the safe use of Kratom by the people!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6425","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Micah Doughty","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Why punish chronic pain patients who now have a viable alternative to opiates with little risk to themselves?

I had read about kratom and decided to try it because it is more of a natural herb vs all the medications I was already taking. Kratom really helped me a lot! Before I tried it I was tossing and turning most nights and was not able to fall asleep due to my jumpy legs and plus I had anxiety all day long. Kratom really helped settle my nervous system down and relax my mind so I could sleep. I generally use a few tsp a day and mix it with juice. I feel Alert and energized while using white leaf kratom and relaxed and mellow with red leaf kratom. There are no real after effects with kratom. If you take too much then you either throw it up or take a long nap. I have not had any issues while using kratom. Normally, I spend about $30 a month for it.

This supplement has allowed me to completely give up drinking.  I don't take this to get high.  I take it every evening around 5 or 6.  The same time I usually started drinking.  It gives a slight calming feeling, which has allowed me to give up drinking.  Please do not ban this product.  I am quite certain, that if this product is banned, I would go back to drinking 4-6 drinks a night.  I am sure that 4-6 drinks a night is worse for a person than a leaf supplement.

I am a 48 year old mother of four. Kratom helped me break free from the grip of opiods back in 2009. In desperation unable and unwilling to subject myself to inpatient detox I found out about Kratom through a google search and lots of subsequent personal research. Kratom did not cure my addiction issues but allowed me to stop taking the large quantity of opiates my body had come to rely on without trading that addiction from one substance to another as in suboxone treatment. It permitted me to continue to work, be an active Mother and productive member if society, while having a clear head for the first time in years. I utilized Kratom as a tool and ceased its' use within a short period of time. My story doesn't end there. Addiction as we know is a disease. And as previous stated Kratom is not a cure but an effective tool to mitigate the horrible physical dependency of opiates. Several years went by while i tried to address the underlying issues that added to my genetic predisposition to addiction. I sought the help of multiple psychiatrists. Was diagnosed with untreated and unresolved trauma from being sexually abused as a child. Accepted that i also had Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety and followed doctors orders. I tried dozens (literally) of different antidepressants and anti anxiety medications as well as different combinations of said medications. Utilized talk therapy in addition to drug therapy. I never once during that time had a symptom free day. I had plenty of drug induced thoughts and my depression deepened. As i struggled with depression and anxiety, my addictive personality led me to begin self medicating for relief of my symptoms. I drove into alcoholism and a new habit for the benzodiazepines from my doctor. Here i sat struggling, miserable, sad and unproductive, lost and without hope. I had to do something this was no way to live. I was unable to care for myself let alone my children or perform the duties my job in property management. In 2012 i hit rock bottom again and Ceased all medications prescribed to me. Stopped drinking and began working a 12 step program. I patiently awaited for my brain chemistry to return to its' normal state after spending years putting all my hopes into the pharmaceuticals my doctor prescribed.  I thought i was going to have to learn to live with my deep depression and ever growing anxiety. I stopped working, lost friendships, and became a shut-in to reduce the severe anxiety. I spent four years as a prisoner to my symptoms. Then in one of the numerous searches for a natural alternative to the mind numbing and addictive pharmaceuticals i had been prescribed, i remembered my experience with Kratom. During my previous use and cessation of Kratom earlier in my life i knew it was mood lifting and also not habit forming. I started researching its' effectiveness in helping with depression snd anxiety. While i had struggled to stop using alcohol, benzodiazepines, antidepressants as well as opiates during my life, i hadn't struggled to stop taking Kratom. It never once made me fuzzy headed , dopey or drunk. It only provided relief. So in 2016 i began using Kratom again as a way to mitigate the symptoms of my depression and now severe anxiety. Within a short time i was able to live a productive and happy life. Rejoining society and filled with hope for the future. I am now Relatively free of the symptoms of depression and anxiety. There is plenty of good science out there that supports my points and experiences. Taking Kratom off the market and placing it on the list of scheduled drugs will be detrimental for me as well as others. I will not return to a life of dependency be it pharmaceuticals or alcohol. So my life without Kratom will result in a return of my depression and anxiety symptoms. A lonely isolated life filled without hope. Please do not change the legality and availability of Kratom. While i fear for myself i also fear for others whose lives have been improved by this non-addictive and benign plant. Thank you for taking the time to read my story.

I believe there is very little evidence to support a ban on this substance. \n\n \n\nFor centuries, kratom has used in Thailand and in the last few decades it has become known to people around the world, including to millions of users in the United States.  It is a mild substance with minimal side effects.  It's is known to be only very mildly addictive and have nearly inconsequential withdraw symptoms, especially compared to those who are suffering opioid withdraws.  I mention this because kratom is used by some who are suffering opioid withdraws.  In the United States, we have a serious problem with opioid addiction and it seems to me that if there is anything that can help, such as kratom, it is worth keeping around, perhaps even promoting.  Besides, if kratom were truly a dangerous drug, there would have been reporting on it years ago.  We all know there is significant risks posed by \"spice\", or synthetic marijuana.  Spice has been reported on frequently by news outlets because there are serious, deadly risks.  Coverage of kratom in the media is almost unheard of because there isn't anything negative coming from its use.  \n\n \n\nPublic support for the War On Drugs (WOD) is at an all-time low.  States all around the country are passing laws legalizing marijuana.  In many ways, this is because the WOD very unpopular and perceived to be unjust.  Adding another fairly innocuous substance to the WOD does not make any sense.  The last thing we need right now is to be filling our prisons with kratom users who are not causing anyone any harm.  Please do not ban kratom.\n\n \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19777","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Pasko","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I listened to Joe Rogan Podcast and learned of all the benefits said about Kratom.

ADD, Migraines, and general tension headaches have also been diagnosed in my family. You could say I'm genetically hardwired/predisposed to Mental disorders and related issues.  \n\nUnfortunately I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder - With the possibility of Bipolar Disorder and Attention Deficit Disorder at the age of sixteen. However, issues had been noted as young as eight when I was placed in 'play' groups to help overcome my anxiety. \n\nThe disorders quickly became increasingly disabling and I was later diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after experiencing traumatic events over a four year period in my early twenties. I was suicidal, had trouble with sleep, drank too much alcohol, and self harmed (cutting and bruising). I had been unable to work or go to school since I was eighteen. I was nearly homeless on several occasions. \n\nMedically I've tried just about everything to overcome and cope with my disorders. I went through a long list of anti-depressants, mood stabilizers (e.g. Venlafaxine, Seroquel, Paroxetine, Fluoxetine, Lithium, Vaproate, etc.), and therapy (e.g. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Exposure Therapy, Relaxation Techniques, Group Therapy). Nothing was helping and I was becoming desperate. \n\nA year or so ago, in my desperation, I was looking online for other options. I found out about Kratom and after doing my research I purchased some from a reputable vendor online. Kratom has completely turned my life around. I take one gram of white veined Kratom in the morning by placing the powder on my tongue using a spoon and washing it down with juice. It has a very subtle effect that starts to kick in about fifteen minutes after. At night I take one to two grams of red veined Kratom which helps me sleep. I do this every day although I have gone a week or two without or a day or two here and there without issue. \n\nThe effect of Kratom on me is subtle, kind of like drinking a strong cup of coffee. The white veined kratom gives me better focus, energy, but most importantly a sense of calm wellbeing/contentment without the zombie feeling antidepressants tend to give. Red veined gives me that same sense of calm but makes me sleepy instead of energetic. It does not give a high it's more like it stabilizes me. The couple of times I took slightly too much I felt like vomiting. I can't imagine anyone could overdose on Kratom because of that.\n\nSince I started taking Kratom I've been able to work, enjoy my hobbies again, and attend social events. It makes me feel normal and I can finally live my life as a productive member of society. I believe that banning Kratom would take me back to the way I was before and that idea terrifies me because I don't think I could do that again. I think I would stop trying. \n\nI don't think the ban is warranted because the effect is milder than alcohol and the antidepressants I took before. It doesn't affect capability or productivity negatively (in fact it has the opposite effect). The change has made a huge difference in my life and has benefitted me enormously, in a medical sense. I'm no longer anxious all the time, not constantly depressed, it helps with muscle pain from stress, I get less migraines, I feel calm but productive, I sleep better. I wouldn't say it's a cure but it is the best medication I've tried and the only one that really made a difference without a disabling effect. \n\nI am 100% against the ban. I find the claims that Kratom on its own is deadly hard to believe. I think the evidence for it is lacking. Kratom should be studied more because I believe it could help millions in a safer way than a lot of other medications currently do. If it were to be banned it would be too hard for those studies to be done. I also believe that banning it would cause the deaths of more people than it claims to safe and cause the suffering of thousands of people, without good reason. The current reasons given are inadequate and not properly supported by evidence. \n\nI do support some regulation to ensure quality and that the Kratom is unadulterated; some oversight would be preferable, provided there won't be a huge increase in cost. Kratom should remain affordable and accessible. It's a natural plant and the pharmaceutical companies should not be allowed to patent it to make a profit and decrease accessibility. I don't see a need for going  through a doctor to obtain Kratom because it's just too mild to be necessary. It would be like going to the doctor to get a Red Bull, unnecessary. Better labeling would be nice however. \n\nI would like to say to those who support the ban to try a gram of Kratom for themselves before judging. You'll see how harmless and mild this medication truly is. Thank you for reading.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2203","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Hazel T","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am an InfoSec professional who regularly collaborates with law enforcement as a part of investigating cyber crimes.

The effects of Kratom, unlike drugs of abuse in the often-compared opiate class, are mild, and the euphoria of the drug, if experienced at all, is very limited even in first time users.  Additionally consuming excessive amounts leads to nausea and worse feelings; that is, it is a self-limiting substance much like caffeine.  Just like it does not make one feel a cocaine rush to consume 20 cups of coffee in rapid succession, consuming tens of grams of Kratom will not result in an heroin-like high but, on the contrary, nausea and discomfort (not death mind you -- please refer to the scientific literature for overdose characteristics).  As such Kratom needs no additional law enforcement to limit its use in adults because it limits its own consumption, much like coffee.\n\nIn addition to the simple fact people enjoy taking Kratom for the clarity of thought and the peaceful feelings it imparts without physical impairment, it can unfortunately be addictive.  I attest to this reality, but the level of addiction and subsequent withdrawals if one stops taking it, are relatively minor for the vast majority of users as compared to hard drugs. There are other ways Kratom can actually even help society.\n\nOpiates, for example, do endanger the lives of people who become addicted to them, and that is sad.  However, even here Kratom has a use: it provides a way for people so entrapped by the cycle of opiate abuse to get off those drugs or greatly reduce their use and, thus, reduce the harm even death they can pose to the abuser.  Kratom does this by helping curb the strong and horrifically painful withdrawals that opiate abusers feel when they are getting off their dope without having to shame or suffering the stigma of getting outside help.  It empowers people to fix themselves while not spending tax dollars or wasting the limited time of our policemen and women doing other jobs, the judicial system's available time, and jail's limited space.\n\nAdditionally Kratom can help people, such as the elderly and our vets who bravely served our country so we may enjoy its freedoms, who deal with pain daily by providing a way out of opiate use, thereby reducing the strain our healthcare system must endure for more risky treatments such as opiate prescription, treatments that render the user less mentally acute to enjoy life and work.  \n\nSo my experience has shown me the simple truth that Kratom has a medicinal use and overall strongly benefits society, not harms it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8161","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Roger Hofer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom tea goes hand in hand with a cup of my morning coffee.

I do not do work that demands from my body, I have had too many injuries over life that wouldnt allow it anyway. I spent 15 years in a domestic violence marriage, 12 years in the nursing field and recently had a not-at-fault collision where my GMC Suburban was totaled. You know how hard it is to total a Suburban? This accident resulted in two surgeries for my injuries. \n\nI like so many others have discovered Kratom to be a legitimate source of pain relief. I recently ended my contract with a local pain manager, a Physicians Assistant at a clinic in Coos Bay, OR. After a period of almost a year, I didnt want to continue with the Opiate therapy I was on. I was prescribed Norco 5/325 (hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen), 1 tablet every six hours for pain. Thats 120 tablets in a 30 day period. Thats a lot of Norco that also describes my pain level. Thats a lot of pain. \n\nAmong my diagnoses, the ones that give me daily pains are:\nSpondylosis with myelopathy or radiculopathy, cervical region. I have had the surgical option to repair this and it will not progress further (the damage) but there is damage that remains and will not regenerate to a point of no pain. \nThoracic back pain. Due to 12 years in the nursing field. \nComplete tendon tears of the left rotator cuff (its been repaired twice, failed.)\nAdditionally in all I have had 16 separate surgeries over my lifetime, nothing chronic, just life. \n\nPlease, I am begging you to keep Kratom available to the community of our country. Do what you must to monitor, but this is truly a safe alternative to the narcotics prescribed to us by our medical experts. I love my doctors for treating me to the best of their abilities and thank my country for all the exceptional levels of care available to me, but I need Kratom. With Kratom I am in NO danger of an accidental overdose. I am in no additional danger of other health problems arising out of using narcotics. I am terrified of using narcotics because of the danger they hold, to my physical health, my mental and emotional health. \n\nI work in the medical industry and I know the opiate abuses that are plaguing our communities. Kratom is not the enemy here. Opiates are. This is not an opiate. \nThank you for your time to read my story.\n\nSincerest regards\nValerie Palmer \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7247","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Valerie Palmer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have talked to heroin addicts who say Kratom helps with withdrawal & cutting down.

I went to my Dr. and for years, we've tried every SSRI, MAOI, anti-anxiety medicine but because I also have extreme OCD and ADD, the depression and anxiety only got worse to a level of was introduced to Kratom from a friend as I suffer from severe depressions and anxiety attacks and I've involuntary anxiety attacks so bad, they froze me.  It was determined that I also suffered severe abandonment issues and PTSD.  We have tried numerous prescription SSRIs, MAOIs for years which can damage my liver and other organs, or cause cancer, anti-anxiety medications that can affect my CNS negatively as well.  Since I need my Central Nervous System to carry out my job as an artisan, the prescription medications I have taken I simply do not trust.  I was introduced to Kratom from a friend that was suffering severe pain from stage 4 cancer and on patches of morphine. She started using Kratom for her pain and depression and she found she didn't need morphine.  She talked with her Dr and even he recommended trying natural herbs. The DEA has already made painkillers (low-level) like 5 mg/350 APAP hydrocodone nearly impossible to get even for chronic sufferers.  She found information about Kratom, tried it and it worked!  Since I started Kratom myself to help me sleep as I have severe restless leg syndrome and anxiety, I have not had one outbreak of anxiety or prolonged depression.  For the first time in years, I can sleep normal hours.  I'm at the age right now, I need 8 hours or diseases start to take hold more and more.  I now can focus on doing work to pay my bills.  The DEA with no real empirical data aside from less than 661 cases to the PCC of nausea, dizziness or less than 30 deaths over the years and I believe internationally were most likely not investigated properly for the causes of death. Probably resulting from allergic reaction, combination of drugs, alcohol, and Kratom including 9 of the deaths listed in Denmark due to a very dangerous concomitant combination of SSRIs combined with Tramadol causing Serotonin Syndrome which can lead to death. The 660 calls over 5 years to the PCC, compared to over 100 calls per day of children drinking detergent does not even warrant concern and hardly is a reason for a drug of concern; I feel The DEA led by acting head Chuck Rosenberg who was an FBI director is clearly over-reacting to just a leaf that has been used safely for over 1000 years in Asia with no recorded serious side effects.  Just because we live in a western society doesn't mean we are any better at recording data as physicians and healers have done in Asia for centuries.  Kratom is safe, safer than caffeine or sugar, fat, chocolate, salt all can lead to a fatty liver or alcohol that leads to 175,000 cases of cirrhosis with only a 5 year survival rate.  What if peanuts suddenly came onto the scene and over 150-200 deaths per year, peanuts would beat out Kratom 10-1 in danger to the general populace.  With that reasoning, then ban all sugar, (high fructose corn syrup), salt, fats, meats, processed foods, hormone injected chickens and GMO's.  Cigarettes and chewing tobacco lead to millions of cases of cancer yearly and is still legal.  So enter Kratom, a safe leaf, an herb that you can brew into a tea, that has proven medicinal record from millions of pain killing, anti-anxiety, anti-depression and even safe opiate and heroin withdrawal properties, and suddenly it's dangerous to America. Plus in 2014, out of concern that America is \"addicted\" to pain killers, the rescheduling from III to II makes getting opiates near impossible from a Doctor, heroine and crime skyrocketed including homicides. The FDA and DEA made matters worse wit the rescheduling and now Kratom is known to help opiate or heroin addicts kick their addiction far more safely and quicker than suboxone or methadone. So we have a miracle plant leaf that can literally solve huge problems with little money, a lot less agony and pain, depression and anxiety relief; which has led many Americans to wonder and suspect the DEA being \"influenced\" by the big pharmaceutical company(s) that might see Kratom as a serious threat to a multi-billion dollar industry with it's efficacy and safety versus synthetic, manufactured and highly dangerous drugs for many requiring doctors to monitor liver and kidney blood results from the ingestion of various pharmaceutical drugs that are given to millions per day.  Americans will not stand by after they have lost so much, almost everything only to see another safe, God-given plant demonized for the sake of greed. The DEA is over-reacting when there is heroin, crack, cocaine, meth, bath salts, synthetic marijuana and God knows what else, but Kratom is hardly a concern even for a mild nausea.  I think a 1000 year history of healthy use speaks for itself.

I have not taken opiates since I got on kratom, and last month (3 months after first time), I am off kratom as well, with almost no withdrawal symptoms.

I'd like to voice my opposition to the DEAs Intent to Schedule the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, which would make Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa), a schedule 1 controlled substance with \"no medicinal value\". This would put kratom on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin, despite the fact that it is a plant that's helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has been very promising and positive.\nMitragyna Speciosa is truly a life-saving plant. Humans have been benefiting from it for millennia, and Americans have for decades. I personally suffer from depression, anxiety, and back pain. I've had these conditions all of my adult life, and have tried prescription medications (antidepressants and painkillers) but they were terribly addictive or altered my mind in a really negative way.

I'm asking you to please stop the ban, or at the very least help us to reach some kind of compromise (age limit, regulated as an herbal supplement, or a situation similar to kava kava, for example).

With the help of Kratom, I have been drug free for approximately 89 weeks.  \n\nI didn't come across Kratom until August of 2016.  I was beginning to have cravings for Opiates, but a friend introduced me to Kratom.  I don't have any cravings when I'm on Kratom.\n\nI am a project manager for a major construction general contractor so I have a large number of responsibilities that are very time sensitive and determine how millions of dollars are spent.  I was under a great deal of stress before I started taking Kratom.  I sleep much better now, I have more energy throughout the day, I get more accomplished, my mood is more balanced and elevated, and most important to me, I don't crave opiates. (I actually don't drink alcohol anymore or crave alcohol as a result of starting to use Kratom).\n\nThe dose size I take is approximately 2 grams of powdered leaf in an 8oz glass of room temperature water.  I drink this mixture when I wake up, another around lunch, one in the afternoon for a boost to finish the day, and one final dose at dinner to wind down.  The feeling I get is balanced, clear, and relaxed.  I think the energy I feel is a product of this clear feeling because I take a dose in the evening and I sleep great.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13002","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"George McDowell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It would be very unethical to ban or limit the production of a natural supplement such as kratom without thorough research as to its effectiveness and potential side effects.

While mitraginine and \n7-hydroxymitragynine can be habit forming, building up a physical dependence on the substances is very difficult. In addition, for those who have managed to become dependent, withdrawal is in no way as disruptive to one's well-being and ability to function normally as the class of drugs they are normally compared to, opioids, and can be managed via tapering off of the substances without much difficulty. \n\nIn terms of positive effects that this substance can bring, it has been widely praised as a natural solution for chronic pain management, which is a boon considering the prescription opioid crisis in the United States. Any potentially less harmful and disruptive alternatives to prescription opioid pain relievers is a big plus. In addition, many people who have developed a physical dependence to opioids, either prescription and street varieties, have been able to successfully use mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine  to cease use of opioids without the need for going through the horrible symptoms normally associated with opioid withdrawal.\n\nLastly, and with the positives previously outlined in mind, keeping mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine legal allows for taxation of kratom and its derivatives, and regulation of the industry as a whole. While I'm not certain that scheduling these substances will create the same kind of black market that other scheduled substances have (owing to the generally mild effects of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine), scheduling them seems to be akin to throwing the baby out with the bathwater.\n\nPlease reconsider placing mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, and the plants in which they naturally occur, in schedule 1. The magnitude of their effects are not consistent with the other substances in schedule 1. They have highly positive effects for the vast majority of people using them. And finally, the negatives associated with other schedule 1 substances, such as highly disruptive withdrawal symptoms, possible long term harm or death resulting from overdose, or habituation leading to difficulties maintaining a normal work or home life, are simply not there for these substances. Placing them into schedule 1 is vastly unfair and shortsighted, considering their benefits.

I have never even tried the substance, but I have read about and heard nothing but wonderful testimonies in its favor.
