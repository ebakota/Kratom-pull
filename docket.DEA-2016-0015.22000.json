I have been using kratom on and off for over a year now. I began taking kratom after suffering an injury that occurred after I was hit by a car on my bicycle. My injury was not in any way severe, however I was in a substantial amount of pain and was not able to take time away from work. I refused prescription painkillers in the hospital as I am a recovering addict of opioid drugs. The benefits of the plant did not end at easing my pain and helping me continue to work. I have ADHD and having decided to not take prescription amphetamines for the aforementioned reason, I found that the kratom helped me tremendously with keeping my focus on important, but sometimes monotonous tasks and helped with sustaining my sometimes overactive mind. \nKratom is not a deadly drug, nor is it any more addictive than coffee. Labeling it as a Schedule 1 \nSubstance is highly unnecessary and unwarranted and I believe that such a legislation would cause more harm than good.

The discovery of Kratom has absolutely changed and enhanced my life ! I use it as needed when I am suffering from the pain of a pinched  occipital nerve and when I get headaches and I no longer miss days out of each month from work ! I have been able to achieve SO MUCH more in life without having to worry about whether or not I would hurt myself if I take a commission job or worrying if I will get a migraine when I have art show deadlines looming. Kratom is an absolute blessing and I would be beyond devastated if it were no longer legal & would be forced back to nauseating , dangerous pharmaceuticals which honestly never helped me much anyway . Sometimes in the passed it even seemed like the prescriptions my doctors gave me were causing me even more pain and inflammation . If you have ever injured your neck / back you may know where I am coming from. Kratom is a natural plant with medicinal healing properties . It seems so strange that in the era of medicinal marijuana laws passing (even here in Florida !!) that anyone would be contemplating outlawing another natural substance. Shouldn't we be passed this stage of uneducated dictatorship ? I believe Kratom should be studied and tested AT LEAST before banning it with no real cause . It may have the potential of addiction but jeez look at Alcohol , totally legal and literally kills many people each and every day ! I have read that there are only a couple of deaths associated with Kratom and that every victim was also found to be on other drugs , namely prescription medications which have also proven to take lives daily. I myself have lost several childhood friends and family members  to drugs / alcohol- how is that all legal ?! I hope and prey you will all make the right choice & not outlaw this miracle herb. What would be next , kava ? Turmeric ? Lemon Balm ? I use all of these herbs as needed and would be a mess without them some days . Please keep Kratom legal and devote any energy involving it to learning more about it and insuring distributors are trust worthy .

I am commenting to state how much kratom has helped my life. Starting three years ago I began down a spiral of multiple surgeries on both my kidneys, ovaries, and feet. To this day I have had 23. For a long time I took the prescriptions my doctor's gave me.  After awhile though those took a toll, I either felt like a zombie or I developed multiple ulcers. So I started looking for another way. I do not like smoking pot, so while that is a legal option where I live it is not an option for me personally. Finally I tried Bali Kratom. It has changed my life. It helps my pain, it helps my mood, I don't feel like a zombie, it has changed so much for me. I no longer have to take prescription medications, and I even went for a seven miles walk yesterday. For me that is major. That is me getting my life back. I am hoping that you will see the difference this plant can make. It's helped given me my life back.

Chronic pain from herniated discs, sciatica, arthritis and migraines used to rule my life.  Working was impossible.   I could not sit or stand for periods longer than 5 to 10 minutes.   So my life running an animal hospital was over.   I couldn't carry my baby.   There were days I couldn't get out of bed.    I was irritable all the time.   I was on Percocet , cyclobenzaprine and ibuprofen (which really messed my stomach up).  I had also been on Lyrica and Toprimate.  I felt like my brain was gone. Then I was introduced to Kratom. I no longer need any of the medications. Not even ibuprofen and my pain was gone.  6 years my family and I dealt with my chronic pain.  Now my life is pain free.  I have my brain back.  We've started a farm and I have a job.  I get to be with my family.  I get to hold my baby. I get to have fun with my teens.  Before Kratom my life was miserable.  With Kratom I am happy, healthy and productive.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8290","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Patricia Laracuente","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 43 year old husband, father, combat veteran and proud American. I went to college on a football scholarship to Wofford College, made All-American, then enlisted in the Air Force. I served for 10 years as a Special Operations Combat Controller, and was part of the initial  push in Iraq as well as serving in Africa, and other parts of Southwest Asia.I still serve the military as a civilian contractor.\n\nDue to my background  in sports and in military service, I suffer from a variety of ailments that cause me daily pain. I also have anxiety problems that make day to day life difficult. When I went to the VA for help, I was prescribed 240 Lortabs per month. These were sent to me in the mail, with only a cursory doctor visit every 6 months. The pills did help, both with the pain and the anxiety, but I quickly became dependent on them. They also made me sluggish, withdrawn, and generally apathetic about everything in my life.\n\nI was shown to be developing liver damage from the tylenol in the pills, and when I spoke to my doctor about the fact that I felt unable to cope with the pills and their high potential for abuse, he simply cut my dose down to 1/3 of the original amount and left me to sink or swim, while making me feel like a bad person for abusing the pills they had given me. \n\nIt was like giving a child a knife, getting angry at it for cutting itself, and then refusing the treat the wound because it was the child's fault.\n\nMy wife, who also suffers chronic pain from a car accident, was concerned about my health and mental state, so she went looking for alternatives. She discovered kratom.\n\nI was highly skeptical that anything legal and natural could actual help me when the pills the professional medical community gave me did not, but I was desperate and willing to try anything.\n\nI was amazed at what a difference kratom made for me in a very short time. It lowered my dangerously high blood pressure, it helped bring my pain down to a manageable level, and enabled me to perform better at my physically demanding job. It improved my anxiety greatly and brought me out of the isolated fog the narcotic painkillers had left me in for years. I became a better employee, a better husband, and most importantly a better and more engaged father to my children. I love having the will and energy and clear-headedness to play and laugh with them and enjoy them while they are young.\n\nI am beyond angry to hear that the government I have worked for and served now wants to take this safe, natural and life-saving plant away from me. I do not want to go back to destroying my health with opiate painkillers, nor am I willing to risk my livelihood & family's safety to continue to use a product that has gone from safe botanical extract to schedule one drug overnight. My other option is living in excruciating pain, letting my anxiety control my life and limit what I can do, and watching my blood pressure skyrocket again, probably leading to an early grave.\n\nI know you have the power to stop this short-sighted action that does not benefit \"we the people\" in any way. Please take steps to stop this ban now.\n\nThank you for your time & service to this great nation.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1031","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sean McGinley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I respectfully request that you NOT ban Kratom for the following reasons:\n\n1) Banning Kratom expands the war on drugs which is a complete failure and the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\n\n2) If Kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and be under the threat of being locked up behind bars for using this plant to help alleviate their pain.\n\n3) Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports Kratom's potential as a pain \nreliever and opioid replacement.\n\n4) Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to Kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising \nscientific studies on Kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down by making it a scheduled \nsubstance.\n\n5) The side effects of Kratom are minimal and its symptoms upon stopping its use are inconsequential compared to \nthe suffering of the withdrawal of people trying to quit opioids.\n\n6) Prohibiting Kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose which has now become an \nepidemic.\n\nPlease do not make Kratom a scheduled drug.

I'm going to make this short and sweet.  I started using Kratom about 3 years ago after becoming addicted to very strong opiates (morphine, hydrocodone, etc.).  I had no where else to turn and I was badly hooked on the prescription drugs, and I was about to get married and start a family.  So, with the help of Kratom I was able to ease the withdrawal symptoms of the heavier opiates, and I have been able to system my abstinence from those heavier drugs for a few years now all because of this natural plant.   Please take a look at the scientific research.  I would say that ANYBODY that has died or gotten into trouble with this plant, has also had OTHER substances in their system.  Kratom is not the root of any serious medical issues.  It's been used for thousands of years in Thailand.  It is natural, and there are so many people I know who are in a similar situation.  One of my best friends was literally a heroin addict, and now he has a cup of this natural tea once a day.  VERY FEW people actually end up abusing it, and the people that do are the addictive personalities who abuse EVERYTHING such as coffee, soda, cigarettes, etc.  Nicotine is addictive.   Tobacco is addictive.  Alcohol is addictive and how many people die per year as a DIRECT result of alcohol, yet that is still legal.  Kratom is FAR less dangerous than alcohol and SO MANY people have used it to become healthier.  \n\nI beg you, PLEASE do not take away our right to this natural plant.  Again, I think you so much for your willingness to read my note.\n\nAll the best to you.  I hope that you AT LEAST allow more time for scientists to do more research.   I say this because if they do determine definitively that it is NOT dangerous, and that it is extremely helpful for all kinds of ailments, then it would be such a wonderful option for so many people in this country rather than stronger and more seriously addictive and dangerous substances.  By making it schedule one you would be eliminating the OPTION for this research to be done, so it's basically not even giving the natural plant a CHANCE.  The people of this country deserve access to this natural plant.

Previously, I could not hold down long-time employment due to opiate abuse (spurred on by a prescription from my doctor) and depression (due to my addiction). The first time I ever tried kratom, I never touched another pill in my life- not even a Motrin (and I had attempted sobriety many times prior with zero success).  And now here I am, several promotions later, happy, and climbing my ladder to success both at work and in life.  \n\nKratom, which has a side effect comparable to coffee, was not a 'legal high' for me- it was simply a plant that helped me achieve my goal of staying sober.  Kratom gave me the energy and determination I needed to help me wake up in the morning and go to work without completely hating myself and focusing all of my attention on where to find the next 80mg Oxycontin to numb my life away and destroy my body.  Within one week of using kratom and not abusing prescription drugs, I was completely sober and suddenly happy and able to live my life comfortably.  No more addiction, no more depression.  Zero negative side effects from kratom.  And that was a decade ago.  Ive taken kratom here and there ever since and never have had a negative or dangerous side effect. \n\nIn conjunction with my own positive thought and ambition to become sober and happy, this simple tea leaf was very useful in helping me overcome my addiction and depression.  Kratom has never killed anyone, and the very few rumored reports that say it has all involved people who were also taking unsafe 'drugs' in conjunction (a simple Google search brings up credible sources debunking kratom deaths).  With so few calls to poison control, and millions of people speaking out in favor of this plant, it's not logical to ban this plant or schedule it.    \n\nIn a day and age where the people have made it clear that they want to be 'free' in the 'land of the free' to use whatever plants, herbs and teas they choose (cannabis, kratom, ginseng, etc.), it is a gigantic step backwards to spend precious time, energy and tax money to ban and/or schedule a plant.  If this decision goes through, the USA will truly be on the wrong side of history.  The citizens of this country are well aware that the war on drugs has been an epic failure - banning substances simply does not work (we have known this since alcohol prohibition), it only makes criminals out of non-violent people and opens up a black market that could be dangerous. Millions of people are speaking out that they want this plant to remain unscheduled.  This is the 'land of the free' - how can we call ourselves that with a straight face while we are busy banning plants and not listening to the people?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4528","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lana LaCanfora","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 27 year old man with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology with minors in Biology and Chemistry. I'd like to share my personal opinion regarding the DEA proposal on kratom.\nI oppose the DEA's proposal to put alkaloids found in kratom on the list of banned schedule 1 controlled substances. \nI started using kratom tea 3 years ago. Today I feel that this is an herb that helped me lead a better life. I have issues with pain and chronic fatigue and at times find it hard to have energy to work and lead a good, productive life. Most people drink coffee for energy, but I find coffee to be too strong - it makes me too stimulated and anxious. Kratom, however, feels milder and helps me get through the day started without all that. \nI also found that it helps my pain without side effects that I experience with OTC NSAIDs. As for scheduled prescription drugs, I've been prescribed opioids for impacted wisdom teeth and they were very strong. They had some side effects: they clouded my mind and had a powerful effect on my body. Kratom, on the other hand, doesn't feel to me like that drug, it's rather like a mild herbal tea that helps me feel  better without a strong effect on my body and without the above mentioned side effects. It doesn't at all feel to me like a scheduled medication, I'd rather compare it to helpful unscheduled herbs like ginseng, valerian root, ashwagandha and other such common supplements.\nWhen I took a full blood check and physical after using kratom regularly for about 2 years, my lab results were quite healthy.\nI find DEA's proposal to label kratom as a schedule 1 substance to be unfounded by evidence. DEA stated that there have been only 30 deaths involving kratom reported and confirmed. They were usually cases involving coingestants, such as very strong drugs (fentanyl, an opioid many times more potent than heroin, was one). It cannot be assumed that kratom was to blame for the deaths when such powerful substances were involved as well. 88,000 deaths a year are attributed to alcohol (according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention government website, http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm ), and NSAID's such as ibuprofen and aspirin are blamed for 16,500 deaths per year (according to a study published in the American Journal of Therapeutics and an FDA article, http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/02/briefing/3882B2_02_McNeil-NSAID.htm#_Toc18761784 ), all in the US alone. The numbers for deaths involving kratom (not necessarily caused by it) are miniscule in comparison and hardly warrant a drastic action like scheduling kratom. \nThere are articles in scientific journals about kratom. Megan Rech, a clinical pharmacologist, pointed out in a 2014 article that serious toxicity from kratom is rare and usually involves relatively high doses or coingestants. The article can be found by following this link -  onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/phar.1522/full . A 2015 literature review in the International Journal of Legal Medicine gave a similar assessment of kratom. Marcus Warner, a Florida forensic scientists, wrote that \"kratom is considered minimally toxic\". Link for the review - link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00414-015-1279-y . A program officer for an international health promotion organization called PSI, Pascal Tanguay of Thailand, stated in a 2013 interview that \"there's never been a single death associated with kratom. People have been chewing this for thousands of years with no cases of overdose, psychosis, murder, violent crime. Never in all of recorded history.\" Link - https://www.minnpost.com/global-post/2013/09/thailand-s-cure-meth-addiction-leafy-jungle-stimulant . There are many other expert opinions widely available online that echo such statements.\nI know I'm not the only one who finds kratom to be helpful in my life, many Americans feel the same way. More than 100,000 Americans signed the White House petition that opposed the scheduling of kratom, which I didn't find surprising, seeing that I've met many upstanding, good citizens online who feel that kratom helps with their issues. Among those who use kratom, there are brave veterans who served our country, loving mothers, hard working blue collar laborers and many other varying groups.  It would negatively impact many Americans if kratom was banned as a schedule 1 substance, because we would lose access to an herb that we personally feel assists us with our issues. I strongly believe that kratom should not be scheduled at all, but rather be treated like other helpful herbal supplements (such as St John's Wort, ginseng, valerian root and others). It is a helpful herb that, experts agree, is not significantly more dangerous than the herbal supplements I mentioned above, so it should not be treated with stricter rules than them. This would allow kratom to stay available to people who find it helpful in their lives. Please help thousands of wonderful American people by not scheduling kratom.

I have a responsible occupation as an aircraft  structures technician performing heavy repair maintenance on commercial airplanes. I suffer from severe allergies with it being the worst in spring and fall with it being so bad that I literally struggle to function with the torment of it. It affects my life and duties trying to perform in my job. 2 years ago I was referred to an allergist after being in the worst condition ever in and struggling to breathe normally. Testing showed I am allergic to a lot of trees,weeds and mold amongst other things. I was prescribed the strongest of allergy medications that helped me a bit at first. The following year while working in NC my allergies struck severely again and the meds did not work hardly. I heard about Kratom and how it has helped people with inflammation illnesses and it is totally natural. I ordered some from a reputable vendor. To my disbelief after trying every medication on the shelves, I took kratom powder and within an hour my sneezing stopped, eyes pretty much stopped itching and I did not have to blow my nose. This is the only thing in this world that has given me relief in over 10 years of sometimes allergy torment. My job creates body pain too working in sometimes very trying and cramped uncomfortable aircraft locations. Kratom I have found relieves these aches and has helped with general energy and well being after being treated for depression and or PTSD in the past after growing up in a war conflict country. I wish to never take anti depressants ever again because of the side effects. Kratom has been a wonderful natural supplement to give me relief for above ailments as and when required. Please keep this wonderful tree leaf legal for the millions of people that it helps live a normal life. \n\nSincerely,\nJohn Kane","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7966","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Kane","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Although I am not a Kratom user, I believe the plant deserves research and analysis before a blanket ban.

I became addicted and started running out of my prescriptions early then buying off the street.  I was constantly moody and irritable and took it out on those I love.  \n  I found kratom about 2 years ago and it has changed my life.  Not only is my pain almost non existent I don't have to live my life like a mindless zombie anymore.

I am vehemently opposed to any scheduling of the natural plant mitragyna speciosa or kratom, and any alkaloids produced by it. \n\nKratom is a natural plant that has very few side effects, especially compared to some of the substances people are replacing with it's use. Kratom is far safer than opiate drugs in managing pain. In my profession I encounter people everyday seeking nutrition and dietary supplements to help wean themselves from opiate drugs, whether prescribed or otherwise. No other dietary ingredient that I am aware of shows as much promise as kratom in this regard.  While we do not carry kratom products in my store, due to the legal ambiguity surrounding them, I regularly inform people of kratom and encourage them to look into it as it may have the potential to help them to end their dependency on substances much more dangerous. \n\nI am also someone who uses kratom, I have taken kratom periodically for over two years. I do not, nor have I ever had an opiate dependence,  but I do drink kratom tea on occasion for a few reasons. I find that kratom provides pain relief when I am experiencing discomfort due to over exertion or an injury.  Kratom also works well in combating the stabbing pain of headaches that I have had intermittently for years. Another reason I will ingest kratom is that small amounts can eleviate social anxiety that can sometimes interfere with my day to day life.  In all my time using kratom I have not encountered any side effects except a few minutes of naseau if too much has been taken and the extreme unpleasantness of the taste of the plant. Even after taking kratom for a days in a row to relieve the pain of an injury, I have not experienced any withdrawal or craving for the substance when I do not take it. I also do not find that kratom impairs my thought process,  coordination, or judgment in any way other than relieving feelings of anxiety when I am experiencing them. \n\nI implore the agency not to ban or schedule kratom or any of the ingredients within it. Individuals should have the right to the use of this dietary ingredient if it can in any way replace more detrimental substances, or improve their quality of life while being safe (as the many years of anecdotal and historical evidence lend themselves to).","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2070","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Danny Hansen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Amber Boeldt.

I was on prescribed pain medication while in the hospital and discharged without any medication.  Ever since my accident, I've had chronic pain in my left knee and it especially hurts while working the long hours that I work.  Physical therapy has only exacerbated the pain.  According to the doctors I have consulted with, my pain is not 'severe enough' so pain medication was not an option, but was also not an avenue I wanted to take due to their habit-forming properties.  I have tried several homeopathic medicines to help with my pain and stumbled on the plant Kratom, the plant that contains Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, when reading about the ban.

I couldnt believe some of what I was reading and decided to try some for myself. I suffered decaded of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of my late husband.  I was diagnosed with depression, ptsd and sciatic nerve damage and the prescriptions I needed to manage these was well over $1,000. a month.  Never could I afford that.  My kratom journey began. I feel like a woman again. I am terrified for so many if kratom is taken away.  Overdose deaths will rise, disability will rise, welfare and so many good Americans could be jailed for felonies related to a plant. Children without parents going into a over crowded system and another generation of addiction and poverty is born.

It provides relief from pain, from sluggishness. It can turn your bad mood into a good one, or it can even just be used to brighten up a monotonous day.

A Mitragyna \"high\" is far less potent and extremely less debilitating than that of Marijuana, which is now available recreationally in several states, and medicinally in even more.

The effects are clean and natural feeling. I personally use it for the increased mood and subtle energy lift that it provides me. For me, I do not require it daily and only started using the plant about 6 months ago. I also gave some to my mother . She told me she found it helped the arthritis in her back. She, like many others, would much prefer Kratom over a stronger opiate like medications. \n\nI work in the addictions recovery field, as such, I believe in harm reduction. I believe this plant can absolutely (and is) an excellent harm reduction tool for people who are lucky enough to have found it (Kratom). Personally, I would love the day where a client/patient could access this plan at there local pharmacy or health food store. The online vendors have been excellent/professional as well. Kratom is an excellent substance for treating opiate addicts as well. Nothing worse than seeing the addicted patients lining up at a methadone clinic or resorting to buying hard drugs off the street. For the people I work with it would be very difficult for them to access this plant as currently it seems to be only purchased via internet rather than easily accessible locations (maybe the odd pot shop that may not represent this plant responsibly.) \n\nThis plant does have recreational value too (lets be honest.) I believe it can be enjoyed on the same level as macchiato at a coffee house or tobacco at a shisha lounge-socially and responsibly. I have found that Kratom can also calm me down at the end of my day and make me feel slightly euphoric. A much better alternative than alcohol (as I dislike the bloating and potential hang over.)\n\nConcerning its addictive potential I would consider it more of a 'habit forming' plant. On the scale of addictive substances the effects that Kratom produce are on the low end -effects are not as immediately felt in the reward system as a more modified substance i.e. morphine, cocaine.\n\nIn this day and age one has to seriously wonder why the DEA would want to follow through with banning a plant like Kratom, This makes people suspicious of the intentions of DEA and big pharma- many people  view the ban as a direct threat to pharmaceutical companies who appear to depend on people in pain and \"addicts.\"  As others learn of its positive effects, I wold imagine less people would abuse stronger substances such as heroin, benzo's etc. This is why I would think the DEA would get behind Kratom and keep it legal.\n\nPlease reconsider banning Kratom. I look forward to further studies of this plant but an immediate ban would very well potentiate the already devastating \"war on drugs.\" Furthermore, grouping a plant such as Kratom into categories such as chemically altered stimulants or depressants is in my opinion irresponsible.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to submit  and consider my opinion!\n\nYour friend from the North.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18279","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't know much about Kratom.

I have not had a pain free day in about 11 years now, and Kratom has been a painkilling ally which has allowed me to have a normal life. With doctors, they prescribe pain medicines, but with painful conditions where the pain levels fluctuate. Kratom is the perfect drug for customization of relief levels. It also provides an energy which counteracts the drowsy side effects of traditional opiates. There are many Americans who rely on this helpful medicine. We as a society have already accepted alcohol, which kills about 100,000 people a year. This supposed Kratom issue is nothing compared to what alcohol is doing to our society, and I encourage you to leave Kratom legal. It would be completely hypocritical to allow a much larger problem to exist while banning a helpful one. It would be similar to being more concerned over a bee sting than a cancer.

While this may not release these folks of the addiction, it's certainly a better option. What would you prefer if your spouse, sibling, child, or parent became the next victim of opiate addiction, continued use, methodone/suboxone, or kratom?  The first two options are either prohibitively expensive, regulated by doctors who don't want to prescribe them (yes, even the \"alternatives\"), come with shame having to face peers, or some combination of those. Kratom is inexpensive, all natural, can be purchased anonymously, requires no doctor, and while it may be mentally addictive, it's not physically, which is a huge difference. When you've watched your loved ones go through the sickness, the agony, the absolutely horrible experience of withdrawals, you'll understand. Even worse, when you've seen people you care about die because they've used unregulated and adulterated substance, or they took too much accidentally, you'll feel some of our pain.  What's the worst pain of all though, is watching someone you love become a husk, a shell of what they once were. Watching their withered body doing disgusting things just to feed their habit. Having to cut them off because they can't be trusted and no matter how much they once loved you, they will manipulate and play you just to take advantage of you in order to get their fix. \n\nI urge you to think about addiction as an illness, not a criminal matter. We are permitted to treat our illnesses with herbal and holistic medicine if we have a cold or the flu, parents are even permitted to place other children in danger by not vaccinating them if that is the choice they have made, why deprive us of the option to treat this illness with an herbal option when it's so readily available?  Have you not seen the reports of the numbers of people who are dying every day due to heroin tainted with carfentanyl? If this plague can be hindered in any way, why deprive people of that option?

First, allow me to applaud you, the DEA, for opening this period of public comment regarding the proposed scheduling of Kratom in the United States, and retracting your intent to classify Kratom as a schedule 1 drug.  Thank you for hearing us.\n\nI began taking Kratom as a daily supplement 4 years ago after concluding a long search for an unobtrusive treatment for anxiety and depression.  In my case, the discovery of this plant and its incredible properties was a godsend.  Kratom has proved to be a very positive and possibly life-saving experience.  After the sudden unexpected passing of my father in 2011, I found myself spiraling uncontrollably down to rock bottom.  I had always been able to handle the light instances of depression and social anxiety I experienced through my life, but this life altering event exponentially exacerbated my symptoms.  I lost a promising job opportunity due to the ingestion of illicit substances, which in turn contributed towards the premature finale of a long term relationship I was in at the time.  I flirted with opiate addiction, and watched one of my best friends go to jail for heroin related crimes while another acquaintance overdosed and died.  I knew I had to change my life or face a similar fate.\n\nSince incorporating Kratom into my daily routine, the changes were swift.  Now, four years later, I have successfully gone back to college, graduated with honors, and received my national certification for lab science.   I no longer drink or do other drugs, and have not experienced the urge to do so.  I began a daily workout routine, lost 40 pounds, and continue to workout today.  I have repaired relationships with my family and friends that were damaged through my unhealthy lifestyle, and now look forward to each new day.  Kratom has helped me achieve all these things.\n\nI vehemently oppose the scheduling of Kratom, or any related action that will restrict or take this miracle plant away from the people who so desperately need it.  I have not experienced any adverse effects from taking Kratom; no one I know has.  We are not addicts looking for a \"high,\" and Kratom does not produce one.  This plant has been unfairly maligned and is lumped in with poisons such as spice and bath salts in the minds of the uneducated. How can this plant be scheduled when DEA/FDA approved medicines injure and kill tens of thousands of citizens each year? Bath salts and Spice were created in the first place to circumvent the restrictions placed on Marijuana and other drugs.  I wonder what else will be created if Kratom is scheduled, and how harmful will it be?  More people are killed in the U.S. yearly by lightning strikes (40-50) than Kratom over three years (15), and in those instances the victims were found to have multiple drugs in their systems.   Furthermore, creating criminal felons out of hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans who are the backbone of society will only serve to make serious problems in this country worse.  Does the DEA believe that patients who need this plant in ways that I can't even comprehend will just stop taking it because of an uneducated edict? Americans should know Americans. \n\nSo in conclusion, please, members of the DEA, FDA; Americans...  Please do not take Kratom away from us.  You will have the respect of the citizenry, and can take an important, necessary step towards impactful drug reform in this country.  Thank you so much for you time and this opportunity to tell my story.  \n\nSincerely,\nMichael B.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17261","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael B","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has quite literally changed my life and that of my family.

I never know from hour to hour how I will feel or even if standing up to walk to the restroom will cause spasms or a flare. I have not known a day without pain for a long time. I was lucky when a friend said I had a spot in her car for a long weekend trip to the beach.  I was excited to get away for a couple of days. The car broke down and we were stranded out of state for a week and I ran out of my regular medications. The friend we stayed with tried to help me get my prescriptions but since most had recently been filled, I was not able to get meds to last the trip. She then offered kratom. I had heard about it in many of my support groups and had researched it prior to this trip. After 1/2 day of no meds, I was ready to try anything! I used kratom tea made from kratom powder and was simply amazed at the overall change I noticed within just 1/2 hour. I didn't have any sort of high, just my symptoms had calmed to a bearable level. I used the tea for the remainder of the trip until I could get home and get my regular meds. My state is an illegal state and I don't want to break the law. I had no ill effects from stopping the tea but many of my symptoms that had been dulled came back full force as did the side effects of the prescription meds. With no cravings or ill effects, I began doing more research into kratom. I so very much want to have my tea for the benefits I personally noticed but due to where I live, that is not possible. I have decided to advocate for the ability to continue to use this herbal tea to improve my overall well being as I deal with my illnesses and the organ damage the prescription meds have caused. There is such potential with this plant and I cannot understand after my experience why the government would want to take it away from the public. More research needs to be done by qualified medical personnel and this cannot happen if the plant and its compounds are added to the Schedule I list. I am one voice but know thousands upon thousands that this plant has helped. Do NOT add this to Schedule I.

I am a 44 year old mother and wife. 12 years ago I was diagnosed with Lupus and Fibromyalgia both of these medical conditions cause me daily and debilitating chronic pain. As a result of that pain I began taking opiates to treat my pain and help me function more normally. At first pain meds were very effective in allowing me to have a better and more normal quality of life, however, I developed a tolerance to the medication and I then began to supplement what I was prescribed with the medication Tramadol. I developed and very serious addiction to Tramadol and at one point would take up to 20 tablets a day. I tried numerous times to stop taking it but the withdrawal I experienced was so severe that I prayed for death and seriously contemplated suicide. A friend introduced me to kratom and I began to take it with the hope that I would be able to get off the narcotic medication that I had been taking for 5 years. My plan was to taper down over a period of 2 months. However, after 3 days on kratom I threw away the Tramadol and never took it again. Kratom literally saved my life! \nWe have a serious drug problem in this country. We are facing a heroin epidemic that is only going to get worse as the restrictions on opiate prescribing continue to tighten. Therefore the scheduling of kratom as an illegal drug is unconscionable and highly irresponsible! People should be allowed the option of using natural remedies to combat chronic pain and addiction rather than only having the option to take highly addictive and dangerous pharmaceutical drugs that have destroyed COUNTLESS lives and caused numerous deaths. I have read the claims that kratom has caused 15 deaths in the past 2 years, which is ludicrous, but even if these claims were true that number pales in comparison to the number of deaths that occur every year from pharmaceutical drugs, illegal drugs, alcohol or tobacco. Therefore, the benefits of kratom far outweigh the risk. There are many other substances that are currently legal that should receive your immediate attention rather than villianizing this natural substance that helps rather than hurts people. As an American citizen, a mother, wife and chronic pain sufferer I do not want my options taken away from me and/or limited to pharmaceutical drugs that are proven to be dangerous and have serious side effects.

I use small amounts of kratom each day instead of drinking or taking drugs. Kratom has a very mild effect on users -- mild stimulation or mild sedation depending on dose. This is not a substance that people can get extremely intoxicated on -- unlike alcohol or marijuana for starters. Kratom is also (and I don't know why) not a drug that a person can fatally overdose on as it does not overstimulate or under-stimulate breathing and heart rate (unlike alcohol or amphetamines). Like any substance (including sugar and caffeine) a user can take too much and feel sick. But having a medical emergency is very unlikely and a fatal overdose brought about solely by kratom seems impossible. Please allow responsible adults to use this substance legally.

If it could, it would make water illegal so wed have to buy it through them. But the purpose of government is to protect \"the commons\" from rampant capitalism, to KEEP things like water legal.\n\nWhy is the DEA suddenly so excited about this beneficial plant? Why now? Because business is booming. Now that Americans have discovered kratom, it's time to make it illegal to secure rights for resale. Good for shareholders, bad for America. \n\nWithout kratom there is no way I could have finished my PhD at the University of Texas. Without the right food, water, and coffee, there's simply no way I could have slogged through all the difficult reading and writing.\n\nIf you own GSK stock, I totally understand your desire to make kratom illegal. I really do. Looking out for yourself over other people is normal and natural. It takes heroic people to be decent citizens, so I'm not really optimistic that you will change your mind. People who work for government agencies do so to make money, like anyone else. And you can only get kickbacks from Big Pharma if you help them. \n\nBut the amount of suffering you will create if you do so will be quite large. Kratom smashes opioid addiction and boosts productivity. I use it for the latter purpose, but it's no secret that opioid addicts really exist in America. Please be a good citizen and keep this addiction-busting coffee legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20853","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Scott Heftler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello there, \n\nI just want to give my two cents on the issue.

Well, not only was I able to get off of the opiate meds I began to feel like my old self again and the pain was managed by the kratom. I've not had to keep increasing the amount of kratom I take like with the opiates for them to work. I feel strongly that it would be a great mistake to make kratom illegal in the US as it has helped many people to quit potentially dangerous medications.

I'm writing to respectfully oppose any decision that would Schedule Kratom in any class, making it a controlled substance. After years of being put on several different antidepressants since I was 14, I decided it was time to go the natural route. I have been on Zoloft, Buspar, Depakote, Remeron, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Effexor, Ativan, and Celexa at different points in my life. All but one had been ineffective and the only one that did help a little, was Zoloft. However, even with the Zoloft I found myself going back to the doctors frequently for severe breakthrough anxiety and panic and having my dosage increased every other month until I maxed out at the highest dosage. The side effects to each were miserable and they often made me feel worse as I couldn't eat, sleep, or function without breaking down. The doctors were going to switch me again but after all those years, I decided that it was time to become free from pharmaceuticals. My decision was not only for my own well being, but to be the best version of myself as a mother for my children. I began taking supplements such as Vitamin D and Vitamin B. I began using coconut oil and Tea Tree oil in lieu of harsh chemicals that are linked to hormonal disruption. I could no longer tolerate caffeine due to the intensifying anxiety after the birth of my children, so I researched natural dietary supplements that would not only promote healthy energy levels, but could also promote overall well being. I found Kratom and because it's in the coffee family but is without caffeine, I decided to give the tea a try. It's been 2 years and I haven't looked back. I'm very much saddened that due to some shops and individuals advertising it as a \"legal high\" or in the likes of synthetic drugs, Kratom is gravely misunderstood. I've felt normal and well, not intoxicated in the least. It's my \"coffee\" but without the jitters and racing heartbeat. I've been in my line of work for over 11 years (professional driver) and up until I found Kratom, I had been struggling with bouts of anxiety which at times, interfered with my abilities to be connect with my children and work. On occasion, my doctor had to write me off of work for a few days to 2 weeks at a time because the anxiety got so debilitating. I haven't needed a note since, nor have I ever found myself in the doctors office like I did before where I'd go in 2x a week sometimes. I go in for routine checkups and that is it. Today was one of those visits and my doctor was very surprised that it had been almost a year since I had come in. She saw me on a weekly basis before and I'm healthier than ever both mentally and physically. I benefit greatly from Kratom being a part of my natural supplement regiment as it helps me with energy, helps reduce irritability, and to maintain overall better health both mentally and physically in the way any dietary supplement is meant to. It is not a medicine nor is it meant to treat any illness or condition, it is just meant to aid in a healthy mind and body. \nI've known several heroin addicts, I know what that does to people and their families. I know what it is to be utterly heartbroken to watch children cry for their parent who's either out getting high, in jail, or worse, deceased from an OD. My niece and nephews were those children. So it is just as unsettling to hear Kratom being compared to heroin. It is not an Opiate. I'm a hardworking wife and mother who's never gotten so much as a speeding ticket. If Kratom is scheduled, that takes away personal choice from those like me, who had no other option but to go natural in order to do what is best for their health. Many of us simply cannot go back to pharmaceuticals and the quality of life, or lack thereof, they provided. I ask that Kratom stay legal and recognized as a dietary supplement, not as a dangerous street drug like the ones out there killing thousands every year. Kratom is nothing like those harmful substances, it doesn't destroy. I am a living testament to that.

I spent the past years deep into alcohol abuse as well as other hard drugs, and every morning I woke up in pain, and barely breathing from chainsmoking already at 26.

Now when I wake up I feel compelled to start my day, often even exercising, which I had neglected doing for years.

More negative and harm will be done than good as a result of the ban. I don't see how that will benefit the American people or society as a whole. The medicinal aspects of this plant as a all natural herbal supplement is much needed for those who seek to live a natural and holistic lifestyle. This really seems like a ploy from Big Pharma to impose restrictions for the gain of the pharmaceutical monopoly. Please consider the elderly and the sick. This plant has provided a much needed spark much like coffee or a natural protein shake and I'd like to continue to have the liberty of such as in the times I need an aspirin or Benadryl.

I've never had a traffic violation or been arrested. My soon to be wife introduced me to kratom about 2 years ago. It's given her energy like that of coffee but also a sense of well being similar to how you feel after a good work out.  The only regulation I support is to limit sale to those 18 and older. If you look at the kratom community as a whole then you can not come to the conclusion that this is a drug or deserves any regulation beyond age restrictions. It should be treated as the supplement that it is. Thank you for the opportunity to be heard, all that is asked is that you give science and research time to prove what 10's of thousands of what Americans already know, that kratom is a safe and benificial plant with absolutley minimal addictive properties and by no stretch of the imagination deserving of a schedule 1 labeling.

I'm 66 years old. I first found out about kratom when my daughter started taking it for her cancer pain. My daughter is a recovering alcoholic and Drug user clean for over 3 years. She was afraid to go back to taking prescription pain drugs because they had to be very strong and she does have a tendency to overdo and she knew that was the direction she would prbably go in. She started reading about kratom and thought hey I'll give it a try and maybe not use prescription pain drugs. Who knows maybe it'll work because the drugs are not working. The first day she took kratom not only was she pain free, she was a new person. She was walking through the house like a normal person. Actually she started to clean our pantry. Before that she could barely make it into the kitchen and sit down. She worked for about 4 hours straight pulling out boxes and cans making all kinds of trash and great headway in that pantry. When I saw the change in her I could have just about cried it was amazing. she was like a new person and she was normal, she was happy, she was pain-free. Slowly I started to think hey maybe I could use a little kratom so I tried a variety of Kratom not for pain because I have no pain at 66, thank God. But I wanted something that gave me a tiny bit of energy so I took the strain of Kratom that just gave me a little pep in my step. It works so well I gave a little to my mom who is 86 years old. She felt so good so good she asked for it every day. She say.... can I have a little more kraytom today. We never ever over did.  In fact if you take a little too much you feel pretty yucky and you have to go to sleep there's no getting high you just feel yucky.  All I can say is please don't take kraytom away. If you have any questions and you need to speak to me I'd be more than willing to answer anything. Thank you for reading this.

When my grandson was born I couldn't stand & hold him at same time due to the knee arthritis & back pain from DDD. This caused great depression. Along with pre-existing PTSD & anxiety. That too kratom has relieved greatly. I'm able now to exercise daily & now my grandson weighs 22 lbs. I can carry him at short periods. It feels great to have a little say in having natural herbs in my body. I have really benefitted as I know many others have. It's not addicting at all. I'm 42 yo & don't have time for addictions just quality time in my life, minus pain & anxiety.

I utilize many herbs,vitamins, minerals all of which are completely legal - I laugh honestly when   I hear the talk of criminalizing the use of Kratom. I am not a  doctor but I doctor up this busted up body nearly everyday with my herbs, vitamins, minerals, diet and sometimes Kratom has its usefulness but certainly is not a cure all and by no means is it habit  forming to me - I can go days without Kratom, but I often choose to use it because Kratom does seem to help me with my chronic L4 L5 spine issue, I feel better for 3 to 4 hours which allows me to go to work at lunchtime  I re dose and go for another 3 to 4 hours. Without Kratom my days are just simply more painful -  I have tried over the counter NSAIDrugs but have adverse reactions as my liver enzymes shoot though the roof and I have horrible acid reflux, so bad often I will throw up Tylenol or Ibuprofen containing drugs. So Kratom and occasional chiropractic sessions help me to avoid expensive and possibly unsuccessful back surgery which could leave me disabled. I have a very important job that affects many in my community - I take my job/career very seriously as 100s of peoples lives depend on my expertise in my field - Kratom does not get me high and it infuriates me that some bill Kratom this way - if you take to much 8 or more grams depending on person, yeah you might get a little loopy for 10 15 minutes, but look out you're gonna vomit - you won't make that mistake again! I am not naive enough to think all plants are innocent or safe - but in my experience Kratom has been very safe and should remain legal. There are some dangers of course with Kratom but most supplements have some dangers, kelp for example can kill you if misused and iron overdose can kill - we could go on and on with examples of dangerous compounds, plants, extracts that have potential infractions maybe we should  make everything illegal !  I believe this war on Kratom has been manufactured by poor media coverage and or pandering bureaucracy inside corrupt agencies. We the people are not ignorant and will not be ignored.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9460","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anthony Hankins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have done some research on this plant and I really think it would help me, but I can't use it because its banned here.

Since that day my life has only gone up hill for the better. In November  of 2015 i injured my lower back at work and it turned out to be a herniated a disc....L1S5 to be precise. I also had a lower lumbar strain that brought on some of the worst pain i ever felt. I was prescribed pain killers ans NSAIDs for pain relief and all it did was make me sick and constipated. I continued going to physical therapy and finally had an epidural injection which helped quite a bit. I was then told to just deal with the pain from there on out. That really bothered me because not that the pain prevented me from working but it became like an annoying constant headache all day, everyday. So i decided to search for natural remedies to help subside the pain even more because i developed severe anxiety over this ordeal. I came across Kratom and within a week or two my pain and anxiety completely disappeared. My life has completely changed. I'm now a very happy and productive young man in every aspect of life.

I learned about Kratom from a Dr. in a chronic pain group that I was in and after researching it,and finding a reliable vendor tried it. The results I had were amazing.I have never experienced any adverse effects from using this herb nor have I ever heard or met anyone else who has! This Herb has helped me to manage my chronic pain better and given me the opportunity to wean myself off many opiates,anti-depressants, and even the newer drugs that are presently being prescribed for Fibromyalgia with many serious side effects. I have not had even one episode of Diverticultis since I started drinking Kratom and it was sending me to the Emergency Room at least 4 times a year for many years. Kratom has given me hope and the ability to live my life fuller...helping me to manage my pain better and given me the energy to face each day knowing that I can accomplish even the simplest of chores that I was unable to do before like showering without crying,dressing and even driving to the store.I do not become mentally or physically impaired in any way from drinking this Herb.This Plant should not be banned and should be kept avail. for all of us who need it desperately just to get  through each and every day...to live our lives to it's fullest potential.Thank you for giving us the opportunity to have a voice regarding the use of this Herb.

My back problems came to a head about 6.5 years ago. I was put on prescription pain pills & started Physical Therapy. The therapy helped but the pain pills started losing their effect as time went on. I was becoming dependent on these pills (Percocet, etc.) & found I needed larger doses. My wife suggested looking at a natural remedy: herbs. I did a lot of research & discovered Kratom. Since I started using Kratom I don't take any narcotic pain pills at all. I am able to do my job (I work in Health Care - I'm a physical therapist in a nursing home) & continue working. I take a small amount of the herb daily to help control the pain. I also have a back brace & a massage chair that helps. I am also doing scoliosis exercises. I do not have altered mentation while using Kratom (I don't get loopy at all). When I need to (like undergoing a medical procedure) I stop taking Kratom & I don't have any withdrawal symptoms except for a runny nose. This herb has helped me to remain a productive member of society & not have to go on disability. It is a good way to help people not become dependent on narcotic pain medicines & lead normal, productive lives. Please do not turn Kratom into a controlled substance (like heroin) as it is helping many people throughout the world.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5881","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Conrad","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban kratom.

I have had several serious spine problems my entire life, but it became debilitating and life altering when I was pregnant with my son. After he was born and I was able to start taking medications for my pain, I was prescribed all sorts of opiates and muscle relaxers. They made me sleepy, depressed, and unable to care for my son. At one point I even became suicidal, which was  completely foreign to me. And once I decided to stop taking the pills after 4 years of daily use, I realized how dependent I was. That's when I researched alternatives and began using kratom almost 4 years ago. I quickly realized I could take care of my son, work in my salon, live my life and drive my car without the foggy head, anxiety, and depressed mood the opiates gave me. Sometimes I would feel so great I would think I was surely all cured, until I stopped my kratom and the pain returned. Then I realized that I could just STOP it! I have a little trouble sleeping for more than about 5-6 hours the first night after stopping kratom use, but the horrible withdrawal symptoms just were not there. I take breaks sometimes for a few days just to remind myself why I take it, and I feel so much better knowing that I am in control of my health and treatment options now. I use kratom daily, and I am positive that it is the main reason I can fully participate in my life and family. I no longer have to live with the stigma of being on pain medication. I feel that kratom used in its natural form (crushed or powdered leaves, NOT extracts or \"enhanced\" products) is the best way to greatly reduce my pain and anxiety levels related to the pain. Please keep this plant legal.

I'll be 32 in November and I live in the West Coast of Michigan, the great big Mitten of the North. Kratom (Mitragyna Speciosa), a plant closely related to coffee, has significantly improved my life as well as helped me titrate my prescription pain-killer usage after a car accident and over 12 years of chronic pain after. Kratom has saved so many lives from opiate/opioid abuse it's enumerable and impossible to swing a guitar without hitting a dozen people who either were directly affected by or know someone who's live was significantly improved by kratom. \n\nThe benefits are plentiful. The side effects are minimal. What's not to like? What's not to love? What's there to ban? When kratom is not abused and when abused are no worse than codeine. So I recommend making it 18+ only and NOT banning it. That just removes power from the good guys and hands it over to the bad guys. \n\nIf kratom is banned or not regulated properly then it makes it MORE dangerous and as Jimmy Carter said before I was even born: \"When the laws of a drug are more harmful than the drug itself, therein lies an injustice.\" \n\nNever more has this ever rang more true than with a kratom ban. It was suggested because of a death related to \"Krypton Kratom\" which was found to be laced with a synthetic compound from China. Kratom was not to blame, it was laced. Kratom has never killed anyone on it's own. Even too much water can kill you, it's called Hyponatremia. \n\nWe supposed to ban water? No, we educate, regulate, and demonstrate. \n\nIf you were to ban kratom then millions of people would be forced back onto the streets and potentially back into a life of crime thus filling our already crowded prisons and jails with even more non-violent drug offenders leaving us no recourse but o let rapist, child molesters, and murderers go free from the over-crowding. How ridiculous.\n\nKratom deserves to be left alone. More emergency room visits for asprin and tylenol than kratom. Ban those? No. We put them on the shelf, over the counter, with a warning. We give people the freedom to choose. The freedom to potentially make a mistake. The freedom to seek help in event of a mistake, and the freedom to enjoy life after we save them from making that mistake. Kratom can't kill. So if they make a mistake with it, it's much less serious than even too much water. How amazing is that? I think it's astounding and it's a miracle that it exists in this form.\n\nIf you research who funded the studies on synthetic drugs based on the kratom's main alkaloids (active ingredients in kratom) you'll find they also initiated the ban on the plant itself! Why would you do that? Well why would anyone buy your fluorinated mitragynine analogues if you can acquire a cheap, natural source of mitragyniates and mitragynoids (compounds from kratom and compounds similar to those found in kratom, respectively).\n\nThat is inherently wrong. You don't 1) Find a medicinal plant that works 2) build analogs to\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2248","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"One Stop Herb Shop","postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Montgomery","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Re: Docket No. DEA-442W\n\nMy mom has been using the herbal supplement, kratom, off and on for four years.

He has been in prison for over 10 years for a non-violent crime he committed while high on heroin. He comes from a wealthy, successful and positive family. He is smart, kind and has unlimited potential. His biggest problem is an addiction that has never fully been addressed - not by prison, not by the state-run rehab facilities he was required to be in, not by parole, not by any punishment he has received. He will always be battling this addiction and something like Kratom may be the answer for him. We know that Kratom is not the cure all for heroin addiction, we understand there is a lot of effort that goes into dealing with the daily struggle of addiction. What we do know is that Kratom has a lot of benefits supported by anecdotal evidence and virtually no downsides that have been proven. A plant that has been used in this country for decades and worldwide for 2000 years should not be deemed a Schedule 1 drug without any research to support such a distinction. I hope that you can reconsider your stance on this plant at least for long enough to do the proper research. Thank you for your time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14357","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rory Farrell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Prior to finding out about Kratom. I was taking oxycontin and oxycodone for bulging and herniated discs in my neck and my entire back. I had broke my neck and back, 5 fractures in total, and already had multiple bulging and herniated discs prior to my 5 fractures. I stopped taking the pain killers mentioned above, but I was unable to work without being uncomfortable and off of the narcotics. My quality of life was absolutely terrible. I was unable to do basic chores and go to work without my pain symptoms having a negative effect on my work and attitude as a whole.  After being off of the narcotics for a yeAR or so, a friend of mine introduced me to kratom.  Since then I take it when my pain is really bad. I am now able to sleep without waking up every 15 to 30 minutes. I am not broke, as it is very affordable and has helped me tremendously since I was introduced to it. I don't take it everyday and have not had any withdrawal symptoms in the time that I have used it.  My friends and family have witnessed a huge change in my everyday activities and I do not get sick when I run out of it. I really hope that the possible scheduling of kratom is researched before making a final decision. I have read a lot of other people's stories online of how it helped them and I cannot believe how helpful this really was for me as well, especially after the amount of opiates I was prescribed in the past which I ended up getting addicted to.  I have read about people using Kratom to get clean as well, which is amazing to me. I have friends and family members that were on suboxone for years before their doctors finally weened them off, which is actually just as bad, if not worse than using the drug(s) that landed them in at suboxone clinic in the first place. The pharmaceutical companies pretty much take an addict addicted to street drugs and switch them over to their drug(s), it is awful. I know people that have had to go to rehab after taking suboxone when they already went away for an opiate prior to that. \nI am almost 40 years old and work in an attorneys office and I am able to function fine using kratom, as opposed to the opiates I took in the past. The only thing I see that is a problem here, is Kratom pulling money from big pharmaceutical companies pockets. It has changed my life's quality and I know I am not the only one.

The wealth of anecdotal and scientific data available due to the aforementioned usage indicate that, scientifically, Kratom fails both prongs required of Schedule One drugs: A) It does not have a high potential for abuse, again, as clearly demonstrated by its use for millennia. In this period the available literature contains relatively little discussion of extreme Kratom consumption. \n\nA rough rate of abuse may be extrapolated from the fact that extreme Kratom use over a long period of time has been documented to darken ones' cheeks, this has only been seen in a minuscule portion of the sample size of historical and present Kratom users (most likely a hundred or many fewer instances per million users). B) Kratom clearly does possess medicinal benefit. The physiological effects of Kratom consumption have been clearly documented,  some of these affects, even when viewed in a vacuum, provide medical benefit; when viewed within the contet of other compounds which provide similar physiological reactions/effect, Kratom may well even offer superior medicinal qualities when compared to its scheduled and unscheduled counterparts which attempt the achieve same effect. \n\nKratom should be legal, freely avaliable, and most imporantly further studied for insight into its true medicinal potential. \n\n-John Morrison","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21279","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Morrison","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Helps with my sleep,pain and anxiety,depression.

Kratom is a lifesaver.  It gives me better pain control and it does not effect my ability to function like the opiates did. So I am having a really hard time understanding why something so mild needs to be scheduled. One of the reasons given was that there have been 15 deaths. This research is flawed due to there being other substances found as well so how can it be stated that kratom was the cause?  The couple of times that I have purchased kratom at a head shop I always think why am I even buying this here? Why is it even sold here?  I should be able to purchase kratom in a vitamin\\supplement store. Kratom does not give you any sort of high and does not effect the ability to function. If this ban is all about researching kratom more and making it available as a pharmaceutical,even though it fits more into the category of n herbal supplement but why ban it?

Kratom seems to have a lot of potential to help individuals with opiate addiction, chronic pain and anxiety. Even though none of that has been clinically proven, Kratom should be given a fair examination.\n\nAs you already know, opiate addiction is an epidemic in our country. Rehab is very expensive and not very effective. The current treatments for opiates are just more opiates. Kratom may be an alternative and it should be studied. We're losing wonderful people everyday to a horrible addiction. If people are having success with Kratom, it must be given a chance. Placing it under Schedule 1 is equivalent to shutting one of the few doors out of our opiate epidemic. \n\nRemember, there are people currently using Kratom to gain relief from one thing or another and if it's placed under Schedule 1, those people will lose their relief. They'll be forced to take the pills they've been trying to avoid or they may even turn back to more dangerous substances. We've already made this mistake with Marijuana and it has taken decades to even begin to undo the damage. Please take careful consideration of all these comments.\n\nYou are not the enemy of the people, you're here to help us. You also know that  these schedules do not prevent use, they just create non-violent criminals.

I am a Certified Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Finance specialist, responsible for ensuring compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA Patriot Act.  My current role involves investigation of potential suspicious activity, ultimately resulting in Suspicious Activity Reports filed with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. \nI have been generally diagnosed with a Thoracic Scapular dysfunction, after countless visits to doctors ranging from Orthopedic surgeons to Neuromuscular specialists.  There has been no direct link to the cause of this dysfunction beyond potential postural issues while working a full-time desk job.  My ultimate resolution, as mostly prescribed by my primary care provider, has been to take a plethora of medications with strong side effects, including muscle relaxers, opiates, and benzodiazepines.  I have even developed an ulcer after taking an extensive amount of Aspirin, requiring visits to a Gastroenterologist which resulted in a surgery.  \nOn nights where the pain has been unmanageable, I have combined medications (obtained legally and with a valid prescription) to attempt falling asleep before going into work the next morning, which requires close attention to detail and management of multiple cases.  I have been amazed at my own body's tolerance to survive some of these combinations, which were taken to force some degree of relief and potentially gain rest.    \nThe quality of my life and my work has suffered greatly as a result of my pain and use of medications to mitigate the pain to an almost tolerable level.  In a quest for legal pain-mitigation alternatives, I discovered plain-leaf Kratom approximately a year ago.  I do not use this substance daily, but I have used it occasionally by itself to help relieve some of the symptoms of my pain.  Given the side effects of the prescription medications compared to the use of Kratom, I personally have found no significant risks of Kratom that would warrant the proposed scheduling of your administration.  Additionally, given the anecdotal discussions and assertions I've seen others make regarding Kratom's potential to help opiate addicts without long-term consequential use, it is critical that this substance remain legal unless further scientific research concludes otherwise.    \n\nI would urge your administration to consider my case in light of the proposed scheduling.  I highly caution against scheduling Kratom, which would cause potentially unintended consequences on the lives of millions who depend on it to vastly improve the quality of their daily lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7776","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi,\n\nI have seen many people use this to help them of different addictions.

Before finding Kratom, I was addicted to opiates. I've had a number of surgeries, leaving me with chronic pain. Since using Kratom, I have not used opiates A SINGLE TIME. Kratom has been a life saver for me. I am able to work, take better care of myself and my children, all with a clear head and no side effects to date. Please, I beg you, please do not ban this miracle that has done so much for me and the wellbeing of my family! If anything should be banned, it is alcohol! Kratom is not dangerous!

I was diagnosed with a crohn's disease an autoimmune disorder. With crohn's comes with several excruciating and debilitating symptoms; pain, nausea, dizziness, depression, anxiety, diharrea and many more. The options for relief are limited and what is available, especially for pain, is powerful and addictive opiates. I've struggled with addiction to pain pills over the last 20 years, but the last year I've been clean for the first time. I'm finally not a slave to pain medication. After battling a terrifying and horrible addiction, I've learned to deal with the ups and downs of life without self medicating. Unfortunately,  I was diagnosed with the autoimmune disorder crohn's disease four months after regaining my life of several years of being a slave to opiates. I was terrified to find out that pain pills was probably the only option I had to relieve the excruciating pain that comes with crohn's until I heard about kratom. After deciding to give kratom a try I was amazed and the terrier of being worried about getting addicted to opiates again passed. Kratom not only helps with my pain, but it helps with nausea, the anxiety and depression that comes with the negative live changes of crohn's. \n\nI typically wouldn't take the time to write something like this but by no means should kratom be classified in the same category as heroin or any illegal drugs. If anything, the class opiates are in should be placed in the category of illegal drugs. There are endless benefits of kratom and understanding the negatives of kratom compared to opiates is far less. My hope in writing this is that I will be heard and will have the ability to continue using kratom as a way to combat the symptoms that come from the debilitating crohn's disease. Otherwise it is almost a for sure that if kratom is no longer available I will have no choice but to go to opiates and no doubt will lease me back into a full blown addiction.\n\nThanks for taking the time reading my story.

To take kratom off the table as an option for people suffering from addiction seems illogical and perhaps motivated by other factors (such as big pharmaceutical companies being the scenes wanting to do this so they can push their own pills for maximum profit).

Aspirin, vitamins, tylenol, cigarettes, nsaids, alcohol, and even sharks kill more per year than cannabis and kratom do in a month!!!

Please keep the kratom plant legal and readily available for all who need and might needed in the future, including your immediate friends family and loved ones. I know mother's and fathers and grandparents that can live life peacefully and happily because of this plant God put on the Earth for us to utilize.  Dont cut your own hands off at the rist, keep control of your own health and  alow for natural choices.  I encourage you to look into its health properties and try it your self.  You will be very happy you did.

The plant has helped us get back to normal mentally and finally feel some joy with life that we never had previously. It picked my wife up from her knees when she was battling post-partum depression. It has helped me reduce the amount of panic attacks and nightmares I suffer from do to past traumatic experiences. I understand my voices is only one, but there are many other good people like myself and my wife that will be left out to dry if the DEA chooses to make this a scheduled narcotic. I'm sure you have your own information about the plant, but please take into consideration the people like us that just want to have a happy life and raise a nice family. This stinks.

I'm in pain every day of my life. I'm leaving my comment about kratom because I believe this leaf has improved my life. \n \n  Ten years ago I was severely addict to opiate pain medication. I was given Demerol regularly for migraines at age 15, and it went crazy from there. One surgery after another, one pain pill prescription after another. Pain management doctors filling me with oxycontion, norco, soma, xanax. I couldn't function. I wound up on 200 milligrams of methadone a day. I'm five foot one and 100 pounds. I was taking twice my weight in synthetic heroin every day. I did not like the person I became. \n\nI began looking for alternatives. I was in Oregon and my doctor recommended medical marijuana. I went off the methadone and it was the worst experience of my life. The medical cannabis helped me through a little. It wasn't until a year later my medical marijuana doctor told me to try kratom when my pain still was not controlled using cannabis. I tried it, wasn't impressed. I sampled more and more, and I found it began working, and working better than anything I've ever been given. I've used kratom daily for three years. My father who is against all drugs,  he doesn't even take Tylenol, buys my kratom for me because I'm unable to afford it and he sees how much it helps. He saw me go through opiate addiction. \n\nI will have no choice but to go back to pain pills or patches or shots if kratom is banned. I will end up back in the cycle of taking too many pills and going to the emergency room once a week for a pain shot. I will become the person I hate, all because I have a disease that causes unbearable pain and my only natural solution will be federally illegal. Please think of the damage this ban will do to so many thousands of responsible kratom users.

Please reconsider what you are trying to do and at least allow it to be further researched before ripping it from the hands of so many who are simply trying to avoid the harmful side effects of pharmaceuticals. Thank you for taking the time to read these comments and for the further consideration you're giving this amazing plant.

I have a bulging disc in my lower back that constantly flares up. The only option I have is surgery, which my Dr does not recommend for someone so young. The disc constantly pinches a nerve cause pain to shoot down my leg and keeps me up most nights. I don't want to take prescription pain medication like oxy, vicodone, etc. They don't work most of the time for me, and left me feeling even worse afterwards. Kratom is wonderful in the sense that it actually helps my pain, AND gives me energy rather than turning me into a zombie. Because I am in pain the majority of the time I usually have to be on medicine constantly. I work in the automotive industry and cannot take something that will impair me like percs or norco. Kratom takes my pain away and gives me the peace of mind knowing that I can go to work and be fully aware of what is going on. My social anxiety is gone when I take kratom, and it has really changed my life. Without it, I would be forced to go back to taking prescription opiate drugs which, from my personal experience, should be a last resort only. I have a B.S in Psychology with a concentration in psychopharmacology. I'm not an expert, but you guys can't POSSIBLY think that kratom is actually a threat to our health. I have accidentally consumed too much and I almost immediately threw up and within 15 min was back to normal. I know people who accidently consume too much of your \"safe prescription alternative \" oxycodone and they fall asleep AND DIE. Please allow me, among other legitimate pain patients to be able to continue to use kratom. We already have an opiate epidemic, and banning this substance would only make things worse.  I will be praying for you to make the right decision. Kratom had literally changed my life and saved me from the opiate deathtrap.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18761","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to voice my opinion in the stated matter regarding Kratom and the alkaloids contained within. \n\nI am a 34 year old single mother of a beautiful 4 year old daughter. I am gainfully employed to be able to take care and provide for my daughter and myself. 3 years ago, I was unable to do this, as I was terribly addicted to opiates and unable to function properly. \n\nOver the past 6 years, I have visited 16 doctors and specialists, had every test imaginable performed, and still no findings of the cause of my severe thoracic back pain. They put me on every muscle relaxer, opiate painkiller, injected me with nerve blocking steroids, etc. They would switch the prescriptions around when the muscle relaxers didn't work, and when my tolerance on the painkillers too high, they would switch those, as well. This switching of painkillers, along with quickly building tolerance to them, caused me many withdrawal episodes, some lasting weeks. The final episode happened when  my tolerance to Tramadol was so high that I would go through a month's supply in a week. My doctor then refused to prescribe any further medication to me and labeled me a drug seeker. This happened around the same time Tramadol was rescheduled. Prior to that, when the doctor refused me, I began purchasing Tramadol online. When Tramadol was rescheduled, I had no further way to obtain the medication. A horrible bout of withdrawal set in. Everything they told me about Tramadol being \"not addictive\" and having \"no withdrawal symptoms\" was entirely incorrect. I would compare my Tramadol withdrawals with that of a heroin or cocaine user. \n\nA friend of mine saw how bad the withdrawals were and asked if I had ever heard of Kratom. I hadn't. I was told it could help ease the withdrawal symptoms and might provide a bit of pain relief. I was informed that it was a tea leaf that is usually consumed as a tea, but it could also be taken in a capsule. I chose to use the capsules. I obtained some locally, swallowed a few of them and literally within 30 minutes I was starting to feel like a human being. The shaking, sweating and skin crawling lessened, and eventually subsided. Within a few days of being on a Kratom routine, all the signs of withdrawal had subsided. As a wonderful side effect, the pain in my back was completely gone. I hadn't felt that relief in years. During the entire time of my painkiller addiction and subsequent withdrawals, I was unemployed and unable to work. The addiction made performing regular routines impossible, as they made me unable to focus or concentrate, as I was in a dissociative state. \n\nI am now a successfully employed single mother. I am the sole provider of my daughter. I am now able to get up in the morning and make her breakfast, take her to preschool and then go to work.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7916","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tiffany Radmer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 20 years old have suffered with depression and anxiety my whole life.

I was diagnosed with fibromalygia at the age of 23 yrs after the birth of my third child who has Down's Syndrome. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for most of my life.  Through out the course of my life, i have been put on different medications for my depression and anxiety.  I watched my depression go from bad to worse.  I now have the diagnosis of Major Depression Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder.  In 2001, I was hit from behind on the interstate and obtained serious injuries to my neck and lower back.  The result was surgery to fuse my L-5 and L-6.  My surgery was a success.  2008, i slipt and fell after a rare snow storm and re-injured my back.  This led to another surgery that fused L-6 to T-1.  This surgery was not as successful as the surgeon damaged the nerves in my sciatica and left me with burning and numbness from the buttock to my feet in my right leg.  I have spent the last 6 yrs being on different opioids, muscle relaxers, and anti-inflammatory medications.  I even have had a neurostimulator implant in my lower back.  The procedure did not address my pain after a few months.  After many injections, procedures, and physical therapy, my pain management doctor told me the only thing left he could try to alleviate my pain was a morphine pain pump.  I was very scared of having that procedure done because of the many risks accompanied with it.  The risk of running out of medication and facing withdrawals; the risk of too much medication being administered; getting too hot and causing me to faint, and or death.  As I researched information on the pain pump, I found information about kratom through an online support group.  I was curious so I started researching it for myself.  I decided I would try kratom before I agreed to the process of having a pain pump implant.  I found the first day of supplementing with kratom that my pain level was not as high.  I am usually at a pain level of 7 or more.  With the research of kratom, I discovered other helpful information about other herbs, vitamins,and minerals that could all help me with my chronic pain.  I learned by taking different supplements that it also alleviated some of depressive moods.  I discovered wonderful research on cat's claw, skull cap, and turmeric.  Adding these different supplements with my kratom has helped me make the decision not to have a morphine pain pump.  By supplementing with kratom and other natural herbs, I don't have to take as many of my pain meds or my anxiety medications.  When I was younger, I could run with my children, play tennis with my husband, bike, hike, host parties and get togethers, and have friends and family in and out of my home all the time.  All the fun things that young people like to do.  Having my car accident and my depression, anxiety, and fibromalygia worsen over the years, I had become a different person.  I was no longer active with my children, my family, my friends nor with my church.  However, since I began to research alternative ways to improve my health, kratom has been the catalyst to my improvement.  I can now sit on the floor and play with my beautiful granddaughter.  I can plan to go to the movies with my handsome grandson.  I don't cancel plans with my friends and family as much as I have in the past.  I even made a 1800 mile motorcycle trip with my husband to 6 states in 5 days.  Simply put, kratom has helped me have some sense of normalcy again in my life.  I still have chronic pains and it is not all roses, but being able to supplement my routine with kratom gives me the boost I need to live a much fuller life than I have had previously.  Please do not schedule Kratom.  It helps me to live a fuller life now.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3829","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Vivian Allen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI am 30 years old, from Michigan and am a computer programmer.  I write to you today to defend a plant that, I think, needs continued research.  We also need to speak about responsible legislation such as a minimum age requirement.  But not a ban.\n\nThis herb has helped myself and countless others with a myriad of physical and mental issues.  In my case, it was anxiety and depression.  Kratom is a safe alternative to the prescription drugs that can be dangerous, addictive and/or take the living out of life.   I can now work in an office environment without the life crippling anxiety and depression I once had.\n\nThere are also those that use kratom for pain.  These are vets who fought for our country and people with countless diseases and illnesses. They want to use something natural, something that doesn't kill 30,000 people a year in this country, as prescription opiates do, and something that is far more affordable.  They also, of course, would not like to be labelled criminals.  \n\nPain sufferers have used kratom for thousands of years in south-east Asia without a single death linked to kratom alone.  Deaths of people with kratom in their system have been exclusively from a combination of other drugs, prescription and otherwise, also in their system.  Other supposed kratom deaths are traced to the lacing and selling of kratom mixed with other drugs, as was the case in Sweden when 9 people died. In some cases, it is an underlying health condition that leads to death.\n\nWe are at a point in this country where people have realized that plants like marijuana and kratom can be helpful to some people. This is a turning point for narrowing our focus with the war on drugs to things that are actually dangerous.  Spending resources and manpower helping addicts turn their life around and preventing abuse of prescriptions instead of banning plants.\n\nBest Regards,\nNH","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2944","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been in chronic hip pain for over 10 years as result of motorcycle accident and have had numerous treatments including most recently surgery this past year.

When I first began using recreationally, and even after I knew I was physically dependent, I believed that I was still in control.  But, eventually, it became a struggle and had a grip on me.  I ended up seeing an addiction psychiatrist, as I was struggling with depression, anxiety and physical effects.  We used suboxone to get me off of it.\n\nI ended up starting to take hydrocodone for recreation again, thinking I could now control it and had learned not to take it so much.  I ended up once again in its grip and started having scary physical reactions this time.  I'll be honest, I LOVED hydrocodone, because of how I felt and who it helped me to be.  But the withdrawals were powerful, and I started having very scary physical effects when I would take it.  I feared my liver and kidneys would eventually fail.  I learned of kratom online, and I wanted to permanently end my addiction to hydrocodone, and at the same time stop doing something that was illegal.\n\nI bought some non-enhanced Kratom from a smoke shop across the street, and it was my savior!  It was nowhere near the strength/power of an opiate, but it was enough to ween myself off, AND it was LEGAL.  So many people are escaping opiates, INCLUDING HEROINE, by taking a plant.  Unlike opiates, the effects of non-enhanced Kratom DO NOT keep getting stronger the more you take!  It has no effect on respiration.  I don't think it's possible to overdose...other than nausea or feeling light headed.  It can actually be frustrating to me when I take more trying to get more effect.\n\nI take it for mood enhancement, motivation, energy.  So, I will be in a great mood and be more productive.  It also helps me with my social anxiety disorder.  But, unlike opiates, where I would actually get \"high\" and would absolutely feel euphoric, I can definitely say those two descriptions I cannot use for non-enhanced Kratom use.  Of course if you take it every day you're going to build tolerance and will experience withdrawal symptoms.  But NOTHING  like with opiates.  Sugar, alcohol and caffeine are also very addictive.  I just recently got off caffeine after many years, and I'm proud of that, but it took time.  Alcohol ruins lives.  Opiates ruin lives.  Non-enhanced Kratom does not have the strength/power to do that.\n\nIf non-enhanced Kratom is made illegal, it will only further the opiate epidemic and will drive people back to opiates.

I am a 42 year old Pediatric Nurse from New York State. \nI have several degenerative discs that have caused me pain on a daily for the last seven years. For six of those years I relied on prescription opiates to control my pain. As per usual, I developed a tolerance to the pain medication and required higher and higher doses to get by. In turn, I became physically dependent and would suffer terrible withdrawal symptoms if I went longer than a few hours without taking a pill. The thought that I was addicted to opiates terrified me. It was like my dirty little secret that I tried to hide from my family, friends, and co-workers. I wanted to quit, but I was physically unable to do so. Inpatient rehab seemed my only option, however, because of my career I was not comfortable coming out as an addict. I began researching alternatives online and read about Kratom. It seemed too good to be true- that something so simple could heal my addiction AND help with my pain. I dismissed it at first, but I continued to see stories touting its' benefits. \nI can honestly say Kratom has changed my life. I take 3-4 grams twice a day and haven't taken Hydrocodone since May 2016. I no longer live with fear of running out of meds and going into withdrawl. No more counting pills every day and calculating when I am going to run out and how long before a refill. No more worrying that people will find out that my life revolves around pain pills. Kratom has freed me from that. \nPlease reconsider this proposed ban. There are so many people that will be hurting and desperate if the ban is passed.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22296","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Kelly","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me kick a nasty opiate pill addiction and now allows me to experience a pain free life without ingesting dangerous prescriptions.

I was very depressed and experienced back pain, so heroin helped with those problems, but created more problems as well. I became much more addicted to heroin than I expected, even though I never moved on to the needle or ever increased my dose as much as the people around me. Though I used very small amounts of heroin I was desperate to quit, and wanted to do it on my own anonymously. I end up searching \"how to quit heroin\" on google, and came across a page guiding people on how to quit heroin with kratom. I ordered some, tried it, and it relieved what I'd say was 80% of my withdrawal symptoms. Now I enjoy using kratom recreationally. I am able to take long periods away from kratom with little discomfort. I don't use kratom because I have to, but rather I enjoy it as someone would enjoy a cup of coffee. Not only is my bank account more stable without having to blow money on heroin, but I have the freedom to put the kratom down whenever I want to without going into withdrawals that would render me useless. I have never experienced any health problems using kratom, and I can't say the same about my previous heroin use. Anyone who says otherwise about kratom surely went through some shady vendor. I am not a person who wants to start using anti-depressants or any dangerous, side-effect ridden, pharmaceutical drug. So I am thankful there is a legal, safe, natural, alternative to such things. I know for sure there are people in more dire need of this herb than me. So making this illegal will make my life harder, but it will put other people's life in danger. That is the real atrocity here, the poor people who really need this because of a herniated disc, or arthritis, or anything like that will suffer. I personally suffer from scoliosis, and depression. So my life would still be manageable, but other people's life would be ruined.

It's far from addictive, I haven't touched it in a long time and I don't crave it or anything. I'm happy with or without it, but it gave me relief when I was trying to quit drinking. Before Kratom, I was a problem drinker (and used to smoke too much marijuana as well) and very unhappy with myself and my behavior while drinking. It wasn't making me happy at all, but I found it hard to eliminate cold turkey. I missed some aspects of the lifestyle.  Kratom allowed me to ease into my  new lifestyle somehow even though Kratom didn't have a significant intoxicating effect. It sounds weird, but Kratom is kind of a miracle in how it makes you feel OK with life and yet doesn't feel intoxicating. I have nothing but respect for the plant and would be devastated to learn that it were banned and taken from people whose lives it could easily change for the better or has changed for the better  in a number of ways. This plant isn't a bad thing, it acts more like a dietary supplement in my opinion. I hope you guys at the DEA really consider the scientific literature existing about this plant and realize it poses no real risk when compared to alcohol, cigarettes or the now legal marijuana.

I would be very unhappy if Kratom was made illegal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8439","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I know this is off topic but you should definitely read this article:\nMarijuana Legalization in CO, WA, AK, OR, and Washington D.C.: So Far, So Good\n\n\n\n\nOctober 13, 2016 - By Joy Haviland \n \n\n\n\n\n\nAs Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, and Nevada prepare to vote on the legalization of marijuana for adults 21 and over in a few weeks, all eyes are on the initial outcomes of those states that have already legalized marijuana. A new report from the Drug Policy Alliance finds a massive drop in marijuana arrests, no increase in youth marijuana use, no increase in traffic fatalities, and major fiscal benefits in states with legalized marijuana.\n\nIn 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first two U.S. states - and the first two jurisdictions in the world - to approve ending marijuana prohibition and legally regulating marijuana production, distribution and sales. In 2014, Alaska and Oregon followed suit, while Washington D.C. passed a more limited measure that legalized possession and home cultivation of marijuana (but did not address its taxation and sale due to D.C. law).\n\nDespite decades of prohibition and aggressive enforcement, marijuana remains widely consumed and universally available. Marijuana prohibition has been a costly failure - to individuals, communities, and the entire country. A marijuana arrest creates a permanent criminal record that can easily be found by employers, landlords, schools, credit agencies and banks and operates as a significant obstacle in daily life. The huge number of marijuana arrests every year usurps scarce law enforcement, criminal justice and treatment resources at enormous cost to taxpayers.\n\nAs public attitudes toward marijuana have changed, some states have sought to pave a new way forward. And preliminary data from those states bring good news.\n\nThe new report reveals that statewide surveys of youth in Colorado, Washington, Alaska, and Oregon found that there were no significant increases in youth marijuana use post-legalization. Tax revenues in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon have all exceeded initial revenue estimates, totaling half a billion dollars in new revenue for those states. (Retail sales have not yet begun in Alaska.) Legalization has not led to more dangerous road conditions, as traffic fatality rates have remained stable in Colorado, Washington, Alaska, and Oregon.\n\nArrests in all states and Washington, D.C. have plummeted since legalization, saving those jurisdictions millions of dollars and preventing the criminalization of thousands of people. Legalization, however, did not abate the disproportionate enforcement of marijuana laws against black people. While thousands less are being arrested, blacks are still arrested at vastly disproportionate rates, even though white people use and sell marijuana at similar rates.\n\nBy shifting away from counterproductive marijuana arrests and focusing instead on public health, states that have legalized marijuana are diminishing many of the worst harms of the war on drugs, while managing to raise substantial new revenue for their state.\n\nJoy Haviland is a staff attorney for marijuana law and policy at the Drug Policy Alliance.\nThank you,\nHoward Alexander Stafford","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2587","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"HOWARD STAFFORD","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I honestly don't know much about this plant but I think it's ludicrous to ban plants.

I am Sr. Software Architect at an international company.\n\nI oppose the ban on kratom (mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine) as I do not believe that there is any harm that has happened, is happening, or will happen to anyone consuming the plant.  I do not think plants should be banned, especially if they help people.  Banning this plant will not be saving any lives.  If anything, banning the plant will cause loss of lifes.  Some have used this to help get off of heroin which could easily kill them.  I have talked to many Veterans that are near suicidal due to PTSD and pain and for them, taking kratom alleviates the problems while still letting them function.  Others experience a large variety of effects that drastically improve their quality of life.  Banning this plant will not save anyone and will hurt many many people who use it to make life manageable.  I believe banning, restricting or regulating kratom is not in the best interest of the American people.\n\nAs for me, I first learned of kratom two years ago.  I was on a handful of prescription medicines for various ailments.  I had decided that I wanted to try to stop taking those medicines and try to use more natural products.  After quite a bit of research I found that kratom was reported to help with nearly all of my ailments in one way or another.  I have an open mind so I decided to give it a try.  I found a local store that sold kratom and they talked to me about how to prepare it.\n\nI do not claim that my findings are in any way scientific.  This, however, is how it affected me and I believe this should go to show that it needs to be seriously studied before any decision is made.\n\nI started out taking it every once in a while when I would have debilitating anxiety.  Minutes after having a cup of tea made with kratom my anxiety would subside entirely.  To me it was a miracle.  I was still fully in control of my wits.  I was not dulled like I had been with my prescription meds.\n\nI had a spell where I was under a lot of stress and I began using kratom once a day.  That is when my eyes were truly opened.  As always it had entirely eliminated my anxiety but additionally I noticed that many other problems such as IBS which I have absolutely suffered from for decades had vanished.  This was even more important to me than my anxiety as this IBS discomfort is so constant and so miserable that I hadn't even realized how much it had wore down my psyche.  It was like being pulled out from under a dark cloud.\n\nNow I use kratom frequently.  I also suffer from cluster headaches and though it does not stop them, it does make the pain bareable.  I do not want to go back to a day where I am unable to consume this plant.\n\nThere are concerns that it is addicitve.  I can honestly say that it does have dependency that comes along with it.  I recently took a trip to New Zealand and did not take any with me.  I had mild cold-like symptoms for 2 days which I'm pretty sure were withdrawal symptoms.  With that in mind I also, recently, had to quit caffeine for a week.  That was some of the worst headaches I have ever had and I suffer from cluster headaches.  My caffeine withdrawal lasted for about 3 days.  So when it is said that kratom is addictive, it is no where near as bad as caffiene is.  Please keep perspective.\n\nFor the record, during my two weeks I was in New Zealand, all of my other symptoms also came back especially the IBS so it once again assured me that it was the kratom that was saving me from those symptoms.\n\nTo this day I still normally have a cup a day and my health has been better than ever.  I feel great.  I get out and do things that I never used to do.   Kratom has given me a whole new life.\n\nI am upset and offended that a government agency would threaten to take kratom away from me while simultaneously insinuating that I'm some lowly drug addict and marking me as a felon just for drinking a cup of tea.  A cup of tea that has drastically improved my quality of life.  This is just my story and I know that many others share similiar stories to mine.\n\nPlease, take the time to do legitimate research and you will find that this is not a dangerous drug.  It is a rather miraculous plant that could have even more to offer than we know about today.  Please stop trying to make plants illegal.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJerry Kilpatrick","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1954","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jerry Kilpatrick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Stop criminalizing everything.

I do not currently use Kratom and I will have been clean of any psychoactive substance for 5 years on 11/30/2016. However, when I was trying to get off of suboxone, the maintenance drug that is used for opiate addicts, I purchased and used Kratom on about 8 or 10 occasions to help me to get off of the maintenance medicine. \n\nFor me personally it served as a step down from Suboxone to being entirely clean without worrying about relapsing on pills and full blown opiate agonist drugs. Because it is a plant and is not a full opiate agonist it not only helps addicts avoid the urge to relapse, it also helps them to avoid the behaviors they associated with drug use when coming off of painkillers or a maintenance drug like suboxone. Purchasing Kratom and using it did not remind me in any way whatsoever of the behaviors I exhibited when I used to get high intentionally. Using Kratom felt just as normal as using the other supplements (such as DL-phenylalanine, an amino acid) that I used during that time to help in similar ways, except they are considered to be supplements and not scheduled drugs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9246","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Morley Spender","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"RE: Docket No. DEA-442W - my comments\n\nCall me TJ, I'm 24, I'm working in food service until I finish school. I am an artist and musician suffering from a plethora of physical conditions and mental disorders, the majority of which were diagnosed before I turned 18.\n\nMy life used to be a mess. State healthcare wouldn't accept me, Covered California wouldn't accept me, I went into debt from medical bills and gave up on doctors. I began self medicating. I was addicted to opiates (including heroin, preferred ROA: IV) for several years. \n\nTo put kratom on the same level as heroin is simply preposterous. On heroin, I didn't care about anything, and I lost everything. Adding kratom to my diet helps me manage my pain, anxiety and depression while still working toward a better life. \n\nI first tried kratom almost one year ago, and it has completely changed my life. I can show up to work every day, I don't have to stay home because just getting out of bed is a nightmare. When dealing with people for hours on end, my blood pressure is not through the roof. My anxiety attacks have subsided substantially. My healthcare in the state I live in now is much better than in California, but it still falls woefully short.

In my capacity as a salesperson, I encountered many people who expressed their amazement and gratitude that a plant like kratom existed. Many customers communicated their histories with prescription opiate dependence, and remarked that kratom aided them in their recovery from addiction. During this time, I also began using different strains of the kratom plant as an alternative to consuming caffeinated or alcoholic beverages. In my personal experience, I found kratom useful for its capacity to alleviate muscle tension and body aches. Typically, I would make a paste with the powdered plant product to consume with yogurt or kefir. I also occasionally consumed kratom powder in capsule form. Although I no longer consume kratom products on a regular basis, I remain convinced that mitrogynine is a profoundly useful substance. I did not find kratom habit-forming, or at least no more habit-forming than a daily cup of coffee. Because I have personally witnessed the suffering of loved ones who ultimately succumbed to opiate addiction, I feel especially compelled to pledge my support to the continued legality and accessibility of the kratom plant. Kratom has proven itself useful for alleviating opiate withdrawal symptoms and aiding in pain management. It is my sincere and heartfelt hope that the DEA will consider its obligation to serve and protect the people's interests for self-determination in regard to our bodily health and well-being.\nRespectfully,\nTeresa King","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6840","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Teresa King","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I write today to thank the DEA for re-reviewing the proposed ban on Kratom and to urge that they do not move forward with a future ban of this miracle plant.

I believe that it can replace many people's use of prescription painkillers. I also believe that it has some anti-depressant characteristics that are useful. I think for the DEA to Outlaw the substance without further study would be very hasty and heavy-handed. From the research that I have done nearly every single death in which a person had kratom in their system they were also on numerous pharmaceutical drugs. In its native countries  there's literally been no deaths attributed to  kratom. I have left this comment because as I stated I believe that the da should not Outlaw Kratom and then it has many medical uses, particularly taking into account the current epidemic of opiate addiction in this country I think it would be a foolish decision to Outlaw such a beneficial plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13381","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gabriel Damiani","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a licensed clinical social worker who works primarily with children and families.  I graduated in the top ten percent of my class while working and raising two children.  I am also diagnosed with fibromyalgia and hashimoto's.  I experience incredible fatigue and insomnia, along with pain that can be severe at times.  I have been prescribed all of the various drugs recommended for these diagnoses and not one of them helped.  Some made me vomit, most made me feel worse and none helped.  I first came to know about Kratom through a drug prevention presentation and was shocked that something so horrible could be so available.  I started researching it as I do all new drugs I learn about, however what I was learning did not match what I was told at the presentation.  I did learn that Kratom could help relieve my symptoms better then the meds I had been prescribed.  I continued researching it and thought about trying it but was so scared I would develop an addiction and ruin my life.  During a particularly bad extended flare-up, I decided to give it a try.  I researched vendors and ordered from one that seemed to be reputable.  When I received it, I took one gram on the weekend, just in case something crazy happened and I couldn't work.  What happened is; no high, no buzz, however I had no pain and decreased fatigue. I was able to get off my couch and take my dog for a walk.  And feel NORMAL. That's it, it made me feel normal.  There are so many substances that have zero or negative health benefits (alcohol, cigarettes, chewing tobacco) that are legal and regulated.  Personal responsibility is expected.  Why not regulate this plant and expect personal responsibility?  The 15 deaths, most of which Kratom was not the only thing the person used, cannot compare to the thousands of deaths connected to acetaminophen or laundry detergent, but there is no effort to ban those.  One death I believe was a suicide, Kratom cannot be blamed for the suicide, mental illness can.  Please do not take away this plant that helps so many people be productive members of society.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1105","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marcia Kurtz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps me everyday with my opioid addiction.

I have read numerous accounts of individuals being able to stop the hard core drugs and eventually not even take anything as they used Kratom during withdrawal. I personally have used it when I did not want to take any pain medication during painful times.

Corporate interest poisons the people of this great nation and pollutes our earth. How many people die each year from prescription overdoses? Im sure you folks over at the DEA must know these numbers. In 2014, more than 14,000 people died from overdoses involving prescription opioids alone. Yes, 14,000! And yet, you want to make a beautifully healing plant which has no known overdoses, ILLEGAL for an entire nation of worker bees (I mean citizens)?! \n\nLook, you all must be smart and honorable people to have come to your positions in life. Do you really want to use your position to harm the amazing people of this nation in favor of BIGPHARMA? Is that really what your life has come to? If that is the case, then we really are living within the darkest ages that humanity has ever known. Perhaps you guys don't believe in your own spiritual nature, but if you did you would understand that when you harm others (which is the whole of life) you are also harming yourself. \n\nLife is continuous, and one day ALL of us will die and we will have to level up with the deeds we have done in this life. We will have to face ourselves alone in the void. I have learned throughout my life very clearly that force, threats, and control is not the way. It is NOT the path towards light, towards the betterment of humanity and a better future for our children.\n\nHope dies last, and my hope is that you all take some time to meditate long and hard on this serious matter of fate that lies within your hands. My hope is that you choose *wisely* what kind of message you are trying to send the hard-working people of this nation and to all of humanity. I am part of a generation of people that are awakened, and we see and we know what is going on. If another beautiful and healing plant is made illegal by force, something that is of a human right, a gift from the earth and something that actually SAVES LIVES and keeps thousands of people from overdosing on prescription meds, then you will be sending a clear message. The message that your interest is NOT really in the people at all and never has been but that your interest is in the >> $$$ << and in self-interest.  Self-interest is humanities greatest downfall. I thought America was suppose to be a leader in the world for human rights. What has happened? \n\nWhatever message you decide to send we, an awakened generation of people, will hear it loud and clear.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1847","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has really helped me in my daily life.

In the world that we live in, there are innumerable drugs that can cause irreparable harm to any member of our country - and are especially dangerous to a certain portion of our citizens. I am 26, but the better part of my adolescence was spent visiting my brothers in rehabilitation clinics for opiate addiction, driving them to and from family visits and doing whatever I could to help them get off drugs. However, like many others, only one of my brothers made it out of his addiction alive. At the age of 19, I lost the most important person in my life at the time, my beloved brother Michael Cappello of an overdose. The many years I spent helping him ended in a half hour attempting to perform CPR on his cold, lifeless body. I mention this because I want it to be understood that I can personally relate to the worst consequences that illicit substances can cause. \n\nWhile the most frequently, and often most effective, way that the DEA can protect the citizens of our country from illicit substances is through physical seizure, there is another extremely important route as well: through truthful and effective education. While the DEA cannot(and should not) regulate substances through popular vote, it is absolutely essential to the goals of the DEA, and ultimately the safety of the public, that the information and actions that the DEA is responsible for are scientifically accurate. When the DEA makes decisions that are not scientifically honest and accurate, it does itself and it's citizens a severe disservice by slowly eroding the trust that the public has for the DEA. The public perception (and trust of) the DEA is directly linked to how serious it's citizens take it's warning about illicit substances. \n\nAs a healthcare professional who has used kratom, I can say, along with thousands of others, that kratom does not pose any 'imminent' threat to the public. In order to maintain the best relationship with the public, the DEA should side with science that we have available, and withdraw it's intent to ban kratom completely. This decision is best for the liberty, helps multitudes of people that are use the supplement to improve their quality of life, and helps maintain a positive public perception of the DEA.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7937","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Peter Cappello","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There are absolutely zero reasons that kratom should be banned.

Simply put, kratom is a benign substance. It is a completely safe and natural plant that has provided not only myself, but innumerable others with a better quality of life. Additionally, kratom is not an addictive substance or one that is in any way a risk to public safety. If the DEA continues with their plan to schedule kratom, it will not only erode trust and relations between citizens and the DEA, but will detrimentally effect thousands of law-abiding, contributing members of our society. \n    I began supplementing with kratom two years ago. I had overcome one the most difficult times in my life - - a drug addiction. In treatment, I was prescribed an opiate maintenance drug known as Suboxone. I had taken Suboxone for around a year, but there were many side effects which hindered my quality of life and ability to perform day to day functions. As an opiate, Suboxone also carried with it the risk of overdose through respiratory depression and potential for abuse, along with being equally as physically addictive as other opiates. Not long after, I did not want to be on Suboxone. I wanted to live a normal life; however,I found that getting clean from my prescribed opiate maintenance drug was even harder to quit than my original drug of choice. I didn't want to be on Suboxone anymore though, so I did some research and found a natural supplement called kratom. Kratom was a miracle for me. It allowed me to get off of Suboxone without having to miss work. I found that I could lead a normal and productive life with the help of kratom, with no risk of harm to my health and no risk of addiction. Without kratom, my life would in a much worse place. I finally finished up my bachelor's degree, am looking into graduate school for a doctorate, and have a great job bartending and managing a restaurant. \n     I understand that the DEA's ultimate goal is to help protect US citizens. It's a difficult and admirable job; however their efforts to schedule kratom are misguided. Kratom is a wonderful alternative to potentially harmful substances, and have provided countless people with a new lease on life. This scheduling effort represents an unprecedented overreach of the DEA and the federal government, and following through will damage relations among the DEA and the general public. Together, we can prevent immeasurable hardship on thousands of people by allowing kratom to remain legal. We can mend and strengthen relations between the general public and government agencies like the DEA if we listen to common sense, scientific/empirically backed data, and public sentiment. Ignoring those key factors in an effort to overregulate will only hurt law abiding citizens in the Kratom community and further tarnish public perception of the DEA. it's time for the DEA to focus its efforts on the actual dangerous substances and leave Kratom alone.

I eat a couple grams of kratom in the evening instead of drinking.  It also helps me with my anxiety, depression, and PTSD when used as a PRN.

A pint of beer produces stronger feelings than a kratom dose. Taking too much is unpleasant.  You get a headache and become nauseated.  This is a key point and is part of why we stand up for it.

I have had back pain problems for a couple years and I started taking kratom about 6 months ago when I found information about it on the Kratom Reddit page. Previously I tried many different opiate pain medications and all of them had negative results after long term use. I became addicted to them and it was affecting the way I lived. After long term use of kratom I found that it is non addictive and I can take it whenever I feel the need to without the negative effects of opiates. Also after a while I noticed it helps me with an anxiety problem I have, it calms me down and helps me focus tremendously. \n       My final thoughts are that if this plant comes from the same family as coffee there shouldn't be no reason to prevent further research on it. We the people should be able to use the gifts that nature created for us without limitations. Kratom can help many people the opiate addiction epidemic that the United States has been facing for many years and it can save lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19167","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alan Ferrara","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a professional historian and university professor. Kratom has been essential to my well being. It gives me the focus of powerful coffee without the jitters. It is an excellent, mild substance very important to me. My 81 year old mother takes it for her lower back. In banning this, many lives will be adversely affected, as you by now know.\nI do not believe you can get \"high\" off this substance, though maybe a truckload would do the trick. Stupid kids can get high off cardboard if you gave them enough time. Kratom removes all anxiety and depression as well as any physical pain without acting as an intoxicant. Anyone using this as an intoxicant is a) misusing it and b) likely very nauseous right about now.\nThere are many professionals that require this for both mental and physical pain. It keeps us from resorting to powerful synthetics that are no good for anyone.

My name is James and I am a Vice President at an IT Consulting Company. I had back surgery when I was 23 because of degenerative discs in my lower back. Unfortunately the surgery was not completely successful. I had a partial laminectomy of my L5-S1 vertebrae and while the numbness and muscle weakness were slowed, I was in considerable pain. Pain from something like this is hard to describe. It feels like a vice is being applied to my lower back with pain that radiates from the area of my operation. During the day, with pain medication it can be barely tolerable. At night, is when the nightmare begins. For me, laying of any type exacerbates my condition after only a short while. Existing pain medications on the market are fairly short acting which means I can get to sleep but after about 3 hours I am awoken by pain. This starts a cycle of either taking more pain medication for another few hours or adding in ibuprofen or acetaminophen which is very hard on my stomach in any doses which would make a difference (Generally around 800 mg of Ibuprophen). It is like having to choose the lesser of two evils. As I have aged and this has become more of a problem, I have refused to take any additional narcotics because while they dull the pain, they result in fatigue and I must be sharp and alert in my position. The real issue is lack of sleep. I had tried everything from other types of pain medications to extended release, hot and cold compress, chiropractic visits, TENS units but nothing worked. I honestly felt like I was slowly dying from sleep deprivation. Then about 6 years ago, being at the end of my rope I went to a holistic medical consultant who suggested trying a mixture of Kratom with Green Superfoods. Almost overnight, I was able to sleep. I took the mixture before bed and the first night slept 6 straight hours. As I continued using this supplement, I continued to see improvements to the point where I was actually waking up fully rested. I could take the supplement instead of additional narcotics which was a life saver because no matter what, with narcotics, you always wake up groggy and fuzzy headed. This plant has improved my quality of life so dramatically that removal of it is terrifying to me. I just want to be able to sleep and wake up rested so I can be productive during the day and do so without more pain killers. Kratom has allowed me to do that; to provide for my family, help my daughter through college and see hope in a future where I am functional and can actually enjoy life. Please consider my situation and so many others in making your decision to make the derivatives of this plant a controlled substance. As a natural alternative to narcotics and opiods, it has the potential to help so many people as it has helped me. Please allow more study on the benefits of this amazing plant before classifying it as illegal and relegating so many of us to misery, discomfort and torment. Thank you for giving us an opportunity to have our voices heard and for listening to our stories.

Ever since i was Honorably discharged from the military, I was sent home on a nasty regiment of Morphine twice a day and Vocodin four times a day. After about two years of this hating the way I felt on a daily basis. I went searching for something that could help me that didn't control my life. Dealing with pain from all my spinal damage every day had run me ragged. After a month or so I found Kratom! I honestly feel it saved my life! I don't crave it like I did the Morphine and other narcotics they had me on. It truly helped with my pain in a way that let me keep my head and not feel so distant from the world and my family. I have since been able to come off of all the narcotics! This leaf is a miracle! You can't take to much or you simply get sick, throw it up and move on. From what I can tell there are no addictive traits. I always felt the narcotics drawing me in. Kratom did not do this to me at all! It gave me my life back and now if this ban goes through I've got to go back on to the hard core drugs just to function.  It seems as if the government is simply trying to stay in control of everything. Let us keep this leaf.. it has already saved countless lives. I'm a survivor because of this leaf. Taking it away at this point would simply give me and many others that suffer from chronic pain a death sentence. There are many other things you should be focusing on.... But this isn't one of them!

There have been 0 deaths as a result of kratom, although there are 15 reported deaths LINKED to kratom abuse. This means these individuals were also under the influence of know potentially lethal drugs like heroin and cocaine. While the CDC reports a jump from 20 to 660 in kratom poisoning calls(which did not result in death), over 10,000 deaths a year are attributed to eating laundry detergent. We cannot make everything illegal because it has the potential to be abused. Almost any substance can be made lethal in large quantities. Making kratom Schedule 1 also prevents scientists and doctors from researching kratom, and discovering any long term affects it may have - good or bad. Kratom has been used for thousands of years, and has helped thousands of people combat everything from chronic pain, to drug addition, to anxiety. With so many reported benefits and ardent testimonials I believe it warrants further investigation before being outright banned. Banning kratom may result in ACTUAL drug-related deaths when people start trying to grow it, buy it from unregulated sources, or return to their addictions. Please reconsider your hard-line position on kratom.

I have used kratom for about 2 years with absolutely 0 negative side effects, in fact I feel healthier than I have in years.

I urge you NOT to schedule or regulate this plant as it will cause so so many people to use opiates and other possible illegal and dangerous  drugs  which we have been thrilled to remove from our lives. I have seen the damage done by heroin and other opiates and the  current medicinal \"solution\" being  offered is no better.  Please stop focusing on the one and only thing that has provided so much relief for so many people and use the time to combat real problems. kratom is not a problem but a solution for so many.

Kratom is an amazing plant that has been in use for thousands of years. There have been no deaths related to Kratom, except those from contamination by the addition of various synthetic opiates, which is illegal anyway and has nothing to do with actual kratom use. \nI do support the age requirement to be lifted to 18. \n\nKratom has so much promise in the medical industry. I had a drinking problem when I turned 21 due to depression. After I started kratom, I almost immediately quit drinking and my depression has improved significantly. I can say that my life is much better off because of kratom. I suffer no medical issues, except for the occasional dry mouth which is very minor. \n\nI think Kratom needs to stay legal so others can use it for their medical benefit. Those who are addicted to prescription pills or heroin can find a useful tool to overcome addiction in kratom. Those who suffer from chronic pain can find relief with kratom. I strongly believe that it shows a lot of promise in treating some specific psychological issues like depression and anxiety, though I would love for more research to be conducted in these areas. \n\nIf it becomes illegal, research will slow or stop altogether. That, in my opinion, would be a crime against humanity because it shows so much promise in helping people. \n\nStop the prescription drug and heroin epidemic. DO NOT go after something that is helping in the fight against heroin. Focus your resources on a real problem, not the solution to one. \n\nMaking Kratom a schedule one substance will end up costing millions of dollars and will put thousands of people, veterans, chronic pain sufferers, people who only use it for medical benefits, in jail. This is wrong and anyone who takes an objective look at the issue will see that.\n Do not let the pharmaceutical industry win because they only benefit from the prescription pill epidemic.

Thank you for working hard to understand why we Americans want to keep a life-saving plant available to us and our loved ones.\n\nTo put it simple: the life of many is in your hands.\n\nMy story: In 2014, I got into a bad car-accident which left me with a broken back. When I came to, every move I made hurt like hell. Imagine your every breath comes paired with sharp pain. It was a nightmare. Doctors prescribed me the strongest pain-killers available, such as hydromorphone and oxycodone. These helped me a bit initially. However, I found that they worked by knocking me out cold. I felt like a plant for days, and I felt my life was slipping through my fingers. These painkillers affected my breathing as well, and I had to remember to breathe consicously! These were scary and dark times.\n\nIn desperation, I started looking for other options. Thats when I came across a natural solution for relaxing pain: kratom tea. Kratom is a tea leaf, in the coffee family, and it works as a natural way to help us relax. I learned it is NOT an opiate, so it is impossible to O.D. on, which is a major issue with prescription drug.\n\nSo I tried some, mixed it in with some mint tea, and after about 20 minutes, I felt my back-pain relaxing. It was different from the medications, in the way that I actually felt clear-headed and awake, as well as relaxed form pain. Soon enough, I did away with the other things and just started to drink my kratom tea instead. And every day, I felt like I could do more and more, and with the help of a brace, I started to get my mobility back. About a week later, I went back to work and I was able to put in a full work-day on the very first day. Before long, I was able to do a full work-week, completely present, productive and effective. All thanks to my daily cup of kratom tea.\n\nThis was 2 years ago. Today, I am a hard-working man with a positive outlook on life. I recently got engaged to my high-school sweetheart and I feel strong, healthy and happy. I have used kratom every day for over 2 years and it really feels like natures got my back ;) It is nature that helped me get my life back and made me gain a renewed appreciation for life. I have never had any problems or side-effects with kratom, and I feel that this tea is a healthy complement to my day, not unlike a cup of coffee.\n\nI now work hard in life, I exercise and I spend time with my family and dog. And this is why I value kratom so much; it NEVER takes over. Rather, it helps to support my physical state, so I can focus on leading a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nI honestly believe that without kratom, I would not be alive right now. So can you imagine why I feel so strong about keeping it available?\n\nWhat if, god forbid, my accident happened to you, or one of your friends or loved ones? Would you not want to have access to a safe, natural, helpful alternative, that has been used for centuries and helped hundreds of thousands of people around the world?\n\nPlease, for the love of all thats good in the world, do your best to keep this plant available. And dont just do it for the people writing, but do it for yourself and your loved ones as well.  There may just come a day you or they may need it, and that day, you will look back with gratitude on how you learned about this amazing little gift of God.\n\nThank you for your work, with all my heart.\n~\nMichael Gore","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5927","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gore Gore","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Keep Kratom legal.

I have been using Kratom for the past 4 years to combat severe pain that I suffer from due to a shoulder injury.  Prior to discovering Kratom, I was prescribed hydrocodone as well as various other pain pills.  The prescriptions did help me manage my shoulder pain.  However, the side effects were terrible.  The pain pills I was prescribed left me feeling foggy headed, unmotivated, caused mood swings, constipation, and made life, work and pain management pretty difficult to balance. \n\nAfter becoming frustrated with prescription pain killers, I started looking for other alternatives.  That's when I discovered an all natural remedy that has changed my life for the better.  I can honestly say that Kratom has changed my life for the better since I started taking it on a regular basis. My shoulder pain is much better managed, and I don't have any side effects from the substance.  I can take Kratom in the morning before work and can go through my day with a clear head, little to no pain, and absolutely no side effects.  There was one evening where my pain became so unbearable that I took more Kratom than suggested.  The side effect of me \"overdosing\" caused me to throw up for about 10 minutes and afterwards I was fine. \n\nMy sincerest hope is that you will allow Kratom to remain available for my consumption as well as countless other individuals that have found relief from pain, anxiety and other issues by utilizing this organic, all natural herb remedy that has been helping people for thousands of years.  We already have a huge problem in this county with throwing countless people in jail for non violent crimes every single day.  Making another natural substance that helps so many people maintain quality of life illegal would be taking a huge step backwards.  I still haven't heard of an instance where a person was harmed by ingesting Kratom alone.  \n\nPlease, please stop the pattern of making natural growing herbs illegal.  Not understanding all the details of an herb isn't grounds for banning that substance, especially when it helps so many people in so many different ways.  We need to be empowering individuals to make choices for themselves, not dictating what they can or cannot do.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to make our voices heard.  I still hope and believe that the United States Government will listen to it's people and vote laws in or out based on our country being for the people, by the people.\n\nBest regards,\n\nZach Fowler\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2492","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zachary Fowler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Years working as a RN in locked rehab and detox settings opened my eyes to the failure of prohibition.

While doing physical therapy and rehabilitating,  my doctor prescribed me opioid pain medication and it worked. It got it to be that was the only thing that kept the pain at bay but I didn't want to live a life controlled by a substance.  I have seen good friends go down terrible roads due to prescription drugs,  and I was not going to let that happen to me. I had pretty much stopped using opiods and just was living in pain at work.  As a flat rate mechanic, my physical readiness, energy levels, and my ability to focus determines my income so I was very stressed.  I did some research on herbal all natural pain relief and saw Kratom on a lot of sites. Skeptical as one may be, I avoided it just because it seemed like a hack. I happened to see a fellow veteran friend of mine who is now a healthy, active crossfit instructor.  In passing I mentioned my situation and he asked me if I heard of Kratom.  He told me that it works for him and he recommended I definitely at least give it shot.  3 months later, I don't even notice my pain unless I really push my limits at work.  I take 2 grams of Kratom with my morning coffee and and if I am sore after work, another 2. I remain clear headed and pain free!  Not to mention the synergy with the coffee provides a nice mild and clean  focused energy for the morning. I know that Kratom,  as with anything in abundance,  can have some negative effects. But in my experience,responsibile and moderate use doesn't result in any of those side effects.  With our country in the midst of a opioid epidemic, lives are at stake, and this plant could play a transitional role in curbing this problem, and do it safely.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6302","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kyle Mckibben","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My opinion is that these substances should not be placed into Schedule I at this time. The plant kratom (whose primary psychoactive components are mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine) has long been used as a staple of traditional medicine in Southeast Asia; it has also been used safely by millions of people in the U.S., and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement. Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, as the side effects and withdrawal symptoms of kratom are much milder than those of opioids. Placing mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I would remove this avenue of opioid relief, thereby worsening the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose, as well as furthering an overzealous war on drugs that is increasingly ineffective, unpopular, and disproportionately targeted towards low-income communities and people of color. Furthermore, placing these substances into Schedule I would also halt promising scientific studies that seek to codify kratom's potential use as an opioid treatment. While there are some legitimate concerns regarding the adverse effects of kratom abuse, and there is a definite need for kratom to be regulated in some manner, I believe that placing mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I is an overreaction that will ultimately create more problems than it solves.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18416","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Scott Jennings","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please reconsider putting any constraints on this supplement.

I was originally prescribed 10mg Oxycontin, and this helped, but only for a very short period of time, I would get around 1-3 hours of relief from a 10mg-30mg dose, sometimes I had to take more, sometimes less.  Eventually my doctor drug tested me and said I had more than oxycontin in my system than I should, which I told him point blank I had to up my dose, so was not hiding anything because I realized that hiding such information could ruin my chance at procuring the medicine I needed to carry on a normal life.\n\nEven though I told him I had taken more, he took this as me being dishonest, and I was cut off from taking Oxycontin.  I ended up buying it illegally from a friends dad, it wasn't until a few years later that I found kratom.  Kratom was a god send because it was legal, and I didn't have to take it numerous times throughout the day.  I could take one dose in the morning and feel the effects throughout the day, it did more than just alleviate my pain though, it helped me with anxiety, sleep, and gave me energy.\n\nIt's an all around wonderful plant, and I think it should be a persons right to treat their pain with whatever suits them best, as long as what they're doing is not going through some nefarious avenues to find relief.  I didn't want to buy somebodies medicine from them in the past, but felt like I was pushed into this positions by doctors that are manipulated by an often unfair system.  \n\nIf I have to have a job to support myself, or my family, and I am injured, and can prove my injuries are legitimate with MRI results, and doctors notes, then I feel like I should have a say in what I treat my injuries with, and shouldn't have to jump through hoops in order to find the proper medicine which works best to alleviate my pains.  I have to go to doctor after doctor wasting money in order to get prescribed something which doesn't even come close to alleviating my pain the way kratom does, and many of the medicines doctors give a person in pain, are mixed with other drugs which cause harm to the kidneys and liver over long periods of time, kratom has been safely used for a very long time, this information is available to anyone who chooses to not be biased towards one side or the other, and is focused on facts.\n\nKratom is the medicine I choose to use, and I want it to stay that way.  I don't think it's fair that you see a handful of idiotic teenagers who use kratom COMBINED with other substances, and this give kratom a bad image.  Kratom is benign when compared to marijuana, and marijuana is becoming accepted all over the USA.  I think instead of demonizing kratom the FDA/DEA should be going after the fentanyl problem in the USA.  Why waste tax payers money on something which is so beneficial to so many?\n\nI would have no problem having an age restriction placed on kratom though, perhaps 21+ years old to buy, like alcohol.\n\nThat brings me to another point, alcohol is legal for 21+ year old people to buy in America, and alcohol causes many deaths/cases of addiction every year throughout the USA, so it doesn't make sense to make something as beneficial as kratom is, illegal.  This really makes the law makers appear as if they don't know what they're doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6026","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ned Flanders","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my name is Adam I'm 21 and Kratom has quite literally save my life.

I have not had a single craving for those Medications. Kratom does not make me feel high or medicated in any way, I just feel naturally great. 3 weeks ago I was diagnosed for a second time with cervical cancer. I had to start chemo treatments again and I was so scared of going back on prescription medications to deal with the side effects. I decided I would stay on kratom and hope I wouldn't have to take anything else. I am extremely proud to say that I have been making it through chemo while still working full time and I only take kratom. Some days are okay and some are down right horrible, but I have stayed functional because of kratom. Last time I was in treatment, I could not get out of bed for days, I couldn't function and I was actually praying for the end to come. This time I still feel horrible but nothing like last time and my spirits are staying high most days. I wouldn't be able to keep working and being the mom I am if I was back on those prescriptions.

These injuries cause me pain if I move in the wrong way to this day. Kratom provides me a way to continue doing physical labour when I need to now without the pain that I experience. Its nerve pain I have so no anti-inflammatory or muscle relaxer can fix this pain though I have tried other medications extensively before I found Kratom. I have taken it for ten years occasionally with periods of sustained daily use and I have experienced no long term health or personal issues. It does not affect my cognition in a typical dosage as I found when I took it occasionally while studying Mathematics in college. I have had zero issue with addiction towards the substance and have not found such symptoms to arise since I moved home to a state where it is illegal and have ceased all usage for several months. I know that in significantly larger doses (which I experimented with when learning how to use the substance) it causes nausea, vomiting, and impaired cognition. Clearly these symptoms could be bad if experienced in an unsafe environment so I fully believe that attaching an age limit to the purchase of this substances is a great idea. I also would love the quality to be controlled by a regulating body to insure no adulterants are added in the importation as it is not commercially grown in the United States. To allow only certain alkaloids to be extracted and sold as a commercial pharmaceutical would be a negative for me as the particular combination works excellent compared to a traditional pain killer in that it does not fatigue you and given the way our current pharmaceutical industry works they are not mixtures of several chemicals but instead a single chemical. This would also add a significant cost that would make it prohibitive.

I did a lot of reasearch on it and eventually bought a small amount to try it for my self. I was very suprised when i made my first glass of tea. Other than the very bitter taste, for the first time in about two years i could feel my mind slowing down and not have a thousands thoughts going threw it. My fiance noticed a big difference in my mood and encouraged me to keep using it. I had a full nights sleep and when i woke up the next moring i had so much energy. I started going back to the gym and i have lost over 40lbs. Even my co workers noticed a big diffrence in my attitude. I am much more pleasent to be around because my depresion is gone and im sleeping all night. When I heard that kratom was going to be banned I felt that feeling of worry and depresion coming back. I finally found something that worked miricales for me and now I am going to have to start all over again. I really have no deire to get back on perscription medicines due to there side effects. With kratom i have no side effect what so ever. It is not even a \" high\" per say that it gives me. It is just the feeling of being able to set and have family time with out feeling anxious or depressed. I sincerly hope that yiu consider not putting a ban on it.

I do not own any stake or profit from any form of Kratom or its distribution. I am not a doctor, nor am I involved in any form of medicine. I am a 34 year old Corporate Safety director for a construction company. I have done my own research and sought many sources to make an educated decision on whether or not Kratom should become a schedule 1 drug. My comments will focus on the medicinal/dietary supplement purpose and not the recreational use. \n\nMedicinal Purpose:\nThe potential medical benefits of Kratom and other substances like it warrant further investigation and testing. From what I have read, in many cases it is used as a non-synthesized alternative medicine for daily pain management. Some references I have seen made to treatment are for a range of skin disorders, arthritis, after injury care, depression, anxiety and an alternative to alleviate the withdrawal symptoms of opiate addiction instead of methadone. These are just a few of the many I have read about.\n\nPotential of Abuse:\nAs an opioid and psychoactive stimulant, there may be physical and mental addiction possibilities. Also, distilling or extracting the components of it may be a source of abuse. Cases of death that i have read about typically involve mixing either legal/non-legal drugs, prescription medications or alcohol and in my opinion decrease the validity of actual causation of death. Without research this is left open for interpretation.\n\nAddiction:\nIn my research I have heard many people say there is no chance of addiction or any ill side effects. I believe to say that is irresponsible without the appropriate unbiased 3rd party testing. \n\nIn my opinion, there are not enough legitimately documented cases of sickness, hospitalization or death to properly classify it as a public danger, with no medicinal value. Doing so before proper testing is done and removing it from the average public consumer is irresponsible and counter-productive. Premature scheduling limits availability for large scale testing, and a negative connotation is associated potentially without cause.\n\nLike many substances criminalized in the public, media and in schools (i.e \"Reefer Madness\"), instead of regulation and eliminating personal choice, discussion should be around education and moderation.\n\nI will own that my references are specifically biased toward the benefit of continued public consumption and availability of Kratom, as the detracting statements I have read are largely from businesses that will indirectly profit from it becoming a scheduled drug, and media outlets that are publicizing it for ratings.\n\nI am formally stating that I believe that the testimonial results of benefits I have watched, read and heard, and small testing scenarios that are published about the benefits, the lack of large quantifiable detractors who are actual users who have suffered negative consequences, and the currently under researched potential have successfully persuaded me to request that this NOT become a scheduled drug.\n\n\nShort list of References:\n#iamkratom\nhttp://www.americankratom.org/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23iamkratom\nhttp://www.exohuman.com/wordpress/2012/06/kratom-why-its-illegal/\nhttp://heavy.com/news/2016/09/dea-drug-enforcement-agency-ban-kratom-deaths-opiates-heroin-united-states-penalties-testimonials-poison-control-petition/\nhttp://www.sagewisdom.org/kratomguide.html\nhttp://www.mitragyna.com/usage\nhttp://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-the-internet-turned-kratom-a-medical-plant-into-an-oxy-adderall-lovechild\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2016/09/02/kratom-devotees-fight-for-supplement/\nhttps://erowid.org/plants/kratom/kratom_basics.shtml\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7027","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zach Thompson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"RE: Docket No. DEA-442W \n\n Both my wife and I have had experiences with mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine in the form of Kratom\nthat have been positive and beneficial.\n\n     We use Kratom very rarely as an emergency pain relief medication in the event of something like \"throwing out\na back\" or a nerve impingement.

If you criminalize Kratom the latter will be true.  \n\nI find it very sad that the following fact is ignored by those in power: \nMore lives have been damaged by draconian laws than by most drugs. \n\nOur Nation seems to be drifting toward cruelty and away from compassion. I urge you to do your part to reverse that trend.  This cruel attitude is not new but has recently taken a leap forward. The following quote is an example from the past of this cruel attitude. It is also proof of why the War On Drugs is a SHAM! \nIn 1994 John Ehrlichman provided some shockingly honest insight into the motives behind the drug war:  \n\"You want to know what this [Drug War] was really all about?\" he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect. \"The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\" \n\nThe War On Drugs must end! Drug addiction should be treated as a medical problem not as crime.  (See the country of Portugal as a successful example) \n\nPlease also consider the following facts about Kratom: \n*  Banning Kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\n*  If Kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\n*  Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports Kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n*  Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to Kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on Kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n*  Side effects of Kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n*  Prohibiting Kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nPlease kick lobbyists from the Pharmaceutical Industry,  For-Profit Prison Industry and Drug-Money-Laundering-Banks OUT OF YOUR OFFICES!  \n\nKEEP KRATOM LEGAL! \n\nMost Sincerely, \nMrs. Charell W.

I am a 34 year old Marine Corps veteran currently managing a movie theatre. I have been using Kratom for 2 years daily to help with the pain from an injury I received while serving the U.S. and also to help with depression/anxiety from ptsd. Before kratom, I barely slept. Would cry every night. Could barely hold down a job or a personal relationship. After I started taking kratom I not only felt relief from all of those ailments but I also got my life back. This plant needs to be studied more for all of the benefits it could offer people like and unlike me. I no longer need any prescription meds (which brought me no relief anyway). I am happy again and look forward to each day. I was one of the quickest people in the company I work for to get promoted to manager in their history. I'm sure some of that was the discipline I learned in the military, however I know I couldn't have done it feeling the way I felt before kratom. If I take a few days off, I only experience a mild uncomfortableness similar to when I don't drink coffee. This plant has helped so many other veterans I know, and I only know how much by being one of them. If banned my life will go back to before. All the pain meds where missing a dose means sweating and tremors and excruciating agony. I am all for regulation, I doubt many of us here arent. Minors should not be able to purchase it and quality control should be done. However, taking this away would harm SO many people. Every story I've read of someone being \"harmed\" by kratom always shows they are taking other substances as well. This would be like saying \"well they all drank water also so it must be the water\". Please do the research. Enact the science before jumping to rash conclusions that could and most likely will cost lives.

I hold a full time position at a  university. I use kratom 2-3 times weekly for chronic pain caused by arthritis & fibromyalgia. Previously, I was prescribed high daily doses of both Ibuprofen & naproxen to ease my pain & inflammation. I did not like taking these, as they are very hard on my stomach, as well as I built up a tolerance and they really didn't help that much the longer I took them. I came across kratom and tried it, thinking it wouldn't hurt to seek a possible alternative. I didn't high expectations, as taking supplements in the past for me has usually been unsuccessful. However, kratom really worked for me. I use it very carefully, so that a do not build a tolerance. On days I do not take it, if I am feeling particularly bad, I will take some otc pain reliever, but I have successfully stopped taking the higher dosage inflammatory medications to manage my pain, which is a godsend. If kratom is made illegal, you will essentially destroying all the good that this plant extract brings to people like myself. I understand there are people way worse off than me who also have had their quality of life greatly improved by responsibly using kratom. The desire to outlaw something with such positive effects, something that is, in fact, less dangerous than alcohol or cigarettes, is appalling and shameful. Kratom, alone, has never caused death in an individual  (deaths allegedly attributed to it have been misreported, as there were other substances found in their systems). The is no \"high\" involved and it cannot (at least in my experience) be used recreationally. Reports of people \"getting high\" are simply exaggerated or false. Overdosing on kratom is also not possible, as ingesting too much simply causes one to vomit it out. I have never done this, but it is proven fact. There are far more dangerous substances (some of which are even legal) than kratom. How many deaths occur each year from alcohol? I implore you, please do not take kratom away from those of us it helps so much. Please do not force sufferers of chronic pain to go back to high dosage pain relievers (and even opiates). I trust you will make the correct decision to allow kratom to remain legal in this country.

Id love more strict regulation as I like knowing my product is in fact my product. But kratom has been the only supplement that has treated my pain with very limited side effects, for me, only limited to occasional nausea. Its extremely important to me to keep taking my regimen, because if it were illegalized i would have to go back on pain medicine and i dont want to put my body threw the wreck that the oxycontin i was prescribed, put me through. Not only has it aided in the complete  hault of a full fledge addiction, but my overall quality of life has gotten 150% better in the last 3 years I have been taking kratom daily. I drink it in a small cup of steeped tea, twice a day, 7 days a week. When I am forced to not take it(if i so happen to be on prescribed medicine like antibiotics or alcohol) I feel no more than a slight lack of energy and nothing like withdrawl of the opiates i would expirience after running out of a prescription.\nI hope you take my comment into consideration while making this life altering decision for MY life, and consider how many people would be going back to pain killers, that of the legal and illegal sorts. Consider how many overdoses there would be from people going back on their drug of choice, and finally please also consider how this plant;supplement can change lives, it did mine, and so many others i know.

Not to mention, it has the lowest potential for abuse relative to all the other substances out there, legal or not. \n\nMy relationship with kratom is not one of chronic pain, but of alcohol abuse. Before I found kratom I was drinking heavily. Kratom has allowed me to turn my life around, gave me hope and inspiration to become a better person. And I no longer have a desire to drink to a state of inebriation. Kratom has catalyzed such an important revelation. I can't help but think of those who could've had a similar revelation from its use, if it were to become illegal. This brings up the question, why is kratom becoming illegal, a helpful drug with little to no negative effects, while alcohol, a drug with an undeniable \"high potential for abuse\" and decades of documented severe negative effects, is legal and essentially unrestricted?\n\nI also use it to keep myself motivated and active each day.

As a result of the injury my Dr.'s prescribed Norco (hydrocodone) in large doses. Within a short period of time my tolerance had built up and I was prescribed more. Over time I because physically dependent on hyrdocodone. I have tried numerous times to quit including a hospital \"detox\". In the hospital I was prescribed an \"anti-psychotic\" to sleep (which made me twitch). I was prescribed Neurontin as a \"detox med\" and was unable to remember the name of my  children's school. \n\nI never received a single pill not legally prescribed to me. However, over time because of pain I would use hydrocodone again and again. This cycle went on for years. Until I read about Kratom and use as a \"detox\" medicine. I researched and purchased from a reputable dealer. Within 2 weeks of my taking Kratom powder I was clean from Hydrocodone and had very little withdrawal. I have used Kratom off and on for pain for several months but never daily and never increased dosage. \n\nGiven that 33,000 people died last year as a result of prescription opiate overdoses and heroin use has increased dramatically because people transition form pills to heroin (I have represented many who went through this cycle).\n\nKratom clearly had medicinal value and needs to be studied more for pain relieving effects and as a opiate withdrawal medicine. I have done extensive research on Kratom and have not found a single death from Kratom use alone (compared to the 100,000's who have died since opiate epidemic began in 1996 (the year Oxycontin produced)\n\nI understand big pharmaceutical companies not wanting a safe plant to help with pain and opiate withdrawals because  a plant cuts into their profits.

Note: I took suboxone and had serious side effects from this \"medicine i.e trading one bad habit for another.\n\nKratom saved my life from the grips of opiate addiction brought on doctors advice and was considered \"valid\" use of opiate pain pills. In reality it just made me an addict, the pain became worse and using and getting off all pharmaceuticals almost cost me my life.\n\nBanning Kratom completely would be leaving a \"miracle detox treatment\" which is much safer than any pharmaceutical out there and keep millions of Americans dependent on opiate pain pills or heroin and keep them from a cure.

As a child, I had JRA, which became osteoarthritis at an early age.  There isn't anywhere in my body that's not affected.  I have had 3 joints replaced at 50, two hips and a knee.  My other knee may need it, and one shoulder as well. My finger joints are moderately deformed and affect my hand strength and dexterity. Spinal stenosis causes me a great deal of pain at times.\nIn addition to surgery, I have been treated with all of the NSAIDs, which my gastrointestinal system can't tolerate.  About ten years ago, I began a maintenance dose of oxycodone, which has proved to be very effective for me.  When I started taking it, I used 20-60 mg. per day, depending on the amount of pain, trying to keep it at the lowest dose possible, getting it down to 20 mg. and sometimes 40 mg.  \nIn addition, I have dealt with anxiety and depression for most of my life.  The various treatments and medications have generally helped, but not always.  I continue to seek alternative ways to deal with those issues.   But I'm currently taking a large dose of Celexa, and a small dose of Klonipin along with a regular dose of Ambien.  I also have a prescription for a small dose of Dexedrine to use as needed (to augment the antidepressant), but I find that Kratom works just as well.  \nDuring my adult life, I have been able (for the most part) to continue to be active.  I love walking, hiking, cross-country skiing, gardening among other things.  I have continued to try alternative treatments such as yoga and acupuncture, not with much success.  Balancing the pain and the depression can be tricky at times, but I'm grateful that I am able to move and be so active!\nI can't remember how I found out about Kratom, but I remember hearing that it could help with energy levels and pain, so I did some research and decided to give it a try.  A reporter from the Wall Street Journal reported trying it for a week and wrote that it was like a strong cup of coffee, He did say after using it daily for one week, he felt a little tired for a couple of days when he stopped. Without the jitters and the letdown after the caffeine wears off.  \nAfter purchasing from an online supplier, I mixed a level tablespoon in a glass of juice, and I felt refreshed, like the cobwebs were cleared away in my brain.  I felt more energetic and went about my day.  Keeping the reporters words in mind, I did not use it every day, but every other day.  After using it for a couple of weeks, I noticed that I didn't need to take more than 20 mg. of oxycodone, and in fact there were days when I skipped it completely.  At no time while taking Kratom did I feel high or euphoric; I have read on some web sites that it can have that affect, but sadly, no euphoria for me.  But happily, something better than tea to get me started in the morning (coffee upsets my stomach) might be helping with my depression and seems to be helping with the pain.  I have been drinking Kratom (with its awful taste) for over a year.  If I skip it for a few days it's no big deal.  I function just fine, my joints don't flare up, and I don't become depressed.  But I know that in its subtle way, it has added to my overall sense of well-being.  Why else would I continue to drink this sludge-like powdered leaf?  \nIf I could find an affective natural substance with no or minimal side affects, I'd gladly stop taking the medications I take now.  I think that Kratom SHOULD be studied for its potential usefulness, but don't let it into the hands of big pharma, please.  They'll wreck everything and make it outrageously expensive.\nThank you for your time.\nLaura Pakaln\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0417","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Ms.","postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laura Pakaln","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Betsy; I am a 50-year-old professional woman and a competitive athlete of 25 years. I hold a Bachelors of Science in Nutrition and a Masters degree. \nI believe Kratom should stay legal.\nI live with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD and chronic pain. I am not a victim. I am an active advocate for my health. I attend psychotherapy sessions regularly, check ups with my health provider team and research treatments for depression and chronic pain. I learned I had \"early ovarian decline\" at age 37. By replacing estrogen and testosterone, I was able to alleviate some of my mood disorder symptoms, but not all. \nOver the past 19 years, my mental health care practitioner and I have tried numerous medications for the MDD (at least six+ different combinations), including Adderall as an off-label for treatment-resistant depression. \nIn 1999 I began to experience intense pain on the right side of my neck and down my arm. I sought out conservative treatment with chiropractic, acupuncture, and physiotherapy. In December of 2015, I underwent a two level cervical spinal fusion and in August of 2016 a Lateral Epicondylectomy and Repair of my right forearm. I have degenerative disc disease and a herniated disc in my lumbar spine - confirmed by multiple MRI's and consequently chronic pain in this area. Over the course of the last three years, I have taken Norco, Percocet, Naproxen and ibuprofen for the pain and post op recoveries. I have been taking Norco daily for at least three years.\nI realized, despite my vigilance with taking Norco, I had a developed a dependency on it. The low back pain is something I have on a daily basis. I have been open and honest with my providers about my prescriptions. I do not doctor shop. I have an excellent relationship with my primary care doctor and my orthopedic specialist.\nIn April of 2016, I tried to take my life because of the despair of chronic pain and the unrelenting depression. After seeing my therapist, I believe the combination of the dysphoria from the Norco and my MDD contributed to this overwhelming state of mind.\nIn September 2016 I learned about Kratom. I began consuming it as a tea in October. In one day I was able to discontinue my use of Norco immediately. The joy I felt after my first day, then a week of not taking Norco was honestly indescribable. The happiness of sharing this with my health care providers was also an incredible feeling.\nI notice that the small amount of tea I drink one time a day also helps alleviate my symptoms of depression. I discontinued my prescription of Adderall. I still continue to take a lower dose of my antidepressant. I still continue to see my therapist and health care practitioners.\nMost importantly, I do not feel \"the need\" to drink Kratom tea daily or more than once a day. I do not get/feel \"high.\" I do not feel \"impaired,\" nor do I feel any dependence or \"addiction.\" In fact, I do not drink Kratom tea daily. I could not say this about Norco, Percocet or even Adderall.\nI am so grateful that something like Kratom tea alleviates my pain and my depression. Because of this, I feel focused, balanced, motivated and most of the time, pain-free. I feel Im a better stepmother, spouse, and employee because I am not in the constant pain and depression cycle. I have lost many, many days (honestly at my age, possibly years) of productivity in work and life due to depression and pain.\nI continue to practice healthy lifestyle choices - I exercise regularly and avoid substances which can worsen depression/anxiety and aggravate pain. Drinking kratom tea has freed me from the daily need of painkillers and the pain-depression cycle. Kratom tea has been a gift of freedom. Having a chronic painful condition can limit your choices - that is why I believe Kratom should stay legal - as it allows a person to manage their health (in my case, pain and MDD) in a healthy way. From this letter, I hope you can see an individual who is educated and dedicated to their health. An individual who has been a compliant patient; who uses the least invasive methods of treatment first, who communicates with her health care providers. A person who believes there are many paths to well-being and is an active participant in staying healthy. I do not condemn prescription medications, nor do I condemn Kratom. I believe keeping Kratom legal is the right step in allowing individuals to choose their method of health and their option for choice. In an age where pharmaceutical companies have enormous financial stakes in this country, please keep Kratom legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20452","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Betsy Bougie","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I Feel very strongly against the ban on Kratom.

I'm a 23 year old mother of 2. I have a 2 going on 3 year old son named Harrison Marshall and a 4 month old daughter named Evelyn Rose. I've always had a job. I've had jobs ranging from restaurant server, cake decorator clothing store manager & even a full detention aid at the juvenile justice center. I've always had a great work ethic, and received many acknowledgements for my work ethic. I was a college student majoring in psychology with a 4.0. \nAfter I had my son, I went on steady spiral down with depression and anxiety. I went and got some help from a therapist, that I could see with healthcare USA at the time. I really invested and it did nothing for me, except get harder and harder to get out of bed every day. Once some of the postpartum hormones leveled out after having my son, I was still depressed and anxious but could function in society at a minimum. \nFast Forward. I was a full time online student, two jobs, 1 toddler, pregnant and Fiance was an over the road truck driver. I handled it well for a while. Then my depression and anxiety got worse. I started by quitting one job. Then it turned into quitting one job and dropping out of school. (Acquiring a bunch of debt from losing my FAFSA grant.) Then it turned into Quitting one job, dropping out of school and then only working 2 days a MONTH. So what did I do with all this new acquired time? I laid in bed all day. I would not go downstairs in my townhouse, because there was too much light. I would only feel safe in my \"comfort\" in my bed with all light blocked out and my door closed. I would hear cars routinely drive by outside my house, and just hearing them gave me so much anxiety my legs would go numb, my heart would palpitate and my breath would become rapid. If someone would knock on my door, I would harbor the exact same anxiety and cover my head under my blankets.  I never could answer my phone. I only answered my phone for my fianc. I couldn't talk to my own parents or siblings unless I built myself up for it for days. I always had anxiety of what people were thinking of me, and couldn't hold conversations. I would literally just shut down. People would ask me questions and I would just sat and there staring at the ground. The saddest part? At this point I still had my son witnessing this. He saw it so much that when he woke up, he automatically brought his toys to my bed and played in my bed all day until daddy got home. I tried. I really, really tried and I couldn't be a good mom to him. After taking care of his necessities: eating, diapering, bathing, clothing, I felt so depleted. I cried every night. I suffered from insomnia at night from anxiety & fighting sleeping all day because of my depression. My illnesses robbed my son of a mother. My fianc switched jobs and Found something local so I wasn't alone. It didn't help my depression and anxiety. So I asked my obstetrics doctor for medication. I tried celexa. I almost killed myself. It made me suicidal and made my self worth feel at a zero. I told my doctor and we stopped that medication and didn't get anymore.  Then I had my daughter, still suffering from my major anxiety and depression. Then from my delivery, something happened to my sciatic nerve and I suffer from sciatica. I tried to get more help depression and anxiety after I had my daughter. My ob prescribed me some Prozac, and it yielded the same results. Now I have fallen through the cracks. Unmarried, no sole income (but Fiance \"makes too much\") so no insurance. I couldn't get any other form of Medicaid because Chris makes $45k. After taxes and our kids insurance he brings home  approx. $800/week. He works 60 hour weeks every week. So I can't afford full price for any treatment. We can hardly afford groceries after bills. \n\nThen comes Kratom. Kratom saved my life. It gave my children their mother back. It gave Christopher his fianc back. It gave my family their daughter/sister back. It helps my sciatica to where I can walk. I can answer my phone, the door and I can even go on walks and go to grocery stores. I don't stare at the same four walls anymore. I open the blinds and the curtains. I clean my house. I am happy. My family is happy. I can play with my kids. Do you know how amazing that is? To be able to take your kid outside with the sun shining on you listening to his innocent laughter, and encouraging my fourth month old to roll over and talk, and to show her new things. I don't want to lose that. I don't want my mothering to be stripped back down to nothing from depression and anxiety. My diseases took away everything else for me. My family is all I have left, and I can't lose them to. I just wanted to let you know what impact Kratom has had on my life. God bless.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21900","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Delissa Coureton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a Licensed Practical Nurse who has used kratom for pain and anxiety for over 2 years.

I have used kratom occasionally since 2011 and it has had no negative impact on my life whatsoever.  I use it primarily for anxiety relief and sustained energy during my day, as well as during the evening when I wish to relax.  Due to the versatility of the plant, it has both energetic and relaxing effects, and it is the only herbal product I have used consistently for over five years due to its reliability and lack of any discernible side effects. I have experienced no signs of addiction or other ill effects from my use of kratom, and the vendors I have purchased from since 2011 have all been scrupulous companies that have provided quality, unadulterated strains just like any other reputable company that sells herbal and dietary supplements.\n\nThe DEA announcement earlier this year was clearly an ill-conceived campaign undertaken without any factual, peer-reviewed evidence of kratom's harm to individuals or society. I would support regulations such as best practices (cGMP) for manufacturers and importers that are already enforced on other dietary supplement companies.  I would support FDA or Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN)'s oversight over this supplement, to prevent false advertising, set standards for product quality and efficacy and other reasonable regulations.  However, I am wholly against any blanket ban or similar executive actions against kratom without a transparent regulatory process and further evidence gathering.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10844","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ibrahim Yucel","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe if you put a ban on kratom u run a high risk of patients finding street drugs.

I've never had a drug problem in my life, but I have taking painkillers before and just stopping cold turkey after a week has affects on the body.  Kratom was introduced to me by a friend who had recently had surgery for a hernia and didn't want to take addictive painkillers.  I had also hurt my back severely at work and was out for a month to help get my back stronger.  He told me about this natural herb that had literally got him back on his feet a few days after having surgery.  I was excited to hear about this news, but I will admit, I was skeptical about it really working.  I told him I would try it and see what I thought.  I can honestly say that without Kratom, I would not be able to work my physically demanding job and support my family without the use of Kratom.  My back still gets sore, but the Kratom fixes the pain as well as giving me an energy boost to get through the day.  I have been taking Kratom for 2 years now.  I don't have to take it everyday, and have zero side effects when I do not take them.  Please don't take Kratom away from us.  By all means, educate yourselves and other people about Kratom and make sure we keep it out of children's reach, but please let us continue to use a natural way to combat pain and anxiety and depression or any number of the various ways Kratom helps people.  Let's work together and make this world a better place.\n\nSincerely,\nChris Perry","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5115","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Perry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI'm pre-law at hunter college in NYC. I am studying to be a lawyer at hunter college in NYC, where I study international law in the room where Elenore Roosevelt drafted the universal declaration of human rights.

The love of my life left me over this accident, I had several nervous breakdowns in the aftermath, and my life had become painful to live. I was irrationally fearful, I was confused, I was heartbroken, and life was dreadfully depressing. Thanks to this wonderful plant, my mental health is now impeccable. I was able to get off of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications, my relationship with my family improved, my rational and logical faculties are sharper, I no longer live in fear, and I feel confident that I will be able to represent people in the legal system responsibly and effectively. I look forward to working in law, and working for the government.\n\nI love this plant. It has saved my life. I dont drink alcohol, I dont take illicit drugs. This plant is my medication.

There are thousands of calls to poison control that regard prescription pills and alcohol, so if kratom is banned, its time to ban these as well unless its inside of a doctors office. If kratom is banned then pills and alcohol should not be allowed outside of a hospital. I have chronic pain from a motorcycle accident where i have a metal plate in my leg. I do not want to go back to pharmaceuticals. They cause death and sever addiction. Kratom is very safe if its not being bought by a drug crazed teenager who wants to get high. I do not get high when I use kratom to cure my pain. I go to work everyday, I pay taxes. Kratom does not need to be scheduled like heroin does. That is unacceptable. I cannot believe the DEA would even compare the two. That is very pathetic and kind of greedy if you ask me. What needs to happen is a mandatory age for buying the product. Its is NOT FOR kids. Kratom is for adults who want to cure pain but do not want to become addicted to pharmaceuticals. IF an addict wanted to get an opium-like high then they will do heroin. Kratom is NOTHING LIKE HEROIN. I will be completely disgusted with this country if the DEA has the balls to make this great MEDICINE a street drug like heroin because that is the only thing that will happen.

I have massive anxiety issues and would have to take 4 to 6 Xanax a day to function. And that is considered safe and legal according to our system. I also had a major alcohol issue to numb the anxiety.   A little over two years ago my wife of 23 years read somewhere about Kratom and we decided to give it a try.  I was at a very low point and at the time was prescribed Seroquel, Lamictal, Prozac and Xanax multiple times a day and was still very debilitated due to massive anxiety attacks. I did not have a whole lot of faith in Kratom as I have been on every depression drug and nothing really worked.  I have taken Kratom two times a day with Orange Juice since then and now it is the only thing I take for my mental issues and I am doing great. I have not had a single drink in over two years.\n I am a IT Director and have owned my own business for 20 years and have never had more than a speeding ticket and work with law enforcement every day. The fact that I have been through every single prescription drug for my issues with NONE ever helping and I find a leaf that actually works and now you want to make it illegal makes me sick to my stomach. I am a law abiding citizen so I will stop using it if it is band but you should truly understand the devastation your causing to myself and my family by doing so. \nI am sure that it can be abused but in my opinion banning it is not the answer. Do some research regulate it anything. Just to not ban it.  People that want to get high can get way better drugs all over the place every day (like I said I work with law enforcement so I know) Kratom is not like those it is a life saver for me and I am sure many others.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1320","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI am submitting this comment anonymously. I am a teacher in my twenties with diagnosed anxiety and OCD and kratom has greatly improved my quality of life. I also have a history of alcoholism in my family and preemptively used kratom to stop drinking alcohol. Unlike alcohol and cannabis, kratom is not intoxicating and does not impair the individual using it. I very much oppose the DEA's putting kratom on the list of controlled substances. Research repeatedly demonstrates that kratom is safe and does not cause respiratory depression. Kratom should remain legal and be regulated to ensure it does not contain contaminants. Just like cannabis legalization, this would help dissolve black markets and create jobs. Please keep kratom legal. Please.

I would like to express my strong and heartfelt support of mitrogynia speciosa, or kratom, as a medicinally relevant and superior treatment for afflictions coming from not only substance dependence problems, but other common ailments and physical problems. For example, many people suffering from chronic pains of the back, joints, or even headaches find moderate but critically important relief from those pains in a manner abundantly more safe and less dependence prone than the relief pharmaceuticals may offer. Pharmaceutical treatments can be harmful, dangerous, and all too easily misused, even unintentionally. Kratom is highly resistive to overuse or overdose by virtue of the propensity of the medicated individual to feel ill and mildly nauseous, and thus disinclined to take more, or even to take as large of a dose in the future. This is a great abuse resistance feature. An overdose is typically vomited out, and the individual cannot consume enough to cause any potential extreme effects. \nAnother ailment that can be mitigated by kratom is the rapidly rising IBS phenomenon. Sufferers can gently soothe their stomachs and smooth muscles of the intestine with kratom. This is a far superior treatment to harsh drugs from the pharmacy. \nMy final comment is in support of making kratom less available to children or other inappropriate people. I would support making kratom unavailable from head shops pro tobacco stores. In fact I would prefer to see kratom only available through online vendors requiring a credit card and mailing address. As a user for the last 10 years, I can faithfully attest to the safety and efficacy of kratom as a health supplement with less inebriating properties than other legal and readily available recreational substances, many of which carry much greater risk to safety, health, and potential for abuse. Kratom is no worse than a good cup of espresso, though often more medically important for many responsible citizens.

I have been using kratom for about 4 years.  I heard about kratom as an alternative to opiates (which I had a problems with since I was a teenager).  I have had problems wth drug and alcohol abuse for my whole life.  Kratom single handedly helped me quit illegal drugs, alcohol, and even quit smoking cigarettes (after 20 years of smoking!)  For me kratom has quite literally been a miracle as far as giving me a safe transition to a new, healthy, and productive life.  I drink a very small amount of kratom tea once in the morning and then in the afternoon.  I have tried at least 10 different prescription antidepressants over the years and nothing has worked as well as kratom - and its all natural.  Kratom is wonderful because it does not make you intoxicated - it does not impare judgement or normal daily functions physically or socially.  It has an extremely mild effect that I can best describe as being an overall sense of well being.  I take kratom twice a day as a supplement (comparable to St. John's wort) and besides that I am totally drug and alcohol free and living without the lingering urges I have experienced in the past without the aid of kratom.  In conclusion, I feel, it would be disastrous for me as far as the progress I have made using kratom in my life.  I think it will be an almost impossibility to find a natural replacement - or even a prescription alternative that doesnt have terrible side effects(suboxone, methadone).  Please do not classify kratom in the same category as terrible opioids that destroy people's lives - it is no more destructive than a cup of coffee.

I wanted to stop these pain killers but my doctor said the blood pressure trauma would cause me to stroke,,,he was right,,, i tried to stop and it almost killed me, my legs swelled till water leaked out of the pours, my doctor then tried to get me on suboxone, i said no way that is addictive as well, so i was introduced to Kratom it helped me through the withdraws and then after that was over i changed to a different strain for pain, if im not active i dont use anything, which ive not noticed any adverse reaction to not taking, so please dont take Kratom, it has given me a better quality of life, with being pain killer free.  \n  Sincerely, Richard Russo","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16022","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Russo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Leave it legal you silly fuckers.\n\nMuch love Joe G.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14170","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joe Galletta","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom, pain and simply, is the reason I am sober.Thank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7599","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Scott Richartz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Krafom has helped my sister and brother in law immensely with pain management and mood disorders.

We don't want him to have to rely on valium, ativan or any other number of prescribed drugs do not work as well and have a high level of addiction. \nI implore you to consider all of the benefits of kratom and how many millions of people it helps.

I stand behind their statements made so far, and I trust in their ability to provide overwhelming evidence on the side of kratom's continued legality. \n\nInstead, I will give a personal view on the subject. To make a long story short: I used to be a fuck-up, as recently as 8-10 months ago. I was unmotivated, unsuccessful in both (university) academic and professional settings, and barely managed to get out of bed most days. I wasn't addicted to drugs, exactly--but I used them all the time, and I lost sight of my responsibilities, I lost sight of my friends and family. I was caught in a vicious, self-destructive loop of generalized depression, and I didn't see a way out. One day I read about kratom on the internet, and noticed that an increased sense of well-being was one of the main effects. Desperate for an answer, searching for a supplement that could help me climb out of suicidal ideation and self-inflicted misery, I ordered kratom from the internet.\n\nThe first time I consumed kratom, I took WAY too much. Approximately 35 grams. I didn't have a scale, and I mixed many large scoops of kratom into a cup of cold water. For context, the average kratom dose is between 2-8 grams. As you can imagine, the results were not pleasant. about 5 minutes later I threw up, and I was sleepy with a headache for the next 6-7 hours. I sobered up, however, and woke up the next day with no hangover. \n\nI mean for that anecdote to show just how safe kratom is. I took SEVEN TIMES the recommended kratom dosage. I had no lasting negative effects, and simply threw up. It was less severe than a hangover from a normal night of drinking vodka. Can you imagine if I took SEVEN TIMES the recommended dosage of Oxycontin, or SEVEN TIMES the dosage of heroin? I have a friend who nearly passed away from an opioid overdose this year, as he lost the ability to breathe (respiratory depression, which kratom cannot induce) from Oxycontin. This happened even though his dosage was only twice that of his normal amount. If it weren't for the hardworking emergency responders we are blessed to have in this country, I would have lost him. \n\nThe second time I took kratom, a few days later, I took 6 grams. I noticed an increased sense of well-being, a little pain relief, and a small boost in mental energy. It felt similar to coffee, although coffee makes me jittery and nervous, and hurts my stomach terribly. I noticed right away that kratom wasn't like other substances, as after I felt the effects I immediately wanted to do my homework. I completed it for the first time in months, and then I cleaned my room. I then called my mother, and spoke to her for half an hour. There was no noticeable comedown from the effects of kratom, and in fact as the effects wore off I merely grew slightly tired, as if caffeine was leaving my body. \n\nI take 5 grams of kratom every single day, and I have for six months now. I use it as a supplement at the end of the day to improve my mood, and boost my focus on household tasks and late-night work. I want to make it clear that kratom does not run my life. I have quit for 2 weeks on two separate occasions, and experienced no significant physical or mental withdrawals. \n\nI have turned my life around in more ways than one. I am in a committed and healthy monogamous relationship, I get along well with my parents, and my career is finally trending upwards. Did I do all of this because of kratom? Of course not--I improved my life on my own. But the presence of kratom in my life has been wholly positive, providing someone prone to bouts of depression with a subtle motivator and mood enhancement. \n\nI am a hardworking graduate student. I am a thoughful dog owner. I am a kind boyfriend. I am a proud voter. I am a tax-payer, and I am a patriotic citizen. If the DEA is successful in banning kratom, they will have added to the list. I never wish to say: \"I am a Felon.\" Please do not criminalize a nearly harmless substance that has allowed me to change my life for the better. I make no angry demands--instead I make an honest plea. Allow me to carry on with my art and my productivity and my kratom, a leaf that has been consumed in Southeastern Asia for thousands of years. Allow me to live as I have been living. Please don't pull the carpet out from under my feet. Please.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3108","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alan S","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Agents of the DEA,\n\nKratom is a harmless and helpful herb that has helped me to cope with migraines and menstrual cramps.

I've had to deal with anxiety all of my life and have been put on every type of anti-depressant to try and alleviate what I have suffered for so long. Nothing quite seemed to work and the side effects of some of these medications were unbearable. Try titrating off Effexor while going to work and simply performing the necessities of life, I've never felt worse. \n\nI finally got my anxiety somewhat under control with Citalopram and Xanax but as a result I was emotionally and mentally flatlined. It was not a life at all. I was just a shell of a person with zero desires as a result. This situation unto itself lead to depression and all that comes with it. I had IBS, my thoughts were that of a nihilist who was just hung up on life as a whole. The thought of living this way for the rest of my life consumed every minute of my life. Something had to change. \n\nI came across Kratom from a military vet that I met at our local dog park. He used it for pain and he also alluded to it helping with what I assume was PTSD. He didn't really want to relive his past and how he got to using Kratom but he was pretty emphatic on how Kratom had helped him.\n\nI sort of brushed it off but said I would give it a try. The following day he gave me a little bit and I told him I would try it. I took the pills that he had given me and about 30 minutes later I felt the effects. My inner dialogue that was always so negative seemed to have quieted for the moment. That alone was a relief. If anyone here has anxiety or depression you know what your inner dialogue / voice can do to you mentally. \n\nWhat Kratom did was essentially alleviate all my negative thoughts for the moment. And within that moment I felt like my head was cleared and I felt optimistic. It wasn't euphoria, it was finally just a different mindset that none of the medication I had been on ever offered. At that moment I just cried, I felt something different which hadn't happened in a long time. I was just so happy to feel something other than my flatline self. \n\nSince that day I have been using Kratom every other day. I got off all my other meds over the course of two months and that alone should be a reason for Kratom to be legal. I know it helps people with opiod withdrawal but I'm here to state that it helps with the ever-so-cumbersome withdrawal from anti-depressants and controlled substances like Xanax. \n\nThat is essentially my story and how Kratom has given me life again in some respect. My anxiety isn't completely gone by any means, but I'm managing it in a different and natural way. I gained 15 pounds while on anti-depressants and that is gone as well. Depression can also lead to IBS which I had and as a side benefit Kratom helped me with that affliction as well. \n\nTo ban Kratom is to hand some users back to the medicines that didn't work or made them feel \"better\" by completely blunting our emotions and personality. That is a road I never wish to go down again. The fact of the matter is that I have an imbalance that is anxiety for whatever reason. This is how I'm wired and it is something I have to deal with for the rest of my life. I didn't choose to have anxiety. I wish I was a med-free functioning soul but it has never been in the cards for me. I've been afflicted with anxiety since I can remember a child. \n\nI should be able to use Kratom as I have so that I do not have to go back to what I was on. This should be my choice and my choice only. Please do not take this option away from me and hand me back to the mental health industry that has given me the million dollar work up only to let me down. I can't go back to such a life.

This would put kratom, an herbal supplement helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\nI first discovered kratom about 15 years ago when I was looking for a natural anxiolytic and relaxant to help me improve my quality of life while dealing with chronic anxiety and depression.  I found this plant to be up to the task and began using it on an occasional basis prepared as a tea.  I found it to be a gentle relaxant with no obvious side-effects.  Around 2005 I incurred a severe spinal injury which resulted in severe chronic pain in my lower back and legs. In 2006 I had a 2-level spinal fusion which alleviated some of the pain, but also caused additional chronic pain my lower back and hips.  Since that time I have suffered from incurable chronic nerve and musculoskeletal pain and have been on prescription opiate therapy ever since.  \n\nWhile the opiates have been a blessing, they are also a curse as the Tylenol that comes with them is taking a toll on my liver.  About 3 years ago I made the choice to begin using kratom to improve my quality of life while dealing with chronic pain and to reduce the opiates needed to control it.  To my surprise I found that kratom greatly improved my quality of life and helped me rely less upon the opiates, so I gradually made the switch and I have now been free of prescription opiate drugs entirely for the past 2 1/2 years.\n\nFor me this plant is a miracle and it would negatively impact my quality of life if I had to switch back to prescription drugs due to a ban on this beneficial herb.  In my long relationship with this plant, I have never found it addictive or harmful in any way.  Please study this plant further and understand what a wonderful herbal supplement it can be.\n\nI ask you to please oppose any outright ban or any moves to schedule this plant or its constituent parts.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19727","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeremy Cranfill","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have friends that have successfully used kratom with no problems to help them get off opioids and heroin.

I am not a user of Kratom. However, I know a few law abiding people  who have benefitted immensely from this dietary ingredient. These  are people who I have seen make a complete 180 degree turn in their lives with the help of Kratom. They were in a constant cycle of making unhealthy decisions for themselves, unable to hold a job, and seemingly always unhappy. While not all of these things have changed (I won't even begin to say that Kratom can fix all of the worlds problems), I have seen them return to a useful working capacity and have been able to hold jobs and take care of themselves. One has managed to graduate college since including Kratom  in their daily lives  many years ago. I had recently heard of all of this effort that the DEA has made in banning this material. Honestly, it is one of the more heartbreaking and shameful actions I have heard about in a while.  I can't for the life of me figure out why in the midst of an opiate epidemic that is killing our kids left and right our government would want to take steps to make illegal a substance that has the potential to help. I do understand that my limited exposure to those who use Kratom suggests that it provides only benefits. However, ahead of putting this comment together I did a little bit of research to see what others had to say. It seems like the overwhelming majority of those involved in this conversation support its continued legal status. We already don't have enough room in our jails or money to keep the system maintained. Why make the problem worse by throwing more people behind bars over something so subtle and useful to those that need it? Please consider ALL the  facts before pursuing a scheduling of this substance.

Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

I have been using Kratom for back pain for approximately 4 months.  I am astonished at the relief I am receiving for an 11+ year issue I have had with my mid back and an ongoing issue with anxiety and depression.  I've had the MRI, the PET Scan, the narcotic pain relivers, but none of these have helped me as completely and as thorougly as Kratom.  I stopped taking Percocet 5/3.25 and began to take Kratom on the same day and I had zero withdrawl from the narcotic.  I received relief from the mid back pain within 15 minutes and had zero side effects other than the comfort of the pain leaving my body.  I have been mixing Kratom with my coffee everyday since then and I remain a functioning, positive contributor to society.  I have read more reviews than I can count on how many people like myself who have benefitted from the use of Kratom.  From quitting smoking, to quitting a long-time narcotic addiction.  \n\nI first found Kratom on the website, \"CNN.com\".  The title of the article caught my eye as it read, \"Kratom, natural painkiller or addictive drug?\" www.cnn.com/2016/06/10/health/kratom-opioid-withdrawal-pain-relief-supplement/index.html\nI had never heard of Kratom prior to this article.  I was so intreged with the possiblity of the relief and \"non side effect inducing\" suppliement that I immediately went online to find a local \"smoke shop\" in hopes of trying it.  I found one an hour away from my home and as it closed before I could get there after I got off of work, I took an hour and a half  leave from my job in order that I could get there prior to their closing.  Again- as above, I received relief within 15 minutes from taking my first dosage of 1 gram (two prefilled capsules).  I was so estatic that I went back online and found, American Kratom Association https://www.facebook.com/Americankratomassociation/?fref=ts and, Kratom (New and Current Users) https://www.facebook.com/groups/kratomtherapy/ on Facebook and became members of each page.  I then found larger quantities for considerably less than what I paid at the smoke shop, so I began orderding from the sourse and have done so ever since with no difficulty or problems, that is until the DEA became involved and there was a huge delay in obtaining the product.\nI am so convinced that Kratom is the answer to the opiate addiction problem not only in America, but world wide that I posted all the links I've shared above onto my own Facebook page for all of my friends, family and friends OF my family, my feelings towards Kratom and how I hoped if anyone they knew suffered from pain, addiction, anxiety, depression, that they would at least try Kratom.  I watched the program, \"Intervention\" on the cable television channel, \"A&E\" and they provided a statistic that read, \"10,050 people died last year due to heroin overdose and over 1 million people are estimated to be addicted today in the United States alone\".  Why is this allowed to continue when Kratom is available is so very confusing to me.  The supplement Kratom has been used in eastern medician for so long and there are no problems with their usage.  The one negative article I've read indicated 10 to 15 people died after using Kratom, but they further indicated that several other drugs including narcotics and alcohol were found in their system which would indicate Kratom was not the issue.  If taken in too large of a dosage, vomiting will occur as the body seems to reject too high of a dose.  Also, a seditave effect is felt as well if too large of a dosage is taken.  There are no side effects that cause harm to the user nor anyone around them.  Please reconsider your decision on taking Kratom away from responsible humans who are simply looking for relief.  Making it available on the counters in every drug store/pharmacy is the right thing to do, even if it means keeping it behind the counter and adding a strict 18 yrs or older rule to the sale of it.  No prescription should be required, it is a supplement, a leaf, not a drug made up of who knows what kind of chemicals that are in many prescriptions today.  Alcohol is available  to anyone 21 year of age and at any quantity.  The legacy of alcohol use speaks for itself.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my comments.\nSincerely,\nChrie Camp","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6270","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cherie Camp","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am not an addict  or in physical pain. .but I have struggled with mental illness. .I was on federal disability for 4 yrs. .unquestioned..11 yrs ago I started using kratom and have been gainfully employed for 9.5 yrs.

I work full-time at a non-profit. I am a recovering alcoholic, and I have been taking kratom as part of my regimen of health supplements for the past 2 years. It has been tremendously helpful for me as I ween myself off alcohol. Alcohol was destroying my life. Kratom has been a god-send. I do not crave it when I do not take it. It provides a slight pick-me-up similar to coffee, and there are no negative effects from taking it, only positives. \n\nI also struggle daily with depression and anxiety. Often my depression and anxiety are so intense as to be debilitating, interfering with my ability to go about my daily business, go to work, attend social functions, etc. I used to use alcohol to cope with these issues, and the alcohol would just make everything worse. With kratom, I can cope with my depression and anxiety with no adverse side effects. Kratom helps me to be a productive member of society. Without it, my depression and anxiety will once again become unmanageable. \n\nPlease have compassion for us folks who struggle every day, just to live our lives. We are doing the best we can. Kratom helps us tremendously and doesn't destroy our lives in the process, like alcohol, or legitimately illegal substances such as pain pills or heroin. Kratom is not at all like these substances and should not be made illegal. Kratom is simply a tea, related to the coffee tree. \n\nAgain, when I do not take kratom, I have no withdrawal or craving. I simply begin to feel my chronic anxiety and depression again. Please, have compassion. Keep kratom legal for adults. Making this tea illegal will do nothing except make peoples' lives harder: people who already have enough on their plate just getting through each day in a positive and productive manner. \n\nThis is my final plea: have compassion for people dealing with depression, anxiety, alcoholism, and drug addiction. Keep kratom legal for adults. Please do not take away one of the best tools I have in my arsenal for living a normal life, with no drawbacks or negatives. This tea is pure positivity; it helps me live my life well. Please keep it legal. Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15561","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Branden Dashiell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has many very helpful uses.

I worked at a group home for 13 years and was forced to leave because I was no longer able to preform my duties from cooking to cleaning or grooming a client or giving cares.  I am currently a preschool teacher. Without Kratom my pain can be so bad there are days I cannot even lift a child to hold or hug.

My son was a valedictorian, drum major, well behaved kid who all of a sudden during the later part of his senior year in highschool began to experience terrible anxiety. I cannot describe to you how difficult it is as a parent to watch as your child go through this. We took him to the dr. who immediately put him on an anti-depressant.  Fast forward to almost 2 years later and we are still struggling with this. He has anxiety and depression now. He is seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist all the while trying to navigate college and be successful which is very hard with these challenges. It just breaks my heart to see how this could just steal everything away from him. All of the medicines he has tried have not worked. They end up causing him so many side effects that they are detrimental to his well being. He has just recently tried Kratom because he heard that it can be helpful for people with anxiety and depression. He is taking a very small amount, it has taken him some time to figure out exactly what works for him, but he is noticing very positive results. It seems to help both the anxiety and depression. For the first time in two years we have some hope that something might help him! I would implore you to reconsider making this a schedule 1 drug. He is not abusing kratom, but using just a small amount to help. I understand that there are studies being done on Kratom and I believe that is a good thing but please don't make it illegal without fully investigating how many people it is helping and the benefits it could have in helping others whom also have found no relief with anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medicine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4265","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used kratom to help get off my horrible addiction to pain meds.

I had just a few months ago lost my dear mother, with whom I had spent the last few year at her bedside. A few months later, while driving and turning with a green arrow, someone ran a red light, which resulted in a frontal collision for both.\n\nThankfully, we all came out alive from this accident, However, my whole world crumbled so very rapidly. Depression is probably one of the worst things that can happen to someone. To wake up in the morning excrutiating with the fear of that huge and hollow burden to carry throughout the day. The piercing and contant paiins where injury had resulted only exacerbated it all.\n\nHaving learned about Kratom changed it all. I knew that long term pwain pill would be going down a slippery slope nd into even worse problem. Kratom, not only lifted my sever depression and allowed me to see the world with an optomistic, yetcalm andd focused view. It also help relieve much of the pain that I had been experiencing in my ribs, back and neck.\n\nThough things are not perfect yet, they are getting pretty darn close to normal. I now take a teaspoon 2 or 3 times a week but could do without at any point. Making Kratom a shcedule one drug would, in my opinion, take away their very freedom to treat their ailments with a conscious and safe choice. Would eliminate heart attacks and stress from too much coffee or alcohol. Would help many quit drugs, which has become such an engrained problem in our society, for those who use drugs as well as those who do not.\n\nMaking Kratom illegal would disenfranchise so very many who could benefit from resposnible use, especially in this age of Baby Boomer retirement. Sugar, cigarettes, alcohol, cars and even licorice can and do kill countless people a year. They are not illegal.\n\nFinally, I wish that those who want to make it illegal would try just a small cup of tea to realize that this whole thing has been blown out of proportion.\n\nPLEASE DON'T MAKE KRATOM ILLEGAL AND LET FOLKS HAVE THE DEMOCRATIC RIGHT TO CHOOSE.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8268","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I will cut right to the chase.

A person there, who overhead the conversation, suggested Kratom due to it helping pain management and it NOT being a narcotic.  \n     Our daughter, Megan,  my best freind, Judy, and myself noticed a difference in Greg shortly after his first dose.  He was much calmer, less anxious and agitated.  He was more talkative, more energetic,  and less confrontational with all of us.  It was like Greg was back to his old self. He started gaining weight due to him getting an appetite back.  He also decreased his taking the prescribed narotics in half.  He had even less depression episodes after he had been taking the Kratom for a short period of time.  \n     Greg was comig up with a plan to get off the prescribed narotics with the use of Kratom then he wanted to get off the Kratom.

I am 36 years old and I am a full time mother and caregiver to my disabled husband.  I am also a full time college student.  After countless doctor visits,  prescriptions,  and contraptions purchased in hopes of getting relief from pain resulting from Digenarituve Disc Disease and hip displacement I decided to research alternatives for pain relief.  Prior to my research I had already developed an dependency to narcotic pain medicine prescribed by the doctors with no resources in my area I could afford to seek help.  Instead I stayed on a constant cycle of taking the medicine prescribed for pain then taking the medicine because I could not stop.  I could not afford to not take the narcotic pain medication because I had a family that had to be taken care of regardless of my physical or mental state.  It is a horrible situation that one falls into,  not knowing the full extent of what will happen.  Upon researching alternatives for pain relief I found a article written about research done at a local  state College (University of Ms) regarding Kratom.  This article highlighted the effects of kratom on opiate dependency and the benefits of kratom.  I decided to find where I could purchase some and did so at a store in my area.  Since my first purchase I have never needed any other substance for pain or because of dependency on a drug. Kratom manages my pain so that I can function  without being in agony and keeps me from having to remain on the endless cycle of narcotics and Doctor visits.  For me Kratom made it possible for me to return to college and spend quality time with my family for some people it is a matter of life and death as it replaces her own and other deadly substances and allows those people to have a normal life","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11711","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Charity Crowley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi my name is Eddie Valle and I'm a 24 year old recovering addict that uses kratom. I've been to some bad places in my life because of my addiction, to say the least, but I've come out a better, stronger, and maybe a little bit wiser of a man now. I'm the kind of person that had to learn everything the hard way, so like everyone's addiction story, mine is long and it's never over. It is a mental health problem I have to keep in check for the rest of my life. Opioid addiction -- first the RX pills, then heroin, then methadone -- made me lose myself. Methadone was sold to me as professional help from people that care but the only difference ultimately was that my drug dealer was now a doctor. In addition, they replace my addiction with an even stronger one! If the argument to make kratom illegal is because it's \"replacing one addiction for another\", then how are MMT or suboxone any better? \n\nThe drug war has been a total failure. This plant isn't being used like cocaine or meth to just get high, the overwhelming majority of fellow kratom users I've met or spoken to use it for legitimate health issues. Veterans use it for pain or even PTSD, people with chronic pain, people with anxiety problems, and plenty of ex-opioid addicts like me that have found their way back into society as a productive member. There's always going to be some bad apples, you see it alcohol all the time and we don't prohibit it again, we regulate it better. While alcohol, tobacco and prescription drugs kill tens of thousands a year, there has never been one reported death due to kratom alone. I know this may not all even be read by anyone, but this impacts literally millions of good people in the country. You're really going to wave a wand and label cancer patients, wounded vets, people like my mother (who came legally into this country and has never gotten more than a speeding ticket) a felon because they don't want to be forced to give their money to the drug companies that started this whole mess? Please, listen to the people, accept that the tides are changing. They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly, and expecting different results. The drug war, decades worth of insanity, did not work. I just want to work, make my money, and live my life peacefully without the gov't dictating what I can and can't put into my own body.

Kratom saved my life by helping get my life back. It helped with my withdrawals, and then I continued use to be able to help my anxiety, pain, and depression. It's a wonderful feeling to be able to use something natural and NOT b high all the time and unable to work. I am a nurse and am able to perform my job to the fullest and never felt better.  There is no danger with kratom period! You're just worried about money. This natural plant is much much safer than any man made pill.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6409","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a responsible adult who uses Kratom to improve my wellbeing.

I deployed twice, once to Afghanistan (2004-2005) and once to Iraq (2006). And as you know, long deployments in a hostile environment can be stressful on the mind. Upon discharge, I noticed I started having mental complications when dealing with stress and paranoia, which also brought on a chronic migraine in the rear left side of my head. Years later (Fall of 2014), my PTSD, anxiety and depression, caused my body to develop an extremely rare auto-immune disease known as Polyarteritis Nodosum. The disease itself caused serve nerve damage in my right foot, both of my shins feel very tender to touch, and i have bruising under the skin along my blood levels, for my organs, to be thrown way off the chart. The disease pretty much is my white blood cells attacking my blood vessels. I am in an incredible amount of pain, as you can imagine. Electric type of shocks all through my shins and foot. Also My right foot felt like it was on fire with the feeling of pins and needles all over it. For pain , my doctors, Fall 2014, prescribed me with Tramadol 50mg to taken 4 times a day 2 tablets each dose. I was prescribed 300mg of Gabapentin to be taken 3 times a day and just recently, I had to change medicine so now I'm taking Lyrica 100mg 3 times a day. And for my leg cramps and anxiety, I am taking Clonazapam 1mg once a day, plus other meds to suppress my immune system. For 3 years, I've been stuck in that regimen and felt severely nonfunctional and my depression worsened. In August 2016, a friend introduced me to Kratam. And I thought it was all folklore and \"snake oil\" stuff at first. But after doing some research and trying the Meang Da strain, Kratom not only suppress the severe pain on the same level as an opiate/opiod but I felt focused and \"normal\" for the first time in 3 years. Finally, I am able to be awake and be somewhat functional like everyone else around me. Kratom has given me a safe alternative to prescription pain killers that are proven to be addicting. To be more clear, Kratom helps me free myself from my usual daily drugged up slumbers, caused by Tramadol, Lyrica, and Clanazapam, to being able to read a book pain free with no mind altering affects at all. \n\nFor the DEA personnel reading this \"long\" comment, please reconsider banning Kratom for good. Many us, believers, wouldn't mind if the Kratom was just regulated to ensure that the leaf powder was indeed of good quality and not a powder that's harmful or of poor quality. Also, have it tested for the positive and the negative affects, if any negative is present in the plant at all. Perhaps, after studies have concluded that it is completely safe, tax the plant and help boost our nations economy just like cannabis has done for Colorado. Again sorry for the super long comment, I'm just really excited that I've found an alternative to just taking my prescription pain killers and passing out for 6-7 hours during the day only to fall back asleep at night for the same amount of time. I'm hurting really bad and just want to be like everyone else in the work force. I hope that we all can find, at least, some sort of middle ground and keep Kratom off of the schedule 1 list.\n\nThanks for reading this, madam or sir. :) I really do appreciate the work you all do in our gov't agencies. Thank you for service. \n\n-Eric","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11831","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric German","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 32 year old responsible woman who is also a single mother to two little boys. I have a B.A. In Psychology and am a domestic abuse survivor. I've  been using Kratom responsibly for the past 6-9 months as a supplement to my Dr. Prescribed medications for Narcolepsy... I was diagnosed in May 2015. I have depended on stimulant medication prescribed by my doctor (in doses well above the FDA recommendations) for the better part of 6 years now. I have also depended on anxiety medications (benzos) to combat the anxiety the stimulants were giving me. I have tried every single stimulant on the market and almost every single antidepressant on the market. The stimulants came with a lot of side effects and I hated how up and down they make you feel. Nothing was ever consistent and I was always tired. It was a disaster, the pharmaceutical drugs helped minimally but did not get me anywhere near being a functional member of society (let alone a mommy). I haven't been able to work for the past 3 years thanks to my condition... My ex husbands child support, food stamps and my parents have been my only source of income for quite a while now. When I started looking into Kratom I was at a point physically where I didn't think pharmaceuticals could help me much more, so I needed another option. Narcolepsy can quite literally destroy your life and body, and at my worst I was sleeping 18-20 hours a day... I could not accept that as my reality because of my two children. I did all my research and decided to give Kratom tea a try- crossing my fingers it would help me. \n\nKratom in low amounts is stimulating and so I found that just a very small amount (1-2 teaspoons) a few times a day helped me tremendously. Not only did it decrease my extreme daytime fatigue, it almost completely eliminated my anxiety. When I first started using Kratom I had no idea just how helpful the supplement would be- not only was I able to stop taking Anxiety medications (benzos) I was also able to stop taking stimulants. 1 teaspoon of Kratom three times a day did more for me than 120mg of Adderall and 3mg of Ativan. I am feeling better than I have in a really long time and Kratom is a really big part of the reason why. My health is completely consistent and because of that, life is soo much easier. I've been thinking about getting a part time job in the next 2-3 months... I will not be able to do that if Kratom becomes a schedule 1. Honestly, I fear for what my life will go back to if I am no longer able to use Kratom. I love being healthy and have a right to choose which supplements, vitamins, and Rx drugs I use to remain that way. \n\nMy life with no Kratom will be one I never thought I would have to go back to. If Kratom tea is scheduled, I will be back to relying on just prescription medications to manage the symptoms of Narcolepsy. Adderall and Ativan, because there is nothing more helpful than Adderall and with that comes a lot of anxiety as a side effect. I will be ok one day and not the next, and when I say not ok I mean I'm literally not able to wake up and function outside of my bed. Within a month I will become tolerant to the Adderall and will have zero good days anymore... I will most likely have to get in touch with my doctor and have her switch me to a different stimulant in the hopes that it works. It won't, I've been through this cycle many times... I will have no option but to deal with the fatigue and will not be able to look for part time work like I was anticipating doing in the next few months. \n\nScheduling Kratom will not only impact me, it will impact my children as well. They have long forgotten the Mommy who was always too tired to play with them, cook for them and enjoy life because of them. I will lose so much more than just energy as I will not be able to spend nearly as much time with them due to sleeping all day. They deserve to have me at my best to take them to school, cook healthy meals for them, teach them how to play soccer- all things I can do now but will not be able to do if I can no longer have Kratom tea. It breaks my heart for them, for me, and for everyone else who will be affected by this. It is unnecessary and not fair- and I hope the people responsible for this know how much they are hurting people like me- you're hurting my children too and it's a shame there is so far no way to stop you from doing this to us. Using Kratom as a supplement is absolutely safe and effective. I do not think it needs to be put on any schedule- there is little to no risk of harm (and especially death) in the plain leaf form so please let me as a responsible consumer continue to use this supplement as I am currently.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1806","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jessica Clawson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep it legal, it is the only thing that helps my pain that is not a narcotic!

I do not get high 9r even a buzz off kratom so I do not understand why you want to make it a felony if I  was to be caught with it. I also know of many people who have used kratom to get clean from opiates so with the huge opiate problem we have, why would you want to take it away when it has the ability to help addicts get clean? If you make kratom illegal I will have to start taking prescription opiates which in turn could kill me since it causes kidney failure for me and my family since we all have kidney disease.  You will be taking away any hope I  have of ever living a normal life. Alcohol impairs people way more than almost any drug I  know, maybe you should spend your time changing laws on the things that actually impair you and stop trying to take away all natural options from the community when there are many people like me who want a natural alternative instead of spending our lives addicted to opiates.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21218","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not take Kratom but I do believe more research should be done before any drastic measures are taken.

However, in researching it, I have learned of thousands of people who use it to manage chronic pain, and who are trrrified of being pushed either into criminal activity or into using opiate medications that they rightly fear becoming addicted to. At a time of a massive opiate epidemic it seems utterly preposterous to ban a substance that appears to provide many of the benefits of opiate painkillers with greatly reduced risk.

Since then, I've been using it as needed for pain. I might not need it for months at a time, but when the pain flares up I'm glad it's there. Without it, I'd be forced to take drugs that impair my on-the-job functioning, which would only lead to a downward spiral.\n\nI made a conscious decision to reject the habit-forming, harmful opiates that impair my ability to be a productive, responsible, healthy citizen.\n\nThat's not a crime.

I started seeing a Pain Dr in 2011 and was prescribed 10/325mg Percocet and received monthly shots in my neck. I was told that pain medicine was going to pretty much be my only option to control my pain, and I would most likely end up in a wheel chair as the discs continued to disintegrate. I took percocets for about  a year and they were no longer controlling my pain, so my Dr gave me 10mg Oxycodone which I continued taking for a year. When the 10mg oxycodone was no longer helping I started taking 20mg Oxycodones. I continued the 20mg Oxycodones for several months until my Dr got in trouble and stopped seeing all of his patients with no warning what so ever. I did what I could to keep myself from going cold turkey due to a heart condition I have. I tried and tried to get a new Dr but nobody would see me because of my previous Dr. I lost everything I owned because I had to keep myself able to work and take care of my family. In 2013 my wife started researching hollistic alternatives to help get myself off prescription medicine and live a healthier life. She came across a plant called Kratom and read nothing but positive stories about people that had turned their lives around by drinking this tea. We purchased some and started drinking kratom tea! My neck pain is almost completely non existence after I drink a cup full, my blood pressure has never been better, my depression isn't keeping me in bed all day and I actually have a social life!

I started using Kratom several years ago, shortly after I lost my father to colon cancer. I have a 5 year old little boy who is the love, along with my husband who is an officer of the law. I've struggled for many years with shoulder bursitis in both shoulders due to having played sports most of my young adult life and childhood; all of which subjected to trying nearly every anti-inflammatory medicine available, including OTC vitamins, and even having cortisone injections directly into my shoulders in order to be able to do the simple things we take for granted on a daily basis. I suffer from elbow tendonitis, osteoarthritis and knee issues as well. The quick fix for the pain was always a subscription for opiate pain medication to relieve the excruciating pain when all other avenues had been exhausted medically to try and keep functioning normally. Throughout the years I have suffered from depression and anxiety as well. From a very early age I have tried every anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication you can think of; all of which either did not work or would not allow me to function normally (i.e. would make groggy, subjected me to blackouts, etc.) After having lost my father I knew I needed to do something to help myself function better both physically and mentally; I had visited with my drs repeatedly, I had done physical therapy to help with basic movements, etc.; and the worst of all was the pain medication. As a mother with a small child, I did NOT want to have to rely on opiate pain medication as part of my daily routine to get through, I knew there had to be something better; something natural, something that would not put my body through the effects of what opiate pain medication can and will do to a person. Rheumatoid arthritis also runs in my family, I see what the effects have done to my mother; I was determined to find something that would relieve me of all unhealthy, unnatural, chemically induced medications causing side effects. I researched and stumbled upon Kratom. I continued reading up on Kratom and its benefits, other testimonials from real people who have tried it and decided to try it myself. It was one of the best decisions I have ever made! I function normally, I can interact with my son, I can run and play with him, read with him, pick him up; I have the energy and functionality I need to go to work daily, to help keep up with our household. I am a mom, I am a wife and a kratrom user. Kratrom has allowed me to become a normal functioning adult again without having to depend on any unnecessary medications, worst of all, opiate pain medication. I have my life back bc I can use kratom as a tea daily, it does not interfere or cause any type of side effects whatsoever; it allows me to get through my days pain free and mentally depression and anxiety free. I can't be more thankful for kratom. Thank you so much for you consideration in allowing commentary to allow people like myself to express what kratom can provide as a normal way of life for those of us who struggle regularly with pain and other life debilitating illnesses.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21533","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Melinda ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Due to my military service, I suffer from severe back pain (degenerative disc disease, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis, bulging discs, sciatica, numbness in legs and feet), arthritis in my knees (one of which has progressed to bone-on bone), and periodic depression due to my physical condition. I have received on-going medical care since I retired from the military, which has included surgery, physical therapy, and multiple types of over-the-counter and prescription medications. Despite these efforts, I continue to suffer daily from severe pain. I currently take three prescription medications to control my pain. I have sought out alternative methods of pain relief. The best alternative pain relief that I have found is kratom. I am aware that the DEA has significant concerns involving kratom. However, from my personal experience, I can testify that kratom has a high medicinal value with no negative side effects. I have been using kratom for nine months. It helps my pain tremendously and has helped my depression. I have never felt high from kratom. It does not negatively affect my mental state I take kratom while I am at work and I have always remained clear headed and alert. I have never felt addicted to it and have never felt any withdrawal symptoms if I go without it for a few days. When I first started taking kratom, I accidentally took too much. I felt nauseous and vomited. However, my body experienced no other reactions from taking too much kratom and, after I vomited, I immediately felt fine. Kratom has significantly improved my quality of life and allows me to keep my prescription medicine at low doses. I am asking the DEA to not make kratom a schedule 1 drug, as kratom gives me, as well as many other people, a natural and safe way to treat their medical conditions without relying solely on prescription medication or resorting to \"street\" drugs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16211","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been taking Kratom for about 4 years now, since starting to take it for chronic pain I have been able to do so much more physically.

I have self-medicated before with other substances, but all others had negative effects that were not worth the benefits. However, with kratom I've found that a few grams in a tea every morning and afternoon drastically reduces my anxiety with virtually no negative effects. \n\nThe effects I notice can be described as a strong cup of coffee that gives me energy without making me jittery, and a slight sense of well-being without any real disturbances to my thought process. I can perfectly function at home and at work-- actually it improves my productivity in many cases-- and once the effects start to fade I feel quite normal again without any dip in mood or energy. \n\nI have never used it for treating opioid addiction, but have read many anecdotal accounts of kratom playing a crucial role in weaning one off more dangerous opiates such prescription painkillers as codeine, fentanyl, and hydrocodone, and street drugs like heroin. I believe that placing mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I would simply be fueling the prescription painkiller addiction epidemic that this country is currently experiencing, and possibly supporting the pharmaceutical companies that may have interest in these chemicals. \n\nI could not believe my eyes when I saw the patent on these active alkaloids, \"Methods For Treating Withdrawal From Addictive Compounds\" (patent number: US 20100209542 A1), yet still somehow the DEA wishes to place them into a category for chemicals with no accepted medical use. The hypocrisy is unbelievable and I can only begin to speculate that this discrepancy has come from a lack of communication rather than any profit-motivated interests on the part of any types of pharmaceutical corporations.\n\nFor the reasons I've stated above, I sincerely hope that kratom will remain a legal, freely-available supplement that will continue to benefit millions of Americans every day. However, I also believe that some system of regulation to ensure quality and potency, as with any substance for human consumption, would be beneficial in furthering the usefulness of this amazing plant and its compounds.

I was extremely depressed and addicted to pain pills and alcohol. The alcohol I used to help numb the pain to get through my day. 8 months ago I couldn't play with my kids, I couldn't cook, clean or work. I completely depended on my husband to do it all. I was miserable and didn't want to live anymore. 8 months ago I ran out of my pain pills and was in horrible withdraw. Out of desperation I got onto my computer, logged into Facebook and typed in the words \"Opiate Addicts.\" I found a group of people who were in the same situation as me. It was in this group where I learned about Kratom. So many people were talking about this wonderful plant and how it helped them fight their opiate addiction, and control their pain and depression. After much research, I thought it was worth a try. It couldn't get any worse than it already was. The very first time I drank kratom tea I could tell an immediate difference. It didn't get me high or make me feel loopy like the pain pills had done. I just felt the pain slowly leave my body. I felt so happy I wanted to dance.\n Since I started my Kratom journey 8 months ago my quality of life has improved immensely! Kratom had helped me to get off all opiate pain medication. It has also helped me stop drinking completely and now I can play with my kids and cook for my family. I can now go on hikes with my husband and I can work, something I haven't done in over 8 years. Kratom helped save my life. We shouldn't be fighting to save this harmless plant. Instead we should be praising it and doing more studies on it. Kratom could be our answer to the opiate epidemic and you're trying to ban it.

I worry because the addicts we see are our family, our respected co-workers, our friends - certainly not the criminals that are stereotyped. There should be other options to get these folks back to a normal, contributing life. I think we should look at Kratom as possibly doing that.\n\nThe mainstay press has seemed to embrace the possibilities of Kartom.I am impressed my the number of legit publications that seem to promote the research on Kratom.\n\nForbes\nwww.forbes.com/sites/sarahhedgecock/2016/11/21/what-you-need-to-know-about-kratom-before-december-1/#6e978d37385e\n\nSafer Painkillers - Scientific American\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/recreational-drug-kratom-hits-the-same-brain-receptors-as-strong-opioids/\n\n&and lots of stories on the news networks like CNN.\nPlease reconsider any ban on this potentially beneficial plant. I believe it would be a step backwards for our country.\nThanks in advance, Randolph A Hayes","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14641","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Randolph Hayes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my name is John. I've recently found out about Kratom within the last year or so. Let me give you a little backround on myself. When I was 18 (1998) I got out of Allegheny County Jail in Pittsburgh, I was released with a heroin dealer we will call him \"Dirt\" and he gave me the first taste of dope I'd ever had. After that I was off and running. Not getting clean from heroin until 2011 (9/21/2011) to be exact with the help of Suboxone. I am now 5 years into Suboxone maintenance therapy and I'm ready to begin to taper my dose down and detox. Kratom has a unique pharmacology and can be/is very beneficial to people like me. For whatever reason my MU1 opioid receptor has needs that under the \"Prohibition Model\" will eventually kill me. This death would be caused by the irregular black market or a no knock raid but not from Kratom. You guys have to know by now prohibition isn't working especially for addicts/recovering addicts like myself. So why try to schedule 1 a botanical that has very similar pharmacology to the molecule that is cureently a schedule2? That in itself speaks volumes.  Kratom as I understand it has a ceiling dose much like Suboxone where if you take over a certain amount your body gets rid of it at no danger to the user. I'm using Kratom to ease my suffering during this Suboxone detox.  Kratom won't replace Suboxone on my MU1 because of the binding affinity of Bupenorphine. But as space on my MU1 receptors opens up I believe Kratom can fill the gap and aid in my success. I have lost over half of my life to opiates and I know an opiate when I take one, Kratom is NOT an opiate. My real concern about your rush to make Kratom a schedule 1 drug is that it reeks of collusion with pharmaceutical companies and other entities to which someone like me is a paycheck for awhile and then when I die or relapse there will be another person to fill my place on the opiate replacement maintenance conveyor belt. I've seen 2 patents so far that I'm sure will be used in the arena that Methadone and Suboxone are now used in. Kratom has helped me see that I can get off of sythetic opiates and use a plant as mother nature intended. Maybe that is bad news for pharmaceutical companies but they aren't interested in cures just a long drawn out treatment that is very difficult to detox from. Suboxone is so much worse to detox from than heroin. Because of the drug war and it's ideology and edicts though people like me have FEW options had I known about Kratom I would've detoxed from heroin with it giving me a better chance at not relapsing from a PAWS symptom. Does it feel good to you guys to remove a treatment option from someone sick and suffering from addiction? Because you're awfully eager (It seems that way at least)! I say leave Kratom alone and let it be used as a supplement. The more you guys prohibit something the more it drives demand and that demand creates an black market where a person cannot be sure what they are getting is a sound substance. Just like right now in PA and OH heroin overdoses are at an epidemic rate not because of exceptionally pure heroin but because of the irregular black market and its merchants. Overdoses are driven by varying potency of drugs on the black market. Why do cartels and narco states decide what chemicals to dole out to Americans who suffer from a disease? Kratom is helping people all across the country to be free of opiates, do you really want to stop that? Finally I want to say thank you for reading this diatribe. I know that you guys are just doing your jobs but if you are driving people back out to illegal opiates and maintenance opiates how does that help at all? How can you masquerade that into a \"Concern for the public\" when it is nothing more than a detriment to the public.Unless of course my suspicion is correct and pharmaceutical corporations are using you as an enforcement arm to protect their bottom line. I don't want to be victimized by prohibition any more than I have been. What you tried and failed to do to Kratom only leaves people like me in it's wake. I am sick I suffer from a deadly and progressive disease, I did not want this disease and yet here I am. Kratom helps me daily in my struggle to be free forever from opiates both prescribed and street and I know it can help me. If you want to hurt drug dealers kingpins and their unscrupulous minions bring the war on drugs to an end so people like me who have infinite potential to do good can come out of the shadows, stigma free and help make society in America more compassionate and inclusive nation.  Thank you for doing the particular job you do. My beliefs are no doubt the polar opposite of yours(The reader) but when you remove that uniform or suit you are a human being just like I am, flawed just like I am, maybe in different ways but flawed. Because GOD created us flawed first and equal second. I hope this helps in the decision process. I'll say thank you one last time!

I have had very little help from Doctors ! I have taken every medication that they have thrown at me, went through test after test, paid outrageous dr and hospital bills , only to be told there is nothing they can do! Then when I ask to get any kind of medicine for my pain I am treated like a complete drug addict or felon straight out of prison!   I even had a dr tell me I should just quit my job if I am in that much pain , he said maybe if I hurt bad enough to quit work he may consider giving me some pain medication !!!!  Well if I quit my job I could just lay around the house and not need medication ! \nSo I finally found this wonderful , natural pain relief called Kratom!!!  i am proud to be a working memeber of society and do not want to be on the \"\"system\"\" like so so many in the USA! I live in Southeastern Ohio where  there are more people on Welfare and Disability then people who actually hold down jobs ! With KRATOM I am able to do my job, 12 hours a day on my feet , I am able to do my house work and keep my house nice a clean like I enjoy! I truly believe without this I will end up on disability way before time for me to retire unfortunately!

I am a retired carpenter of 30 years. I have severe neck and back pain from injuries sustained over a thirty year career in the heavy construction industry building hospitals, schools and high rise buildings. I retired at age 55 from my career and am now living on social security disability and a small pension. I did the whole prescription pain killer (narcotics) thing but it only led to dependency and eventually stopped working altogether. I entered into a 6 week rehabilitation program in order to stop the prescription pain killers. When I returned home I sunk into a severe depression along with continuing to deal with the pain from my injuries. I often spent days in bed at a time, only getting up when it was absolutely necessary. I could barely even eat. I have seen doctors and psychiatrists who prescribed many different anti-depressents for depression and none of them have worked for me.  After almost 5 years of suffering daily from this debilitating depression and physical pain, I discovered the supplement Kratom. By taking a small amount of Kratom tea each day, I'm able to manage my life and get out of bed and do things such as grocery shopping, preparing meals and even playing with my three granddaughters. I'm spending this Thanksgiving weekend at a cabin with my family. Before I found Kratom, I would have just stayed home in bed. Kratom is not something you use to get high like drugs or alcohol. It just lifts the fog of my depression enough so that I can participate in life. Kratom also helps relieve the physical pain that I have to deal with every day. Please don't make this life saving supplement illegal. I can't imagine going back to the way my life was before discovering Kratom.

In high school, I would try my hardest to not be noticed by anyone. In college, I was required to do a lot of presentations in front of audiences. My legs would shake while I was standing in front of the class sometimes due to being so nervous. I would also be extremely uncomfortable around people I didn't know. I never went to a doctor and got anything diagnosed, but I believe I had some form of social anxiety.\n\nI found kratom while looking for ways to combat anxiety. I read about it, educated myself on different strains and how to rotate them, and decided to give it a try. It turned out to be very effective for me. For at least 4, maybe even 5 or 6 semesters in college, I used kratom to help myself stay focused in class and relieve anxiety. This allowed me to get more out of my classes and do better in presentations. I was less worried about other people and more focused on the material. I no longer had shaky legs during presentations. I even had one teacher say I had a good \"stage presence\".\n\nDuring the time that I used kratom to combat my anxiety I looked for a more permanent solution. I found a diet change that wound up being exactly what I needed. Once I made the diet change I stopped using kratom on any kind of regular basis and experienced no withdrawal whatsoever. I never once had any kind of craving for it, even when I was using it the most (which was probably once or twice a day for 4 days a week over at least 2 semesters). \n\nI earned a business degree with honors from CSU Fullerton. While I believe I could have achieved this on my own, it definitely would have been much harder without kratom. \n\nI believe kratom should be legal because of its potential for medical use. I'm sure there will be many people who write in with stories about using kratom for pain or to combat addiction. There are also probably many people like me out there who could use it to overcome anxiety instead of using something potentially addictive and dangerous like klonopin.\n\nToday I rarely use kratom. It is still useful for stressful situations, but I don't run into those very often now that I've fixed my diet and beaten anxiety. I still keep a small amount at home though, because I have experienced firsthand how helpful it can be.\n\nThank you for reading this. It is my hope that more research will be done on kratom to show that it is a safe compound that can help many people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18122","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steven Wright","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"When I first started with kratom it was to help me quit the pain meds my Dr had me on for fibromyalgia.

It was then that I realized my friend had sent me this herbal remedy for pain from Thailand.

Within 6 months I decided to start a small Distribution Company that sold Kratom here in Idaho. in my younger years I did a lot of motocross racing, I played football in high school, I played baseball soccer and just about all other sports I could even grasp my hands into. I started feeling the effects of all of my crashes and hit and mishaps in my late thirties. it was then I started taking a lot of Advil for these ailments. by the time I was 40 it felt like every time I took Advil it felt like I was eating needles in my guts as the Advil have worn holes into my stomach lining. Kratom is the only pain reliever I can take now that doesn't feel like I haven't swallowed needles.  Still, to this day, it works fantastically.  My wife prescribes pyschotropic drugs for a living and she also owned a clinical trial company for 15 years.  She can see the good in kratom from a different perspective as her son became a heroin addict after an injury from playing semipro hockey.  The kratom helped him too.  Please, kratom is my lively hood and my ticket to stay off the couch.  Keep kratom legal.\nThe kratom I sell is thoroughly tested and cost almost $10k a month.  This is imperative for kratom to be  GMP product.  There are a lot of companies that taint their products.  In fact, I believe most of them do.  Please keep the good companies alive and stomp out the \"not for human consumption\" companies.  My best friend is also on the national board of pharmacy and he is a strong believer in the use of Kratom.  His name is Mark Johnston.  Please look it up.  Thank you for reading.\nsincerely,\nJeffrey Todd Wickstrom","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5293","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Todd Wickstrom","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I WOULD LIKE LESS GOVERNMENT CONTROL IN ALL ASPECTS BUT ESPECIALLY IN HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS.

The pain used to be so bad I couldn't sleep and couldn't ride bike and couldn't think about working at a job that requires a lot of walking/standing.\nFor the past three years, using kratom, I am literally pain free. I work part-time, seasonal as a food server at a very busy apple orchard, plus do janitorial work at a boy's school. I work out at the gym every single day (5-6 days a week) for 1.5 hours, play and take long, long walks with my grandson. I wouldn't be able to do any of these things without kratom. \nI don't know what I will do without kratom, but I am pretty sure there will be daily/nightly pain and I can forget about working, which will make me sad because I like to spoil my grandson a little.\nAs far as opioid pain relievers are concerned, yes, they work, but they are habit forming, make me tired, and I don't want to take any medication. I take no medications right now and want to be med-free as long as humanly possible. I am very very healthy and am staying that way, due to, in part, kratom.\nThank you for your time and consideration in the matter.\nSiincerely, \nMarlene Carlson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22178","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marlene Carlson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello DEA, \nThe DEA is losing money with decriminalization and legalization of marijuana in more places and needs more things to prohibit to keep business steady.

I was hopeless and ready to give up my fight when I read about something called kratom online. Before I discovered kratom I was barely making it through each day...I was drinking heavily and on the road to losing my job so I thought \"it can't hurt to try it, I'm already at rock bottom\".  I started taking kratom a year and a half ago and the decision to begin daily kratom doses was the best decision I've ever made.  I take a spoonful every morning with my coffee and then I'm happy and stress-free for the day.  The stress relief benefits have greatly relieved my depression and I no longer crave alcohol; actually I do not drink at all anymore nor do I have any desire to drink after I started kratom. \n\n I strongly oppose the proposed ban on kratom considering it has greatly enhanced my life through its stress relieving benefits. I do not agree with claims that kratom is highly dangerous because the effects are mild and I do not feel any sort of impairment or \"high\" when taking kratom. Kratom has helped me build a better life for myself and my son & it also improved my relationships with family members. Last but not least my work performance has greatly improved with my daily doses because I am no longer depressed or anxious all of the time. Please do not ban kratom, I promise that, from my experience,  it is not a dangerous drug and the benefits are enormous. I would compare it to taking Tylenol for a headache except the benefits of kratom fixes more than just a headache, it improves your life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11623","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Danielle Sweeting","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a middle class father of two family man.

I am able to consume this supplement, kratom, and function as a normal and productive citizen, working in the health industry. I believe that if kratom becomes a scheduled substance, my quality of life will greatly decline, and my ability to continue within society as a positive and productive member will be abolished. Just the thought that millions of outstanding and productive Americans who depend on kratom, just as some millions depend on their cup of coffee, will be viewed as criminals is absolutely appalling to me.

I have very much first-hand experience with patients that have gained great health benefits from it because it allowed them to transition smoothly and safely away from harder drugs. Whole kratom is, as an addictive substance, quite self-limiting in that the user will have a very difficult time building a substantial tolerance/dependence. After a certain dose threshold, the drug becomes a very unpleasant experience, with signs and symptoms including nausea, emesis, epigastric pain, and dysphoria. I have seen many patients chase a high and be bitten harmlessly by the side effects of the drug. Simply put, this is a substance that has \"built-in\" safeguards against not only tolerance building, but overdose. My personal recommendation would be to list purified/extracted solutions of 7-hydroxymitragynine and mitragynine as schedule one and/or any product containing stronger than specific thresholds of the psychoactive constituents (i.e. a concentration that clearly indicates a refined product). But please do not schedule the plant.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

Its recent decision to delay the scheduling and allow comment is indicative of this, as I am positive that the DEA would not have done this had they felt the info that was the basis of these actions was objectively credible. I look to the emergency scheduling of synthetic substances with high potential for abuse, such as MDMA or \"Bath Salts\" as perfectly credible and effective uses of emergency scheduling based on credible, actionable information. With substances like \"spice\" and \"flocka\" hitting the streets, I am sympathetic to the DEA's urge to protect the American public from harm, but I firmly believe that this proposal to schedule Kratom is hasty and would ultimately do more harm to the public than good. \n\nKratom has not been responsible for a death without a catalyst or contraindication - deaths which the media has associated with Kratom have mostly if not entirely turned out to have other substances, and/or complicated health issues involved. Kratom's footprint on the workload of our Poison Control center is absolutely infinitesimal when compared to benign foodstuffs and everyday cleaning products. The increase in recent calls is objectively attributable to its recent gain in popularity coupled with product ignorance and inquiry from general practitioners. Kratom's activity on opioid receptors is unique in its minimalism and the near impossibility of respiratory arrest, according to recent study by Columbia University. \n\nAs more scientific study is conducted on this plant, the lack of evidence of danger/toxcicity becomes more apparent as we continue to lack sufficient reason to believe this plant is anything more than mildly addictive. If we are to ban plants on the basis of mild addictive potential, I suppose we should do away with coffee and tobacco. If we are to ban plants based on mild opioid activity, I suppose we should look at Spinach next. \n\nOne thing is clear - there are hundreds of thousands, (considering the significant percentage of the botanical trade Kratom is responsible for) if not millions of Americans using Kratom every single day without incident. Thousands of families living happily with Kratom users among them. Because Kratom is legal, it is bought and sold safely and not under the control of gangs or cartels. Frankly, Kratom is so mild that it would be an absolute failure as an illicit substance. \n\nMany Kratom users are astute and have observed that medicines based on Mitragyna alkaloid content have been patented - we see this as a potential collusion between the FDA and Pharmaceutical Lobbyists who see the therapeutic potential of this plant and wish to make maximum profit from it. If the DEA is truly concerned with the well being of the American people, it will do everything it can to work with the FDA and ensure that Kratom remains legal and regulated like any other dietary supplement, subject to the same safety and cleanliness standards, and available to America.\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14431","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ian Sturgill","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I suffer from IC (interstitial cystitis) a painful bladder condition.

I've had to sit by his side and watch him suffer and basically lose his life, when none of the medical establishments can even understand whats wrong with him or how to treat him. He is in intense pain every single day and Kratom along with kava are one of the only substances which take away any of his pain without nasty side effects of something like hydrocodone. Might as well just make tylenol, Valium and oxycotone illegal too. This is a terrible decision please think about how much harm would result from this ban. A lot more harm then good. Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2030","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Noah Cooper","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm going to make this seeet and short. I was addicted to opiates for most of my 20's. When I was 22 I got into a bad car accident and had a bad shoulder injury. Shorty after I was given OxyContin and after a few short months my life was turned upside down. A year later I was a full blown addict with all aspects of my life falling apart. Fast forward another year and I was now addicted to heroin. I tried everything but could never get myself away. Until I found suboxone. Great right? Wrong. Now I was just had yet another drug I was using as a crutch. Until one day I was doing research on how to get off suboxone and I found kratom. After I weaned down off of suboxone I starting taking kratom. Within a month I was suboxone free. No withdrawal no craving and even better I had no pain. Fast forward another month and I was able to stop taking kratom all together. For the first time in years I was 100% completely drug free. While I do still take kratom on occasion the best thing is that I dont NEED kratom just to make it through my day. Kratom is 100% responsible for giving me my life back. I'm am now a mother to three beautiful and healthy young children and that is all thanks to finding kratom. I can honestly say that my life is owed to kratom. Without finding this amazing natural herb I don't know if I would have even been able to stop using opiates. \n\nI strongly urge you to consider my stories and others like mine. We are in the worst drug addiction epidemic in history and this simple plant is helping to stop the cycle.

Coming off true opiates is an almost insurmountable task for most people. Kratom can be a bridge to success in this task.  AA and traditional treatments have such low success rates because the gap between opiate use and sobriety is to large and difficult to bridge with sobriety alone. Kratom can be a very useful and safe  step in between. Allowing opiate users to step down from Opiates to kratom for a period of time, and then to sobriety is a much easier, obtainable and safe transition. This will save many lives. \nKratom is also useful for people experiencing chronic pain. It is much safer, has less side affects, less addiction potential, and a lower cost than traditional \"Western\" pain medications. There is also no risk of overdose. \nKratom is not dangerous. It has great benefit to the medical and civilian communities. \nKratom allowed me to learn to thrive with training wheels on (Kratom) and then remove those training wheels when i was ready to. I was an opiate user who struggled for years in and out of rehabs. The problem was once i got sober i felt so awful (even after months of time)  that i could not fathom how i was going to live my life in any successful way. Kratom provided a bridge for me to get off and stay off the opiates and then when the time was right and i felt strong enough, to get off the Kratom. If i had not found kratom i would still be on the same cycle of opiates and rehab or maybe even dead. \nDO NOT ban Kratom. Kratom is a useful tool in the \"War\" on opiates and probably all hard drugs. It is a useful, beneficial, lifesaving, non threatening plant that should be available to the public and used in treatment centers. \n-Anonymous","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19837","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was an opiate addict for nearly 5 years and would continuously relapse.

My life was turned upside down almost seven years ago when I suffered a burst compression fracture of my L-1 vertebrae, as well additional damage to my lower spine and SI joints, during a sledding accident on a family snow trip.  I went through months of rehab after the accident, and continue to have several procedures on my back every year (steroid injections and RFA).\n\nUp until a year ago I was taking 4-8 Hydrocodone daily to help me manage my pain. This helped with the pain, but also kept me in an almost constant daze.  I stopped taking my prescriptions when the law changed to require a doctors visit every two weeks to get a signed prescription... Paying twice a month for doctors visits and two prescriptions (Before the law change, I would receive a month-long prescription) became financially burdensome and unsustainable.  I went through a couple weeks of withdrawals, where I prevailed with clearer my mind, but increased pain.\n\nThis past summer, my husband came across an article about Kratom (I'm not sure where he found it), and asked me to read it.  I became excited about trying Kratom after reading the article and other peoples' testimonials, and ended up ordering some over the internet.  It has changed by life so much for the better.\n\nThe first time I took Kratom (I usually swallow about 1tsp, about three times a day), was the first time by back felt decent, and I had the energy / desire to get out and DO stuff.  Sure, the hydrocodone I used to take would take my pain from an 8-9 down to a 3-4, but all I would want to do is take a nap.  I would be afraid to drive anywhere because I was always so tired, even though I had to sometimes because if my doctors appointments or children's activities.  Now with a little bit of Kratom, I can drive for hours (from Sacramento, CA to the Bay Area) with fear of falling asleep, and with my pain down to a 1-2 level.\n\nLike I said, I first found out about Kratom this summer.  I ordered about $70 in July, and was planning re-order some in September, but couldn't find it anywhere.  Instead, I found out the DEA was issuing a BAN!  How could they ban this miracle I had just found out about?  And WHY would they?  I know people are different, but I've never experienced anything using Kratom that would make me think it would need to be banned.  I don't feel \"high\".  In my experience, it is no way impairing in the way drinking or smoking pot can be (yes, I've tried that, and while it may help me forget the pain, it does not take it away like Kratom does); in fact, I feel uplifted / energetic / almost back to my old self.  Thankfully, the ban of Kratom in September did not go into effect, and I was able to order another $70 worth in the middle of October, which should last me at least until the end of the year (way cheaper than what I was paying for the prescription hydrocodone and bi-monthly office visits).\n\nPlease don't take away this miracle I've, and apparently many others, have found.  The only reason I can see why the DEA would ban it, is pressure from the pharmaceuticals.  Why would people continue to use a killer addicting drug like hydrocodone when something that is natural, cheaper, and works better exists?  I encourage anybody who is pushing for a ban to simply try a small dose of Kratom, and sincerely ask themselves if they experience is really in need of a ban.  And to say there is no medical benefit... for myself, I can say that claim is totally false.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22580","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Abaigeal Johnson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a citizen, a tax payer, voter and a grandmother residing in a very poor area of central New York State.

It helps me with sleep and with pain management and as such is invaluable, as I have PTSD, chronic pain and very bad sleep problems without using it. Drugs I took for pain and sleep cause me not to be able to function most of the following day from being in a stupor from the sleep or pain drugs, so if I use pharmaceutical drugs, I would not be able to even have a life due to their effects on my physiology. \n\nOther benefits of Kratom for those using it:\n\n-- Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\n\n-- If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\n\n-- Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n\n-- Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n\n-- Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n\n-- Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nKratom is not dangerous and the only reason I can think of that would cause someone to want to pull it from the market is that it is cutting into the pharmaceutical industry's profits. If the pharmaceutical corporations would make good drugs that work as needed, without unpleasant or dangerous side effects, then people would not be seeking relief from pain, sleeplessness and more through kratom. \n\nPLEASE -- do not make kratom a Schedule 1 substance! Do not throw us into the clutches of the pharmaceutical corporations making us pay high prices for drugs that often do not do the job they were designed for, and with unpleasant or dangerous side effects! Make your decisions on what people are telling you and science. Not so that drug companies can get rid of competition for their designer drugs. \n\nI am a woman veteran with PTSD.

The natural herb can not be compared to such mind altering, addicting, life destroying substances, when it can only affect you as much as a cup of coffee and has many benefits for people like me.\nAs of last year I was taking 6 different psychiatric medications a day in an attempt to help control my depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I felt like I could barely keep my head above water, if I did anything it was the bare minimum. And I thought that was just the way my life was going to be, take pills and hope things improve. \nAt the beginning of the year I added kratom to my daily regimen and began decreasing the amount of medications I was taking. The last and hardest psychiatric medication I was on was 450mg of Wellbutrin, I never had a doctor tell me that is a dangerously high dosage. I spent several months tapering off it, scared that my depression would become out of control and I would have to go back to taking that medication again. I take kratom strains that tend to help with depression and energy. As of today I have not taken a single psychiatric medication for approximately 2 months, only a small amount of kratom daily, and not only is my depression and thoughts very manageable. My quality of life is the best it has ever been. My thoughts are clear, my energy level is higher than it has been in years, I am happy to be alive.  \nI am also a recovering opiate user, since taking kratom I have significantly less cravings for pain killing drugs. I still have my struggles with mental health and addiction, but today is so much better than it ever use to be. And I give the credit to working on myself and to kratom. Today my kids have a mom who is present and active in their lives. My spouse has a significant other who is happy to be alive. I have become the best version of myself naturally.\nPlease let kratom continue to help us, taking it away means taking some of our lives away.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5547","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Helen Knight","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'd like to tell you about my kratom experiences.

I have used small doses of kratom successfully to treat restless leg syndrome, which has not been manageable with anything else other than tramadol, an opioid that I wish to avoid taking daily.  I fear that if kratom is banned, I may be stuck with an opioid prescription for my RLS.  \n\nI have known others who have used kratom responsibly to reduce or eliminate their daily alcohol consumption, by consuming a small amount of a less harmful substance instead, along the path to complete sobriety.  \n\nI have never experienced any of the alleged negative effects of kratom.  I have not become an addict or shown any interest in other drugs.  I do understand that it may be a recreational drug for some, but I cannot see how it could ever become a serious social problem in the way that heroin, meth, etc. have.  \n\nI believe that the psychoactive compounds in kratom would be worth researching as alternative pain management drugs, or to help develop drugs to combat our increasingly serious opioid epidemic in the US.  Kratom should be seen as a possible tool to help combat the epidemic, not a part of the problem.  \n\nBased upon my personal experience, I cannot imagine anyone becoming seriously addicted to kratom in the same way that some people become addicted to opioids.  The dosage required to experience strong effects would likely cause extreme nausea; therefore dosage is self-limiting.  \n\nAdditionally, from a philosophical standpoint, I don't approve of bans on substances unless a significant harm can be demonstrated.  A ban on kratom would be a \"solution\" to a problem that doesn't exist, and would likely erode the public's respect for drug regulations in general, most of which are important and worthy of public support.  \n\nThanks for taking the time to read.

You will be on the wrong side of history (failure of prohibition and the recent election results for recreational/medicinal cannabis) and it will actually cause more long term damage (and potential deaths) if it is banned. There is abundant evidence that the benefits far far outweigh any downsides. Also, the citations I've seen about the few handful of deaths attributed to kratom consumption have *all* been associated with at least one additional substance (if not more) at the same time. This, in my opinion, is not enough evidence to institute the heavy handed scheduling approach being proposed. If anything it needs to be left open to more research. Tagging it as Schedule 1 will hinder that effort greatly. I can't tell you how many instances I've heard of research scientists trying to advance this type of understanding only to get red-taped into oblivion when the target is already a Schedule 1 substance. This is not how we as a society make progress and be allowed educate ourselves.\nAccording to CDC data, annually in the US:\n- over 480,000 deaths directly attributable to smoking \n- over 88,000 deaths directly attributable to alcohol \n- over 28,000 deaths directly attributable to Opioids, with half of those (~14,000) being prescriptions related\nCompare the above to the ~15 deaths I've seen loosely associated with kratom, and you're needlessly expending resources going after the wrong substance if part of your charter is to \"save lives\".\n\nI almost can't help but feel there's something else driving the effort to schedule it because the numbers and cited dangers simply do not warrant the proposed approach. I expect you'll be seeing a number of preliminary peer reviewed studies coming to a similar conclusion - that making it schedule 1 is unnecessary, and may in fact do more harm than good. This plant has an impressively long list of benefits associated with managed use. Please let the actual science (both already completed and the studies yet to come) dictate the classification rather than what really feels like a knee-jerk reaction to what a vast majority would consider a non-issue.\n\nThank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22695","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"V S","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I Have been using kratom for 5 years now.

It is not just a waste of government time and resources, it's a recipe for disaster, pure and simple. \n\nBecause it is used safely my many to get and stay off much more powerful and dangerous narcotics, a ban is sure to force these individuals back into the realm deadly drugs, both legal and illegal. This will result in increased narcotic overdoses, increased unjust arrests and imprisonment for possession of kratom, and increased deaths. \n\nAs a 22-year sufferer of Crohn's disease, I continually endure unspeakable amounts of pain, both physical and emotional. I've had multiple surgeries to remove sections of my small and large intestines, and have been the lucky recipient of an ileostomy, such that my bodily wastes are collected in a bag taped to my abdomen.\n\nOver the years I have been prescribed copious amounts powerful narcotic drugs to combat my suffering, which predictably led to my becoming dependent on them. I discovered Kratom several years ago as I was healing from two successive surgeries. As I learned about the plant and experienced its effects, I slowly began to gain hope that I could actually live a life unfettered by stupefying drugs, and by the constant refilling of stigma-inducing prescriptions that made me feel -regardless of my legitimate status -like a failure and a criminal.  \n\nOver time, I slowly stepped down on the narcotics while maintaining a steady dose of Kratom tea (simply leaf and water), and to my absolute joy, I am finally free of the beast. \n\nOnly now, when I and many like me finally found a way out of Hell, our government inexplicably wishes to tear it from our hands.\n\nIn spite of my handicaps, I am a successful family man with a rich life. Much of this I attribute to Kratom, which has allowed me to enjoy my family and my pursuits in a way I never otherwise would have under the circumstances. I no longer drink or take prescription drugs for pain. \n\nMy story is far from unique. Since this emergency scheduling news came down, I was amazed to see the growing number of intelligent, caring individuals whose experience with this plant mirror my own. Please, listen to them, look at the real numbers, look at what is actually harming people and how this plant can truly reduce that harm. Draconian, arbitrary drug laws tear individuals and their families apart just as quickly as the drug casualties they are meant to eradicate.\n\nTo think that overnight, millions of hard working and law-abiding Americans will become felons, subject to arrest, prosecution, and imprisonment, all because they had the audacity to seek natural and far less harmful alternatives to the opiates/opioids - which they have rightly been taught could easily kill them at best, and destroy their families at worst. This looming ban threatens to eradicate completely what is left of my faith in this government and its institutions. Surely, it will be the killing blow - on many, many levels -for huge numbers of citizens like myself.\n\nI take no issue with kratom and its components being taxed, regulated and age-restricted like other legal psychoactive substances like tobacco, alcohol, etc. In fact I think that would be a wise move. However, scheduling and/or restricting adults' access to the plant would be a glaring error - both in my opinion and in that of many, many others whose lives were saved.\n\nRegardless of the intentions behind this move, the result will be the same. Americans will suffer. Americans will die.

Crohns is an inflammatory bowel disease that can cause intense abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever, among other things. Kratom leaf helps me get through these symptoms when I have a flare-up, as it mitigates pain and eases diarrhea due to a light constipating effect. For me, kratom leaf is more effective than other remedies, and I know that I am not the only sufferer of a bowel disease who relies on it to ease pain and discomfort during flare-ups. I feel that kratom should be legally available for purchase by adults while it is studied further for its medicinal uses, which many others have written about.

Tramadol was made in a lab. Kratom has been used for centuries in Asian culture, and formally since 1897. Tramadol was created in Germany in 1977. Kratom has analgesic, antibiotic, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties, relieves pain, digestive problems, anxiety, depression, PTSD, insomnia, fatigue, and withdrawal symptoms, and is commonly used in fighting addictions. Tramadol's only purpose is to numb the pain. Kratom's most common side effects are nausea, dizziness, fatigue, constipation, and vomiting if a large dose is taken. Tramadol has over 60 known common side effects that I don't even have space for. Kratom is as addictive as caffeine, and studies show very little abuse in users of all ages. Tramadol is highly addictive for every user, and builds addiction quickly. Kratom has no toxicity; there are 0 reported deaths. Tramadol is extremely easy to overdose on; only a couple pills more than your prescribed dose will kill you. More than 500 people died from Tramadol between 2006 and 2011. Kratom is highly effective and gives me 5-6 hours of no pain and no side effects.  Tramadol is known as the \"safest\" and \"weakest\" pain pill, and does not even touch my pain, and makes me feel very unwell. Kratom is a chanpion of small family businesses, and Tramadol is a multi-billion dollar industry for Big Pharma. Kratom is becoming what allows people to live happy, productive, healthy, pain-free lives. Tramadol becomes a worst nightmare to many.

Three years ago, my father committed suicide. I was already struggling with severe anxiety and depression that stemmed from another death in my family, when my father decided to take his life. My depression and anxiety grew unmanageable. I, myself, became suicidal. I stopped working, socializing, and connecting with my loved ones on any emotional level. I became withdrawn and disconnected. At this moment in my life, I reached a point where I had to decide whether to continue the downward spiral or make an effort to regain a sense of worth and positive motivation. It took a tremendous amount of effort, but I decided to make a change. Around this time, I started researching herbal supplements that might be able to help me. Among articles on St. John's Wort, chamomile, valerian root, I discovered an article about tea made with kratom and decided to give it a shot.\n\nKratom helped give my life back. I felt positive, focused, and motivated. I became goal oriented and had strive to be a better person. I started to enjoy being alive. I became social and connected with my family. I am now a productive member of society, working full time as a coordinator for a local college teaching life-saving techniques. Similar to how coffee helps wake me up, or chamomile helps me sleep, kratom has helped me enjoy life. \n\nKratom does not make me feel \"high\" or under any influence and I have had no ill-effects from taking kratom for the past three years. I see no reason why the DEA wants to ban kratom or classify it under the same schedule as deadly drugs such as heroin. This ban will be a frivolous waste of tax-payer money and should be reconsidered.\n\nPlease do not make kratom a schedule 1 substance.\n\nRegards.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7779","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anon Anon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom was a godsend for me.

I strongly believe kratom is a benign plant with great potential to help many suffering people. I'll lay out, broadly, my reasons for thinking this, but I'll leave the details (easily available through a simple Google search) to your own research via sources more credible than I. \n\nIt's true that kratom has some similarities to opiates pharmacologically and psychoactively. But its effect is greatly weaker. A normal dose of kratom is no more noticeable for the user than a strong cup of coffee. (In fact there are marked similarities.) It's also true that kratom, like other opioid agonists, can bring about physical withdrawal on cessation of heavy use. Most users, however, experience a very mild withdrawal comparable to that from coffee: runny nose, irritability, insomnia, etc. \n\nFurther, the side-effect profile of kratom is much less threatening than that of opiates. There is no risk of overdose (at least, not with the plant matter--it's not yet clear whether one can OD on the pure extracted chemicals) or respiratory depression. There is little or no compulsion to continually redose. The constipation is minimal. Nausea is quite common. But this is, generally, the worst of it. I've heard outrageous claims recently of kratom causing symptoms so severe as seizures or hallucinations. I've spoken with many people who've used the plant, and have heard from many others who have, and not one of them reported anything so severe.\n\nI think I've made clear that kratom is a far more benign substance than the pain medications that are already widely prescribed. Too widely. Thousands are dying in an opiate epidemic. It takes an absurd nerve on the DEA's part to outlaw a safe alternative. Perhaps the only available safe alternative. Already kratom is widely used as a reliable way to get addicts off opiates and back into LIFE. It's a special kind of sociopathy the DEA expresses with this attempt at unilateral (unconstitutional) legislation.\n\nLastly, many people suffering from psychiatric conditions like mood disorders and PTSD find kratom highly beneficial. I struggle with a mood disorder myself, and find that kratom keeps me more confident and talkative, less self-conscious and anxious, and more motivated and focused.

Many others are in the same position, whether it be due to chronic pain or depression.

First:  Kratom is a herb, not a synthesized drug made from herbs. Second: Kratom works on the brain receptors like an opioid without the risk of addiction.  Third:  Many people who have addiction issues or can not take opioids for other reasons depend on Kratom to function.  Fourth:  Kratom enhances the quality of life without it affecting their cognition.  Fifth:  There will be an increase of the use of street drugs and an increase of crime should you schedule Kratom as a controlled substance. Sixth:  There will be an increase in suicides in our nation should Kratom not be available to individuals who are unable to take opioids. Seventh: There are many herbs that synthesized drugs are derived from that have not been scheduled in such a way that would make them unavailable to the people.  One of them is white willow which aspirin is derived from.  Another is foxglove which digitalis is derived from, a heart medication.  \nI am a disabled person who receives pain management services.  I am on opioids to manage my pain.  I know what that means and feels like.  I did not know about Kratom until I had been on opioids for several years.  I thought I would try Kratom.  It did absolutely nothing for me.  But I have talked to many people, now, who swear that Kratom is a miracle for them.  And I believe them. One of those persons is a relative.  A responsible adult who can not tolerate opioids.  He has back issues that are very painful.  But he does not want to be placed on Disability.  He prefers to work and be a productive citizen.  Kratom allows him to do that.  I was a medical social worker for twenty years.  Believe me, this will be a travesty to the American people should the DEA schedule Kratom as a controlled substance.

I was introduced to Kratom by reading about it on online forums and made my first purchase of it from a smoke shop. The clerk gave me an OPMS liquid shot for free to try. the effect it gave was that of a STRONG pain killer, like an oxycodone. I was in disbelief that something this strong could be sold over the counter. The result was me being High for about 5 hours.\n\nI soon switched to a more mild Kratom, just the regular leaf. I was buying from on online vendor now. I began taking it recreationally everyday for about 6 months. One day I woke up with an odd feeling in my stomach. I went to use the bathroom but I couldn't. I was really constipated. This is a common side effect with all opioids. So, I pushed a little harder and then I felt a sharp pain in my side. This ended up being the worst pain id ever felt in my life. I went to the ER, and the CT revealed a large amount of stool in my colon. SO much so that it caused my appendix to become inflamed. My doctor asked me what I had been taking and I was honest. I said Kratom. My dr was aware of it and told me to immediately stop because it was doing harm to my body.\n\nKratom caused my appendicitis. \n\nafter this flare up, I stopped taking it all together. I soon realized this wasn't as harmless as I thought. I went into a full on physical withdrawal that lasted 2 weeks to a month. The first week was RLS, insomnia, depression, and terrible anxiety. The latter was followed by extreme lethargy and sever depression. Again, None of this was told to me as a possible side effect when I began taking it. \n\nI've relapsed more times than I can count and now Im in and addiction program to make sure I don't go back to this stuff.\n\nKratom is a drug. Kratom is an opioid. Kratom is way too easily obtained. kratom should not bee sold over the counter, it should be prescribed. \n\nPlease get this off the shelfs. While its not as deadly as heroine, it certainly can be as addicting. \n\nit ruined a year of my life. \n\nPlease do the right thing. regulate it and only give it to people who truly need it. this drug should not be readily available to the public. \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0206","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher K","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has shown no danger to our society, has shown to be safe, and should not be scheduled.

I did get clean the traditional 12 step way for a year, but the underlying problem was never solved. I was still suffering from depression, anxiety, and everything that made the prescriptions and heroin appealing in the first place. I had learned of Kratom when I was addicted, but clearly I wasn't ready to quit because Kratom didn't give me a high, it helped with withdrawals, but I was still stuck with myself. After a year in the program and therapists telling me that the mental illnesses were caused by addiction and not the other way around, even if I was in therapy long before any addiction, I turned to Kratom and quite frankly never looked back. I don't feel any sort of high or impairment. I just feel like the cravings are gone. The need to white knuckle my way through life is gone. I'm not lying in bed crying all day anymore. I'm becoming a productive member of society, going back to school, holding employment, even getting married.

Every day is a struggle for me, i have a full time job and a 2 yr old son. The meds prescribed to help people with narcolepsy are the same stimulants prescribed for someone with ADD/ADHD, only i require doses that are above what is considered the maximum doses, because there are not standards for people with Narcolepsy, and it is considered off label. I am looked at like a drug abuser at the pharmacy,  even though I've used the same exact pharmacy since i was 17 or so. High doses of stimulants have so many horrible side effects such as... extreme levels of irritation, my toes uncontrollably move which causes me agitation to the point i sometimes have to wear tennis shoes to bed to keep them stable. I constantly have to change my meds and dosages because i build up a tolerance very quickly. I barley have enough energy for my full time job,  let alone take care of my 2yr old.  I rely heavily on my twin sister to help me. I don't drive for safty reasons... im a prisoner to my disease. \n\nThat's just a high-level overview of my Narcolepsy struggle.

I am incredibly opposed to the DEA making kratom a schedule 1 substance because I do not believe it is harmful or addictive and I do believe it is beneficial to people - at least addicts. I started using kratom about a year ago because my boyfriend had read about it and we had stopped drinking and we're looking for something more exciting than doing nothing but also something safer than alcohol. We stopped drinking because we both had a problem and know that my boyfriend suffered serious medical repercussions from alcohol abuse, as we learned talking to his doctor. I'm sure I did too but I was never evaluated that closely for alcohol's impact on myself. What I can say is it was not that exciting - I didn't feel buzzed or high but I did feel mildly relaxed or mildly energized dependent on the strain. I have been without it over the course of the year at various and have found no symptoms of withdrawal. As far as overuse, the worst thing I have ever experienced is a feeling of nausea. I have been an alcoholic and I can say that I have not drank for over a year and I attribute that partially to kratom. I don't believe in prohibition of alcohol but I have seen the impact of heroin and alcohol in my and my boyfriend's family (deadly overdose, suicide, early death from liver problems) and with these experiences I would not defend kratom if I thought or experienced anything negative or harmful with its use.

She has been in a lot of pain and discomfort since.  Her finger joints begun to deform, her back hurt all the time and besides all the pain she also experienced burning on all her body.  The worst was on raining days. My wife's pain increased. Her rheumatoid specialist Dr. put her on Humira injections, $2000 per injection! besides the prices, the side effects were worse than her arthritis. I see a big reason here why they want to ban kratom .Her pain didn't get much better and then she was put on Cimzia.  Same price and same bad side effects! My wife was so afraid of getting cancer from this injection, one of 100 sides effects, that she decided to endure the discomfort and pain instead of been poisoned.  Last month I heard of kratom and after doing some research on it I didn't think twice on give it a try.  We were amazed on how quick and how well it works! 3 days after taking it rained and she didn't feel tired and she didn't have the burning pain!  It was great to know that she was getting a break from all her discomfort and pain after 5 long years! \nI work as a machinist so I have to be on my feet all day long. I have very bad flat feet and problems with my knees so I decide to take Kratom too.  One day my knees were very sore while working and took kratom. 45 minutes later I felt how my knee pain was vanishing.  \nTwo months ago my son had a mountain biking accident and broke his shoulder. I was very concern because of the painkillers he had to take. I suggested that he stopped the pain medication and take kratom instead.  He felt a lot better while taking kratom and one more time, no much side effects. \nMy oldest son has extreme depression. We gave him kratom and 40 minutes later he was calling me at work to let me know how \"normal\" he was feeling which no other medication ever made him feel like that. All the medication that he has been taking for his depression has so many and horrible side effects and kratom doesn't!  And... what is your reason why you want to ban kratom???? Baning Kratom sounds  more like some pharmaceutical company wants to keep it out of our reach so they keep selling and sickening more people.  We will continue fighting for our rights and it is our right to choose what makes our life better. You do not have the right to make our life worse. You do not!\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlfonso Lopez","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11665","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alfonso Lopez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi,\n\n\nI use Kratom as an herbal supplement for arthritic pain and it seems to help a bit.

I have been prescribed, by Pain Management, numerous opioids over the years. I've been on MS Contin,  with immediate release morphine for breakthrough pain. I've also been prescribed Methadone for chronic pain. Most recently ,my pain is being treated with Hydrocodone 10/325, 3 times a day.  It does not adequately control my pain, but my doctor is hesitant to raise my dose. He is concerned that his opioid prescribing will be seen as excessive.\n\nI have sought other avenues for pain control, including physical therapy, massage, prescribed muscle relaxants, seizure medication, antidepressants, etc, etc. I've even tried acupuncture.\n\nThe increasing reluctance of doctors willing to prescribe adequate opioid for my chronic pain has caused me to look into to other avenues.  I decided to try Kratom, specifically the strains for pain relief. Imagine my surprise when I took 1 dose and experienced dramatic pain relief that lasted the entire day !!!  I CAN FUNCTION NOW WITHOUT DEPENDING ON MY PRESCRIBED DOSE OF Hydrocodone.  I am down to 2 tablets a day of hydrocodone  and intend to slowly wean myself off them.  I am 65 years old and all I ask is to be able to function and do my daily activities of everyday life.\n\nKratom is a miracle for me. Please let it be available for the general public.

I was grateful to have some relief but I hated the thought that I would most certainly become addicted and I constantly felt ashamed with the stigma of using pain meds regularly. I had seen so many lives cut short due to opiate abuse and I didn't want to become one of those stories. I discovered Kratom about 2 years ago and it has changed my life. I have not had a script for meds in over 2 years now and Kratom controls my pain better then medications did with none of the side effects. It has also helped me to be more social which is crucial when you are living with an illness that can cause you to use the bathroom 4-5 times an hour sometimes. Please continue to allow access to this plant for those that need it so badly. It has made me a more productive and happy person and no medication could ever provide the same relief. I also know many who stopped a dangerous cycle of opiate addiction with Kratom. For those that can't afford saboxin treatment, Kratom is an effective replacement.

My mother is 72 yrs old and has serious problems w both arthritis and sciatica. Some days are very difficult for her and the kratom helps her quite a bit w the pain. I have another friend who has successfully used kratom to get control over an addiction to pain medication and also heroin. She's only 23 and I'm so grateful to this plant and the online community who have been so helpful to her. I wish I'd have known about kratom when I was 23, because I personally had a terrible addiction to opiates at that age and  it's cost me dearly in many ways. I've been off of drugs now over 8 1/2 years, am a productive member of my community,raise 2 kids, and am very thankful that I survived all I went through to get here. This plant is a good thing, whether anecdotal or not I'd like to think that as a country we need all the help we can get regarding this crisis. The jails are packed resources are thin and there's is no shortage of drugs. This afternoon I have to go to a funeral for an old friend who died of an overdose last Wednesday. He leaves two young girls behind , and was a good person. I wish he'd known about this plant, because maybe things would be different. I understand you people have concerns. PleSe do the right thing here and keep kratom legal. Together we can do better than this. We have to. Thanks for your consideration. I'm very very tired of seeing people's lives ruined by drugs and all the misery that comes with the territory. I truly believe that this plant offers a solution of sorts.

I was in a constant battle with myself to stay clean and not give in. During that time I also fell into a deep depression. My anxiety had gotten to the point that I had a hard time leaving the house. When I was introduced to kratom I wasn't educated on it at all. As I felt the effects of it I began to think this was a miracle herb. I was able to manage my pain without all of the nasty side effects of prescription opiates and I didn't dread waking up everyday. I began to do more and more research to see what was out there and how it worked for different people. I was able to gain a great deal of knowledge about the different strains and what works best for what ails you. The best part is that it's completely natural and has been being used for hundreds of years. I honestly don't know where I would be today without kratom.

I'm 27 years old and I am a state licensed journeyman electrician. I have been using kratom for 2 years. Kratom has helped me tremendously at my job and with my life at home. I have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease and I live with constant pain in my back. The traditional prescription opiate painkillers are very dangerous, addicting, and most of the time lead to harder illegal drugs. I have had a cousin become addicted to opiates and my family watched as he got into trouble with the law, stole from his mother and  was in and out of jail/ rehabilitation. Because of that and the obvious problems with the opiate epidemic going on in the US, I will not take prescription pain killers nor do I take illegal drugs. \n Kratom is all natural and it really helps with my back pain, way more than NSAIDs ever could. There hasn't been a death that can be solely linked to kratom. The 660 calls to the poison control center is  another laughable statistic as well. 660 calls over a span of a few years pales in comparison to alcohol, which causes an average of 88,000 alcohol related deaths a year. There was way over 5000 calls to the poison control center due to children eating laundry packets in the first 6 months of this year alone.  There are plenty of other problems in this country that the DEA should be taking care of,  such as getting heroin and prescription drugs off the street. Kratom helps people who are in withdrawal from opiates. Apparently many people have quit using opiates by starting to take kratom. So in reality kratom can help with this epidemic we are seeing.  During the time we need it most we are faced with losing this all natural solution. Soldiers with PTSD have found relief in kratom, so have many individuals with depression.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14737","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon Briggs","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"See attached","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23218","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"m.2180"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17981","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"NS Khalsa","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I use kratom to deal with chronic pain.

I am a 70 year old male, married to the same woman for almost 50 years, blessed with two children and three grandchildren. I am now retired from the computer programming profession. In the past 5 years, I have had two spinal fusion surgeries, and now have seven fused vertebrae in my lumbar region. Three years ago, I was diagnosed as needing a right knee replacement, which I hope to have done in January of 2017. After reviewing the evidence -- x-ray, MRI, and formal medical diagnosis -- no physician has ever questioned my assertion that I am in pain and discomfort with most every step I take -- sometimes bearable, sometimes not. I think the surgeries have prevented my symptoms from getting steadily and progressively even worse, but they have not eliminated the pain and discomfort by any means. I have tried the usual recommended therapies; they run the gamut from physical therapy, to bed rest, heat, cold, OTC medications, and prescription medications. I do not tolerate opiates well, even though, of the therapies mentioned above, they are the most effective for reducing pain. I also do not like the cognitive clouding that accompanies their use.\n\nAfter my second back operation, a little over a year ago, an acquaintance suggested that I might find relief with the alkaloid mitragynine, a component of an herb commercially available as \"kratom\". I tried it with skepticism, because I am not a huge believer in herbal therapies, but to my surprise, it has reasonably effective analgesic qualities without the cognitive side effects. I can make use of it on those \"bad\" days, and ignore it on better days. I have not, to date, experienced any withdrawal effects such as those accompanying opiates. In short, it helps prevent my quality of life from deteriorating further, or at least slows its progression. I am aware of my own responsibilities in dealing with pain, and do not expect magic effects from any substance or therapeutic procedure. If I have tried everything to reduce pain on a given day, without success, I know that more of the same is not going to help and it's time to grit my teeth and try to endure.\n\nI am opposed to the re-classification of mitragynine/kratom for two main reasons. The first is the personal quality-of-life issue which I've tried to describe above. The second reason is based on what I know about human nature: individuals who are in frequent and unrelenting pain will try almost anything, and search almost anywhere, for relief. Unfortunately, in this case, most of the alternatives are ineffective, or dangerous, or highly controlled and illegal. Prohibiting the use of mitragynine would force those who find it useful into searching for and trying other unknown and/or dangerous forms of relief, or promised relief. Re-classifying this substance at this time, without further controlled, scientific study by trained and independent parties will only harm individuals such as myself in ways that may not be anticipated.\n\nThank you for considering my opinion and the opinions of all those who will be affected by your decision.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15389","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't believe this is a dangerous substance.

I am part of a community that uses Kratom extensively.  I see people use it for a variety of reasons.  The main things that we use it for is an alternative to dangerous drugs and alcohol. We go out dancing in environments where everyone is having a good time but no one is inebriated to where they become a threat to themselves or anyone around them.  This is the main reason this is such a beautiful plant.  It is extremely safe compared to already legal substances like tobacco and alcohol.  \nI also am a Veteran.  I was an air force linguist so I never saw direct combat.  However, I have plenty of friends and family that have.  Kratom helps them with their pain that they have from injuries sustained while fighting for our country.  It also helps with anxiety from PTSD.\nOn a personal level.  I honestly have found Kratom to be very useful for eliminating allergies.  I used to get massive migraines that originate from a variety of allergic reactions.  Once I learned how to use Kratom effectively, I haven't had a migraine from allergies in three years.  Before Kratom I was taking over the counter pills that were probably destroying my liver, making me feel groggy, and didn't really work as well as Kratom anyways.\nPlease, I am a grown man with a discerning intellect.  I have always made choices in my life that were, for the most part, good.  Good for me, my family, my friends, my community, and my country.  I have no doubt that choosing to have this amazing plant in our lives is a good choice.  \nThank You","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16765","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Patrick Presfield","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for leaving kratom listed with the coffee plant.

My name is Jonathan Parsons and I am 36 years old and live in Illinois. I am writing you this letter because I am opposed to the banning of the dietary supplement Kratom. I learned of Kratom a little over 3 years ago. I was in an accident where I fell from a roof while shingling my parents home. After the accident I was in constant pain from bulging discs in my kneck and two compressed discs in my back. I did not like visiting doctors and hate pharmaceutical drugs. I got to a point where I had nerve pain in my legs so bad I couldnt walk. I was sent to a spine clinic and told if physical therapy was unsuccessfully my only other option was surgery.  I was prescribed a oxycodone and slue of drugs that I despised taking but my pain was to the point I had no other choice or so I thought. I started looking for natural pain relieving remedies and came across an artical about Kratom. I was willing to try it as I was getting no relief from the prescribed meds. After 3 days of Kratom my pain levels were already down. I flushed all the pain pills the 4th day and never looked back! Since then I a drink Kratom tea when I have back troubles and have no problems stopping. This plant is wonderful for many other purposes then pain, such as anxiety and depression why would ever want to ban such a helpful herb?

In 2010, my first born daughter Zoey died shortly after birth from a Congenital Heart Defect known as Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome. Zoey's death brought forth severe depression, anger and loss of purpose. Within a year I had begun abusing a legal prescription for pain medicine that I'd been given after my daughter's birth. For nearly 3 years following her death I struggled with that addiction. Faced with the reality that I would be on a lifetime suboxone maintenance program I tried Kratom in November of 2013. I was able to completely stop all pain medication as well as suboxone usage. After recovering from the physical part of my addiction, I realized the benefits that Kratom had in managing the PTSD I experienced from the loss of my daughter. While I do not take Kratom on a daily basis, I do not experience any side effects from either taking or not taking Kratom - something I was not able to do with prescription medicines. \n\nIf Kratom were to be scheduled, I feel the work and progress I have made following my daughter's death would be jeopardized as I would have to return to pharmaceutical medicines to help my condition of PTSD.

The evidence the DEA has used to support this ban as being a public health emergency is largely overblown and in some cases outright propaganda. This substance has helped numerous people overcome addictions to much more serious opiate drugs and has little if any side effects both in medically reported literature and from thousands of anecdotally reported user experiences. Banning this substance is going to create the very public health hazard that the DEA is trying to avoid and incorrectly stating kratom is causing. Overdoses on opiate drugs will spike and many people who have successfully quit opiate drugs using kratom will return to them causing a worsening of the very real public health crisis that exists now regarding opiate drugs. Those deaths will be on the hands of the government and the DEA if they do outright reschedule and ban this substance based on fear and propaganda. The American public deserves the right to not only be heard on this matter but also the right to choose to use this harmless plant if they personally decide to. The DEA should not only reconsider it's scheduling as it has done once already due to public outcry, they should hold it off indefinitely until such time as multi year based scientific studies are conducted on the uses of kratom in the help of alleviating or replacing opiate addiction such as ongoing research is already studying","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10235","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This option should be left open for people to seek pain refuge.

To tell you a little of myself and why I consume Kratom. My name is Thomas, I am a former firefighter/EMT who currently manages and operates a car wash and detail center in South Florida. I'm originally from the beautiful state of Idaho where I fought fire for a career. I suffered injuries from the fireground back in 2011. Nothing thst has crippled me but enough to render me in enormous pain day in and day out. The reason I function and enjoy life is in part my consumption of Kratom. \n\nLike many of my peers I struggle with everyday stress and burden myself with overwhelming workload. Kratom has helped me in so many ways. And one of those reasons is that it keeps me focused and a lot less stressed. I personally do NOT view kratom as a drug. It to me is as common a daily as my coffee or water. The effects of kratom are similar to coffee. Yes it is a amild all natural pain killer. But its caffinated effects are really it's primary use (in my own case). Instead of taking sugary energy drinks or coffee (that eventually upsets my stomach), i take kratom to naturally give me my energy. My back is also in pain from my accident in Idaho. The kratom has almost given me a new lease on life. Im a changed man and i love it. My doctors have always tried prescribing me narcodics for my back. But always hated the effects and the entire ordeal of being bind to meds. However kratom does not have a dependency nor does it relate to heavy narcodics. Kratom has different effects for many. For former heroin addics it has saved them and helped their recovery. I personally know law enforcement officers and firefighters who consume kratom for the bennifits it provides. For professions where a high burnt-out rate consumes personel, kratom helps combat that. A major weapon against PTSD. There have been no recorded overdoses due to kratom. It just cant happen. Those who are very against it are unaware and uneducated in kratom effects and how it effects us. \n\nSchedule 1'ing kratom is a terrible Idea and it is taking away more than what you view as a drug. It has literally saved lives. It has been an introduced culture aspect. Bringing young people and older people to come together with an equal love for this plant. Its a part of my life along with many others. It increases my work productivity and gives me an amazing outlook on life. Banning kratom will do more damage than good.  It will hurt small business that are vital to our economy. It will effect those who consume it to feel better so they can go to work, for those who are recovering from a major addiction. I truly believe that krstom is a beautiful thing. And I am highly against the schedule 1. Please take into consideration that this wonderdul plant in no way is similar to that of marijuana, its also not synthetic. It helps so many of us day in and day out. I hope you realise the importsnce of this substance and acknowledge the impact it has on our society. \n\nThank you for your time.

This piqued my interest, and I began reading about it. Based on my research I decided to try it, and I found its effects to be subtly pleasant and enjoyable.\n\nI began taking kratom every few days. I have never felt any cravings to do more of it on a given day, or any more often. I have never felt any sort of a crash after consuming it. I have not experienced any feeling of bottoming out on days when I do not have some. On the occasion when I consumed too much, I felt nauseated for about an hour, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nLooking at kratom on a range from coffee to alcohol to cannabis (the latter two I have not consumed in at least a decade), I find kratom to be about on par with coffee, and in some ways subtler. But nowhere near as intense as alcohol or cannabis when consumed in normal quantities.\n\nGiven my own experience with kratom, I am very surprised at the DEAs intention to schedule another plant. Unfortunately its difficult to avoid the very cynical suspicion that this is just the DEA acting on the wishes of big pharma. I truly hope that this is not the case. Regardless, I do not feel that the public is served by scheduling kratom, and I hope that the DEA will reconsider its position.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16896","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Sessions","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't have much to say, but I'm a strong supporter of alternative drugs and research.

I had over 90 surgeries to rebuild my face and countless surgeries to fix the rest of my body. They told me I'd never walk again. 4 years later I did, but i was in pain every single day.

My pain level had become uncontrollable and my studies started reflecting that. I found myself struggling to get through clinical. A friend told me about this group and kratom.

I have never been physically or mentally addccited to alcohol, prescription pain medicine, street drugs, or any other drug that has potential for mental or physical dependence.

I am a 54-year-old mother who is disabled and raising three children on my own.  I have had a crippling condition called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome for 15 years now.  There is currently no cure for CRPS, so my goal over the past 15 years has been to manage the pain as best I can.  The pain medicine I have been on in the past has terrible side effects, such as fatigue, brain fog, anxiety, and excruciating withdrawal symptoms, just to name a few.  I have always taken the medicine as directed by my doctor, but I still had these awful side effects.  \n\nI began searching for natural alternatives to ease the pain, and after hours and hours of researc\nh, I decided to try Kratom.  Kratom has helped me immensely.  It helps with the pain without the negative side effects.  I also don't go into withdrawal when I haven't taken it.  It doesn't alleviate the pain entirely, though nothing I've ever tried does.  It makes the pain more tolerable.  As a result, I've been able to sleep better, which in turn helps with any anxiety I experience in trying to live my life to its fullest.  For me, Kratom has been impressively helpful.\n\nKratom helps me be the mother I want to be.  I can attend my children's school functions now without the pain becoming unbearable.  My quality of life will decrease drastically if Kratom becomes illegal.  I want to be able to dance with my daughter on her wedding night, and escort my son across the gymnasium floor on his Senior Sports night.  I may miss precious moments like these if Kratom becomes illegal.    \n\nI recall reading that 15 people have died from Kratom, but that is not true.  Further research showed that  these individuals also had very dangerous substances in their systems.  Even if those 15 individuals had died solely as a result of taking Kratom (which, in fact, has never happened) that number dulls in comparison to the 14,000+ deaths caused by prescription opiates each year.  I find it very illogical to say that you want to decrease drug addiction and overdoses, yet you push to criminalize an herb that may really help with that.  Please show the public that you really are looking out for our best interests by allowing Kratom to remain legal.\n\nDuring my research, I also found that, according to the Center for Regulatory Effectiveness, banning Kratom would be a violation of the US-Canada Regulatory Cooperation Council Agreement, because Kratom is classified as a permitted \"National Health Product\" in Canada.\n\nSincerely, \nKim, A Concerned Citizen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10296","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kimberly Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My daughter's life has been turned around because of this amazing tree.

I believe a couple years now since I've had a drink and I have no craving for alcohol. Kratom is also used to withdraw from opiods rather then turn to heroin. There is very little physical effect from Kratom. It allows you to live a normal life. I've come to find out that I've suffered mental illness since I was a child but was not aware because I was drinking to self medicate. Kratom has allowed me to deal with my mental illness rather then drink to cover it up. To make Kratom illegal would be counter to efforts to make drug use a health issue rather then a criminal one.

Mr. Bell is a documentary film maker whose latest project is on Kratom.  Here is a link to the show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-9J5-KCHCU\n\nI'm concerned that the potential re-scheduling of Kratom is being done without enough research regarding the affects of the drugs.  In the above video, Mr. Bell makes compelling points that Kratom can be legitimately used to treat both pain and addition.  In an earlier podcast, Mr. Bell talks about his own history with extreme chronic pain as well as the addictions he has overcome, including Oxycontin.  Given the current epidemic of addiction to legally prescribed opioids, Kratom could be a valuable tool for healing people.    \n\nI strongly urge the DEA to tread carefully with regards to making Kratom a Schedule 1 drug.  There are already astonishingly powerful painkillers already legally on the market causing clear and obvious problems.  Were a potentially beneficial drug like Kratom be made illegal, it could potentially damage the DEA's reputation as a trustworthy institution.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11823","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Cardenas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to urge you to reconsider your ban on kratom. I have severe scoliosis and have had four spinal fusions.  Nothing (including addictive fentanyl patches) has helped my pain except kratom.  I have been taking it for 1.5 years and have had no tolerance, withdrawal, or negative effects.  In contrast, when I had steroid injections in my spine, my adrenal glands shut down and I lost hair.  I was then treated with steroids which led to multiple hospitalizations when I lost significant weight and was too weak to walk.  Because of three months of inactivity, I was then hospitalized for a blood clot.  Because of the steroid use, I developed osteoporosis.   I have been weaning off of steroids for the past year.  It took months to wean off of fentanyl patches and that is how I first started using kratom which can mitigate withdrawal symptoms.  Throughout this process, I struggled to keep my job as a psychologist working with active duty military members.  I used all of my leave but kept my job.  I have had no negative effects from kratom, but my experience with traditional pain treatments has been ineffective, expensive, and time consuming.  I had to take one day off per month to get another prescription for opiates.  If the clinic computers were down, I had to reschedule and worry about going through withdrawal.  I was forced to pay for urine tests to make sure I was not selling the medication.  I had to search for pharmacies willing to fill the prescription.  \n\nI am a married, 57 year old female, with bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering, an MBA, and a doctorate in clinical psychology.  I also completed all requirements except a dissertation for a PhD in electrical engineering.  I have never written a petition for anything in my life, but this leaf has saved my life!  As a federal employee I am subject to drug testing so even if I could buy the substance if it is made illegal, I could not keep my job and would be forced to apply for disability.  I support my family.\n\nI urge you to support structured research on the substance before issuing a ban.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6523","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Susan Dubois","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was introduced to Kratom since i have fibromyalgia and back and neck injuries from 4 rear ends in the last 7 years. I am not fond of the feeling from opiates. A friend who has more illnesses than just fibro, told me about a plant based pain reliever called Kratom. Over the 25+ years of fibro pain, I have tried numerous non-prescription and prescription substances. Side effects and impairments were not acceptable. \n\nI listened to the testimony my 2 friends who are seriously disabled. They are no fun, neither can play with their kids due to arthritis from broken bones. both want to work, neither can stand. So imagine my surprise reading their Facebook posts about what they were doing. I had been absent due to the latest rear end and had missed something. I rapidly wrote each of them to asked what new medicine they were on. Each one said no prescription - stopped everything! cold turkey! Taking a new plant based substance called Kratom. \n\nThen I went to work. And the younger lady i work with, had a car accident some years ago, broke many bones in her body and has serious pain from that, along with pelvic structural defects from the accident and a hard delivery of her last child. Her periods require monthly ER visits for morphine injections. She was on the first day of her period and was at work and was not in pain. I expressed my surprise and she told me that someone had told her about Kratom and she had gotten some and was feeling great. \n\nSo I ordered Kratom that day, after she had shared some with me and it had reduced my pain level. I am now a convert to Kratom. The different varieties allow me to tailor the pain relief along with energy or relaxation. What is even more amazing is the testimony of people who are weaning themselves of opiates and heroin. That is amazing. \n\nI see people taking personal responsibility for pain control and being able to be contributing members of society and available to their families. I am imploring you to leave KRATOM available to the public as it is and not give into big pharmaceuticals request to regulate. The substance is self-regulating, as taking too much results in vomiting. This stuff is literally MAGIC and with opiates being pulled from prescription due to regulation, people are resorting to heroin use or street purchasing of unknown pain pills.

Based on that, all I can say is this all seems very fishy - there are zero deaths that can be explicitly attributed to Kratom. Every case that I read involved either other drugs, or mental illness, etc. etc. Given the fact that people are using Kratom to treat opioid addiction, and the amount of money that is involved in the prescription painkiller industry, it does not take a giant leap to suggest that there may be other motives for scheduling Kratom besides people's well-being. I believe that the best course of action is for controlled studies to explicitly determine the benefits and risks associated with Kratom.

When I met my wife, Dawna, she was on extremely high doses of opiates and with the help of kratom was able to ween down to the lowest dose of just one pain medication (she'd been on 4 at the she rim when we met). This was for her back disease and injury. Then she had a brain injury and the first thing the doctor wanted to do was increase her opiates. I noticed that kratom had another added benefit: less depression and anxiety. My wife had lost quite a lot when she sustained the brain injury. She was a nurse making over $50k a year and all of a sudden she couldn't remember things, wasn't allowed to drive due to seizures and was told she'd never work again. PTSD, anxiety, feelings of being a burden and being worthless soon followed. I noticed, however, that when she took her dose of kratom she wasn't constantly crying and talking of suicide. I truly believe that kratom has saved her life and I'm downright terrified of what the results could be if this natural God given supplement was made illegal/unavailable.

Thank you for listening to my story.  I am 37 years old and have dealt with severe back pain since I was a child.  My back would actually go out and I couldn't bend it for days as young as 10.  I was diagnosed with Severely Degenerating Discs.  It is a pain that appears most hours of everyday whether I am sitting standing or laying.  My only true fix is to move to a new position but that last for a short period of time.  I have had a prescription for 3 10mg Norco per day for the last 10 years.  During this time, I have refused to up the dosage or get something stronger due to fear of addiction.  For the last 3 years I have used Kratom as a replacement or in addition to my Norco prescription.  Most days it will work just as well as the Norco by taking away a good amount of the pain.  Before Kratom, I could not forget my Norco or I would get headaches and the pain would multiply.  With the Norco, my body is not craving or needing the Norco.  I feel free vs feeling like I need the Norco.  I hated that feeling but I need them to make my pain tolerable.  Kratom is a miracle plant.  In addition to the pain it gives me energy in the morning the same as a cup of coffee would.  I have seen it save many lives over the last few years whether it be from addition or pain.

I'm also a recovered heroin addict of almost 3 years! \n\nIt scares me to think this plant which has made my recovery from heroin much easier might soon be considered an illegal drug.  Kratom is much like coffee.  Having kratom available to me makes even thinking about taking heroin seem crazy!  \n\nWhile I did not use kratom to come off heroin, because I didn't know about it at the time, I wish I would have.  I was detoxed at a state facility with benzodiazapam (xanax) which made my withdrawals even worse! I was hallucinating from a combination of opiate withdrawal and benzos prescribed by doctor.  However, I did manage to stay completely sober for 1 year, six months of which was in rehab.  I eventually relapsed on alcohol and xanax, it was a mess.  I was then introduced to kratom a few months later.  What a life saver! I take one dose a day, again much like coffee, and I feel ready to face the world.  When I run out of kratom I am fine, I do not withdrawal like from heroin. I can do without kratom, and I do often.  When my anxiety gets out of control, it comes to save the day!\n\nKratom has helped me to manage my anxieties and also my urges to take opiates like heroin or oxycontin.  It has helped me get my life together so I can manage being a productive and successful member of society like I have never been before!  Without kratom I fear I may end up a mess again, homeless living out of my car.\n\nI beg and plead with the DEA to listen to the voices of people who kratom has saved.  Many people are alive and well today thanks to kratom.  If you are to ban kratom, how can you keep oxycontin legal?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2034","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\nMy name is Rob.\n40.\nSchool Teacher, Husband, Father of One Seven Year Old\n\nI have been suffering from extreme Pelvic Pain for the past four years.\nI have not had a completely pain-free day since 2012.\nI have seen numerous medical professionals.

I am writing in reference to docket number DEA-442W and the intended scheduling of substances found in the Kratom plant.  I am not a Kratom user myself, but have a vested interest in this issue as I have friends who use Kratom as a part of their battles against chronic illness, and because I am student in the biological sciences aspiring to be a teacher and hope to be able to tell future students that we truly do use reason to decide which substances people have the freedom to use or not.  I don't want those suffering chronic illnesses or any isolated chronic symptoms to lose supplements from their coping toolboxes.  Kratom is brewed as a tea.  I haven't heard of lavender leaves or matcha being regulated by the DEA, and find it hard to comprehend this proposed regulation.  This plant is not a drug but a supplement like all those that remain unregulated and available at the discretion of individuals.  \nI also take issue with the supposed health risks being placed on a mere 15 deaths which are easily attributed to other causes...how many die from alcohol each year?  You can poison yourself with too many apricot pits or too much caffeine.  I think the scheduling of Kratom would set a dangerous precedent and harmfully damage the American citizen's right to use his or her own discretion when it comes to supplements.  \nI would like to emphasize as well that users praising a supplement as \"life-changing\" or making medical claims about the supplement are not a basis for it being considered a medicine that needs regulating.  Whole communities of Americans exist who use essentials oils to treat symptoms and disorders, and make sweeping claims about things they \"cure\" or \"treat\", but I have heard nothing of them being regulated.  \nUltimately, I think those suffering from chronic conditions pull relief from a number of sources and removing one of those sources is totally unjustified especially when the mortality is lower than almost any pharmaceutical, and even many things not considered drugs by the DEA, and when we know scheduling can halt or slow general research done with scheduled substances.  \nIf a Kratom user says it saved their life, we might hear them and say \"we must regulate this potent substance\" or we might step back and see the virtually non-existent mortality, the total lack of evidence of danger, and think again about how often someone says coffee is their life-blood or that they just can't relax without a cup of tea.  Not all things that effect our bodily processes or even symptoms of illness need to be regulated as drugs, and Kratom certainly does not.  \n\nSincerely, \nMaggie Wilson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7600","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Maggie Wilson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I fully support Kratom remaining legal.

I just wanted to take a few minutes to express my firm belief that Kratom should not be placed in any sort of drug schedule. This supplement has been safely used by millions of Americans for many years, not to mention for millennia across the globe. It is primarily used an an herbal tea that can provide energy, minor pain relief, and general mood enhancement. It is a plant relative of coffee, and is extremely similar to the way it affects humans. There have been no recorded deaths solely from the herb itself, and besides that, millions of people die each year from tobacco, alcohol, and prescription drugs, so in comparison to safety and legality, there should be no question that it doesn't belong in the same category as illegal narcotics, because if that was the case, alcohol and tobacco should be immediately placed into schedule 1 classification. Kratom is not used to cure any sort of disability, it is merely used as a supplement similar to Coffee, St. Johns Wort, Guarana, Yerba Mate, Ginseng, and many others. There is absolutely no \"public health hazard\". I myself drink the tea occasionally for an energy boost with my coffee in the morning as a pick me up, and have never felt any sort negative effects, or \"high\" with it. I don't drink alcohol, or take any illegal drugs, and I feel that it is an abomination to potentially incriminate me over something that is so ridiculously minuscule compared to the real drug problems America is facing right now. I also feel that banning this could have a substantial effect on the black market drug trade, Kratom is fully legal and available in our neighboring countries; Canada, and Mexico, which would make America a prime target for an herb that is high in demand, thus taking precious time away from law enforcement to engage in more serious crime. As history has shown us, making drugs illegal has no effect on the drug trade, and increases violence from cartels, and increases incarceration at astonishing rates at the cost of the tax payer. The drug war needs to end, and the DEA has overstepped their bounds in this matter, and has shown a complete disregard to the science behind this. Please reconsider your decisions as they could negatively impact our country greatly.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19127","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jesse Riche","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In reference to docket number DEA 442W: I am a 47 year old man in the transportation industry who is firmly against the scheduling of Kratom and its derivatives.

I have worked with psychiatrists and therapists and have tried 4 different antidepressants, all with side effects that were at best inconvenient and at worst life-threatening. The worst of this took place when I was prescribed Welbutrin and consequently suffered two seizures. This was quite terrifying for myself and my family, and I nearly lost the ability to possess a drivers license. Overall, the negative side effects of prescribed medications have far outweighed the positive effects, and they have put my safety in jeopardy.\n\nMy older brother had been safely and responsibly using Kratom for several years, suggesting to me that I could benefit from it as well. I was opposed to it for a long time before trying it myself. My reluctance came from the fact that I perceived it as a drug, and furthermore, one I had never heard of before. I have a highly addictive personality; I am acutely aware of this and I keep it in mind when I make decisions regarding substance use. I was scared I would become addicted to Kratom.\n\nHere we are, 4 years later, and I have not become addicted to Kratom. I take breaks from it on a regular basis to ensure that I do not become reliant upon it. The withdrawal effects of this are mildly irritating, but they are nothing compared to those I have experienced when ceasing intake of antidepressants.\n\nSince beginning to take Kratom, my mental and physical health has improved greatly. When I use Kratom, there are noticeable improvements in my motivation, energy levels, sociability, and overall enjoyment of life. I have high hopes for my future, academic and otherwise. I want to be an Occupational Therapist for children. My academic performance has never been better. My current GPA in college is 3.7 (I used to be on academic probation), I am at a healthy weight now (I used to by morbidly obese), I have hobbies and friends that I love, and to put it most simply, I enjoy life.\n\nI know part of my transformation was inevitable due to personal growth and the progression of time, but I also know that I largely have Kratom to thank. I shudder to think of how it will be if Kratom is banned and I am no longer able to see these benefits. Please keep me and others like me in mind going forward.\n\nI appreciate this comment period being opened. I am concerned and scared, for myself and all the other people who benefit from access to the plant. Please don't ban Kratom.\n\nThank you for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14242","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sasha Silberman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA:\n\nHello there.

Please take more care in researching the peer-reviewed literature on kratom and it's alkaloids. The lethal dose of kratom alkaloids in mice was so high that it could not be determined in a peer-reviewed study. This strongly indicates that the potential for overdosage is vanishingly small. If you look at the mechanism of action of the main alkaloids, the literature strongly suggests they selectively act in a biochemical pathway that does not cause respiratory depression ( almost always the cause of opiate death) or cause the down-regulation of opiate receptors ( a main cause of opiate dependence). Studies and anecdotal evidence indicate that any dependence from long-term use is less than that of codeine, a drug sold over the counter in many places without issue. There is mounting evidence that kratom alkaloids act in an agonist-antagonist fashion. Sort of like a very weak suboxone. Using large doses of these alkaloids appears to inhibit their own action; There are no reports (that I have seen) of people abusing  large amounts to get a morphine-like or cocaine-like \"high\". I have only seen one report in the peer-reviewed literature of what appeared to be a fatal kratom overdose. In this case there were also other drugs in the patients system and no way to determine if other indeterminate factors were the actual cause of death. It would appear, in any case, that the percent mortality of kratom users is far less than that of acetaminophen or ibuprofen users.\n\nI understand your desire to protect america from potential public health threats, however please keep in mind that many of the points of reference being used against kratom are not scientifically based. I am not going to describe the potential benefits of kratom, you have likely already read thousands. I am, however, going to mention that this is a very unique set of alkaloids with a very minimal potential for abuse. To schedule them would not protect the public interest in any way, and would almost entirely prevent any research into exploiting their very unique biochemical properties.\n\nThank you for allowing my comment, I pray you will not schedule these compounds or at least delay their scheduling untill a full scientific studey can be performed..","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15550","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Trent G","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA, you must reconsider the decision to ban Kratom.

For your sake, I will keep my comments to a minimum. My mother passed away in 2012 from an accidental overdose of prescription pain medication. She was young, a nurse. My understanding is that Kratom can be used to treat chronic pain, and your agency intends to ban this substance without any evidence that it is dangerous. \nYour scheduling system appears to be arbitrary, including substances in the Schedule 1 list that do have proven medicinal use. However arbitrary, higher scheduled substances become very difficult to study for legal reasons. As a fellow citizen, and tax payer, I want you to focus on substances that kill and maim. Wasting your finite resources, as well as those of the various agencies that follow your lead, cripples our ability as a nation to react to real dangers. We have a heroin epidemic in this country, deal with that before focusing any attention on non lethal substances. \nYou must be aware of the perception in this country that your agency is motivated by money alone. Whether it is true or not, when you ban substances that seem to have potential to be alternative forms of medicine for no apparent reason people draw conclusions. Simply stating that this thing is bad and dangerous is not good enough anymore.

Then in 2013 I became septic from a burst ovarian cyst. I was hospitalized for a week, given massive doses of antibiotics that continued for an additional 3 weeks after discharge home. I tried to go back to work but ended up injuring myself over and over again. My joint integrity had been compromised (my theory anyway) and I gave up my profession in mid-2014.\n\nIn February of this year I contracted parvo virus, a mild childhood infection that, in adults, is much more serious and can in fact, in up to 25% of cases, give rise to chronic fatigue syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. I developed classic symptoms of RA by July, pain especially bad in my wrists and ankles. By September I was taking 12 Ibuprofen tablets a day. My doctor put me on Predisone for 10 days which relieved all my pain for over a month. Slowly, as the medication left my system, all my pain returned.\n\nI'd never heard of Kratom until September, doing searches online for alternative treatments for pain. My science background is strong so I understand what mu receptors are, why the compounds in Kratom relieve pain and the reasons it needs to be used cautiously. I chose to use the \"branch and vein\" approach, making strong tea I keep refrigerated, rather than opting for capsules. My first \"dose\" was about 3 oz taken on an empty stomach. In less than 10 minutes all my lower leg pain was gone. There was an uplift like drinking a cup of coffee. I went for the longest walk I'd taken in over a year, and I cried half the time because I was so grateful to have found this remedy. I continued this dosage, sometimes adding a second in the late afternoon as I concentrated on regaining my strength and endurance. I progressed more rapidly than ever before. Then, one month later, I got the news that Kratom is to be put in Schedule 1 drug status.\n\nThis is as infuriating as it is devastating. As I understand it the FDA has reported 15 (?) deaths over the last 2 years involving Kratom, sometimes in combination with other drugs. How does this compares to the death rates per opioid abuse, alcoholism, FOR TYLENOL OVERDOSES, or just an unfortunate stay in a hospital where iatrogenic infection/MRSA/medication errors etc. are not rare (I know: I've worked in several).\n\nAn opioid addiction crisis that is headline news all over the country, and the FDA decides banning Kratom will benefit the public health and safety?\n\nWe are truly through the looking glass now. Although I'm politically liberal I've never been much of a conspiracy theorist; I realize that sometimes bad decisions/bad governance exist in an otherwise working system. But this controversy over Kratom has led me to question: just how beholden to pharmaceutical companies's bottom lines are the FDA? How many lobbyists are on the Hill massaging this issue to members of congress?\n\nPlease, please leave Kratom alone or, if you must, create regulations concerning sales and standards for companies providing it.  \n\nRespectfully, Sarah McBride MS PT\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3242","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah McBride","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom took me from a career criminal to a career family man who pays his taxes and is involved in community activism","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22381","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Ross","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been a positive influence on both my wife And myself. I have type one diabetes and as such have terrible circulation in my legs which causes swelling and pain. I am able to use an average dose of kratom to control the pain and it enables me to work on my feet all day without issue. There are no unfavorable side effects and I've never had what anyone can describe as a narcotic experience. My mind is clear at all times. It doesn't make me drowsy, I raise five children and this is a must to be alert at all times. Kratom allows me to be there for my children at all times without fear of being \"loopy\" or worry about dependency on a drug that could ruin my life. I know that those who use this abroad use it responsibly and for most of their adult life without what anyone could describe as a \"drug problem.\" The worst feeling you can get from kratom could be described as drinking a single light beer. I have never gotten a narcotic high from it and your body will purge immediately if you try to take too much.\nThis substance stands to save the lives of many suffering from addiction to anxiety and pain that usually requires real schedule 1 drugs that stand to ruin the lives of thousands in the U.S. this year.\nPlease do not schedule kratom as s narcotic. Keep it where it belongs, as easily attainable able safe alternative to pain killers that offer little else than a starting place for opiate addiction.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8381","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Putnick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have suffered from extreme Restless Leg Syndrome for years.

My name is Griffin. I was a functioning pain killer addict most of my adult life (about 10 years) and have been drug free since 4-27-2012. I'm 33 years old and now have a beautiful wife and and 2 great little boys (ages 3 and 3 months).  I was on methadone after being on pills for years and finally decided I didn't want to be on drugs anymore. I quit 80 milligrams of methadone a day cold turkey! It was pure hell, but with the help of my wife (girlfriend at the time) and loving parents I got thru it. My parents spent over 10k dollars on a homeopathic Doctor, and while the doctor meant well, her treatments of vitamins and supplements did not help. After over a year of being clean a coworker (who is on suboxen-another very addictive drug like methadone) told me about kratom. I have since tried a variety of kratom. It has helped keep me off of wanting to use drugs again or even feeling a need to do so.  I have stopped taking kratom in the past to see if there was side effects and have found that it is similar to quitting coffee. I have noticed no negative side effects and my dose has stayed the same over the past 3 years. Kratom has  helped me  to continue being a great husband and father that is not a drug user. Kratom could if used properly be a key to treating the huge heroine/opiate epidemic in our country. Please don't criminalize this plant  without extensive future research that has helped save my life and allow me to be the man my family deserves.

In 2013 I say in a jail cell and cried out that enough was enough, I was done fighting. I enrolled in a state funded recovery program and pledged my life to helping others.

I am extremely lucky to have been afforded so much in my life and I'm truly grateful for my family, my health, and all that I have in my life.  I own and run small business in my city helping and advocating for children and families. Prior to this I was a preschool teacher. I love working with children and families, and making a difference in my community but I came very close to being forced to give it all up due to severe back pain and depression. For over a year I felt that each day was a struggle just to get out of bed. I withdrew from my kids and my family, and could not engage in any type of normal activity or enjoy any part of my life.  My Dr prescribed pain medications and anti-depressants, but nothing helped. After a year of watching me deteriorate, a friend suggested that I try an herb called Kratom to alleviate my pain and possibly help with symptoms of depression. I do not drink or do drugs, I eat mostly healthy, un-processed foods, and am very selective about what I put in my body. I was VERY hesitant to try kratom, but I was feeling desperate and overwhelmed and needed help. After researching all that I could about Kratom, I decided to give it a try. Now, I could go on and on about the difference it made, but I will just sum it up by saying that Kratom saved my life. I no longer take any prescription opiates, yet my pain is more manageable now than ever. I don't take anti-depressants yet I wake up every day excited to be with my family and happy to go to work and make a difference in my community. I do not know what I would do without this life-changing herb. \nKratom is safe. It's not a recreational drug and there is no valid reason to ban, restrict, or regulate it.\nPlease keep Kratom legal and accessible and help me and the hundreds of thousands of Americans like me who are able to live better lives with the help of this amazing plant.  \nThank-you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14600","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rose Richdale","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20264","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Polly O'Malley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please research this compound before making it a scheduled drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12166","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Stop the abusive war on drugs.

Five years ago I was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia, also known as the 'suicide disease', because of the many people who take their own lives due to the intense pain.  Since then I have been on multiple medications such as, tegritol, neurontin, lyrica, baclofen, cymbalta and elavil, to alleviate the pain.  none worked as well as my doctors thought.  I elected to have a radiation treatment at a cancer center.  I felt so uncomfortable going in for visits and the treatment because there were so many people there with cancer and I thought my condition was so small that I wanted everyone of these patients to get treatment before myself.  I had the treatment which involved numerous MRIs, CT Scans and even having a 'hall' screwed into my skull while I was awake.  Nine months later, it only alleviated a small percentage of the pain.  I chose to see my neurosurgeon and elect to have brain surgery which was something I swore I never would do.  My quality of life was not that of a normal person because of the pain.  I had the brain surgery in March of 2016 and as of October I still get some pain, but not as much as I was having.  In August, I was told kratom might help.  Guess what?  It did.  I only get pain once or twice a week now and I'm happier then I have been the past almost 6 years.  If it had not been informed about kratom, I would still be in a miserable place with no hope.  It's not something I use everyday, just a few times per week when I can sense the pain coming on.  I had a prescription for a narcotic pain killer, but I found the side effects to be too much and had to take it too often.  Kratom, on the hand, has been wonderful without the side effects or cravings / addictive effects.  I humbly ask for the decision to be reconsidered so that myself and those who suffer neurological pain and those who have turned to kratom instead of opiods can have access to kratom.\nThank you and I appreciate and respect any decision that is made, but to please strongly consider those whose quality of life has been lifted by having kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0020","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"\"anonymous\" \"anonymous\"","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, \nMy name is Blake Randolph and I live in Albany,NY. I am a strong advocate for the the plant known as \"Kratom\" and have gone to great lengths to ensure that it is given the chance to remain legal to purchase in our country. I understand there has always been a strong opposition to this plant and the safety concerns it brings up. And to those people, my best advice is to read the wealth of literature and reputable sources on how safe this plant really is. [1] Kratom is a part of the coffee family and its uses in Southeast Asia were to receive the same energy boost and productivity that a cup of coffee produces. One of the biggest misconceptions regarding this plant is it's claims that it is synthetic. This couldn't further from the truth. It is as much synthetic as a basil plant would be considered. From a personal stand point, I have benefited tremendously over the past 5 years since discovering Kratom. Lower back pain is a plague in my family that has effected every generation and for myself, it started at the age of 23. I worked long hours in a restaurant and could hardly walk on my days off, let alone live a normal young life. That is until I stumbled upon Kratom. Since taking this plant, I have not only found a way to be a more productive at work, I am currently one of the most successful sales representatives in the Northeast market in my company, solely due to the fact that I can wake up pain free and elevate my ambitions to go be successful. I'm sure as you read most of the comments you'll see the phrase \"life saving plant\" be thrown around and people mean this in a very literal way. Not only are there so many highly functional people in society taking this plant to help with their every day lives, but more importantly, there are recovering drug addicts who have taken the necessary steps to better themselves and find a safe alternative to curb their addictions to the dangerous synthetic drugs out there. Kratom has been pivotal for those who want to be drug free and live a normal life and this plant has given those people a chance to avoid a relapse. I know that I am not speaking for myself when I say all of the people who take Kratom are extremely appreciative of your consideration to have this plant remain legal and available to those who truly need it. My hope is that you read this along with the thousands of others who benefit so much from this plant and take into consideration the immense amount of privilege we feel to have access to a great, natural, and safe alternative to other energy and pain relief options out there. \n\nThank you very much for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21523","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Blake Randolph","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing to request that Kratom not be placed on any DEA schedule.  My name is Kelly Meredith, I am 47 years old, married, and Ive worked in the technical department of an environmental company for over twenty-five years.  I was diagnosed several years ago with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder, and I currently take prescribed medication which keeps the worst of my symptoms under control.  I also run about twenty miles per week and do yoga at least once per week, and these both help as well.\n\nI started drinking Kratom tea a little over two years ago. It was suggested to me by a friend of my husbands, and I noticed that it lessened some of my anxiety symptoms that arent controlled by other methods. The effect is subtle--the closest thing I can liken it to is coffee.  I feel uplifted, but unlike coffee, I dont get jittery.  Instead I feel both alert and calm at the same time. Occasionally I have some mild back pain from sitting at a desk all day, and Kratom seems to help with that as well.  Earlier this year I completed my Masters in Information and Library Science, and I feel that Kratom helped with test anxiety and the general anxiety of being in school.  My husband drinks Kratom tea often with me, and my 74 year old mother recently started drinking it to help with her anxiety and with some of her rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.  \n\nPutting Kratom on a schedule will have a negative impact on me and my family.  It is now part of our lives in much the same way coffee or tea is, and I believe it to be just as benign-in no way do I agree that it is as dangerous as LSD or Heroin.  I think it should be regulated like other drinks such as coffee or tea, or as a supplement.  \n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nSincerely, \n\nKelly Meredith","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16201","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kelly Meredith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been utilizing Kratom for about five years.

I am a 45 year old man from Illinois.  Starting about 10 years ago, I was having really painful back problems where I would lift something heavy or turn the wrong way and my back would go out very painfully for 2 or 3 days.  It would get so bad that I would have to see a doctor, and they would usually give me a muscle relaxant and an opioid painkiller, usually Vicodin.  A few years into this pattern, I started working at a used furniture place moving furniture and was having very bad back problems, and I eventually got hooked on Vicodin or others painkillers like it.  Things got really bad for the next 6 or 7 years.  My addiction grew and grew as my tolerance built.  I'm sure there were times when I was so close to overdose that I shouldn't be alive today.  I was eventually referred to a Methadone clinic where I went regularly for about a year.  That was just another addiction that made me like a zombie and was even worse than the painkillers I was using it to get off of.  Then I did some research online and found Kratom.  The day it arrived in the mail was the last day I've done any opioids.  It might elevate the mood a bit, but doesn't get me high like the opioids or methadone.  I have been drug free ever since and my life has improved greatly.  I sitll pull my back out occasionally, but when I do, I avoid the ER and just take a few more Kratom capsules and I can handle the pain until it eases.  It has completely taken away my craving for opiods and even alcohol which I also suffered an addiction with.  I'm working, I went back to school and got a degree in Machining, and my life is so much better.  That's why I'm so worried about this upcoming ban.  I fear, like many others, that if you ban it, I will go back to opioid painkillers like Vicodin and be right back where I started.  I pray you reconsider and at least do some research.  This plant is a gift from God and could help so many people with the same troubles I had and will have again if it's banned. Thank you for your time,\nJohn L.

I am doing so in the hopes that testimonies like mine may help to educate, unravel stigma and ultimately help prevent an unnecessary and potentially tragic scheduling of this herbal supplement which is in many regards comparable to coffee, yerba mate, or loose leaf tea. \n\nI began utilizing the benefits of powdered kratom leaf in 2011 after suffering from severe lower back pain, moderate depression and social anxiety as well as bouts of gastrointestinal distress.  Seeking relief for lower back pain in particular, I decided to try kratom and after just a few instances of using it and titrating for an effective dose, I found that it was simultaneously the most effective, and least debilitating pain relief I had ever experienced! Instead of feeling drowsy and unable to perform energetic or complex tasks like the prescription opiates I had tried before would make me feel, I found that kratom would actually boost my motivation and ability to get things done, while also providing enough pain relief to maintain a positive mood and enjoy being social. \n\nI continued taking kratom on an almost daily basis which made it possible for me to maintain a strenuous job as an arborist over the next two summers and to finish my Bachelor's degree in Ecological Design during the school year. Interestingly, and somewhat unexpectedly, I found that my dosage was steadily decreasing over this time, especially as my back pain subsided and my use of kratom became much more equivalent to how one might drink coffee or tea for productive stimulation. \n\nMore recently I have been relying on kratom for the painful, disruptive, embarrassing, and energy draining symptoms of IBS-D (Irritable Bowel Syndrome  Diarrhea) as well as the co-morbid depression and anxiety. At the end of August when I heard that kratom may be categorized as a schedule 1 drug, I took it upon myself to see what my life would be like without kratom. I tapered my dosage down to nothing over a week. My symptoms, both physical and mental were increasingly worse and by the last two days I was seeing blood in my bowel movements. I decided that this was a serious matter, potentially of life and death for me, and continued with my moderate but daily use of kratom. \n\nNow that reportedly millions of other American Kratom utilizers and I are facing the possibility of a schedule 1 categorization again, I am terrified for my future wellbeing as well as for the potentially traumatic impact this would have on American society at large.  In the midst of a prescription opiate epidemic ruining the lives of millions in this country, it is difficult not to perceive that only ignorance or ill intentions could motivate a sustained effort to limit access to this herbal alternative which is Kratom. \n\nThis leafy shrub hailing from SE Asia but potentially viable as a domestic crop, has the strong potential to provide relief to those suffering from withdrawal from opiates, but also presents those who are wary or tired of using prescribed pain medication with an attractive alternative. In addition, a host of other alkaloids and bioactive compounds present in varying concentrations in kratom leaf, all have potential as medicinal compounds in their own right, and likely work in a synergistic fashion with the two main pain relieving molecules mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. Not only that, some of them appear to: mitigate the physical dependance liability of kratom, help maintain focus and energy while experiencing pain relief, and protect against respiratory depression which is the main cause of fatal overdose from traditional opiates of all kinds. These are all complimentary compounds which are not found in the opium poppy plant (papaver somniferum), and therefore represent novel medicinal molecules with great potential in the study of pain relief and other fields of health.\n\nPreventing the research of mitragyna speciosa by placing it's two of many active alkaloid constituents: mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine into a Schedule 1 category, would be a grave mistake for the medical and pharmaceutical industries and the American people who could benefit so greatly from this complex yet gentle medicine. It would also be a logistical and experiential nightmare for those of us whose illnesses are managed in full or in part by Kratom, and an ethical tragedy on the part of the the DEA and federal government.\n\nI urge anyone reading this to carefully consider what power they have and how to best use it for the prevention of unnecessary suffering. Please consider the mounting evidence regarding kratom, both peer-reviewed and anecdotal, carefully and compassionately. A great many people's health, jobs, families and futures depend on the availability of this plant. \n\nThank You","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22607","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amalesh Parajuli","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban Kratom.

From that point on, I suffered from back pain and once I started a career where I was standing most of the day, the back pain became excruciating by ends day. To top it off, I had torn my Achilles's heel and needed immediate surgery. I was then prescribed vicodin and unfortunately became addicted to the pill. After awhile I knew I needed to be off of the pain killer and was prescribed suboxone - not very helpful. After a few months it became apparent that my doctor had absolutely no plan or even knew how to wean me off of suboxone so I started doing research on my own. I came across kratom and ordered some. NO lie - and with all sincerity, it absolutely helped me get off of the suboxone and stay away from opiates. It really was a miracle because I was really at my breaking point and wasn't sure I was going to make it through, but I did. I think research should be done to prove how much this can help addicts but it should absolutely NOT be made illegal. The vicodin and suboxone that I was prescribed by doctors were and are far more worse and there are plenty of people who are dying on a daily basis because of the addictions to these opiates.

During the accident, I was able to get up and walk it off even though it was painful. At this young age , I did not put too much thought in it because I thought I could handle the pain. But as I grew older, the pain in my lower back got worse. I had to see my family doctor and hope that he could find an appreciate pain treatment for me since I cannot use opiates due to the allergic reaction I had experienced after taking the medication. After my doctor and I discussed the alternatives, we decided to use Tramadol and Anti-Inflammatory. The pain was managed and I experienced fewer side effects with the Tramadol than other opiates. A few years later, I started having stomach problems with the Anti-Inflammatory. I had to stop taking the Anti-Inflammatory medicine because it cause the stomach pain, which is one of the side effect of the drug.\n\nWhen I addressed my concerns with my doctor, he suggested me to go to a chiropractor once a week. At the time, I had a job and a good insurance. As time pass by, I lost my job as well as my insurance due to layoffs and the family doctor who I went to all these years decided to retire on the day before the Affordable Care Act start. After losing my job, I thought to myself that I needed a change which I decided to live oversea for several years. When I was oversea, I had developed a bone spur in my heel. The pain in my heel led to a severe lower back pain from my new walking posture, the pain was so overwhelming and I could not function normally. Therefore, I would have foot and back massage and use acupuncture as a form of pain management on a regular basis. \n\nWhen I was oversea, I also met a woman whose father was a traditional Chinese doctor. She told him about my issue with pain and her father put together a package of chinese herbs for me. I was surprise after using the traditional chinese herbs because the pain does not disrupt me as much as it used to be. Moreover, I did a little research on the herbs and found that one of the herb in the mixture was kratom. When I moved back to the United States, I realized I could purchase kratom here, a herb that helped tremendously with my pain. Ever since I started using kratom as a form of pain management , Im confident to say that Im 90% pain free and be able to function.\n\n\nIn my personal experience, kratom has helped me tremendously with my pain management I have endured over the years with no negative effect on my body. Therefore, when I learned the DEA has a plan to ban kratom, I was surprised. The DEA listed many health risks found in kratom abusers such as insomnia, seizure, vomiting, poor concentration and many more. However, there are over 140 side effects listed with the common pain reliever, ibuprofen, which 5 of the side effects are the same as kratom according to the DEA. Kratom is not a dangerous substance when the sides effects and health risks listed by the DEA are similar to the commonly use remedy ibuprofen, which it has done more harm to me then kratom ever has. For certain people, such as me, kratom is much safer to use due to my allergic reaction of other opiate pain relievers. \n\n\nI was a teenager in the 80s and through the years I have seen how the USA drug laws have split this counrty in two. To add kratom on to the list is only going to lead to a much older population with medical issues in prison.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20464","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I really think that we need more research.

Also as we have seen many Heroin dealers are cutting their product with fetanyl which is causing a large number of deaths across this nation.\n\nKratom on the other hand is nearly impossible to overdose on, and there is a ceiling on the effects you can get. It can be addicting if abused just like any compound. As of now kratom seems relatively unharmful especially in comparison to heroin and prescription opiates. More research is needed on the long term effects of this plant.\n\nMy point is that if you are to schedule this drug even temporarily making it unavailable you will force the users who are using kratom to quit the far more dangerous drugs back into using them.

All the more so, I write on behalf of my son, a veteran of the Iraq war, who succumbed to the results of Oxycontin and later heroin addiction, having like so many others of his generation escalated to an even worse substance once Oxycontin, a highly-profitable and legally-manufactured epidemic, was finally reigned in by way of legislation and DEA Enforcement...but only long after the money was raked in and the damage done.\n\nIt's crucial to examine the term \"legal\"  as generally understood in this context: the implication a legal substance \"must be\" safe and an illegal one \"beyond question\" dangerous. What about Oxycontin? Everyone knows the results. However, few know Oxycontin was legally allowed to be promoted as a less-addictive mode of pain relief. How is that possible when not a single mouse could have proven Oxycontin anything but non-addictive? It's easy with a little help from your lobbyists and friends:\n\n\"Michael Friedman, Paul Goldenheim and Howard Udell, three pharmaceutical executives who previously worked on OxyContin, are likely regretting their criminal plea agreement that led to a 12-year ban on doing business with Medicare and Medicaid...The men [eventually] pled guilty to falsely marketing OxyContin as being less addictive than other painkillers. They were accused of releasing erroneous data related to clinical trials and burying the relatively dramatic fall-off in blood levels by using a different type of data table than the majority of us are used to reading.\" [https://goo.gl/4K4o1Y]\n\nThe DEA should be all the more familiar with the story of Tramadol.\n\nFirst: \"Recent research shows that tramadol has greater potential to be abused and to cause overdoses than was believed when it first appeared on the U.S. market in 1995.\n\n\"A Journal Sentinel/MedPage Today investigation found that the FDA failed to heed a key piece of research indicating tramadol had the potential to be abused. Instead, the agency recommended not putting tramadol under the Controlled Substance Act. Restrictions on prescribing it are no more stringent than for Lipitor or Viagra.\n\n\"The Controlled Substance Act places drugs into five progressively restrictive categories based on their abuse potential. At the top of the list are drugs such as heroin. At the other, are some cough medicines with limited amounts of codeine.\n\n\"In approving tramadol, the FDA decision was based largely on research in which the drug was injected. The FDA also weighed evidence from Europe, where tramadol had been on the market for years.\n\n\"But the FDA also had research showing that when given to opioid abusers orally in high doses, rather than being injected, it produced opiate-like effects that were similar to oxycodone, the narcotic in OxyContin, one of the most abused drugs in America.\nThe FDA did ask Ortho-McNeil, the company that marketed the tramadol, to fund a committee of paid consultants who were to watch for abuse problems that might require making it a controlled substance. That never happened.\" [https://goo.gl/2NzrtA]\n\nQuestion: Should Kratom distributors be allowed to employ paid consultants and \"watch for abuse problems\" before it's classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance? Answer: Probably not, given that the DEA proposes listing Kratom as a Schedule I controlled substance yet eventually decided to schedule Tramadol as a Schedule IV controlled substance...apparently after learning of patients driving their cars into pharmacies to obtain more Tramadol:\n\n\"Upon conducting its eight-step analysis, the DEA found that relative to Schedule III drugs, tramadol has a low potential for abuse and limited physical dependence, and coupled with tramadols medical legitimacy, DEA determined Schedule IV to be the most fitting for tramadol.\" [https://goo.gl/lmycgW]. Nevertheless, Tramadol is now the source of a global crisis: https://goo.gl/z0V2iY\n\nTo the point, 51 Congress members never submitted a letter to the DEA signaling their support  for research regards to Oxycontin and Tramadol as promising treatments for opiate addiction. Yet those 51 members did just that in regards to Kratom. [https://goo.gl/6JGrTM]. Why would 51 members of Congress support research into the  (potentially) Schedule I Kratom as a treatment for addiction to Schedule 1 and Schedule IV substances? Clearly, financial concerns were not an issue: Unlike the manufacturers of Oxycontin and Tramadol, those who sell Kratom have no lobbyists.\n\nFurthermore, the deaths attributed to Kratom, such as nine reported in Sweden, involved not Kratom alone but Kratom taken with...Tramadol!\n\nDEA, you may listen to us or pharmaceutical lobbyists. We will await, and widely disseminate, the proof of your purpose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17097","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paul Toth","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kraton should be researched further before it is blindly places into the schedule 1 drug class.

I have no side effects, I don't sleep all day. I enjoy my family and I am able to do the things for myself.this is huge for me. I have me back. \nI am heartfelt asking you to reconsider and not schedule this plant as a drug. Please do the research, it is safe. It's related to the coffee plant. \n\njaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2588524\n\nMany professional medical people agree. For the thousands and thousands that use kratom to have a more normal life,  this would definitely be a travesty. For all the disabled, including our own veterans, and those fighting addictions,  we found a natural safe way to live again.  We are smart people... many of us returned to work because of this leaf. We are able to function again. Our alternative would be opiates again. If we could even get help with the new regulations with medications and the opiate addictions. I will be forced back to bed. Unable to even shower alone.  \n\nThe misinformation that has gone around is ludicrous, unfounded and untrue. Did you get this type of response with bath salts?  \n\nI live in an amazing country, I love our country and I'm glad there are entities trying to make sure things are safe for me...for all of us. Kratom is absolutely not a health threat.  It does not cause anyone to die.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20923","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lois Gilpin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am somebody with severe mental and physical illness and kratom is legitimately the only thing that has ever been truly effective in treating the majority of my symptoms.

There is no such thing as an overdose. Anyone who's ever drank a strong Kratom Tea or taken the substance orally in it's dried powdered form can confirm that it will make most people sick before they even come close to overdosing, even when mixed with multiple other substances. I never feel like I NEED to take it, don't get the shakes after taking it, or have any withdrawal symptoms.\n\nBeing a Viable LEGAL option was the main reason I chose Kratom for pain relief.\n\nIn 2014 I was on doctor prescribed medication for PTSD, Back Pain, and ADHD. The medication I was on was due to injury/issues I sustained while enlisted. When it cam close to signing a new enlistment contract I was torn... what happened a few months before my contract was over with stopped me from re-enlisting.\n\nA buddy and I went out to have a drink and on our way home was pulled over by the police. I told him first thing that there was a legally owned firearm in the glove box. His partner secured the weapon and then proceeded to harass my friend and I. \n\nAfter two more cop cars showed an order to search my vehicle given. At that point I had had enough and exclaimed that I did not consent to the search and asked what the probable cause was. The officer who gave the order then put me under arrest...\n\nThe blood test came back at 0.035, less then half the legal limit, but because of my ADHD medication I was charged with Driving a vehicle while under the influence of drugs and alcohol and \"in possession of\" a firearm while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. At no point was I ever in physical possession of the firearm or above the legal limit to drive.\n\n4 experts testified that the ADHD was well within therapeutic limits.\n\nThe jury still found me guilty.\n\nI fought it all the way to the Michigan Supreme court and am still waiting to see if they will hear my case.\n\nSense the  state of Michigan found me guilty of driving under the influence I have stopped using all medications, against doctors recommendations, because I had to choose between driving, living, working, or medication that was helping me lead a normal, healthy, life.\n\nIf any documentation would be helpful I'd be glad to provide it! \n\nMaking Kratom illegal would literally give law abiding citizens like myself, and many others who simply want to stay on the right side of the law, NO OTHER OPTION but to become criminals. \n\nAmerican Citizens must be allowed to live their lives with out unnecessary government interference. There is a reason that the 21st amendment was NESSISARY for the safety of the population.\n\nThere is so much more to say, but isn't that enough? I don't want to be a criminal for trying to follow the law... I don't want to feel like there is no other option but to live in pain and suffering OR be locked in my house.\n\nMaking Kratom Illegal is a mistake and millions will suffer from such a stupid decision.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1380","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Veteran","postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Barone","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern,\n\nI don't know much about kratom, admittedly.

They have families, jobs, responsible adults. Bannning something that so clearly helps people is ludicrous. The opiate epidemic is out of hand and if kratom is banned it is only going to get worse. We have thousands of people dying from opiate abuse, losing jobs, families, mass incarceration. It is absolutely out of control. People should be able to choose for themselves if they want out of that cycle. If they want help with opiate addiction, pain, anxiety, depression. They should be able to choose if they want a better quality of life without the government jumping in. Besides that the majority of vendors that sell Kratom are small family owned legitimate businesses. Banning would not only affect the people that drink kratom tea but the businesses and families of the people that put their heart into helping people be able to have a better quality of life.

I had a warehouse job for about a year that I suffered through 8 hours of sciatic nerve pain the entire time. \n  I discovered kratom through the community on Reddit and it has improved my life dramatically. Although I still feel pain when standing for long periods of time, at least kratom makes it tolerable.\n  My parents both have had chronic back pain their entire adult lives, so much so that my mother developed allergies to most over the counter pain medications. I do not want to have to survive off of NSAIDS or whatever addictive opiates being pushed by most doctors for chronic pain. \n  Kratom has also improved my social anxiety and depression. I'm halfway through earning my bachelors degree and if kratom were moved to a schedule one classification it would have a severe, negative impact on the positive direction I feel like I am headed.

I am a 25 year old male from North Carolina and I've recently started using kratom for sleep and pain management. Four about 4 years I've suffered from a severe overgrowth of bacteria and yeast in my small intestine that has in turn given me chronic pain, severe food intolerances, anxiety, and terrible insomnia. My doctors have given me all sorts of medication to tackle this condition and alleviate my symptoms to no avail. Nothing has helped me, and I've been driven to the limit of frustration trying to overcome this. It has sapped all motivation from me and left me in a depressed and hopeless state.\n\nThree weeks ago I decided to give kratom a shot after having heard about it from a friend who has used it for anxiety and sleep. I intended to do the same and see if it might do what no medication has for me. To my surprise it has not only helped with sleep, but improved my mood tremendously, alleviated most of the pain I have, increased my energy and motivation throughout the day, as well as helped settle my terribly sensitive and ailing digestive system. I have felt better the past 3 weeks than I have in four years and I'm enjoying every minute of it. I feel like I can start to get back into the world again and move forward with my life, a mindset I haven't had in a long time. I've taken a few breaks in between and have experience little to no adverse effects. Essentially non-existent withdrawls for me.\n\nI strongly oppose the decision to schedule mitragynine thus making it an illegal substance. Such would be an absolute travesty to human rights and our freedom to use a safe and natural substance with very minimal adverse effects. It would seem that there have been around 15 or so deaths associated with kratom over the past few years, almost all of them being associated with the use of other more dangerous substances as well. I fail to see how this can be considered an imminent threat to the public when substances like alcohol and tobacco are perfectly legal for adults to consume when they kill tens of thousands of people every year. Banning a substance that is far safer with far more beneficial effects seems to be completely illogical.\n\nI truly hope you reconsider the benefits of kratom, how it has helped millions of people for centuries, and decide not the schedule mitragynine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13349","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 37-year-old copyeditor from New Jersey who has been suffering from back and shoulder pain for over 7 years now. Nothing has worked to help me. I've had steroid injections while under anesthesia, been prescribed several types of pills from opioids to muscle relaxers, including patches, used TENS units, been to physical therapy twice, tried massage or applying heat or cold, had trigger point injections, went to a chiropractor, have seen osteopaths and pain management doctors...nothing helps. Sometimes the pain would wake me up late at night or in the morning, and I cant go back to sleep. I felt very hopeless, like maybe Id just have to learn to live with this pain, throbbing and making me cranky and tired and not the mom and wife and person I want to be. But then I found out about kratom and tried it earlier this year (2016). Almost out of pure desperation and the hope that anything might help. I did a lot of research first despite my desperation. \n\nBased on a lot of reading, I purchased from a wonderful business I still buy from today. After I tried it and gauged my perfect dose, it was like night and day. It helped make the pain like a very quiet whisper fading into the background of life instead of the screaming megawatt-level throbbing and spreading pain Id been so used to tolerating. I couldnt believe it. This leaf, this natural plant was doing what nothing else could: make the pain manageable. Its not medicineits better. When I was taking pain pills or muscle relaxers, I was always afraid Id become dependent. Almost did. And I was usually a bit lethargic and got angry when they would wear off. It was not easy to stop. Kratom I can stop whenever I like. But theres no reason to when it helps me this much. I have generalized anxiety and sometimes find myself feeling down for no reason, and I truly believe kratom helps with that too. That is priceless to me. I can play with my kids, work at my desk as long as I need to, sleep without being woken by pain or changing positions constantly, and the pain no longer dictates how I function or what Im capable of doing.   \n\nKratom eases anxiety and depression. It helps with PTSD. In a time when Narcan has to be made available in every Walgreens and carried by every EMS worker and police officer because the opioid epidemic is so widespread and pervasive, we need to find a solution to keep people off street drugs and opioids. Kratom does that. There are countless examples. It helps with alcohol dependency and countless other neurological and mental disorders as well. This is a natural treatment we can offer to so many who suffer every day, a way out that will not become as hard to deal with in withdrawals or side effects as the pain itself. \nPlease listen to those who are telling you how much it has helped them, and you will see how invaluable it is to this country. We are only trying to ease our pain issues and remain productive. I can only anticipate you will see an increase in opioid overdoses and relapses in addition to an increase in street drug use if a kratom ban goes through. People who are harmlessly taking this leaf now to ease pain will have to do something, and they will likely go from kratom, which was not causing overdoses, to something that they could ultimately OD from. \n\nI and so many others like me are asking, begging, the DEA and the regulatory powers to listen to the facts, and listen to the stories. I am only one of many. This natural thing, this plant, is not a pill made in a factory, its not something that people overdose on, it is not in any way a bad thing. Given the opioid epidemic in this country, it is saving lives every day. It kept me from desperately going back to pain pills that werent helping much but it was better than the full weight of the pain bearing down on me every day. Now, with kratom, I will never go back to pain pills. Unless I have no choice because kratom is made illegal. I will return to having no quality of life should that happen, because pain pills were costing me a lot more than just money. So many people rely on this herb to help them through their daily lives, and its not because theyre dependent on it psychologically or mentally. It works, and that is why we use it. Theres no high, theres no euphoria, simply a peace and calm and absence of pain that is so important to people like me. Please listen to these stories and the facts, and allow universities and researchers to study it and find out if we have discovered a way to permanently keep people off of pain pills and depression and anxiety drugs for good. I truly believe after my experience and reading so much about this plant that it is that incredible and weve only begun to see what it can do to help people. \nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5129","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kathryn West","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have many genetic disorders that make me completely disabled.

I am a cancer survivor and have been in two car accidents and have had more than seven major surgeries during my lifetime.  After a spinal fusion, I had to relearn how to walk and was put on more than a half dozen pharmaceutical medications including benzos and opiates for the debilitating pain.  While these medicines helped, they became less effective over time and my body developed a tolerance.  Since finding Kratom two years ago, I have been able to get off of ALL daily medications and live a functional life.  I can think clearly, participate in family and professional life and have the energy to significantly contribute to society as well.\n\nKratom leaves zero side effects (it is far milder than coffee for Pete's sake!) for 99% plus of its users and has been utilized by millions of people throughout the world without incident.  There are no legitimate reasons to ban this plant (Schedule 1) and not even let medical researchers and scientists conduct peer reviewed studies to test its efficacy and applicability to numerous ailments and medical situations.  If the DEA places Kratom in Schedule 1 it will create a staggering health care Crisis and harm the lives of millions of Americans now, and tens of millions in the future.   Simply put, Tens of thousands people will die if Kratom is placed in Schedule 1. \n\n  I urge the human being reading this to imagine battling with cancer, knowing you are facing your mortality and trying to endure horrific pain.  Why would anyone, or any free country, take away the option of using a safe, natural plant, used for millennia all over the world, away from someone suffering?  Why can't the Federal Government wait to schedule this remarkable plant until multiple peer reviewed studies have been conducted and make an informed decision?  What is this rush to ban Kratom?  What financial interests are behind it?\n\nThere is a chronic pain crisis AND an opiod Crisis in our country.  People are living longer and life is a full contact sport so injuries and diseases come with it.  In Kratom, we have a plant that has safely and effectively helped innumerable people treat their pain AND get off of prescription opiates and heroin.  We the American people are urging you NOT to exacerbate the number of unnecessary deaths and suicides by taking away this effective tool from people.  Thousands of Americans die from Tylenol and tens of thousands die from other prescription and over the counter medications.  It is preposterous that these medications that regularly lead to death aren't being considered for Schedule 1 before a safe plant like Kratom.  If the DEA places Kratom in the category of a Schedule 1 substance it will reveal a callous disregard for human life, an irresponsible turning away from scientific research, and an embrace of the misguided and short sighted policies that have led to this crisis in the first place.  Please don't do the bidding of powerful financial interests and punish the human beings facing life altering and life threatening injuries and diseases.  Please show some compassion and common sense and fund research.  \n\nKratom has given me more than Hope........it has given me my family, my career and my life back.  Please don't destroy my life by banning this remarkable plant.  I didn't fight this hard to survive cancer only to have my government make it impossible to live.  Please do the right thing which is leave Kratom alone at the Federal level (except for research, clinical trials and peer reviewed studies!) until we can all learn more about it and make informed medical choices.  \n\nThank you for your time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22761","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello.

Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18441","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Angela Robinson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In 2013 I was diagnosed with vaginal in situ carcinoma.  In terms of invasive cancer, it is minor and easily removed through local excision.  However, the pain inflicted during this delicate operation was beyond what I had ever experienced.  First, this should not be an outpatient procedure.  Due to the large amount nerve bundles in the area, this surgery felt like I was filleted open and left to deal with it at home only a few hours later.  I was given Vicodin...a lot of Vicodin.  100 pills to be exact.  The fact that I was given so much is testament to the degree of pain everyone knew I would be in.  And, I took them.  I took them all.  \nNow, I had taken pain killers before, but only small amounts for high acuity conditions where long term pain is not expected.  Removal of wisdom teeth, a fractured ankle bone.  This is manageable and I had no issue with addiction in these cases.  This surgery was re markedly different and at the end of 100 pills, I was not only physically addicted but also mentally.  \nAfter seeing my physician, he noted that a course of Tramadol would help.  Worse mistake ever.  Tramadol has been known to induce SSRI components and for a person that was already depressed due to the nature of the surgery just endured, this exacerbated my addiction and ultimately led to drug seeking behavior.  As a successful professional and dedicated wife and mother, how did I get here.  It was unbearably shameful and debilitating in every way.\nAfter a year of drug seeking to now fill the void of addiction and depression, I needed some way out.  I had tried tapering tramadol to no avail.  When I decreased to the smallest amount possible, my depression kicked in full gear and consumed me.  We added anti-depressants one right after another that illicit more side effects and no relief.  This, I thought, was my lot in life now.  My never ending penance to pay for an addiction.\nThen, for some reason I can't remember now, I saw an article on kratom and its uses to help opiate addiction.  I investigated further only to find a few reputable studies that tried to illuminate the nature of its use, both historically and in modern society as well as future benefits.  With not much to lose, I tried it.  At first in very small doses where I also kept a diary detailing any side effects, both good and bad.  (Note:  I am a biologist) I stopped Tramadol for a full 48 hours before I took a dose kratom to ensure no interaction and also limited caffeine and any OTC medications.  After one week of only kratom use, I felt 80% normal.  After 2 weeks, 95% of my life was returned to me.  I had only minor nausea that was easily limited by modifying the dose (reduction).  After finding my optimal dose to achieve normality, I did not dose further.\nConclusion:  This plant helped ME kick a very serious and potentially life threatening addiction.  I dose now only occasionally, having completed a titration off kratom for months at a time.  Now, it's used only to facilitate focus when needed for a deadline at work.  I find is also helps relieve my anxiety that we all deal with day to day.  Avenues for regulation of kratom moving forward:  Get kratom out of head shops.  Preferably, this should be sold only by pharmacies that can track and regulate its use.  Keep it OTC, but require a pharmacy consult before hand.  The reason kratom works so well for opiate addicts is because its OTC.  The shame felt by many addicts is the primary obstacle toward their sobriety.  Keeping it accessible is key to that success.  Finally, making something illegal doesn't do anything to address the problem of why its needed in the first place. Taking a stance of increased legality of a product that is clearly helping more people than it hurts will only erode any trust people have in the DEA.  The effects of that are already being felt with marijuana across the country.  Please consider the body of evidence (which is neither conclusive nor complete as of yet) before making rash decisions.  Continue to allow use of kratom in the free market and push for funding of comprehensive, randomized/blinded trials to understand its use, implications and place in society.  Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4627","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sharon Clark","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Personally identifiable information. I want my phone number and email redacted please.\n\nHey, I've been using kratom now for approximately 2 years without having to take any opioids. This stuff has been great for my lower back pain. I work as a quality assurance technician  for a main contractor for Nasa. This has not affected how I do my job, in fact I have gotten several fairly high profile certifications in the last 2 years. I would please like you to reconsider banning this. Yes maybe there could be some restrictions put on it so that we know exactly what we are getting. And another thing,  this stuff is in abundance and a heck of alot cheaper than going to the pain specialist and getting a prescription. I found kratom when the govt put the restrict ions on pain meds, having no refills and going to the doc once a month. My doc ended up leaving town. So I looked for herbal alternatives and found this great stuff. Again please rethink this.

I think everyone agrees that the opioid epidemic is a serious problem in this country, but kratom is a substance that will help battle the opioid epidemic, not contribute to it.  Kratom has been used for hundreds of years as a safe alternative to overcome serious opioid addictions in Southeast Asia.  Kratom is a much safer alternative to dangerous opioids like Percocet and/or Vicodin that are ROUTINELY prescribed by doctors, not to mention the serious killers like heroin and fentanyl.  There has yet to be a single reported mono-drug overdose death attributed to kratom in the USA, meanwhile, over-the-counter painkillers like Tylenol and Advil kill hundreds every year.  I have been using kratom daily for chronic pain and depression/anxiety for several months now and the worst side effect I ever had was nausea-- once.  I have also found that kratom's effects \"plateau\" at a point, meaning that it is much less likely to be abused that other drugs that \"compound\" their effects with higher doses.  I understand that there needs to be reasonable regulation of kratom (to make sure that it is labeled properly and comes with appropriate warnings, to make sure that the substance is pure, that it is taken with doctor's supervision etc.) and I don't think many users would argue with that, but placing kratom into Schedule I is the equivalent of the death penalty.  Thousands of users will have to either get kratom through black market sources (rather than some of the legitimate, reliable vendors around today), or go back to more dangerous opioids.  Additionally, placing kratom into Schedule I would effectively kill off all research opportunities.  EDUCATION and AWARENESS are the most important tools at the DEA's disposal to keep kratom use safe, not an outright ban.  This is an amazing substance that has a lot of potential to do a lot of good for a lot of people, with little to no side effects if used properly.  A ban on kratom will do nothing but INCREASE the opioid problem in America. There is a precedent for a more passive regulation of substances like kratom, and that is CAFFEINE.  Caffeine is a potent psychoactive drug, yet is treated as a \"dietary supplement\" by the FDA.  People can die far easier from ingesting caffeine powder than kratom powder.  Caffeine is effectively controlled through our social norms surrounding it-- you use it daily, you get it through coffee or tea, and that's that.  Let's control kratom though education, awareness and culture, not guns and handcuffs.  Thank you very much for your time, and I hope and pray that you please take a reasoned approach to the regulation of kratom.  Let's make it safe and help improve people's lives, not leave people out in the cold.
